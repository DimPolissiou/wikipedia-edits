The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck).

The full-time side is at the west end (railroad north). It has a [[turnstile]] bank, token booth, and two staircases going up to either eastern corners of Broadway and East Houston Street.

In one fare control area, a set of [[HEET turnstile|full height turnstiles]] lead to two separate entrances leading to East Houston Street between Lafayette and Crosby Streets, on the south side. In the other fare control area, another set of full height turnstiles leads to another entrance on Lafayette Street and Houston Street, on the north side. A passageway connects the Lafayette Street fare control areas with the fare control areas at the Broadway end of the station without going through the lower level mezzanine.\n\nThere are closed staircases from the extreme western ends of both platforms that lead to a mezzanine with exits to the west side of Broadway and Houston Street. It is currently used by employees.\n\n{{anchor|Signal}}The 1998 artwork here is called ''Signal'' by Mel Chin. It features stainless steel and glass sculptures with lights on the mezzanine walls and ceramic tiles on the platform walls.\n\nWest (railroad north) of this station, there are crossovers between the two northbound tracks and a single one between the express tracks. The line turns north along Sixth Avenue and goes through a complex set of switches and crossovers with the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] before arriving at [[West Fourth Street\u2013Washington Square (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|West Fourth Street\u2013Washington Square]].\n\nEast (railroad south) of this station, there used to be a crossover between the two southbound tracks before they were reconfigured in 1967 by the [[Chrystie Street Connection]]. B and D trains turn south down Chrystie Street with a stop at [[Grand Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Grand Street]] before crossing the [[Manhattan Bridge]] into Brooklyn. F trains continue directly east with a stop at [[Second Avenue (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Second Avenue]], turn south on Essex Street with two more stops at [[Delancey Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Delancey Street]] and [[East Broadway (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|East Broadway]], before passing under the [[East River]] through the [[Rutgers Street Tunnel]] into Brooklyn. M trains use a connection that leads to [[Essex Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Essex Street]] on the [[BMT Nassau Street Line]] before crossing the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] into Brooklyn.\n\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{ external media\n| width  = 220px\n| align  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bqzzV-15m8 Bleecker St Station Expansion], Metropolitan Transportation Authority; February 5, 2010; 1:26 YouTube video clip (construction and rendering phase of the new transfer project between this station and the uptown Bleecker Street platform)\n| video2 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxPhgIlCI2Y Broadway/Lafayette-Bleecker St Transfer], Metropolitan Transportation Authority; September 28, 2012; 4:04 YouTube video clip (completed project)\n}}\n{{Commonscat-inline|Bleecker Street / Broadway \u2013 Lafayette Street (New York City Subway)}}\n* Forgotten NY \u2013 [http://forgotten-ny.com/2006/01/the-original-28-part-1-a-look-at-the-artwork-from-the-nycs-first-28-stations-opened-october-27-1904-2/ Original 28 -

It has two [[side platform]]s which were originally 5-cars long. In the 1950s, the southbound platform was extended to the south and the northbound platform was extended to the north for ten car trains. After the 2012 renovation, the northbound platform was extended to the south, and the 1950s northern extension of that platform was closed (but can still be seen upon leaving the station on a train).<ref name=shifts/>\n\nThe station features two styles of \"Bleecker Street\" station identifiers made by the [[Grueby Faience Company]] in 1904. The large \"Bleecker Street\" plaques were assembled from 27 pieces of faience ceramic. They depict poppies. The smaller blue \"B\" [[cartouche]]s show [[tulip]]s, probably a reminder of the Dutch origins of the city. Later [[Squire J.

These mosaics were removed in the 2012 renovation of the station, and replicas of the \"B\" cartouches were installed throughout the station.\n\nA new MTA's Arts for Transit project was created in 2012, called ''Hive,'' by [[Leo Villareal]].

This section of the station complex, opened on January 1, 1936, has four tracks and two [[island platform]]s.<ref name=\"nycsubway\">[http://nycsubway.org/perl/stations?221:775 Broadway-Lafayette Street] ''NYCSubway'' Retrieved August 28, 2008</ref> B and D trains stop on the inner express tracks while F and M trains stop on the outer local tracks.<ref name=\"nycsubway\"/> Both outer track walls have a blue trim line on a black border and small \"BROADWAY\" signs beneath in white lettering on a black border. Large blue columns run along either side of both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate and white lettering.\n\nThe center of both platforms have three staircases that go up to a mezzanine, where wide staircases on either side go up to the station's three [[fare control]] areas. The full-time side is at the west end (railroad north). It has a [[turnstile]] bank, token booth, and two staircases going up to either eastern corners of Broadway and East Houston Street. The southeastern one is built inside an alcove of an [[Adidas]] Sport Performance Center.<ref name=\"street map\">[http://www.onnyturf.com/subway/?system=subway&station_id=218 Downtown Bleecker Street/Broadway\u2013Lafayette Street] ''On NY Turf'' Retrieved August 28, 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717082709/http://www.onnyturf.com/subway/?system=subway&station_id=218 |date=July 17, 2011 }}</ref> The station's other fare control areas lead to exits on either side of East [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]]. In one fare control area, a set of [[HEET turnstile|full height turnstiles]] lead to two separate entrances leading to East Houston Street between Lafayette and Crosby Streets, on the south side. In the other fare control area, another set of full height turnstiles leads to another entrance on Lafayette Street and Houston Street, on the north side. A passageway connects the Lafayette Street fare control areas with the fare control areas at the Broadway end of the station without going through the lower level mezzanine.\n\nThere are closed staircases from the extreme western ends of both platforms that lead to a mezzanine with exits to the west side of Broadway and Houston Street. It is currently used by employees.\n\n{{anchor|Signal}}The 1998 artwork here is called ''Signal'' by Mel Chin. It features stainless steel and glass sculptures with lights on the mezzanine walls and ceramic tiles on the platform walls.\n\nWest (railroad north) of this station, there are crossovers between the two northbound tracks and a single one between the express tracks. The line turns north along Sixth Avenue and goes through a complex set of switches and crossovers with the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] before arriving at [[West Fourth Street\u2013Washington Square (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|West Fourth Street\u2013Washington Square]].\n\nEast (railroad south) of this station, there used to be a crossover between the two southbound tracks before they were reconfigured in 1967 by the [[Chrystie Street Connection]]. B and D trains turn south down Chrystie Street with a stop at [[Grand Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Grand Street]] before crossing the [[Manhattan Bridge]] into Brooklyn. F trains continue directly east with a stop at [[Second Avenue (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Second Avenue]], turn south on Essex Street with two more stops at [[Delancey Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Delancey Street]] and [[East Broadway (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|East Broadway]], before passing under the [[East River]] through the [[Rutgers Street Tunnel]] into Brooklyn. M trains use a connection that leads to [[Essex Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Essex Street]] on the [[BMT Nassau Street Line]] before crossing the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] into Brooklyn.\n\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{ external media\n| width  = 220px\n| align  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bqzzV-15m8 Bleecker St Station Expansion], Metropolitan Transportation Authority;

[[Roman Empire|The Romans]] conquered the region in the second century BC and made it part of the much larger province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. The area remained part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], but was often raided and settled by [[Early Slavs|Slavic tribes]] beginning in the sixth century of the Christian era. Following [[Byzantine\u2013Bulgarian wars|centuries of contention]] between the [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]], Byzantine, and [[Serbian Empire]], it was part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion from the mid-14th until the early 20th century, when, following the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912 and 1913, the modern territory of North Macedonia came under [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] rule.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] (1915\u20131918), it was ruled by Bulgaria, but after the end of the war it returned to being under Serbian rule as part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. Later, during the [[Second World War]] (1941\u20131944), it was ruled by Bulgaria again, and in 1945 it was established as a [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|constituent state]] of [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|communist Yugoslavia]], which it remained until [[1991 Macedonian independence referendum|its peaceful secession in 1991]].

A century later, it had become a hotly contested nationalist cause, a battlefield, and an obsession. What led to this dramatic transformation was modernity: a chilly wind of West European provenance that propelled to the Balkans concepts that few in the region understood, wanted or cared about. Among these, the idea of nationalism was the most potent, and the most lethal. Before the 1850s, Macedonia was a poverty-stricken province of the Ottoman Empire, where an Orthodox Christian and mostly peasant population speaking a variety of Slavonic idioms, Greek, or Vlach, was trying to eke out a modest living, and protect it from rapacious brigands and a decaying Ottoman administrative system. Religion was the only collective identity that most of them could make sense of, for ethnicity and language played little role in shaping their loyalties. But the winds of change quickly gathered momentum, and eventually shattered that multi-ethnic community, producing a 'Greek', or a 'Bulgarian', out of a 'Christian'.\" D.

[[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuil]], one of the Cometopuli brothers, was proclaimed [[Tsar of Bulgaria]]. He moved the capital to Skopje and then to Ohrid, which had been the cultural and military centre of southwestern Bulgaria since Boris I's rule. Samuil reestablished Bulgarian power, but after several decades of conflicts, in 1014, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] defeated his armies, and within four years the Byzantines restored control over the Balkans (including North Macedonia) for the first time since the 7th century. The rank of the autocephalous [[Bulgarian Patriarchate]] was lowered due to its subjugation to [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and it was transformed into the [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. By the late 12th century, Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities, including a brief [[Normans|Norman]] occupation in the 1080s.\n\nIn the early 13th century, a revived [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] gained control of the region. Plagued by political difficulties, the empire did not last, and the region came once again under Byzantine control in the early 14th century. In the 14th century, it became part of the [[Serbian Empire]], who saw themselves as liberators of their Slavic kin from Byzantine [[despotism]]. Skopje became the capital of [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Tsar Stefan Dusan]]'s empire.\n\nFollowing Dusan's death, a weak successor appeared, and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. These events coincided with the entry of the [[Ottoman Turks]] into Europe.

The most abundant group are the [[flowering plant]]s with around 3,200 species, followed by [[moss]]es (350 species) and [[fern]]s (42).\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], North Macedonia belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and the Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of the Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Pindus Mountains]] [[mixed forests]], Balkan mixed forests, [[Rhodopes]] mixed forests and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[sclerophyllous]] and mixed forests.\n\n[[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|National Park of Pelister]] in Bitola is known for the presence of the endemic [[Macedonian Pine]], as well as some 88 species of plants representing almost 30 percent of North Macedonian dendroflora. The Macedonian Pine forests on Pelister are divided into two communities: pine forests with ferns and pine forests with junipers. The Macedonian Pine, as a specific conifer species, is a [[relict]] of tertiary flora, and the five-needle pine [[Macedonian Pine|Molika]], was first noted on Pelister in 1893.\n\n[[File:Pelister Molika.jpg|thumb|''[[Pinus peuce]]'', the Macedonian Pine or Molika, one of North Macedonia's most recognisable trees]]\nNorth Macedonia's limited forest growth also includes [[Macedonian Oak]]s, the sycamore, weeping willows, white willows, alders, poplars, elms, and the common ash. Near the rich pastures on \u0160ar Mountain and Bistra, Mavrovo, is another plant species characteristic of plant life in Macedonia \u2013 the poppy. The quality of thick [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] juice is measured worldwide by morphine units; while Chinese [[opium]] contains eight such units and is considered to be of high quality, Indian opium contains seven units, and Turkish opium only six, Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units and is one of the best quality opiums in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=246 |title=Macedonian Flora |publisher=Macedonia.co.uk |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe native forest fauna is abundant and includes bears, [[wild boar]]s, wolves, foxes, squirrels, [[chamois]] and deer. The [[Eurasian lynx|lynx]] is found, very rarely, in the mountains of western Macedonia, while deer can be found in the region of [[Demir Kapija]]. Forest birds include the [[blackcap]], the [[grouse]], the [[black grouse]], the [[Eastern imperial eagle|imperial eagle]] and the forest owl.\n\nThe three artificial lakes of the country represent a separate fauna zone, an indication of long-lasting territorial and temporal isolation. The fauna of Lake Ohrid is a relict of an earlier era and the lake is widely known for its letnica trout, lake [[Lake whitefish|whitefish]], [[Gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]], [[Rutilus|roach]], podust, and pior, as well as for certain species of snails of a genus older than 30&nbsp;million years; similar species can be found only in [[Lake Baikal]]. Lake Ohrid is also noted in zoology texts for the [[European eel]] and its baffling reproductive cycle: it comes to Lake Ohrid from the distant [[Sargasso Sea]],<ref>Schmidt, J.

The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the Prime Minister. The President is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the state armed forces and a president of the [[National security|state Security]] Council. The President is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most.\n\nWith the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005, local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities ({{lang|mk|\u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438}}, {{lang|mk-Latn|op\u0161tini}}; [[Grammatical number|singular]]: {{lang|mk|\u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430}}, {{lang|mk-Latn|op\u0161tina}}). The capital, Skopje, is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as the \"City of Skopje\". Municipalities in North Macedonia are units of local self-government. Neighbouring municipalities may establish co-operative arrangements.\n\nThe country's main political divergence is between the largely ethnically based political parties representing the country's ethnic Macedonian majority and Albanian minority. The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in 2001, following which a power-sharing agreement was reached. In August 2004, parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate.\n\nAfter a troublesome pre-election campaign, North Macedonia saw a relatively calm and democratic change of government in the [[2006 Macedonian parliamentary election|elections held on 5 July 2006]]. The elections were marked by a decisive victory of the centre-right party [[VMRO\u2013DPMNE|VMRO-DPMNE]] led by [[Nikola Gruevski]]. Gruevski's decision to include the [[Democratic Party of Albanians]] in the new government, instead of the [[Democratic Union for Integration]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]] coalition which won the majority of the Albanian votes, triggered protests throughout the parts of the country with a respective number of Albanian population.

Later, during the [[Second World War]] (1941\u20131944), it was ruled by Bulgaria again, and in 1945 it was established as a [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|constituent state]] of [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|communist Yugoslavia]], which it remained until [[1991 Macedonian independence referendum|its peaceful secession in 1991]].

A century later, it had become a hotly contested nationalist cause, a battlefield, and an obsession. What led to this dramatic transformation was modernity: a chilly wind of West European provenance that propelled to the Balkans concepts that few in the region understood, wanted or cared about. Among these, the idea of nationalism was the most potent, and the most lethal. Before the 1850s, Macedonia was a poverty-stricken province of the Ottoman Empire, where an Orthodox Christian and mostly peasant population speaking a variety of Slavonic idioms, Greek, or Vlach, was trying to eke out a modest living, and protect it from rapacious brigands and a decaying Ottoman administrative system. Religion was the only collective identity that most of them could make sense of, for ethnicity and language played little role in shaping their loyalties. But the winds of change quickly gathered momentum, and eventually shattered that multi-ethnic community, producing a 'Greek', or a 'Bulgarian', out of a 'Christian'.\" D.

During the 580s, Byzantine literature attests to the Slavs raiding Byzantine territories in the region of Macedonia, later aided by [[Bulgars]]. Historical records document that in c. 680 a group of Bulgars, Slavs and Byzantines led by a Bulgar called [[Kuber]] settled in the region of the Keramisian plain, centred on the city of [[Bitola]], forming a second route for the Bulgar definitive settlement on the Balkan Peninsula at the end of the 7th century.<ref>\"Acta Sancti Demetrii\", V 195\u2013207, \u0413\u0440\u044a\u0446\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, 3, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 159\u2013166</ref> [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian's]] reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia.

[[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuil]], one of the Cometopuli brothers, was proclaimed [[Tsar of Bulgaria]]. He moved the capital to Skopje and then to Ohrid, which had been the cultural and military centre of southwestern Bulgaria since Boris I's rule. Samuil reestablished Bulgarian power, but after several decades of conflicts, in 1014, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] defeated his armies, and within four years the Byzantines restored control over the Balkans (including North Macedonia) for the first time since the 7th century. The rank of the autocephalous [[Bulgarian Patriarchate]] was lowered due to its subjugation to [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and it was transformed into the [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. By the late 12th century, Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities, including a brief [[Normans|Norman]] occupation in the 1080s.\n\nIn the early 13th century, a revived [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] gained control of the region. Plagued by political difficulties, the empire did not last, and the region came once again under Byzantine control in the early 14th century. In the 14th century, it became part of the [[Serbian Empire]], who saw themselves as liberators of their Slavic kin from Byzantine [[despotism]]. Skopje became the capital of [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Tsar Stefan Dusan]]'s empire.\n\nFollowing Dusan's death, a weak successor appeared, and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. These events coincided with the entry of the [[Ottoman Turks]] into Europe. The [[Kingdom of Prilep]] was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=y2d6OHLqwEsC&pg=PA275 |title=The last Centuries of Byzantium, (1261\u20131453) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-521-43991-6 |page=500 |author1=Nicol, Donald Macgillivray |accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref> Gradually, all of the central Balkans were conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and remained under its domination for five centuries as part of the province or [[Eyalet]] of [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]].

According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and the Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of the Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Pindus Mountains]] [[mixed forests]], Balkan mixed forests, [[Rhodopes]] mixed forests and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[sclerophyllous]] and mixed forests.\n\n[[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|National Park of Pelister]] in Bitola is known for the presence of the endemic [[Macedonian Pine]], as well as some 88 species of plants representing almost 30 percent of North Macedonian dendroflora. The Macedonian Pine forests on Pelister are divided into two communities: pine forests with ferns and pine forests with junipers. The Macedonian Pine, as a specific conifer species, is a [[relict]] of tertiary flora, and the five-needle pine [[Macedonian Pine|Molika]], was first noted on Pelister in 1893.\n\n[[File:Pelister Molika.jpg|thumb|''[[Pinus peuce]]'', the Macedonian Pine or Molika, one of North Macedonia's most recognisable trees]]\nNorth Macedonia's limited forest growth also includes [[Macedonian Oak]]s, the sycamore, weeping willows, white willows, alders, poplars, elms, and the common ash. Near the rich pastures on \u0160ar Mountain and Bistra, Mavrovo, is another plant species characteristic of plant life in Macedonia \u2013 the poppy. The quality of thick [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] juice is measured worldwide by morphine units; while Chinese [[opium]] contains eight such units and is considered to be of high quality, Indian opium contains seven units, and Turkish opium only six, Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units and is one of the best quality opiums in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=246 |title=Macedonian Flora |publisher=Macedonia.co.uk |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe native forest fauna is abundant and includes bears, [[wild boar]]s, wolves, foxes, squirrels, [[chamois]] and deer. The [[Eurasian lynx|lynx]] is found, very rarely, in the mountains of western Macedonia, while deer can be found in the region of [[Demir Kapija]]. Forest birds include the [[blackcap]], the [[grouse]], the [[black grouse]], the [[Eastern imperial eagle|imperial eagle]] and the forest owl.\n\nThe three artificial lakes of the country represent a separate fauna zone, an indication of long-lasting territorial and temporal isolation. The fauna of Lake Ohrid is a relict of an earlier era and the lake is widely known for its letnica trout, lake [[Lake whitefish|whitefish]], [[Gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]], [[Rutilus|roach]], podust, and pior, as well as for certain species of snails of a genus older than 30&nbsp;million years; similar species can be found only in [[Lake Baikal]].

The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the Prime Minister. The President is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the state armed forces and a president of the [[National security|state Security]] Council. The President is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most.\n\nWith the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005, local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities ({{lang|mk|\u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438}}, {{lang|mk-Latn|op\u0161tini}}; [[Grammatical number|singular]]: {{lang|mk|\u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430}}, {{lang|mk-Latn|op\u0161tina}}). The capital, Skopje, is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as the \"City of Skopje\". Municipalities in North Macedonia are units of local self-government. Neighbouring municipalities may establish co-operative arrangements.\n\nThe country's main political divergence is between the largely ethnically based political parties representing the country's ethnic Macedonian majority and Albanian minority. The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in 2001, following which a power-sharing agreement was reached. In August 2004, parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate.\n\nAfter a troublesome pre-election campaign, North Macedonia saw a relatively calm and democratic change of government in the [[2006 Macedonian parliamentary election|elections held on 5 July 2006]]. The elections were marked by a decisive victory of the centre-right party [[VMRO\u2013DPMNE|VMRO-DPMNE]] led by [[Nikola Gruevski]]. Gruevski's decision to include the [[Democratic Party of Albanians]] in the new government, instead of the [[Democratic Union for Integration]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]] coalition which won the majority of the Albanian votes, triggered protests throughout the parts of the country with a respective number of Albanian population.

The money included $600,000 from the Federal Urban Mass Transit Administration, $125,000 from private sources, including some from the Vincent Astor Foundation. The scope of the project included the restoration of the famous glazed ceramic beaver plaques, new improved lighting, the installation of noise-abatement material, as well as the installation of new brown floor tiles. A new piece of porcelain steel artwork by [[Cooper Union]] alumnus [[Milton Glaser]] was installed, and a cast-iron copy of one of the station's original kiosks was built.

The [[fare control]] is at platform level, and the underpass connecting northbound and southbound sides was removed in the 1980s. The access hatch to the underpass is visible behind the northbound token booth inside the fare control area. The northbound platform contains a news and candy stand, which replaced the original public women's lavatory. On the southbound side, the station has a department store entrance into a [[K-Mart]]. This store was originally constructed in 1868 as an [[A. T. Stewart]]. It had changed ownership and was a [[Wanamaker's]] when the station was constructed. The heavy brick-faced square columns on the downtown platform support the store above. The northern building of Wanamaker's store, but not the southern building above, burned in the 1950s. Octagonal windows on the brick wall of the platform were the store's showcases.\n\nPlaques of [[beaver]]s are located on the walls, in honor of [[John Jacob Astor]]'s fortune derived from the beaver-pelt trade. The plaques, as well as name tablets, were made by the [[Grueby Faience Company]] in 1904. During the renovation, the magnificent maroon and gold tile [[Cooper Union]] signs underneath the tile Astor Place signs were destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/85071996@N00/4017302543/sizes/l/in/pool-1194454@N25/ |title=1982 Photo of Astor Place Signage |year=1982 |work=Cable (Cooper Union Yearbook) |accessdate=December 9, 2009 }}</ref> Black and white pillar signs read Astor Place on one pillar, then Cooper Union on the next.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Exits===\nThe station has two entrances, one in each direction.

The [[fare control]] is at platform level, and the underpass connecting northbound and southbound sides was removed in the 1980s. The access hatch to the underpass is visible behind the northbound token booth inside the fare control area. The northbound platform contains a news and candy stand, which replaced the original public women's lavatory. On the southbound side, the station has a department store entrance into a [[K-Mart]]. This store was originally constructed in 1868 as an [[A. T. Stewart]]. It had changed ownership and was a [[Wanamaker's]] when the station was constructed. The heavy brick-faced square columns on the downtown platform support the store above. The northern building of Wanamaker's store, but not the southern building above, burned in the 1950s. Octagonal windows on the brick wall of the platform were the store's showcases.\n\nPlaques of [[beaver]]s are located on the walls, in honor of [[John Jacob Astor]]'s fortune derived from the beaver-pelt trade. The plaques, as well as name tablets, were made by the [[Grueby Faience Company]] in 1904. During the renovation, the magnificent maroon and gold tile [[Cooper Union]] signs underneath the tile Astor Place signs were destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/85071996@N00/4017302543/sizes/l/in/pool-1194454@N25/ |title=1982 Photo of Astor Place Signage |year=1982 |work=Cable (Cooper Union Yearbook) |accessdate=December 9, 2009 }}</ref> Black and white pillar signs read Astor Place on one pillar, then Cooper Union on the next.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Exits===\nThe station has two entrances, one in each direction.

One of his most famous works, it tells the story of Santiago, an aging [[Cubans|Cuban]] [[fisherman]] who struggles with a giant [[marlin]] far out in the [[Gulf Stream]] off the coast of Cuba.<ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 | work = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1954/ | accessdate = January 31, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, ''The Old Man and the Sea'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], and it was cited by the [[Nobel Committee]] as contributing to their awarding of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] to Hemingway in 1954.<ref name=\"nobel\"/>\n\n==Plot summary==\n''The Old Man and the Sea'' tells the story of a battle between an aging, experienced fisherman, Santiago, and a large [[marlin]]. The story opens with Santiago having gone 84 days without catching a fish, and now being seen as \"''salao''{{-\"}}, the worst form of unluckiness. He is so unlucky that his young apprentice, Manolin, has been forbidden by his parents to sail with him and has been told instead to fish with successful fishermen. The boy visits Santiago's shack each night, hauling his fishing gear, preparing food, talking about American baseball and his favorite player, [[Joe DiMaggio]]. Santiago tells Manolin that on the next day, he will venture far out into the Gulf Stream, north of [[Cuba]] in the [[Straits of Florida]] to fish, confident that his unlucky streak is near its end.\n\nOn the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago takes his [[skiff]] into the Gulf Stream, sets his lines and by noon, has his bait taken by a big fish that he is sure is a [[marlin]]. Unable to haul in the great marlin, Santiago is instead pulled by the marlin, and two days and nights pass with Santiago holding onto the line. Though wounded by the struggle and in pain, Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his adversary, often referring to him as a brother. He also determines that, because of the fish's great dignity, no one shall deserve to eat the marlin.\n\nOn the third day, the fish begins to circle the skiff. Santiago, worn out and almost delirious, uses all his remaining strength to pull the fish onto its side and stab the marlin with a [[harpoon]]. Santiago straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and heads home, thinking about the high price the fish will bring him at the market and how many people he will feed.\n\nOn his way in to shore, [[shark]]s are attracted to the marlin's blood. Santiago kills a great [[mako shark]] with his harpoon, but he loses the weapon. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his knife to the end of an [[oar]] to help ward off the next line of sharks; five sharks are slain and many others are driven away. But the sharks keep coming, and by nightfall the [[sharks]] have almost devoured the marlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail, and its head. Santiago knows that he is destroyed and tells the sharks of how they have killed his dreams. Upon reaching the shore before dawn on the next day, Santiago struggles to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on his shoulder, leaving the fish head and the bones on the shore. Once home, he slumps onto his bed and falls into a deep sleep.\n\nA group of fishermen gather the next day around the boat where the fish's skeleton is still attached. One of the fishermen measures it to be {{convert|18|ft|m}} from nose to tail. Pedrico is given the head of the fish, and the other fishermen tell Manolin to tell the old man how sorry they are. Tourists at the nearby caf\u00e9 mistakenly take it for a shark. The boy, worried about the old man, cries upon finding him safe asleep and at his injured hands. Manolin brings him newspapers and coffee. When the old man wakes, they promise to fish together once again. Upon his return to sleep, Santiago dreams of his youth\u2014of lions on an African beach.\n\n==Background and publication==\n{{quote box | width = 22em | quote = No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in&nbsp;....

Perhaps the most memorable claim is Waldmeir's answer to the question\u2014What is the book's message?\n<blockquote>The answer assumes a third level on which ''The Old Man and the Sea'' must be read\u2014as a sort of allegorical commentary on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious overtones of ''The Old Man and the Sea'' are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway's works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating what might be called his philosophy of Manhood to the level of a religion.<ref name=\"waldmeir\">{{cite journal\n | last = Joseph Waldmeir\n | title=''Confiteor Hominem'': Ernest Hemingway's Religion of Man\n | journal=Papers of the Michigan Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters\n | volume=XLII | year=1957 | pages=349\u2013356\n }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWaldmeir considered the function of the novel's Christian imagery,{{or inline|date=May 2018}} most notably through Hemingway's reference to the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus|Christ]] following Santiago's sighting of the sharks that reads:\n\n<blockquote>\"''Ay'',\" he said aloud.

His 1962 piece \"Fakery in ''The Old Man and the Sea''\" presents his argument that the novel is a weak and unexpected divergence from the typical, realistic Hemingway (referring to the rest of Hemingway's body of work as \"earlier glories\").<ref name=\"weeks\" /> In juxtaposing this novel against Hemingway's previous works, Weeks contends:\n<blockquote>The difference, however, in the effectiveness with which Hemingway employs this characteristic device in his best work and in ''The Old Man and the Sea'' is illuminating. The work of fiction in which Hemingway devoted the most attention to natural objects, ''The Old Man and the Sea'', is pieced out with an extraordinary quantity of fakery, extraordinary because one would expect to find no inexactness, no romanticizing of natural objects in a writer who loathed [[W. H. Hudson]], could not read [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], deplored Melville's rhetoric in ''Moby Dick'', and who was himself criticized by other writers, notably Faulkner, for his devotion to the facts and his unwillingness to 'invent.'<ref name=\"weeks\">{{cite journal\n | last = Robert P.

One of his most famous works, it tells the story of Santiago, an aging [[Cubans|Cuban]] [[fisherman]] who struggles with a giant [[marlin]] far out in the [[Gulf Stream]] off the coast of Cuba.<ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 | work = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1954/ | accessdate = January 31, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, ''The Old Man and the Sea'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], and it was cited by the [[Nobel Committee]] as contributing to their awarding of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] to Hemingway in 1954.<ref name=\"nobel\"/>\n\n==Plot summary==\n''The Old Man and the Sea'' tells the story of a battle between an aging, experienced fisherman, Santiago, and a large [[marlin]]. The story opens with Santiago having gone 84 days without catching a fish, and now being seen as \"''salao''{{-\"}}, the worst form of unluckiness. He is so unlucky that his young apprentice, Manolin, has been forbidden by his parents to sail with him and has been told instead to fish with successful fishermen. The boy visits Santiago's shack each night, hauling his fishing gear, preparing food, talking about American baseball and his favorite player, [[Joe DiMaggio]]. Santiago tells Manolin that on the next day, he will venture far out into the Gulf Stream, north of [[Cuba]] in the [[Straits of Florida]] to fish, confident that his unlucky streak is near its end.\n\nOn the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago takes his [[skiff]] into the Gulf Stream, sets his lines and by noon, has his bait taken by a big fish that he is sure is a [[marlin]]. Unable to haul in the great marlin, Santiago is instead pulled by the marlin, and two days and nights pass with Santiago holding onto the line. Though wounded by the struggle and in pain, Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his adversary, often referring to him as a brother. He also determines that, because of the fish's great dignity, no one shall deserve to eat the marlin.\n\nOn the third day, the fish begins to circle the skiff. Santiago, worn out and almost delirious, uses all his remaining strength to pull the fish onto its side and stab the marlin with a [[harpoon]]. Santiago straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and heads home, thinking about the high price the fish will bring him at the market and how many people he will feed.\n\nOn his way in to shore, [[shark]]s are attracted to the marlin's blood. Santiago kills a great [[mako shark]] with his harpoon, but he loses the weapon. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his knife to the end of an [[oar]] to help ward off the next line of sharks; five sharks are slain and many others are driven away. But the sharks keep coming, and by nightfall the [[sharks]] have almost devoured the marlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail, and its head. Santiago knows that he is destroyed and tells the sharks of how they have killed his dreams. Upon reaching the shore before dawn on the next day, Santiago struggles to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on his shoulder, leaving the fish head and the bones on the shore. Once home, he slumps onto his bed and falls into a deep sleep.\n\nA group of fishermen gather the next day around the boat where the fish's skeleton is still attached. One of the fishermen measures it to be {{convert|18|ft|m}} from nose to tail. Pedrico is given the head of the fish, and the other fishermen tell Manolin to tell the old man how sorry they are. Tourists at the nearby caf\u00e9 mistakenly take it for a shark. The boy, worried about the old man, cries upon finding him safe asleep and at his injured hands. Manolin brings him newspapers and coffee. When the old man wakes, they promise to fish together once again. Upon his return to sleep, Santiago dreams of his youth\u2014of lions on an African beach.\n\n==Background and publication==\n{{quote box | width = 22em | quote = No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in&nbsp;....

Relationships in the book relate to the [[Bible]], which he referred to as \"The Sea Book\". Some aspects of it did appear in the posthumously published ''[[Islands in the Stream (Hemingway)|Islands in the Stream]]''. Hemingway mentions the real life experience of an old fisherman almost identical to that of Santiago and his marlin in ''On the Blue Water: A Gulf Stream Letter'' (''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', April 1936).<ref>[http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Old-Man-And-The-Sea/Ernest-Hemingway/9780684830490#excerpt Old Man and the Sea.

Selected articles and dispatches of four decades''. New York: Scribner's.</ref>\n\nJoseph Waldmeir's essay \"''Confiteor Hominem'': Ernest Hemingway's Religion of Man\" is a favorable critical reading of the novel\u2014and one which has defined analytical considerations since. Perhaps the most memorable claim is Waldmeir's answer to the question\u2014What is the book's message?\n<blockquote>The answer assumes a third level on which ''The Old Man and the Sea'' must be read\u2014as a sort of allegorical commentary on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious overtones of ''The Old Man and the Sea'' are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway's works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating what might be called his philosophy of Manhood to the level of a religion.<ref name=\"waldmeir\">{{cite journal\n | last = Joseph Waldmeir\n | title=''Confiteor Hominem'': Ernest Hemingway's Religion of Man\n | journal=Papers of the Michigan Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters\n | volume=XLII | year=1957 | pages=349\u2013356\n }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWaldmeir considered the function of the novel's Christian imagery,{{or inline|date=May 2018}} most notably through Hemingway's reference to the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus|Christ]] following Santiago's sighting of the sharks that reads:\n\n<blockquote>\"''Ay'',\" he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.<ref>Hemingway. ''The Old Man and the Sea''. p. 118</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the most outspoken critics of ''The Old Man and the Sea'' is Robert P. Weeks. His 1962 piece \"Fakery in ''The Old Man and the Sea''\" presents his argument that the novel is a weak and unexpected divergence from the typical, realistic Hemingway (referring to the rest of Hemingway's body of work as \"earlier glories\").<ref name=\"weeks\" /> In juxtaposing this novel against Hemingway's previous works, Weeks contends:\n<blockquote>The difference, however, in the effectiveness with which Hemingway employs this characteristic device in his best work and in ''The Old Man and the Sea'' is illuminating. The work of fiction in which Hemingway devoted the most attention to natural objects, ''The Old Man and the Sea'', is pieced out with an extraordinary quantity of fakery, extraordinary because one would expect to find no inexactness, no romanticizing of natural objects in a writer who loathed [[W. H. Hudson]], could not read [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], deplored Melville's rhetoric in ''Moby Dick'', and who was himself criticized by other writers, notably Faulkner, for his devotion to the facts and his unwillingness to 'invent.'<ref name=\"weeks\">{{cite journal\n | last = Robert P.
