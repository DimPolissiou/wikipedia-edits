The song became Goldfrapp's second top thirty single when it debuted at number twenty-five on the [[UK Singles Chart|singles chart]], and spent a total of six weeks in the top seventy-five. The song was re-released on 10 May 2004 and surpassed its previous chart position in the UK by recharting at number twenty, becoming Goldfrapp's first top twenty single.\n\nThe song was also successful outside the UK. It reached number twenty-six in [[Canada]] and became Goldfrapp's first single release to chart in the country. Although the single sold considerably, \"Strict Machine\" did not chart on the Canadian [[Jam!|BDS]] Airplay chart, receiving most of its sales from its fans in the dance clubs. In [[Australia]], the song peaked at number fifty-four and would remain as Goldfrapp's only single to chart in the country until the release of \"[[Ooh La La (Goldfrapp song)|Ooh La La]]\" in 2005.\n\nAfter the favourable reception of \"[[Twist (Goldfrapp song)|Twist]]\" and \"[[Black Cherry (Goldfrapp song)|Black Cherry]]\" on the dance charts, \"Strict Machine\" was released in the [[United States]]. It became their first release to reach the top of the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart, where it remained for one week.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2004-06-19/dance-club-play-songs |title=Hot Dance Club Play |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=4 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227003919/http://www.billboard.com/charts/2004-06-19/dance-club-play-songs |archive-date=December 27, 2013 }}</ref> It also performed well on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart, where it reached number three.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r629424|pure_url=yes}} |title=Black Cherry > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=4 October 2008}}</ref> The single sold over 170,000 copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Albums 22.05.04: Goldfrapp |journal=[[Music Week]] |page=35 |date=22 May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:StrictMachineVideo.png|right|thumb|Alison Goldfrapp in a kaleidoscopic setting containing [[Archigram]]-style buildings.]]\n\nThe song's [[music video]], a mixture of graphic and live action segments, builds upon the art direction featured on the band's album and single covers.

By the end of Lula's administration, entrepreneurs and industrialists began to question the sustainability of these policies. They complained about the national industry's declining share of Brazilian GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn response to these concerns, Rousseff created the New Economic Matrix in an attempt to help the Brazilian industry become more competitive internationally. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies which ultimately failed to stimulate industry. Productivity, after growing by 2.7% in 2010, fell by 0.9% and 3.7% in the following two years, shrinking government revenues and thus requiring reductions in public investment.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n=== Political instability ===\nIn the same year the crisis began, a major corruption scheme involving top politicians and major companies such as the oil giant [[Petrobras]] was uncovered by [[Operation Car Wash]].

They complained about the national industry's declining share of Brazilian GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn response to these concerns, Rousseff created the New Economic Matrix in an attempt to help the Brazilian industry become more competitive internationally. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies which ultimately failed to stimulate industry.

In 2015, among [[OECD]] countries, only [[Russia]] went through a recession. Even after the economic sanctions imposed by other countries due to the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|conflict in Ukraine]], Russia's GDP fell by only 4% in two years (2015 and 2016). Few other countries in this period were going through a recession, which reinforces the argument that the crisis in Brazil was mainly due to local causes.<ref name=\"book\">{{Cite book|last=Carvalho|first=Laura|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XppWDwAAQBAJ|title=Valsa brasileira: Do boom ao caos econ\u00f4mico|date=2018-05-08|publisher=Editora Todavia S.A|isbn=978-85-93828-63-8|language=pt-BR}}</ref>\n\nIn comparison to other crises in Brazil, it was verified that the 2014 crisis was not the deepest, as previously thought. After the GDP values for 2015 and 2016 were reviewed by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), the economy shrank by 8.2% in the period, in contrast to the 8.5% in the 1981 recession. Despite not being the deepest, the crisis was long. It was also followed by the slowest recovery of all.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nAccording to Codace (committee part of [[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas]]), the 1981 crisis lasted nine trimesters, reached its peak in the first trimester of 1983 and, since then, took seven trimesters for the GDP the reach its pre-crisis level. Later, the 1989-1992 crisis lasted 11 trimesters and the recovery time was the same: seven trimesters. This crisis, however, had a lower intensity, with an accumulated decrease in the GDP of 7.7%.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn turn, the GDP after the 2014 crisis will only reach its pre-crisis level in 2022, according to an optimistic estimate, with 20 trimesters of recovery in total. When taking into account not only the GDP, but also the employment rate, the recovery will be even slower. In addition to the sluggish recovery, the new jobs will be of lower quality, including informal and autonomous labor.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Brazil labor reform (2017)]]\n* [[Economy of Brazil]]\n* [[2018 in Brazil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Government of Michel Temer}}\n{{Financial crises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2014 Brazilian economic recession}}\n[[Category:2010s economic history]]\n[[Category:2014 in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Economic crises in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Recessions]]\n[[Category:Government of Michel Temer]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Brazil]]\n", "name_user": "20182309L", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Brazilian_economic_crisis"}
