As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the [[Shield (geology)|Shield]] were once far below the Earth's surface.\n\nThe high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for mineralization. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada's far north called the [[Arctic Cordillera]]. This is a vast deeply dissected [[mountain range]], stretching from northernmost [[Ellesmere Island]] to the northernmost tip of Labrador. The range's highest peak is Nunavut's [[Barbeau Peak]] at {{convert|2616|m}} above [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite bivouac|261|Barbeau Peak}}</ref> Precambrian rock is the major component of the bedrock.\n\nThe North American craton is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock.\n\nThe Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called [[Arctica]], which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago during the [[Neoarchean]] era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, [[Scotland]], and [[Siberia]], and is now roughly situated in the [[Arctic]] around the current [[North Pole]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n<!---not quite ready to delete this yet, but it does not seem germane to geology. Definitely of use to a GEOGRAPHY article about the same area--->\nThe current [[geomorphology|surface expression]] of the Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the [[bedrock]], with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe [[glacier|glaciation]] during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]], which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean.\n\nThe lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation; it also contains many marshes and bogs ([[muskeg]]s). The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with [[permafrost]] throughout the year. Forests are not as dense in the north.\n\n[[Image:BlackRiver1.JPG|thumb|Typical shield landscape in a southern Ontario region with very few old growth trees, due to a history of logging and fires. Black River, Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park.]]\nThe Shield is covered in parts by vast [[boreal forest]]s in the south that support natural [[ecosystem]]s as well as a major [[logging]] industry. The boreal forest area gives way to the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador. The [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]] that run westwards from [[Northwestern Ontario]] have boreal forests that give way to taiga in the most northerly parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. [[Hydrography|Hydrographical]] drainage is generally poor, the soil compacting effects of [[glaciation]] being one of the many causes. [[Tundra]] typically prevails in the northern regions. Many mammals such as [[caribou]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[moose]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[wolverine]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[mink]], [[otter]]s, [[grizzly bear]], [[polar bear]]s and [[American black bear|black bears]] are present.<ref>{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=na0612|name=Northern Canadian Shield taiga}}</ref> In the case of polar bears (''Ursus maritimus'') the Shield area contains many of the [[Maternity den|denning]] locations such as the [[Wapusk National Park]].<ref>C.

The rocks that now form the surface of the [[Shield (geology)|Shield]] were once far below the Earth's surface.\n\nThe high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for mineralization. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada's far north called the [[Arctic Cordillera]]. This is a vast deeply dissected [[mountain range]], stretching from northernmost [[Ellesmere Island]] to the northernmost tip of Labrador. The range's highest peak is Nunavut's [[Barbeau Peak]] at {{convert|2616|m}} above [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite bivouac|261|Barbeau Peak}}</ref> Precambrian rock is the major component of the bedrock.\n\nThe North American craton is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock.\n\nThe Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called [[Arctica]], which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago during the [[Neoarchean]] era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, [[Scotland]], and [[Siberia]], and is now roughly situated in the [[Arctic]] around the current [[North Pole]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n<!---not quite ready to delete this yet, but it does not seem germane to geology.

This arrangement was caused by severe [[glacier|glaciation]] during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]], which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean.\n\nThe lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation; it also contains many marshes and bogs ([[muskeg]]s). The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with [[permafrost]] throughout the year. Forests are not as dense in the north.\n\n[[Image:BlackRiver1.JPG|thumb|Typical shield landscape in a southern Ontario region with very few old growth trees, due to a history of logging and fires. Black River, Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park.]]\nThe Shield is covered in parts by vast [[boreal forest]]s in the south that support natural [[ecosystem]]s as well as a major [[logging]] industry. The boreal forest area gives way to the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador. The [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]] that run westwards from [[Northwestern Ontario]] have boreal forests that give way to taiga in the most northerly parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. [[Hydrography|Hydrographical]] drainage is generally poor, the soil compacting effects of [[glaciation]] being one of the many causes. [[Tundra]] typically prevails in the northern regions.

These were the first languages collectively given the name of ''Tanoan.'' [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]], which is a related language, is now spoken mostly in southwestern Oklahoma. The Kiowa historically inhabited areas of modern-day Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n==Languages==\n\nThe Tanoan language family has seven languages in four branches:\n\n{{clade\n|label1={{nowrap|Tanoan&nbsp;}}\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Kiowa language|Kiowa]], (C\u00e1uij\u00f2g\u00e0/c\u00e1uij\u00f2:gy\u00e0): 20 speakers\n   |label3=&nbsp;[[Tiwa languages|Tiwa]]&nbsp;\n   |3={{clade\n      |label1=Northern&nbsp;\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=[[Taos language|Taos]]: 800 speakers\n         |2=[[Picuris language|Picuris]]: 225 speakers\n         }}\n      |2=[[Southern Tiwa]]: 1,600 speakers\n      |3=?

The inclusion of [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] into the family was at first controversial given the cultural differences between those groups. The once-nomadic [[Kiowa people]] of the Plains are culturally quite distinct from the Tiwa, Tewa, and Towa pueblos, which obscured somewhat the linguistic connection between Tanoans and Kiowans. Linguists now accept that a Tanoan family without Kiowa would be [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]], as any ancestor of the Pueblo languages would be ancestral to Kiowa as well. Kiowa may be closer to Towa than Towa is to Tiwa\u2013Tewa. In older texts, ''Tanoan'' and ''Kiowa\u2013Tanoan'' were used interchangeably. Because of the cultural use of the name ''Tanoan'' as signifying several peoples who share a culture, the more explicit term ''Kiowa\u2013Tanoan'' is now commonly used for the language family as a whole, with Tanoan being the branch that contains the languages now spoken in New Mexico and Arizona (i.e. [[Hopi-Tewa|Arizona Tewa]])\n\nThe prehistory of the Kiowa people is little known. As a result, the history is obscure about the separation of the members of this language family into two groups ('Puebloan' and 'Plains') with radically distinct lifestyles. There is apparently no oral tradition of any ancient connection between the peoples. Scholars have not determined when the peoples were connected so that the common linguistic elements could have developed. The earliest traditions and historical notices of the Kiowa record them as migrating to the north and west, to the territory now associated with the tribal nation. Today this area is within the modern states of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]), which they occupied from the late 18th century.\n\n==Genealogical relations==\n\nThe Tanoan family has been connected to the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] family in a hypothetical [[Aztec\u2013Tanoan languages|Aztec\u2013Tanoan]] proposal.  Although it is undemonstrated, many linguists find this hypothesis to be promising.\n\n==Historical phonology==\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe chart below<ref>The original [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] phonetic symbols differ from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: Amer. {{angbr|c}} = IPA {{angbr IPA|ts}}, Amer {{angbr|\u0292}} = IPA {{angbr IPA|dz}}.</ref> contains the reconstructed consonants of the Tanoan [[proto-language]] as reconstructed by Hale (1967) based on consonant correspondences in stem-initial position.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"line-height: 1.1em;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

These were the first languages collectively given the name of ''Tanoan.'' [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]], which is a related language, is now spoken mostly in southwestern Oklahoma. The Kiowa had historically occupied areas of Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n==Languages==\n\nThe Tanoan language family has seven languages in four branches:\n\n{{clade\n|label1={{nowrap|Tanoan&nbsp;}}\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Kiowa language|Kiowa]], (C\u00e1uij\u00f2g\u00e0/c\u00e1uij\u00f2:gy\u00e0): 20 speakers\n   |label3=&nbsp;[[Tiwa languages|Tiwa]]&nbsp;\n   |3={{clade\n      |label1=Northern&nbsp;\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=[[Taos language|Taos]]: 800 speakers\n         |2=[[Picuris language|Picuris]]: 225 speakers\n         }}\n      |2=[[Southern Tiwa]]: 1,600 speakers\n      |3=?

The inclusion of [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] into the family was at first controversial given the cultural differences between those groups. The once-nomadic [[Kiowa people]] of the Plains are culturally quite distinct from the Tiwa, Tewa, and Towa pueblos, which obscured somewhat the linguistic connection between Tanoans and Kiowans. Linguists now accept that a Tanoan family without Kiowa would be [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]], as any ancestor of the Pueblo languages would be ancestral to Kiowa as well. Kiowa may be closer to Towa than Towa is to Tiwa\u2013Tewa. In older texts, ''Tanoan'' and ''Kiowa\u2013Tanoan'' were used interchangeably. Because of the cultural use of the name ''Tanoan'' as signifying several peoples who share a culture, the more explicit term ''Kiowa\u2013Tanoan'' is now commonly used for the language family as a whole, with Tanoan being the branch that contains the languages now spoken in New Mexico and Arizona (i.e. [[Hopi-Tewa|Arizona Tewa]])\n\nThe prehistory of the Kiowa people is little known. As a result, the history is obscure about the separation of the members of this language family into two groups ('Puebloan' and 'Plains') with radically distinct lifestyles. There is apparently no oral tradition of any ancient connection between the peoples. Scholars have not determined when the peoples were connected so that the common linguistic elements could have developed. The earliest traditions and historical notices of the Kiowa record them as migrating to the north and west, to the territory now associated with the tribal nation. Today this area is within the modern states of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]), which they occupied from the late 18th century.\n\n==Genealogical relations==\n\nThe Tanoan family has been connected to the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] family in a hypothetical [[Aztec\u2013Tanoan languages|Aztec\u2013Tanoan]] proposal.  Although it is undemonstrated, many linguists find this hypothesis to be promising.\n\n==Historical phonology==\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe chart below<ref>The original [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] phonetic symbols differ from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: Amer. {{angbr|c}} = IPA {{angbr IPA|ts}}, Amer {{angbr|\u0292}} = IPA {{angbr IPA|dz}}.</ref> contains the reconstructed consonants of the Tanoan [[proto-language]] as reconstructed by Hale (1967) based on consonant correspondences in stem-initial position.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"line-height: 1.1em;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

There was economic and political disorganization in the country, the radicalization of the masses, the devaluation of life and polarization of society that intensified during the First World War, leading to the emergence of mob justice, banditry, and riots. Increasingly, a violent solution to political and social problems were emphasized. Ratkovsky notes that the use of coercion was inherent to all parties to the conflict. <ref>[http://www.pseudology.org/Abel/PetroVchk1918_RedTerror.pdf \u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0412\u0427\u041a \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2006.] p.236</ref>\n\nRatkovsky places emphasis on the role of foreign countries in intensifying the civil war, involving German, Czechoslovakian, American, British, French, and Japanese forces. The use of repression was justified by the State on the basis of the foreignness of its enemies. There was the suppression of revolutions in Hungary, Germany, and especially Finland, which pushed for more decisive action by the Soviet state against its adversaries. Believing that its foes were diametrically opposed to it, the Soviet forces aimed at suppressing them, including their social basis. Thus, the repression was directed against ancien regime officials and military officers, policemen, and members of the upper classes <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nIn addition to clearing the old state apparatus, the Red Terror had a purpose in strengthening the Soviet state. According to Ratkovsky, the situation demanded the Bolsheviks retain power not only by suppressing rebellion, but also to prevent it at all costs, as well as signs of anarchy. The Red Terror sought to fix the problem of the spontaneous, individual terror. <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nThe Red Terror in [[Soviet Russia]] was justified in the [[Soviet historiography]] as a wartime campaign against [[counter-revolutionaries]] during the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, targeting those who sided with the Whites ([[White Army]]). Bolsheviks referred to any anti-Bolshevik factions as Whites, regardless of whether those factions actually supported the [[White movement]] cause. Leon Trotsky described the context in 1920:\n\n{{Quote|The severity of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, let us point out here, was conditioned by no less difficult circumstances [than the [[French Revolution]]]. There was one continuous front, on the north and south, in the east and west. Besides the Russian [[White movement|White Guard]] armies of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]], [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and others, there are those attacking Soviet Russia, simultaneously or in turn: Germans, Austrians, Czecho-Slovaks, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Roumanians, French, British, Americans, Japanese, Finns, Esthonians, Lithuanians ... In a country throttled by a blockade and strangled by hunger, there are conspiracies, risings, terrorist acts, and destruction of roads and bridges.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\nHe then went on to contrast the terror with the revolution and provide the Bolshevik's justification for it:\n\n{{Quote|The first conquest of power by the Soviets at the beginning of November 1917 (new style) was actually accomplished with insignificant sacrifices. The Russian bourgeoisie found itself to such a degree estranged from the masses of the people, so internally helpless, so compromised by the course and the result of the war, so demoralized by the regime of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], that it scarcely dared show any resistance. ... A revolutionary class which has conquered power with arms in its hands is bound to, and will, suppress, rifle in hand, all attempts to tear the power out of its hands. Where it has against it a hostile army, it will oppose to it its own army. Where it is confronted with armed conspiracy, attempt at murder, or rising, it will hurl at the heads of its enemies an unsparing penalty.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\n[[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]], stated in the newspaper ''Red Terror'':\n\n{{Quote|We are not fighting against single individuals. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which class he belongs, what is his background, his education, his profession. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused.

''The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia \u2013 Past, Present, and Future'', 1994.</ref> }}\n\nThe bitter struggle was described succinctly from the Bolshevik point of view by [[Grigory Zinoviev]] in mid-September 1918:\n\n{{Quote|To overcome our enemies we must have our own socialist militarism. We must carry along with us 90 million out of the 100 million of Soviet Russia's population. As for the rest, we have nothing to say to them.

Although the Constituent Assembly elections predated the split between the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Right SRs]], who had opposed the Bolsheviks; and the [[Left SRs]], who were their coalition partners, consequentially many peasant votes intended for the latter went to the SRs.<ref name=\"reflections\"/><ref>Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Russian Revolution'', Oxford: Oxford University Press (2008), p. 66.</ref><ref>E.

Pipes has quoted Marx's observation of the class struggles in 19th century France: \"The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also ''perish'' in order to make room for the people who are fit for a new world\", but noted that neither [[Karl Marx|Marx]] nor [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] encouraged mass murder.<ref name=\"Pipes\"/><ref>Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/ch03.htm  The Class Struggles in France] (1850).</ref> [[Robert Conquest]] was convinced that \"unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities\".<ref name=\"reflections\">Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000), {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[Orlando Figes]]' view was that Red Terror was implicit, not so much in Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous violence of the [[Russian Revolution]]. He noted that there were a number of Bolsheviks, led by [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Mikhail Olminsky]], who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to \"Lenin's violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy\",  the Bolsheviks would be \"forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means\".{{sfnp|Figes|1998|pp=630, 649}} Figes also asserts that the Red Terror \"erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.\"{{sfnp|Figes|1998|p=525}}\n\nThe German Marxist [[Karl Kautsky]] pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population and included the taking and executing hostages: \"Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\".<ref>[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 ''Terrorism and Communism''] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Nicolas Werth]] contrasts the Red and [[White Terror (Russia)|White terrors]], noting the former was the official policy of the Bolshevik government:\n\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.{{sfnp|Werth, Bartosek et al.|1999|p=82}}</blockquote>\n\nYuri Semyonov argues that \"apologists for the Whites, trying to justify them, often say: the White Terror simply amounted to the excesses of individuals wronged by the Bolsheviks, while the Red Terror was a deliberate policy of the Bolsheviks in general and particularly Lenin. This, however, is not true.\" Semyonov cites documents from Siberia stating \"it's forbidden to arrest the workers, you're commanded to shoot or hang them.\" Kolchak himself issued an order to \"I order you to shoot all captured Communists. Now we rely on the bayonet.\" Kolchak's governor for Yenisei region Lieutenant-General S. Rozanov issued an order stating \"The villages, whose people meet  government troops with weapons, burn them down and shoot the adult males without exception. Confiscate property, horses, wagons, and grains in favor of the treasury.\"<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nJames Ryan points out that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=116}} He did intend to bring about \"the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie\", but through non-violent political and economic means.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=74}}\n\n[[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] noted that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of \"violent revolution\" and [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] long before the [[October Revolution]], implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906, when he argued it must involve \"unlimited power based on force and not on law\", \"absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence\". In ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' of 1917, Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices such as Kautsky calling for moderate use of violence met \"furious reply\" from Lenin in ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]'' (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky's reservations was written by [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in ''[[Terrorism and Communism|The Defense of Terrorism]]'' (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it is sufficient that the \"violence is successful\" for it to justify its \"rightness\". Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system such as \"militarization of labor\" and concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.W.

There was economic and political disorganization in the country, the radicalization of the masses, the devaluation of life and polarization of society that intensified during the First World War, leading to the emergence of mob justice, banditry, and riots. Increasingly, a violent solution to political and social problems were emphasized. Ratkovsky notes that the use of coercion was inherent to all parties to the conflict. <ref>[http://www.pseudology.org/Abel/PetroVchk1918_RedTerror.pdf \u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0412\u0427\u041a \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2006.] p.236</ref>\n\nRatkovsky places emphasis on the role of foreign countries in intensifying the civil war, involving German, Czechoslovakian, American, British, French, and Japanese forces. The use of repression was justified by the State on the basis of the foreignness of its enemies. There was the suppression of revolutions in Hungary, Germany, and especially Finland, which pushed for more decisive action by the Soviet state against its adversaries. Believing that its foes were diametrically opposed to it, the Soviet forces aimed at suppressing them, including their social basis. Thus, the repression was directed against ancien regime officials and military officers, policemen, and members of the upper classes <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nIn addition to clearing the old state apparatus, the Red Terror had a purpose in strengthening the Soviet state. According to Ratkovsky, the situation demanded the Bolsheviks retain power not only by suppressing rebellion, but also to prevent it at all costs, as well as signs of anarchy. The Red Terror sought to fix the problem of the spontaneous, individual terror. <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nThe Red Terror in [[Soviet Russia]] was justified in the [[Soviet historiography]] as a wartime campaign against [[counter-revolutionaries]] during the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, targeting those who sided with the Whites ([[White Army]]). Bolsheviks referred to any anti-Bolshevik factions as Whites, regardless of whether those factions actually supported the [[White movement]] cause. Leon Trotsky described the context in 1920:\n\n{{Quote|The severity of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, let us point out here, was conditioned by no less difficult circumstances [than the [[French Revolution]]]. There was one continuous front, on the north and south, in the east and west. Besides the Russian [[White movement|White Guard]] armies of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]], [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and others, there are those attacking Soviet Russia, simultaneously or in turn: Germans, Austrians, Czecho-Slovaks, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Roumanians, French, British, Americans, Japanese, Finns, Esthonians, Lithuanians ... In a country throttled by a blockade and strangled by hunger, there are conspiracies, risings, terrorist acts, and destruction of roads and bridges.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\nHe then went on to contrast the terror with the revolution and provide the Bolshevik's justification for it:\n\n{{Quote|The first conquest of power by the Soviets at the beginning of November 1917 (new style) was actually accomplished with insignificant sacrifices. The Russian bourgeoisie found itself to such a degree estranged from the masses of the people, so internally helpless, so compromised by the course and the result of the war, so demoralized by the regime of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], that it scarcely dared show any resistance. ... A revolutionary class which has conquered power with arms in its hands is bound to, and will, suppress, rifle in hand, all attempts to tear the power out of its hands. Where it has against it a hostile army, it will oppose to it its own army. Where it is confronted with armed conspiracy, attempt at murder, or rising, it will hurl at the heads of its enemies an unsparing penalty.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\n[[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]], stated in the newspaper ''Red Terror'':\n\n{{Quote|We are not fighting against single individuals. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which class he belongs, what is his background, his education, his profession. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused.

We must carry along with us 90 million out of the 100 million of Soviet Russia's population. As for the rest, we have nothing to say to them.

Pipes has quoted Marx's observation of the class struggles in 19th century France: \"The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also ''perish'' in order to make room for the people who are fit for a new world\", but noted that neither [[Karl Marx|Marx]] nor [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] encouraged mass murder.<ref name=\"Pipes\"/><ref>Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/ch03.htm  The Class Struggles in France] (1850).</ref> [[Robert Conquest]] was convinced that \"unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities\".<ref name=\"reflections\">Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000), {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[Orlando Figes]]' view was that Red Terror was implicit, not so much in Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous violence of the [[Russian Revolution]]. He noted that there were a number of Bolsheviks, led by [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Mikhail Olminsky]], who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to \"Lenin's violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy&nbsp;... [t]he Bolsheviks [would be] forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means\".{{sfnp|Figes|1998|pp=630, 649}} Figes also asserts that the Red Terror \"erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.\"{{sfnp|Figes|1998|p=525}}\n\nThe German Marxist [[Karl Kautsky]] pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism, because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population, and included the taking and executing hostages. \"Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\".<ref>[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 ''Terrorism and Communism''] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Nicolas Werth]] contrasts the Red and [[White Terror (Russia)|White terrors]], noting the former was the official policy of the Bolshevik government:\n\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.{{sfnp|Werth, Bartosek et al.|1999|p=82}}</blockquote>\n\nYuri Semyonov argues that \"apologists for the Whites, trying to justify them, often say: the White Terror simply amounted to the excesses of individuals wronged by the Bolsheviks, while the Red Terror was a deliberate policy of the Bolsheviks in general and particularly Lenin. This, however, is not true.\" Semyonov cites documents from Siberia stating \"it's forbidden to arrest the workers, you're commanded to shoot or hang them.\" Kolchak himself issued an order to \"I order you to shoot all captured Communists. Now we rely on the bayonet.\" Kolchak's governor for Yenisei region Lieutenant-General S. Rozanov issued an order stating \"The villages, whose people meet  government troops with weapons, burn them down and shoot the adult males without exception. Confiscate property, horses, wagons, and grains in favor of the treasury.\"<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nJames Ryan points out that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=116}}  He did intend to bring about \"the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie\", but through non-violent political and economic means.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=74}}\n\n[[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] noted that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of \"violent revolution\" and [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] long before the [[October Revolution]]. Implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906 where he argued it must involve \"unlimited power based on force and not on law\", \"absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence\". In ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' of 1917 Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices calling for moderate use of violence, such as Kautsky's, met \"furious reply\" from Lenin in ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]'' (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky's reservations was written by  [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in ''[[Terrorism and Communism|The Defense of Terrorism]]'' (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it's sufficient that the \"violence is successful\" for it to justify its \"rightness\". Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system, such as \"militarization of labor\" and concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.W.

The original seven members consisted of [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania|Millersville University]], [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT), [[Princeton University]], [[Seton Hall University]], [[The College of New Jersey]] (TCNJ), the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[West Chester University]]. The founder and first president of the conference was Tom Hench (2014-2016).

The results of these games will count towards league standings and determine the playoff seeds. The top six teams at the conclusion of the regular season will qualify for the conference playoffs, which are held at a single venue over the course of one weekend. \n\nThe top two seeds receive a bye in the first round. The third seed faces the sixth seed, while the fourth seed faces the fifth. The second round sees the top seed take on the lowest remaining seed, and the second seed take on the highest seed remaining. The two teams that advance will face each-other in the championship game, with the winner receiving both the conference trophy and a birth in the ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament.\n\n==Member

States)|mid-Atlantic]] region of the United States. The conference is part of the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] Division 2 and is made up of ten teams from colleges and universities based in [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Original CSCHC Logo.png|thumb|left|150px|The original logo of the CSCHC.

The original seven members consisted of [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania|Millersville University]], [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT), [[Princeton University]], [[Seton Hall University]], [[The College of New Jersey]] (TCNJ), the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[West Chester University]]. The founder and first president of the conference was Tom Hench (2014-2016). Andrew Ducko (2016-) currently resides as the conference president.\n\nPrior to the 2015\u201316 season [[Monmouth University]] joined the conference from the [[Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Hockey Association]] (MACH), raising the total number of teams to eight. In November 2015, the ACHA granted the CSCHC an automatic bid into the ACHA D2 Regional Tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cschc.pointstreaksites.com/view/cschc/news-1470/news_359055|title=CSCHC RECEIVES AUTO BID {{!}} Colonial States College Hockey Conference|website=cschc.pointstreaksites.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> \n\nIn March 2016, [[Rutgers University]] and the [[University of Scranton]] were accepted into the conference from the GNCHC following the 2015\u201316 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cschc.pointstreaksites.com/view/cschc/news-1470/news_448161|title=The CSCHC Welcomes Rutgers and Scranton {{!}} Colonial States College Hockey Conference|website=cschc.pointstreaksites.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2018\u201319 season the conference adopted a new shootout rule for regular season games that were tied at the conclusion of overtime, eliminating the \"tie\" entirely from CSCHC play. The first game to implement this new rule was on October 26, 2018 where The College of New Jersey defeated Millersville University, 5\u20134 (2:1 in SO), after five shootout rounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acha_cschc.wttstats.pointstreak.com/boxscore.html?gameid=3367582|title=Colonial States College Hockey Conference {{!}} Pointstreak Stats|website=acha_cschc.wttstats.pointstreak.com|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://achahockey.org/view/achahockey/divisions/men-s-d2-1/stats-431?type=boxscore&level=game&id=3367582|title=Stats {{!}} ACHA|website=achahockey.org|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n[[File:CSCHC 2018 Playoffs.jpg|alt=The College of New Jersey and West Chester University compete in the first round of the 2018 CSCHC Playoffs at Loucks Ice Center.|thumb|The College of New Jersey and West Chester University compete in the first round of the 2018 CSCHC Playoffs at Loucks Ice Center.|278px]]\n\nFollowing that season the CSCHC took part in the 2019 Men's Division 2 All Star Challenge, along with 12 other DII leagues and one group representing independent programs, which was hosted at West Chester's [[Ice Line Quad Rinks]].<ref>{{cite web |title=COLONIAL TO COMPETE IN ACHA D2 ALL-STAR CHALLENGE |url=http://cschc.pointstreaksites.com/view/cschc/news-1470/news_516352 |website=cschc.pointstreaksites.com |accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref> The team finished 12th with a record of 1-3-1.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Men's Division 2 All Star Challenge |url=http://achahockey.org/view/achahockey/events-477/2019-mens-division-2-all-star-challenge |website=achahockey.org |accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref> In August 2019, TCNJ was announced as a 2020 ACHA Men's Division 2 Regional host, with [[Lawrenceville School#Facilities|Loucks Ice Center]] in [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey]] acting as the site for the Southeast tournament between February 28 and March 1.<ref>{{cite web |title=2020 Men\u2019s Division 2 Regional Sites Selected |url=http://achahockey.org/view/achahockey/acha-hockey-news/news_524892 |website=achahockey.org |accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref> This was the first time that a team from The Colonial acted as an official host for an official ACHA event.

The results of these games will count towards league standings and determine the playoff seeds. The top six teams at the conclusion of the regular season will qualify for the conference playoffs, which are held at a single venue over the course of one weekend. \n\nThe top two seeds receive a bye in the first round. The third seed faces the sixth seed, while the fourth seed faces the fifth. The second round sees the top seed take on the lowest remaining seed, and the second seed take on the highest seed remaining. The two teams that advance will face each-other in the championship game, with the winner receiving both the conference trophy and a birth in the ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament.\n\n==Member

P. Vijayakumar. It is directed by [[P. Vasu]]. The film is a remake of the [[Malayalam]] film ''[[Kadha Parayumbol]]'' (2007) and stars [[Jagapati Babu]] and [[Meena Durairaj|Meena]] in the lead roles, with [[Rajinikanth]] in an extended cameo. [[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]] and [[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam|Dharmavarapu]] play pivotal roles. The film was a commercial success and received positive reviews. It was simultaneously made in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[Kuselan]]'', which released to mixed reviews and was a below average grosser. Most of Rajinikanth's portions were dubbed from the Tamil version, except the climax scene with Babu.\n\nThe film explores the pressures of friendship, and revolves around a villager who had shared a strong friendship with a popular [[Film|cinema]] actor while they were in their youth. However, due to their different career routes, they are eventually forced to part ways; one becoming a national figure, the other becoming a village barber. Decades later, the actor returns to the village to participate in his film's shooting. Whilst the entire village becomes excited about the prospect of seeing the actor, the barber fears that his old friend would have forgotten him and eventually neglected him. \n\n==Plot==\nThe plot tells the story of two childhood friends: Balakrishna ([[Jagapathi Babu]]) and Ashok Kumar ([[Rajinikanth]]). Balu stops at nothing to make his friend happy. As time passes by, they take different paths, and Balu becomes a barber in a small village called [[Sircilla|Siricilla]]. He marries Devi ([[Meena (actress)|Meena]]) and has three children and leads a happy life. However, his finances are poor and he is often led to the door of Dharmaraju ([[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam|Dharmavarapu]]), the financier. He has tough competition from the smarter and more clever Shanmugam ([[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]]), who has a salon opposite his shop. Balu is a man with self-respect and honesty. His life continues the same, until one day there is news that a film shooting is going to happen in a place near their village and the hero of the film is superstar Ashok Kumar''.'' The news spreads rapidly, but Balu hesitates to reveal himself to be a friend of Ashok Kumar. However, people around Balu learn about their friendship, and suddenly those who have been ridiculing him start doing favors for him\u2014only with the intention of meeting Ashok Kumar, or at least watching him from outside. Balu is hesitant to do what they want, and soon people start shunning him. Balu faces poor treatment even from his own children. At last, Ashok Kumar publicly acknowledges Balu as his childhood friend who made him a superstar, and he meets Balu.\n\n==Cast==\n;Main cast\n* [[Jagapati Babu]] as Balakrishna.

[[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]] and [[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam|Dharmavarapu]] play pivotal roles. The film was a commercial success and received positive reviews. It was simultaneously made in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[Kuselan]]'', which released to mixed reviews and was a below average grosser. Most of Rajinikanth's portions were dubbed from the Tamil version, except the climax scene with Babu.\n\nThe film explores the pressures of friendship, and revolves around a villager who had shared a strong friendship with a popular [[Film|cinema]] actor while they were in their youth. However, due to their different career routes, they are eventually forced to part ways; one becoming a national figure, the other becoming a village barber.
