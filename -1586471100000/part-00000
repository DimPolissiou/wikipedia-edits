The village has since transitioned to a tourist-based economy. The port remains active as terminus of the [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]], one of two commercial ferry lines between [[Long Island]] and [[Connecticut]], and is supplemented by the terminus of the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s [[Port Jefferson Branch]]. It is also the center of the Greater Port Jefferson region of northwestern [[Brookhaven, New York|Brookhaven]], serving as the cultural, commercial and transportation hub of the neighboring [[Port Jefferson Station, New York|Port Jefferson Station]], [[Belle Terre, New York|Belle Terre]], [[Mount Sinai, New York|Mount Sinai]], [[Miller Place, New York|Miller Place]], [[Poquott, New York|Poquott]], and the [[Setauket-East Setauket, New York|Setaukets]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Colonial and precolonial history===\n[[File:John Roe House in Port Jefferson, New York.jpg|thumb|left|c.1682 home of John Roe, the first settler in lower Port Jefferson]]\n\nThe original settlers of the [[Brookhaven, New York|Town of Brookhaven]], based in the neighboring hamlet of [[Setauket, New York|Setauket]], bought a tract of land from the Setalcott Indians in 1655.

This house, named Egerton, was a grand abode on the western end of Mount Sinai Harbor at Mount Misery Neck.<ref name=\"Barstow\">{{cite book|last=Barstow|first=Belle|title=Setauket, Alias Brookhaven|pages=110\u2013291}}</ref> The first settler in Port Jefferson's current downtown was an [[Irish people|Irish]] Protestant shoemaker from [[Queens]] named John Roe, who built his still-standing home in 1682. It remained a small community of five homes through the 18th century, and was renamed to \"Drowned Meadow\" in 1682.<ref name=\"portjeffguide\"/>\n\nLocal lore has it that the pirate [[Captain Kidd]] rendezvoused in the harbor on his way to bury treasure at [[Gardiner's Island]].<ref name=\"Pelletreau\">{{cite book| title=A History of Long Island: from its settlement to the present time, Volume II| url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924026113914| author=Pelletreau, William S| pages=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924026113914/page/n286 273]\u2013275|year=1905}}</ref> During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and that [[John Paul Jones]] had a ship fitted here.<ref name=\"Pelletreau\" /> However, there is no factual support for these assertions, and the historical works quoted do not present them as definitive facts. John Paul Jones' career in particular is well documented, and there are no accounts of him actually visiting the village which was under British control during the entire time he served as a commanding officer.\n\n===Development as a shipbuilding village===\nIn 1797, when the town had but five houses, its first shipyard was built. By 1825, several shipbuilding firms existed, bringing in new residents and commerce.<ref name=\"Pelletreau\" />\n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], British interference on Long Island Sound upset local shipping routes. On one occasion, two British warships, the frigate ''[[HMS Pomone (1809)|H.M.S. Pomone]]'' and brig ''H.M.S. Despatch'' sent their boats into the harbor under cover of darkness and captured seven sloops.<ref>Port Jefferson Historical Society Newsletter, October 2000 to January 2001, confirmed using the ship's logs in the British National Archives.</ref> To protect local interests, a small fortress was set up on the west side of Port Jefferson Harbor.<ref name=\"Bayles\">{{cite book| title=Historical and Descriptive Sketches of Suffolk County and its Towns| url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldescri00bayl_0| author=Bayles, Richard Mather| pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldescri00bayl_0/page/n445 223]\u2013281|year=1874}}</ref>\n\nIt wasn't until 1836 that the local leadership truly initiated the community's transition from a swampish hamlet to a bustling port town. Twenty-two acres of the harborfront, which flooded with the tides, were brought to a stable elevation with the construction of a causeway. Concurrently, the village was rechristened from \"Drowned Meadow\" to \"Port Jefferson\"<ref name=\"newsdayportjeff\">{{cite web| url=http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-historytown-hist0084,0,3771667.story| title= Newsday, Port Jefferson: Ships Were King in 'Drowned Meadow'| accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=1463 |title= Profile for Port Jefferson, New York, NY |publisher= ePodunk |accessdate= 2012-10-04}}</ref> The name choice was in honor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], who provided significant funds for this project.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nNumerous shipyards developed along Port Jefferson's harbor and the village's [[shipbuilding]] industry became the largest in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]. A common misconception is the belief that the village was as a major [[whaling]] port. This is not supported by Government documents used to compile the two definitive references on the American Whale fishery. These two works list every vessel and every voyage undertaken by American whaling vessels from colonial days until the 1920s, none of which began or ended at Port Jefferson. However two whaling vessels were built for New Bedford at Port Jefferson in 1877 (ship ''Horatio'' and bark ''Fleetwing''), and a Port Jefferson built schooner (''La Ninfa'') was later converted into a whaling vessel at San Francisco.<ref>Starbuck, Alexander, History of the American Whale Fishery, Originally Part 4 of the Report of the U.S. Commission on Fish and Fisheries, Washington, DC, 1878, Reprinted by Castle Books, Secaucus, NJ, 1989</ref><ref>Hegarty, Reginald B., Returns of Whaling Vessels Sailing From American Ports, Old Dartmouth Historical Society, New Bedford, 1959</ref> Port Jefferson's main role as a port in the 19th Century was to build and support vessels engaged in the coastal freighting trades. Many of Port Jefferson's remaining homes from this period were owned by shipbuilders and captains. This includes the [[Mather House Museum]], a mid-19th century home once owned by the Mather shipbuilding family that now serves as the center of a museum complex and headquarters for ''The Historical Society of Greater Port Jefferson''.\n\n[[File:Historical postcard of Hotel Square in Port Jefferson.jpg|thumb|Postcard of Hotel Square, corner of Main and East Main, with labels displaying the Townsend House hotel and the village's first post office in the late 19th century]]\n[[P. T. Barnum]], the famous circus owner, owned a tract of land which ran through the village. His intention was to make Port Jefferson the home base for his circus. The residents put a stop to his plans, and he eventually sold his land. Barnum Avenue now runs through the area that was once his land, and one of the [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]] boats is named the ''P. T. Barnum''. A house he had constructed also still exists but is privately owned.\n\n[[File:Mather Shipyard Crew, 1884.jpg|thumb|left|Mather Shipyard in 1884]]\nDuring this period, lower Port Jefferson's main section of commerce was located on what is now East Main Street. Most of the current Main Street, located on what was initially a swamp, did not become as commercially viable until the 20th century. The section of town at the intersection of the two streets, then known as Hotel Square, became an active center of Port Jefferson's early tourism industry in the mid-19th century. Visitors in town for business, or traveling through by rail or ship, were able to select from a variety of lively hotels and restaurants. This included the John Roe house, which was repurposed and expanded into the Townsend House hotel. The village's first post office was added to this intersection in 1855.<ref name=\"images of America\">{{cite book|title=Images of America:Port Jefferson|author=Robert Maggio|year=2013|pages=65\u201370}}</ref>\n\nWith the 1923 sale of the Bayles Shipyard to the [[Standard Oil Company]] and demolition of all but two of its structures, Port Jefferson's shipbuilding industry came to a close. This resulted in an economic downturn and the closing of many of the grand hotels in Hotel Square as tourism declined along with the industry. Port Jefferson Harbor was repurposed for the oil transportation and gravel industries and, since the 1940s, as the site of a [[Long Island Lighting Company|Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO)]] coal-fired power plant. The harbor also had activity as a [[rum-running]] center during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]]. It would not be until well into the 20th century that Port Jefferson rehabilitated its economy with tourism as its primary focus.\n\n===After incorporation===\n\n[[File:Danfords Hotel in Port Jefferson NY.jpg|thumb|left|Danfords Hotel & Marina]]\n[[File:Port Jefferson Village Center2.jpg|thumb|left|Port Jefferson Village Center, during the final phase of Harborfront Park's construction]]\n\nThe village of Port Jefferson was incorporated in 1963.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Port-Jefferson-New-York.html |title= Port Jefferson New York|publisher=City-Data.com| accessdate= 2012-10-04}}</ref> The revitalization of Lower Port Jefferson soon followed as local tourism brought increased revenues and the village adjusted itself to its new economic role. One such transformation was the 1976 redevelopment of the defunct Mather & Jones Shipyard into a shop-lined promenade known as Chandler Square.\n\nA result of the transition is new public access to much of the waterfront, as several industrial lots had previously stood in the way. Danfords Hotel and Marina was one major waterfront project, which integrated several new and historical structures into a luxury hotel. Danfords includes a commercial marina and walkable pier, marking an aspect of the harbor's transformation from industrial to recreational use.\n\nHarborfront Park, a project completed in 2004, similarly transitioned the site of a shipyard turned Mobil Oil terminal into a public park with picnic grounds, a seasonal ice skating rink and a promenade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portjeff.com/facilities/village-center/harborfront-park|title=Harborfront Park|accessdate=2014-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226160240/http://www.portjeff.com/facilities/village-center/harborfront-park|archive-date=2014-02-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Concurrent to the park's construction was the rebuilding of a former shipyard warehouse into the Port Jefferson Village Center, a new public space for events and recreation.\n\nA number of historic buildings were included in the [[Port Jefferson Village Historic District]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> Separately listed are the [[Bayles Shipyard]] and [[First National Bank of Port Jefferson]] building.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nThe village of Port Jefferson is located on the [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore of Long Island]], 60 miles east of [[New York City]].\n\n[[File:PJBoats.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Boats in Port Jefferson Harbor]]\n\nThe village's commerce is divided into two centers that lie one mile apart along Main Street and at differing elevations. These are known as ''Lower Port Jefferson'' and ''Upper Port Jefferson'', respectively the waterfront and the railroad station sections of town. The first is currently the center of tourism, while the latter is undergoing plans for revitalization to the economic viability of its historic self. Further from Main Street, the remainder of Port Jefferson consists of several residential neighborhoods defined by the hills on which they sit. In the northeastern corner of the village is the neighborhood of ''Harbor Hills''. This neighborhood occupies the western edge of Mount Sinai Harbor and contains the Port Jefferson Country Club at Harbor Hills. ''Brick Hill'' is the neighborhood directly west of the Lower Port Jefferson commercial center and was first developed by the noted circus owner [[P. T. Barnum]]. West of Upper Port Jefferson is ''Cedar Hill'', which is topped by the c. 1859 Cedar Hill Cemetery where residents formerly would bask while enjoying views over the village from its highest point.\n\nWithin Port Jefferson is Port Jefferson Harbor, a natural deepwater harbor. Setauket Harbor branches off to the west from the harbor. One notable geographic feature is The Cove, a small cove dredged in the early 20th century by the Seaboard Dredging Company. The original name was Seaboard Hole, but it was changed for the sake of appealing to tourists, and several large sand dunes artificially created by the dredging can also be found here.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Portjeffersonferry.JPG\n|width1=200\n|caption1=The ''P.

The other route is the [[Cross Sound Ferry]] at [[Orient Point]] and no bridges or tunnels exist despite past proposals. Port Jefferson's ferry company was established in 1883 and was championed by influential circus owner [[P. T. Barnum]]. Barnum, who owned lands in both Port Jefferson and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], became the new company's first president.<ref name=\"bp pj ferry\">{{cite web| url=http://www.88844ferry.com/aboutus/history.aspx| title= The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson ferry: History| accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe village additionally serves as the eastern terminus for the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s [[Port Jefferson Branch]]. The branch consists of a diesel train that connects to the electrified [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] at the village of [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]]. During the full run it continues toward the western termini of [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Manhattan]] or to [[Atlantic Terminal]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The average commute from Port Jefferson to Manhattan via the Long Island Rail Road takes approximately 2 hours. Train service to [[New York City]] first reached Port Jefferson in 1873. The ferry terminal and train station are approximately one mile apart. In March 2014, mayor Margot Garant announced interest in establishing a future shuttle to link the two transportation networks as well as their respective sections of town, lower and upper Port Jefferson.<ref name=\"pj shuttle\">{{cite web| url=http://www.thelirrtoday.com/2014/03/port-jefferson-officials-mull-village.html|title=Port Jefferson Officials Mull Village Shuttle|website=thelirrtoday.com|date=March 22, 2014|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2016}}\n\nPort Jefferson's main street forms a section of [[New York State Route 25A]], a scenic and historic route through Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore]] from the [[New York City]] borough of Queens eastward to Calverton. Just southeast of the village is the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 347]], a multilane divided highway that connects to the [[Northern State Parkway]] in Hauppauge. [[New York State Route 112]], an important north\u2013south route, begins just south of the village and runs to Patchogue, with a dedicated bicycle lane along much of the route.\n\n==Culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Theater Three-Port Jefferson.JPG|thumb|[[Theatre Three]] is based in the Athena Hall, built {{Circa|1874}}]]\n[[File:Lecture night at the Baptist Church, Port Jefferson.jpeg|thumb|''Lecture night at the Baptist Church, Port Jefferson'', 1912 painting by [[William Moore Davis]]]]\n\nPort Jefferson has been home to the annual ''Port Jefferson Village Dickens Festival'' every year since 1996. The festival celebrates the works and times of English novelist [[Charles Dickens]]. It takes place during a weekend early in December and typically includes many events and occurrences, such as the regular sighting of people who dress in 19th century clothing, house tours, the reading of winter-related poetry, caroling, and booths set up by local businesses. Students from the Port Jefferson Middle School and High School submit poetry and art that are used in the festival. Free concerts of seasonal music by various ensembles are presented at the Methodist church. Many small festivals are held during the summer, showcasing music and crafts. Each [[Fourth of July]] sees a substantial parade on Main Street. The village also hosts an annual outdoor concert series and film screenings, both of which currently take place in Harborfront Park throughout July and August.\n\nPort Jefferson is home to [[Theatre Three]], a non-profit theatre company founded in 1969. Each year Theatre Three stages four musicals and two plays and additionally performs A Christmas Carol during the annual Dickens Festival. Theatre Three is held in Athena Hall, a performance space dating to 1874. The village was home to two notable landscape painters in the late 19th century, [[William Moore Davis]] and Leon Foster Jones. Both artists produced numerous depictions of Port Jefferson and its harbor. They were the subject of a 1993 art exhibition by the [[Long Island Museum]] in [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]].\n\nIn keeping with its seafaring heritage, Port Jefferson hosts its own annual boat race series known as the ''Village Cup Regatta'', with proceeds benefiting cancer research. The village also boasts two recent [[America's Cup]] winners. Bowman Scott Vogel lost the [[1983 America's Cup|1983 race]] and won the [[1987 America's Cup|1987 race]], and pitman Wally Henry won the race [[1992 America's Cup|in 1992]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 1724\n|1890= 2026\n|1970= 5515\n|1980= 6731\n|1990= 7455\n|2000= 7837\n|2010= 7750\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8164\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 7,750 people, 3,090 households, and 1,975 families residing in the village.

By 1825, several shipbuilding firms existed, bringing in new residents and commerce.<ref name=\"Pelletreau\" />\n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], British interference on Long Island Sound upset local shipping routes.

This is not supported by Government documents used to compile the two definitive references on the American Whale fishery. These two works list every vessel and every voyage undertaken by American whaling vessels from colonial days until the 1920s, none of which began or ended at Port Jefferson. However two whaling vessels were built for New Bedford at Port Jefferson in 1877 (ship ''Horatio'' and bark ''Fleetwing''), and a Port Jefferson built schooner (''La Ninfa'') was later converted into a whaling vessel at San Francisco.<ref>Starbuck, Alexander, History of the American Whale Fishery, Originally Part 4 of the Report of the U.S. Commission on Fish and Fisheries, Washington, DC, 1878, Reprinted by Castle Books, Secaucus, NJ, 1989</ref><ref>Hegarty, Reginald B., Returns of Whaling Vessels Sailing From American Ports, Old Dartmouth Historical Society, New Bedford, 1959</ref> Port Jefferson's main role as a port in the 19th Century was to build and support vessels engaged in the coastal freighting trades. Many of Port Jefferson's remaining homes from this period were owned by shipbuilders and captains. This includes the [[Mather House Museum]], a mid-19th century home once owned by the Mather shipbuilding family that now serves as the center of a museum complex and headquarters for ''The Historical Society of Greater Port Jefferson''.\n\n[[File:Historical postcard of Hotel Square in Port Jefferson.jpg|thumb|Postcard of Hotel Square, corner of Main and East Main, with labels displaying the Townsend House hotel and the village's first post office in the late 19th century]]\n[[P. T. Barnum]], the famous circus owner, owned a tract of land which ran through the village. His intention was to make Port Jefferson the home base for his circus. The residents put a stop to his plans, and he eventually sold his land. Barnum Avenue now runs though the area that was once his land, and one of the [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]] boats is named the ''P. T. Barnum''. A house he had constructed also still exists but is privately owned.\n\n[[File:Mather Shipyard Crew, 1884.jpg|thumb|left|Mather Shipyard in 1884]]\nDuring this period, lower Port Jefferson's main section of commerce was located on what is now East Main Street. Most of the current Main Street, located on what was initially a swamp, did not become as commercially viable until the 20th century. The section of town at the intersection of the two streets, then known as Hotel Square, became an active center of Port Jefferson's early tourism industry in the mid-19th century. Visitors in town for business, or traveling through by rail or ship, were able to select from a variety of lively hotels and restaurants. This included the John Roe house, which was repurposed and expanded into the Townsend House hotel. The village's first post office was added to this intersection in 1855.<ref name=\"images of America\">{{cite book|title=Images of America:Port Jefferson|author=Robert Maggio|year=2013|pages=65\u201370}}</ref>\n\nWith the 1923 sale of the Bayles Shipyard to the [[Standard Oil Company]] and demolition of all but two of its structures, Port Jefferson's shipbuilding industry came to a close. This resulted in an economic downturn and the closing of many of the grand hotels in Hotel Square as tourism declined along with the industry. Port Jefferson Harbor was repurposed for the oil transportation and gravel industries and, since the 1940s, as the site of a [[Long Island Lighting Company|Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO)]] coal-fired power plant. The harbor also had activity as a [[rum-running]] center during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]]. It would not be until well into the 20th century that Port Jefferson rehabilitated its economy with tourism as its primary focus.\n\n===After incorporation===\n\n[[File:Danfords Hotel in Port Jefferson NY.jpg|thumb|left|Danfords Hotel & Marina]]\n[[File:Port Jefferson Village Center2.jpg|thumb|left|Port Jefferson Village Center, during the final phase of Harborfront Park's construction]]\n\nThe village of Port Jefferson was incorporated in 1963.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Port-Jefferson-New-York.html |title= Port Jefferson New York|publisher=City-Data.com| accessdate= 2012-10-04}}</ref> The revitalization of Lower Port Jefferson soon followed as local tourism brought increased revenues and the village adjusted itself to its new economic role. One such transformation was the 1976 redevelopment of the defunct Mather & Jones Shipyard into a shop-lined promenade known as Chandler Square.\n\nA result of the transition is new public access to much of the waterfront, as several industrial lots had previously stood in the way. Danfords Hotel and Marina was one major waterfront project, which integrated several new and historical structures into a luxury hotel. Danfords includes a commercial marina and walkable pier, marking an aspect of the harbor's transformation from industrial to recreational use.\n\nHarborfront Park, a project completed in 2004, similarly transitioned the site of a shipyard turned Mobil Oil terminal into a public park with picnic grounds, a seasonal ice skating rink and a promenade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portjeff.com/facilities/village-center/harborfront-park|title=Harborfront Park|accessdate=2014-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226160240/http://www.portjeff.com/facilities/village-center/harborfront-park|archive-date=2014-02-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Concurrent to the park's construction was the rebuilding of a former shipyard warehouse into the Port Jefferson Village Center, a new public space for events and recreation.\n\nA number of historic buildings were included in the [[Port Jefferson Village Historic District]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> Separately listed are the [[Bayles Shipyard]] and [[First National Bank of Port Jefferson]] building.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nThe village of Port Jefferson is located on the [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore of Long Island]], 60 miles east of [[New York City]].\n\n[[File:PJBoats.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Boats in Port Jefferson Harbor]]\n\nThe village's commerce is divided into two centers that lie one mile apart along Main Street and at differing elevations. These are known as ''Lower Port Jefferson'' and ''Upper Port Jefferson'', respectively the waterfront and the railroad station sections of town. The first is currently the center of tourism, while the latter is undergoing plans for revitalization to the economic viability of its historic self. Further from Main Street, the remainder of Port Jefferson consists of several residential neighborhoods defined by the hills on which they sit. In the northeastern corner of the village is the neighborhood of ''Harbor Hills''. This neighborhood occupies the western edge of Mount Sinai Harbor and contains the Port Jefferson Country Club at Harbor Hills. ''Brick Hill'' is the neighborhood directly west of the Lower Port Jefferson commercial center and was first developed by the noted circus owner [[P. T. Barnum]]. West of Upper Port Jefferson is ''Cedar Hill'', which is topped by the c. 1859 Cedar Hill Cemetery where residents formerly would bask while enjoying views over the village from its highest point.\n\nWithin Port Jefferson is Port Jefferson Harbor, a natural deepwater harbor. Setauket Harbor branches off to the west from the harbor. One notable geographic feature is The Cove, a small cove dredged in the early 20th century by the Seaboard Dredging Company. The original name was Seaboard Hole, but it was changed for the sake of appealing to tourists, and several large sand dunes artificially created by the dredging can also be found here.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Portjeffersonferry.JPG\n|width1=200\n|caption1=The ''P.

The other route is the [[Cross Sound Ferry]] at [[Orient Point]] and no bridges or tunnels exist despite past proposals. Port Jefferson's ferry company was established in 1883 and was championed by influential circus owner [[P. T. Barnum]]. Barnum, who owned lands in both Port Jefferson and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], became the new company's first president.<ref name=\"bp pj ferry\">{{cite web| url=http://www.88844ferry.com/aboutus/history.aspx| title= The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson ferry: History| accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe village additionally serves as the eastern terminus for the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s [[Port Jefferson Branch]]. The branch consists of a diesel train that connects to the electrified [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] at the village of [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]]. During the full run it continues toward the western termini of [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Manhattan]] or to [[Atlantic Terminal]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The average commute from Port Jefferson to Manhattan via the Long Island Rail Road takes approximately 2 hours. Train service to [[New York City]] first reached Port Jefferson in 1873. The ferry terminal and train station are approximately one mile apart. In March 2014, mayor Margot Garant announced interest in establishing a future shuttle to link the two transportation networks as well as their respective sections of town, lower and upper Port Jefferson.<ref name=\"pj shuttle\">{{cite web| url=http://www.thelirrtoday.com/2014/03/port-jefferson-officials-mull-village.html|title=Port Jefferson Officials Mull Village Shuttle|website=thelirrtoday.com|date=March 22, 2014|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2016}}\n\nPort Jefferson's main street forms a section of [[New York State Route 25A]], a scenic and historic route through Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore]] from the [[New York City]] borough of Queens eastward to Calverton. Just southeast of the village is the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 347]], a multilane divided highway that connects to the [[Northern State Parkway]] in Hauppauge. [[New York State Route 112]], an important north-south route, begins just south of the village and runs to Patchogue, with a dedicated bicycle lane along much of the route.\n\n==Culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Theater Three-Port Jefferson.JPG|thumb|[[Theatre Three]] is based in the Athena Hall, built {{Circa|1874}}]]\n[[File:Lecture night at the Baptist Church, Port Jefferson.jpeg|thumb|''Lecture night at the Baptist Church, Port Jefferson'', 1912 painting by [[William Moore Davis]]]]\n\nPort Jefferson has been home to the annual ''Port Jefferson Village Dickens Festival'' every year since 1996. The festival celebrates the works and times of English novelist [[Charles Dickens]]. It takes place during a weekend early in December and typically includes many events and occurrences, such as the regular sighting of people who dress in 19th century clothing, house tours, the reading of winter-related poetry, caroling, and booths set up by local businesses. Students from the Port Jefferson Middle School and High School submit poetry and art that are used in the festival. Free concerts of seasonal music by various ensembles are presented at the Methodist church. Many small festivals are held during the summer, showcasing music and crafts. Each [[Fourth of July]] sees a substantial parade on Main Street. The village also hosts an annual outdoor concert series and film screenings, both of which currently take place in Harborfront Park throughout July and August.\n\nPort Jefferson is home to [[Theatre Three]], a non-profit theatre company founded in 1969. Each year Theatre Three stages four musicals and two plays and additionally performs A Christmas Carol during the annual Dickens Festival. Theatre Three is held in Athena Hall, a performance space dating to 1874. The village was home to two notable landscape painters in the late 19th century, [[William Moore Davis]] and Leon Foster Jones. Both artists produced numerous depictions of Port Jefferson and its harbor. They were the subject of a 1993 art exhibition by the [[Long Island Museum]] in [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]].\n\nIn keeping with its seafaring heritage, Port Jefferson hosts its own annual boat race series known as the ''Village Cup Regatta'', with proceeds benefiting cancer research. The village also boasts two recent [[America's Cup]] winners. Bowman Scott Vogel lost the [[1983 America's Cup|1983 race]] and won the [[1987 America's Cup|1987 race]], and pitman Wally Henry won the race [[1992 America's Cup|in 1992]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 1724\n|1890= 2026\n|1970= 5515\n|1980= 6731\n|1990= 7455\n|2000= 7837\n|2010= 7750\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8164\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 7,750 people, 3,090 households, and 1,975 families residing in the village.

In October 1954, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network launched Disney's first regular television series. In 1954, Walt Disney used his ''Disneyland'' series to unveil what would become [[Disneyland]], an idea conceived out of a desire for a place where parents and children could both have fun at the same time. On July 18, 1955, Walt Disney opened Disneyland to the general public. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland was previewed with a live television broadcast hosted by [[Robert Cummings]], [[Art Linkletter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. After a shaky start, Disneyland continued to grow and attract visitors from across the country and around the world. A major expansion in 1959 included the addition of America's first [[Disneyland Monorail System|monorail system]]. For the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], Disney prepared four separate attractions for various sponsors, each of which would find its way to Disneyland in one form or another. During this time, Walt Disney was also secretly scouting out new sites for a second Disney theme park. In November 1965, \"Disney World\" was announced, with plans for theme parks, hotels, and even a model city on thousands of acres of land purchased outside of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wdwmagic.com/walt-disney-world-history.htm |title=Walt Disney World History |website=www.wdwmagic.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920235120/https://www.wdwmagic.com/walt-disney-world-history.htm |archive-date=September 20, 2018 |access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisney continued to focus its talents on television throughout the 1950s.

In October 1954, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network launched Disney's first regular television series. In 1954, Walt Disney used his ''Disneyland'' series to unveil what would become [[Disneyland]], an idea conceived out of a desire for a place where parents and children could both have fun at the same time. On July 18, 1955, Walt Disney opened Disneyland to the general public. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland was previewed with a live television broadcast hosted by [[Robert Cummings]], [[Art Linkletter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. After a shaky start, Disneyland continued to grow and attract visitors from across the country and around the world. A major expansion in 1959 included the addition of America's first [[Disneyland Monorail System|monorail system]]. For the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], Disney prepared four separate attractions for various sponsors, each of which would find its way to Disneyland in one form or another. During this time, Walt Disney was also secretly scouting out new sites for a second Disney theme park. In November 1965, \"Disney World\" was announced, with plans for theme parks, hotels, and even a model city on thousands of acres of land purchased outside of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wdwmagic.com/walt-disney-world-history.htm |title=Walt Disney World History |website=www.wdwmagic.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920235120/https://www.wdwmagic.com/walt-disney-world-history.htm |archive-date=September 20, 2018 |access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisney continued to focus its talents on television throughout the 1950s.

The men were told that the study would last six months, but in the end it continued for 40 years.<ref name=\"timeline\" />  After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they were only being studied and would not be treated. Facing insufficient participation, the Macon County Health Department nevertheless wrote to subjects to offer them a \"last chance\" to get a special \"treatment\", which was not a treatment at all, but a spinal tap administered exclusively for diagnostic purposes.<ref name=\"Brandt\" />  None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with [[penicillin]] even after the antibiotic had been proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control]], the men were told they were being treated for \"bad blood\"\u2014a colloquialism describing various conditions such as fatigue, [[anemia]], and syphilis\u2014which was a leading cause of death among southern African-American men.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nThe 40-year study became a textbook example of poor [[medical ethics]] because researchers had knowingly withheld treatment with [[penicillin]] and because the subjects had been misled concerning the purposes of the study.

An attractive stone-built village, there is also a little light industry and a number of new housing developments.\n\nFacilities in the village include a village store and two pubs. It has a primary school and nursery called Kayes First and Nursery School,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kayesfirst.co.uk/kgfl/primary/kayesprimary/site/pages/aboutus |title= About us|publisher=Kayes First and Nursery School|accessdate=}}</ref> which was built in 1862, and was doubled in size in 1981. Kayes First and Nursery School consists of 202 children and 32 staff from Nursery to year 5 (2017 figures). The school is also part of a three tier schooling system with Scissett Middle School and Shelley College (formally Shelley High School).\n\nIt also has a Scout Group which offers access to a number of outdoor activities including archery, target shooting, kayaking and much more.\n\nClayton West is located between the villages of [[High Hoyland]], [[Scissett]] and [[Skelmanthorpe]].\n\nThe river that runs through the village is called the [[River Dearne]] and was part of the [[2007 United Kingdom floods]].\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. The Industrial Revolution had brought a migration of the population to the Dearne Valley where abundant water was available for manufacturers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allsaints-claytonwest.org.uk/Resources/Dr%20Addy%20history.pdf |title=migration|format=PDF|accessdate=}}</ref> so people lived away from the church. Both Clayton West and Scissett had grown so rapidly that there were people still alive in 1873 that could remember the expansion. Although the parish of Scissett had been created in 1839, yet Clayton West remained as a part of High Hoyland.\n\nBy 1865 eleven coal mines existed in the Dearne Valley. The Clayton West village coal mine (pit), \"Park Mill\", closed in 1989, having been somewhat bypassed by the events of the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|UK miners strike (1984-85)]].

They mined using bell pits. A pit was sunk to a depth of 7 meters and worked outward from the bottom of the shaft.  Pits dating back to the 16th century can be seen off Woodhouse Lane.  Evidence of bell pits is also clearly visible in the woodlands around Duke Wood, down the hill from Cliffe Woods,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffewoodsclaytonwest.uk/ |title=Cliffe Woods|accessdate=}}</ref> in Clayton West. Joseph Norton was the owner of a number of mines around the 1870s which he used to mine to produce coal to power his [[textile mill]]s located at Cuttlehurst and in Scissett.  One of these was a mine in Duke Wood.  This shaft still acts as an emergency exit and air vent for the privately owned \"Flacks\" mine, the only mine still operating in the village.\n\nThe village once had a [[Clayton West railway station|railway station]] on a branch line, opening 1 September 1879, branching off the [[Penistone Line]]. However the station along with Skelmanthorpe was closed in January 1983. The [[Kirklees Light Railway]] now runs and operates trains from the former station.\n\nClayton West was occasionally used as a location for Britain's longest running comedy series ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', in which one of the village's former pubs, \"The Shoulder of Mutton\" in Church Lane, features prominently. The village lost its post office in 2010.\n\nAll Saints Church, on Church Lane, dates back to 1875 and is still in use today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allsaints-claytonwest.org.uk/index.html |title=All Saints Church|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref> It belongs to the Diocese of Wakefield. All Saints cost \u00a32,300 to construct between 1872 and 1875. Half of the cost was met by the parish, the other half by WB Beaumont of [[Bretton Hall, West Yorkshire|Bretton Hall]] (later to be [[Wentworth Beaumont, 1st Baron Allendale|Baron Allendale]]), the church's patron and benefactor. All Saints can be seen from many places around the village, the only building with a spire, which houses one bell. The roof slates of the church were last replaced in the earlry 1980's, following a slate appeal when raffle tickets were sold to raise funds for the roof replacement, the spire was also repainted and reclad at this time.  In 2019 the roof is again in need of major restoration.\n\n'''Historical Listings'''\n\nClayton West is listed as [http://opendomesday.org/place/SE2610/clayton-west/ Clayton [West<nowiki>]</nowiki> in the Domesday book] and has been translated as meaning settlement on clayey soil. The settlement had a land value attributed to the Lord of \u00a31 in 1066. Plough land is also listed as being two, with other resources listed as woodland, one half times one half leagues.  The Lord in 1066 is stated to be [http://opendomesday.org/name/58630/alsi-son-of-karski/ Alsi, son of Karski].

The de Lacy family took part in the Norman Conquest of Briton and there is evidence that Ilbert fought at William's side at Hastings.\n\nListed as Clayton, West, the village featured in \"[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/topographical-dict/england/pp624-626 A Topographical Dictionary of England]\" which was published by [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], London, 1848.  In 1848 the village had 1440 residents and was described as being 1080 acres belonging to various owners.  Mining was listed as the predominant industry, along with the production of silk and worsted goods for clothing.  The account states that many large mills had been constructed in the village for this purpose.\nIn 1848 the four places of worship were listed.\n\nListed as CLAYTON (West), in John Marius Wilson's [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/604 Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales] (1870\u201372). Clayton West is described as a township of the High Hoyland parish with hamlets of Cuttlehurst, Parkmill, Topitt and Spring-Grove.  The village has a post office and comprises 1,098 acres, with real-estate worth \u00a34, 371, \u00a3122 of which are in mines.  The population is now listed as 1,532, with 325 houses.  Woollen manufacture is again listed as a pre-dominant industry.  Chapels are listed for independents (constructed in 1866) and Baptists.\n\nFurther information of the progressing village is delineated in Kelly's 1881 [http://specialcollections.le.ac.uk/cdm/ref/collection/p16445coll4/id/278534 Directory of the West Riding of Yorkshire]. It describes \"Clayton West\" as a township and large village.  The manufacture of fancy woollens, as well as twine and flax spinning seems to be the prevalent industry of the village.  The church of All Saints, constructed in 1875, is now listed along with Congregational, Baptist, New Connexion Methodist, Primitive Methodist and Wesleyan chapels.  Kelly lists the charities for distribution as being  \u00a313 annually . Also mentioned is the un-denominational school (Kaye's First School) built by William and John Kaye esqs., which was erected in 1862, and in 1881 William Priestly was school master.  Capt. Henry Savile is lord of the manor.  The main landowners are listed as W. B. Beaumont esq.,  M.P. W. T. Spencer-Stanhope esq.,  J.P. John Kaye esq.,  J.P. and Thomas Norton esq. J.P. The area occupied by the village is now 1,140 acres with rateable value, \u00a34,548.  The population in 1871 was 1,531.\n\n'''Textile Mills'''\n\nOne such mill, the Spring Grove Mill, still has buildings visible, just off the A636, opposite the Scissett swimming baths building.  Locally is it still known as [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=OPhsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=beanlands+mill+clayton+west&source=bl&ots=pjbnHj8UTL&sig=vdc0FdSrI4SORqG6lnx383NDt30&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0077tw63WAhVnAcAKHdiSAi0Q6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&q=beanlands%20mill%20clayton%20west&f=false Beanlands Mill], named after the Beanland family who purchased the business in 1869 from Charles Walker for \u00a38,500.  The mill stopped operating as such in 1975, and the mill chimney has since been removed along with other biludings.  [http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/gallery/look-down-tmill-archive-pictures-9130617 Pictures of the Mill are available].\n\n'''War Memorial'''\n\nThe village has an obelisk style [http://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/29204 war memorial], now situated at the junction of Church Lane with Holmfield Road.  The memorial commemorates 37 people, 30 from the First World War, six from the Second World War and one from the Falklands War.  The war memorial used to be located on the grass triangle at Hill Top.\n\n'''Flooding'''\n\nIn 2007 [https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/beta/flooding-and-drainage/pdf/SurfaceWaterManagement.pdf severe flooding] of the river Dearne affected some 420 properties in Clayton West and Skelmanthorpe.  Summer flooding has also occurred in the area in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2008.  The textile industry history of the area has resulted in modern-day conversions of old [[textile mill]] to become residential accommodation.  The valley floor also has a high density of residential properties making these areas more prone to flooding.\n\n'''Future Development'''\n\n[https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/beta/planning-policy/pdf/examination/site-specific/Clayton_West_Representation_and_Supporting_Information.pdf Plans], dated December 2016, are available detailing proposed developments by the Clayton West Development Company Ltd (CWDCL), who are promoting the development of green belt land at the north eastern edge of Clayton West.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Clayton West}}\n*[http://www.claytonwestscouts.org.uk/ Clayton West Scouts]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205095203/http://www.leytransport.i12.com/clayw.htm The Clayton West Branch Line website]\n*[http://www.kayesfirst.co.uk/kgfl/primary/kayesprimary]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in West Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Geography of Kirklees]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Clayton, West Yorkshire}}\n{{Short description|Village in West Yorkshire, England}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2018}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country                  = England\n|static_image             = Clayton West railway station in 1979.jpg\n|static_image_caption     = Clayton West station platform 1979\n|coordinates              = {{coord|53.5951|-1.6106|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name            = Clayton West\n|map_type                 = West Yorkshire\n|population               = \n|metropolitan_borough     = [[Kirklees]]\n|metropolitan_county      = [[West Yorkshire]]\n|region                   = Yorkshire and the Humber\n|constituency_westminster = [[Dewsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Dewsbury]]\n|post_town                =       \n|postcode_district        = HD8\n|postcode_area            = HD\n|dial_code                = 01484\n|os_grid_reference        = \n}}\n'''Clayton West''' is a village in [[Kirklees]], [[West Yorkshire]], England.

Chapels are listed for independents (constructed in 1866) and Baptists.\n\nFurther information of the progressing village is delineated in Kelly's 1881 [http://specialcollections.le.ac.uk/cdm/ref/collection/p16445coll4/id/278534 Directory of the West Riding of Yorkshire]. It describes \"Clayton West\" as a township and large village.  The manufacture of fancy woollens, as well as twine and flax spinning seems to be the prevalent industry of the village.  The church of All Saints, constructed in 1875, is now listed along with Congregational, Baptist, New Connexion Methodist, Primitive Methodist and Wesleyan chapels.  Kelly lists the charities for distribution as being  \u00a313 annually . Also mentioned is the un-denominational school (Kaye's First School) built by William and John Kaye esqs., which was erected in 1862, and in 1881 William Priestly was school master.  Capt. Henry Savile is lord of the manor.  The main landowners are listed as W. B. Beaumont esq.,  M.P. W. T. Spencer-Stanhope esq.,  J.P. John Kaye esq.,  J.P. and Thomas Norton esq. J.P. The area occupied by the village is now 1,140 acres with rateable value, \u00a34,548.  The population in 1871 was 1,531.\n\n'''Textile Mills'''\n\nOne such mill, the Spring Grove Mill, still has buildings visible, just off the A636, opposite the Scissett swimming baths building.  Locally is it still known as [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=OPhsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=beanlands+mill+clayton+west&source=bl&ots=pjbnHj8UTL&sig=vdc0FdSrI4SORqG6lnx383NDt30&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0077tw63WAhVnAcAKHdiSAi0Q6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&q=beanlands%20mill%20clayton%20west&f=false Beanlands Mill], named after the Beanland family who purchased the business in 1869 from Charles Walker for \u00a38,500.  The mill stopped operating as such in 1975, and the mill chimney has since been removed along with other biludings.  [http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/gallery/look-down-tmill-archive-pictures-9130617 Pictures of the Mill are available].\n\n'''War Memorial'''\n\nThe village has an obelisk style [http://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/29204 war memorial], now situated at the junction of Church Lane with Holmfield Road.  The memorial commemorates 37 people, 30 from the First World War, six from the Second World War and one from the Falklands War.  The war memorial used to be located on the grass triangle at Hill Top.\n\n'''Flooding'''\n\nIn 2007 [https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/beta/flooding-and-drainage/pdf/SurfaceWaterManagement.pdf severe flooding] of the river Dearne affected some 420 properties in Clayton West and Skelmanthorpe.  Summer flooding has also occurred in the area in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2008.  The textile industry history of the area has resulted in modern-day conversions of old [[textile mill]] to become residential accommodation.  The valley floor also has a high density of residential properties making these areas more prone to flooding.\n\n'''Future Development'''\n\n[https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/beta/planning-policy/pdf/examination/site-specific/Clayton_West_Representation_and_Supporting_Information.pdf Plans], dated December 2016, are available detailing proposed developments by the Clayton West Development Company Ltd (CWDCL), who are promoting the development of green belt land at the north eastern edge of Clayton West.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Clayton West}}\n*[http://www.claytonwestscouts.org.uk/ Clayton West Scouts]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205095203/http://www.leytransport.i12.com/clayw.htm The Clayton West Branch Line website]\n*[http://www.kayesfirst.co.uk/kgfl/primary/kayesprimary]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in West Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Geography of Kirklees]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Typo fixing, replaced: runs though  \u2192  runs through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_West"}
