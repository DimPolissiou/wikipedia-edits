The [[Clive Churchill Medal]] was awarded to Raiders five-eighth [[Jack Wighton]] as the game's man of the match, while retiring Roosters halfback [[Cooper Cronk]] became the first player since the [[Parramatta Eels]] of 1981-83 to be involved in three straight premiership victories.<ref group=N>[[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], [[Brett Kenny]], [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]], [[Steve Edge (rugby league)|Steve Edge]], [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Mick Cronin]], [[Steve Ella]], [[Eric Grothe Sr.|Eric Grothe]], [[Paul Taylor (rugby league)|Paul Taylor]] and [[Steve Sharp (rugby league)|Steve Sharp]] were present in all three of Parramatta's premiership wins.</ref> The Grand Final was the last to be held at ANZ Stadium before its temporary closure for renovations.<ref>[https://www.anzstadium.com.au/footer/news-and-media/2018/nsw-government-confirms-810-million-redevelopment-of-anz-stadium-into-world-class-rectangular-stadium/ NSW Government confirms $810 million redevelopment of ANZ stadium into world class rectangular stadium] ANZ Stadium 29 March 2018</ref> \n\nThe match was preceded by the 2019 [[NRL State Championship]] and the 2019 [[NRL Women's Premiership]] Grand Final. Pre-match entertainment was headlined by American pop rock band [[OneRepublic]]; [[Natalie Bassingthwaighte]] performed the [[Australian National Anthem]]. The match was broadcast live throughout Australia by the [[Nine Network]].\n\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|2019 NRL season}}It was the first time the [[Sydney Roosters]] and the [[Canberra Raiders]] contested an NRL Premiership. Having defeated the [[Melbourne Storm|Storm]] in the [[2018 NRL Grand Final|2018 Grand Final]], the Roosters aimed to become the first team since the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in 1992-93 to win consecutive premierships in a unified competition. The Raiders broke the longest grand final drought in the league by appearing in their first grand final since their 36\u201312 win over the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] in [[1994 NSWRL season|1994]]. [[Trent Robinson]] coached his third grand final in his seventh year coaching the Roosters. [[Ricky Stuart]] coached his first grand final in his sixth year coaching the Raiders, it was Stuart's fourth grand final as a coach, after coaching the Roosters in the [[2002 NRL Grand Final|2002]], [[2003 NRL Grand Final|2003]] and [[2004 NRL Grand Final|2004]] grand finals.\n\nThe Roosters and Raiders finished second and fourth on the premiership ladder respectively. Both sides lost their final home and away games in round 25. The sides faced each other twice during the season, with the Roosters winning both games, a 30\u201324 win at [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]] in round 9, and a 22\u201318 win at [[Canberra Stadium|GIO Stadium]] in round 21. Both teams defeated the first-placed [[Melbourne Storm]] and third-placed [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] to progress to the grand final. The Raiders, playing at [[Melbourne]]'s [[Melbourne Rectangular Stadium|AAMI Park]], defeated the Storm 12\u201310 in the first qualifying final. The Roosters, playing at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], defeated the Rabbitohs 30\u20136 in the second qualifying final, (after losing to them twice during the home and away rounds). Earning a direct passage to the preliminary finals in week 3 of the finals series, Canberra, earning a home preliminary final at [[Canberra]]'s GIO Stadium, defeated the Rabbitohs 16\u201310 in front of a sold out crowd of 26,567 to become the first team to qualify for the grand final. The Roosters then defeated the Melbourne Storm 14\u20136 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a 2018 Grand Final rematch.\n\n== Teams ==\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_b  = _Vwhitered \n | pattern_sh = \n | pattern_so = _red_midband_color\n | pattern_la = _red_hoop\n | pattern_ra = _red_hoop\n | body       = 00305E\n | shorts     = FFFFFF\n | socks      = 00305E\n | title      = Sydney\n |leftarm     = 00305E\n |rightarm    = 00305E\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n | pattern_sh = \n | pattern_so =_whitetop \n | pattern_la = \n | pattern_ra = \n | body       = 32CD32\n | shorts     = FFFFFF\n | socks      = 32CD32\n | title      = Canberra\n |leftarm     = 32CD32\n |rightarm    = 32CD32\n}}\n|}\n\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" \n|- style=\"background:#f03;\"\n|- style=\"background:#f03;\"\n!  align=\"centre\" style=\"width:170px; border:3px solid red; background:#00305E; color:white\"|Sydney<br>Roosters\n!  style=\"width:120px; text-align:center; background:#eee; color:black;\"|Position\n!  align=\"centre\" style=\"width:170px; border:3px solid blue; background:LimeGreen; color:white\"|Canberra<br>Raiders\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[James Tedesco]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Fullback\n||[[Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Daniel Tupou]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Wing\n||[[Nick Cotric]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Latrell Mitchell]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Centre\n||[[Jarrod Croker]] (c)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Joseph Manu]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Centre\n||[[Joseph Leilua]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Brett Morris]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Wing\n||[[Jordan Rapana]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Luke Keary]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Five-eighth\n||[[Jack Wighton]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Cooper Cronk]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Halfback\n||[[Aidan Sezer]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Jared Waerea-Hargreaves]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Prop\n||[[Josh Papalii]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Sam Verrills]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Hooker\n||[[Josh Hodgson]] (c)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Isaac Liu]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Prop \n||[[Iosia Soliola|Sia Soliola]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Boyd Cordner]] (c)\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| 2nd Row\n||[[John Bateman (rugby league)|John Bateman]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Mitchell Aubusson]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| 2nd Row\n||[[Elliott Whitehead]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Victor Radley]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Lock\n||[[Joseph Tapine]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Angus Crichton]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange\n||[[Bailey Simonsson]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Nat Butcher]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange\n||[[Emre Guler]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|[[Siosiua Taukeiaho]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange\n||[[Corey Horsburgh]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|[[Jake Friend]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange\n||[[Dunamis Lui]]\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n| [[Trent Robinson]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"|Coach\n||[[Ricky Stuart]]\n|}\n\nSydney Roosters halfback [[Cooper Cronk]] became the first player since [[Ron Coote]] in 1975 to play in nine first grade grand finals. Only [[Norm Provan]] and [[Brian Clay]] have played in more grand finals, with ten apiece. The grand final was also Cronk's final game before his retirement after playing 372 first grade games, 323 of which were for the [[Melbourne Storm]], making him the second most-capped NRL player in the competition's history. [[Brett Morris]], [[Sam Verrills]], [[Angus Crichton]], [[Nat Butcher]] were the only new additions to the Roosters'  grand final winning squad from the previous year. For the Canberra Raiders, all but one of their players played in their first NRL grand final, with centre [[Joseph Leilua]] having last played for the Roosters in the [[2010 NRL Grand Final|2010 Premiership decider]]. Second-row forward [[John Bateman (rugby league)|John Bateman]] has the most first grade grand final experience amongst the Canberra squad, having played in four [[Super League]] grand finals for the [[Wigan Warriors]], winning two titles in [[2016 Super League Grand Final|2016]] and [[2018 Super League Grand Final|2018]].\n==== Officials ====\nThe officiating team, comprising two referees, two touch judges, two review officials and a stand-by in each position is given below.

The match was broadcast live throughout Australia by the [[Nine Network]].\n\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|2019 NRL season}}It was the first time the [[Sydney Roosters]] and the [[Canberra Raiders]] contested an NRL Premiership. Having defeated the [[Melbourne Storm|Storm]] in the [[2018 NRL Grand Final|2018 Grand Final]], the Roosters aimed to become the first team since the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in 1992-93 to win consecutive premierships in a unified competition. The Raiders broke the longest grand final drought in the league by appearing in their first grand final since their 36\u201312 win over the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] in [[1994 NSWRL season|1994]]. [[Trent Robinson]] coached his third grand final in his seventh year coaching the Roosters. [[Ricky Stuart]] coached his first grand final in his sixth year coaching the Raiders, it was Stuart's fourth grand final as a coach, after coaching the Roosters in the [[2002 NRL Grand Final|2002]], [[2003 NRL Grand Final|2003]] and [[2004 NRL Grand Final|2004]] grand finals.\n\nThe Roosters and Raiders finished second and fourth on the premiership ladder respectively. Both sides lost their final home and away games in round 25. The sides faced each other twice during the season, with the Roosters winning both games, a 30\u201324 win at [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]] in round 9, and a 22\u201318 win at [[Canberra Stadium|GIO Stadium]] in round 21. Both teams defeated the first-placed [[Melbourne Storm]] and third-placed [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] to progress to the grand final. The Raiders, playing at [[Melbourne]]'s [[Melbourne Rectangular Stadium|AAMI Park]], defeated the Storm 12\u201310 in the first qualifying final. The Roosters, playing at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], defeated the Rabbitohs 30\u20136 in the second qualifying final, (after losing to them twice during the home and away rounds). Earning a direct passage to the preliminary finals in week 3 of the finals series, Canberra, earning a home preliminary final at [[Canberra]]'s GIO Stadium, defeated the Rabbitohs 16\u201310 in front of a sold out crowd of 26,567 to become the first team to qualify for the grand final. The Roosters then defeated the Melbourne Storm 14\u20136 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a 2018 Grand Final rematch.\n\n== Teams ==\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_b  = _Vwhitered \n | pattern_sh = \n | pattern_so = _red_midband_color\n | pattern_la = _red_hoop\n | pattern_ra = _red_hoop\n | body       = 00305E\n | shorts     = FFFFFF\n | socks      = 00305E\n | title      = Sydney\n |leftarm     = 00305E\n |rightarm    = 00305E\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n | pattern_sh = \n | pattern_so =_whitetop \n | pattern_la = \n | pattern_ra = \n | body       = 32CD32\n | shorts     = FFFFFF\n | socks      = 32CD32\n | title      = Canberra\n |leftarm     = 32CD32\n |rightarm    = 32CD32\n}}\n|}\n\n{| style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" \n|- style=\"background:#f03;\"\n|- style=\"background:#f03;\"\n!  align=\"centre\" style=\"width:170px; border:3px solid red; background:#00305E; color:white\"|Sydney<br>Roosters\n!  style=\"width:120px; text-align:center; background:#eee; color:black;\"|Position\n!  align=\"centre\" style=\"width:170px; border:3px solid blue; background:LimeGreen; color:white\"|Canberra<br>Raiders\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[James Tedesco]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Fullback\n||[[Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Daniel Tupou]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Wing\n||[[Nick Cotric]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Latrell Mitchell]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Centre\n||[[Jarrod Croker]] (c)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Joseph Manu]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Centre\n||[[Joseph Leilua]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Brett Morris]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"| Wing\n||[[Jordan Rapana]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Luke Keary]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Five-eighth\n||[[Jack Wighton]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Cooper Cronk]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Halfback\n||[[Aidan Sezer]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Jared Waerea-Hargreaves]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Prop\n||[[Josh Papalii]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Sam Verrills]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Hooker\n||[[Josh Hodgson]] (c)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Isaac Liu]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Prop \n||[[Iosia Soliola|Sia Soliola]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Boyd Cordner]] (c)\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| 2nd Row\n||[[John Bateman (rugby league)|John Bateman]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Mitchell Aubusson]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| 2nd Row\n||[[Elliott Whitehead]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Victor Radley]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Lock\n||[[Joseph Tapine]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Angus Crichton]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange\n||[[Bailey Simonsson]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n||[[Nat Butcher]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange\n||[[Emre Guler]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|[[Siosiua Taukeiaho]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange\n||[[Corey Horsburgh]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|[[Jake Friend]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"| Interchange\n||[[Dunamis Lui]]\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n| [[Trent Robinson]]\n|  style=\"background:#eee;\"|Coach\n||[[Ricky Stuart]]\n|}\n\nSydney Roosters halfback [[Cooper Cronk]] became the first player since [[Ron Coote]] in 1975 to play in nine first grade grand finals. Only [[Norm Provan]] and [[Brian Clay]] have played in more grand finals, with ten apiece. The grand final was also Cronk's final game before his retirement after playing 372 first grade games, 323 of which were for the [[Melbourne Storm]], making him the second most-capped NRL player in the competition's history. [[Brett Morris]], [[Sam Verrills]], [[Angus Crichton]], [[Nat Butcher]] were the only new additions to the Roosters'  grand final winning squad from the previous year. For the Canberra Raiders, all but one of their players played in their first NRL grand final, with centre [[Joseph Leilua]] having last played for the Roosters in the [[2010 NRL Grand Final|2010 Premiership decider]]. Second-row forward [[John Bateman (rugby league)|John Bateman]] has the most first grade grand final experience amongst the Canberra squad, having played in four [[Super League]] grand finals for the [[Wigan Warriors]], winning two titles in [[2016 Super League Grand Final|2016]] and [[2018 Super League Grand Final|2018]].\n==== Officials ====\nThe officiating team, comprising two referees, two touch judges, two review officials and a stand-by in each position is given below.

Four minutes in to the game, a Raiders kick hit a Rooster's trainer, disrupting the play. This was not the first time an event like this occurred, but a renewed conversation about on-field trainers was sparked due to the high match viewership. Even more controversially, an incorrect call by the refs that was corrected mid-play, but without some of the players hearing, ended a Raiders scoring opportunity. The match refs were criticised harshly as a result, with betting company [[Sportsbet.com.au|Sportsbet]] offering refunds to everyone that bet on a Raiders victory.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{2019 in rugby league}}\n{{NRL grand finals}}\n\n[[Category:2019 NRL season|Grand Final]]\n[[Category:NRL Grand Finals]]\n[[Category:September 2019 sports events in Australia|NRL Grand Final]]\n", "name_user": "ThatOneAussie", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_NRL_Grand_Final"}

The town lies in [[Ulster]], near the border with [[County Fermanagh]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. The town is on the main [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 road]] that links [[Dublin]] (to the south) with [[Enniskillen]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Donegal Town]] (to the north).\n\n==History==\n===Gaelic Cavan 1300-1607===\n\n[[File:Cavan Towne Map 1591.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Cavan town from 1591 showing its market square and the O'Reilly castle on Tullymongan Hill]]\nCavan was founded by the clan leader and Lord of [[East Breifne]], Giolla \u00cdosa Ruadh O\u2019Reilly, between 1300 and his death in 1330. During his lordship, a [[Franciscan]] [[Priory|friary]] was established close to the O\u2019Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at the centre of the settlement close to a crossing over the river and to the town\u2019s marketplace. The friary\u2019s location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).\n\nThe O'Reillys later built a new castle in the late fourteenth century on Tullymongan Hill, overlooking the town centre. In the 15th century, the local ruler, Bearded Owen O'Reilly, expanded the town marketplace which attracted merchants from [[Dublin]] and [[Drogheda]]. The phrase \"life of Reilly\" is believed to derive from the great wealth and power of the O'Reilly clans, some of which came from their market. They also allowed counterfeit English and Scottish coins to be minted in their territory at this time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Kieran|title=The Ui Raghallaigh Lordship of East Breifne c.1250-.c. 1450|journal=Brefne|year=1992|volume=2|series=8|page=415}}</ref> \n\n===Early Modern History===\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]] granted the town a charter in 1610.

This was lined with comfortable town houses, public buildings (such as [[Cavan Courthouse]] which dates from 1824) and churches. From the mid-19th century, Cavan became an important rail junction for the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] (MGWR) and those of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR). The Town Hall was built in 1908\u20131909.\n===20th Century===\n\nIn 1938, work began on the [[Cavan Cathedral|Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim]], the main church of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Diocese of Kilmore (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Kilmore]]. Five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) south-west of Cavan Town, on the [[Regional roads in Ireland|R]]198, is the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Kilmore Cathedral]], which contains a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] doorway dating from the 12th century, reputed originally to have come from Trinity Abbey, located a short distance away upon Trinity Island in [[Lough Oughter]]. Most of the [[Neo-gothic architecture|neo-Gothic]] Kilmore Cathedral was built in the late nineteenth century. A short distance from Kilmore Cathedral is the [[See (religion)|See]] House, a late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style house constructed in the 1830s. This house, designed by [[William Farrell (architect)|William Farrell]], was formerly the official residence (or \"Bishop's Palace\") of the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]].\n\nOn 23 February 1943, a [[Cavan Orphanage Fire|fire at St Joseph's Orphanage]] in the town claimed the lives of 35 children and an elderly woman. A [[public inquiry]] found no culpability on the part of the nuns who ran the orphanage, but the circumstances surrounding the high death toll in the fire remain controversial to this day.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's darkest day|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=23 February 2007}}</ref> The secretary of the Commission of Enquiry, Brian O'Nolan, is better known to posterity as the writer [[Flann O'Brien]]. He certainly felt that the Commission had not found the truth.\n\nThe former Cavan Town [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] Barracks was demolished in 1968. Its successor stood on the corner of Farnham Street (also known as Casement Street, named after [[Sir Roger Casement]]) and Abbey Street. The current [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] Station is further along Farnham Street, just across from the Courthouse.\n\nAdjacent to the Courthouse is the Cavan Central Library building constructed in 2006. The entrance is dominated by an aquarium, with commissioned [[bog-wood|bog oak]] sculptures by local artist Joey Burns that portray Cavan history. An arts feature based on ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' enriches the interior space, and two large paintings by award-winning author PJ Lynch were commissioned by Cavan Library Service, in a lasting tribute to [[Jonathan Swift]] and to Cavan where ''Gulliver's Travels'' was written.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Cavan town expanded rapidly with extensive urban regeneration and suburban expansion. It is the main economic hub of the north central part of Ireland and has an extensive range of financial services, legal, medical, industrial and retail enterprises. Liberty Insurance Ireland, Obelisk Group and CG Power Systems Ireland are a number of major national and international companies whose head offices are located within the environs of the town.\n\n==Cavan Town Hall==\n[[File:Town Hall, Cavan Town, County Cavan, Ireland - geograph.org.uk - 336451.jpg|thumb|The Town Hall located in Market Street, Cavan]]\nThe [[Town Hall]] was designed by [[William Alphonsus Scott|William A.

Smith, the Chairman of Cavan Urban District Council at that time. The relatively small and unostentatious Town Hall, located on Townhall Street, is built of [[sandstone]] from a quarry at Latt, on the northern edge of Cavan Town, while the original [[slate]]s came from near [[Carrick-on-Suir]] in [[County Tipperary]].<ref name=\"Parker 2012\"/> The building appears to be designed and built in a version of the [[Arts and Crafts architecture|Arts and Crafts]] style of architecture. It underwent significant redecoration and refurbishment in the 1980s, under the direction of Cavan architect Philip Cullivan. Each March, since 1946, the Town Hall has played host to the Cavan International Drama Festival, a competition which has always drawn the finest in amateur drama. After the abolition of Cavan Town Council left the building empty in 2014, the building reopened in 2015 as the local arts centre, under the name 'Townhall Cavan'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|title=About Us - Townhall Cavan Arts Space|website=www.townhallcavan.ie|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115002856/http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nThe town is located on the junction of two national routes, the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] to [[Dublin]] and [[N55 road|N55]] to [[Athlone]]. The National Development Plan provides for a major upgrading of the route with an M3 motorway from [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] to [[Dublin]] (completed and officially opened on 4 June 2010) and [[2+2 road|type 2 dual carriageway]] from Whitegate on the Meath border to Cavan, which will eventually bypass Virginia too. The N3 and N55 eastern [[bypass route|bypass]] around Cavan town was fully completed in March 2006, eliminating the need for heavy traffic to pass through an already congested town.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Cavan churches.jpg|thumb|View of Cavan [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Cathedral (spire on the right) and the [[Church of Ireland]] Parish Church (spire on the left)]]\n[[File:Cavan centre.jpg|thumb|Cavan town centre]]\n[[File:Cavan courthouse.jpg|thumb|[[Cavan Courthouse]]]]\n\nAlthough Cavan has no railway links today, there were once two railway stations on separate lines, linking the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) and [[Midland Great Western Railway]], then an end junction of the Belfast-Cavan route linking [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] with a branch line to Crossdoney and [[Killeshandra]]. With the Cavan-Dublin route, via Inny Junction, [[Longford]] and [[Mullingar]] on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]]. There is an old railway line running through [[Kingscourt]] on the border of County Meath; this line is now overgrown.\n\nA branch of the [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]] was also indirectly linked to Cavan town via [[Belturbet]] (the C&L terminus) and [[Ballyhaise]] on the GNR line. When the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] closed the section of the Belfast line from [[Portadown]] to [[Glaslough]] in 1957, it was found to be uneconomical to keep running the rump section from Monaghan to Cavan. All these lines (including the Cavan and Leitrim Railway) were closed by 1960. The (GNR) Virginia Road Station, from 1863 to 1958 serviced the Drogheda and Navan extension route to Kells and Oldcastle. Cooperation between the Cavan and Westmeath county councils is striving to integrate this into the national and regional development plan. [[Cavan railway station]] opened on 8 July 1856, closed for passenger services on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cavan station | work=Railscot \u2013 Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=16 September 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302022802/http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | archivedate=2 March 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\nCavan's bus station is owned and operated by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buseireann.ie/|title=Bus \u00c9ireann - View Ireland Bus and Coach Timetables & Buy Tickets|website=www.buseireann.ie|access-date=2016-12-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130235044/http://www.buseireann.ie/|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Bus \u00c9ireann]] and is located on [[Baron Farnham|Farnham]] Street.

During his lordship, a [[Franciscan]] [[Priory|friary]] was established close to the O\u2019Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at the centre of the settlement close to a crossing over the river and to the town\u2019s marketplace. The friary\u2019s location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).\n\nThe O'Reillys later built a new castle in the late fourteenth century on Tullymongan Hill, overlooking the town centre. In the 15th century, the local ruler, Bearded Owen O'Reilly, expanded the town marketplace which attracted merchants from [[Dublin]] and [[Drogheda]]. The phrase \"life of Reilly\" is believed to derive from the great wealth and power of the O'Reilly clans, some of which came from their market.

This was lined with comfortable town houses, public buildings (such as [[Cavan Courthouse]] which dates from 1824) and churches. From the mid-19th century, Cavan became an important rail junction for the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] (MGWR) and those of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR). The Town Hall was built in 1908\u20131909.\n===20th Century===\n\nIn 1938, work began on the [[Cavan Cathedral|Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim]], the main church of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Diocese of Kilmore (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Kilmore]]. Five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) south-west of Cavan Town, on the [[Regional roads in Ireland|R]]198, is the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Kilmore Cathedral]], which contains a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] doorway dating from the 12th century, reputed originally to have come from Trinity Abbey, located a short distance away upon Trinity Island in [[Lough Oughter]]. Most of the [[Neo-gothic architecture|neo-Gothic]] Kilmore Cathedral was built in the late nineteenth century. A short distance from Kilmore Cathedral is the [[See (religion)|See]] House, a late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style house constructed in the 1830s. This house, designed by [[William Farrell (architect)|William Farrell]], was formerly the official residence (or \"Bishop's Palace\") of the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]].\n\nOn 23 February 1943, a [[Cavan Orphanage Fire|fire at St Joseph's Orphanage]] in the town claimed the lives of 35 children and an elderly woman. A [[public inquiry]] found no culpability on the part of the nuns who ran the orphanage, but the circumstances surrounding the high death toll in the fire remain controversial to this day.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's darkest day|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=23 February 2007}}</ref> The secretary of the Commission of Enquiry, Brian O'Nolan, is better known to posterity as the writer [[Flann O'Brien]]. He certainly felt that the Commission had not found the truth.\n\nThe former Cavan Town [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] Barracks was demolished in 1968. Its successor stood on the corner of Farnham Street (also known as Casement Street, named after [[Sir Roger Casement]]) and Abbey Street. The current [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] Station is further along Farnham Street, just across from the Courthouse.\n\nAdjacent to the Courthouse is the Cavan Central Library building constructed in 2006. The entrance is dominated by an aquarium, with commissioned [[bog-wood|bog oak]] sculptures by local artist Joey Burns that portray Cavan history. An arts feature based on ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' enriches the interior space, and two large paintings by award-winning author PJ Lynch were commissioned by Cavan Library Service, in a lasting tribute to [[Jonathan Swift]] and to Cavan where ''Gulliver's Travels'' was written.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Cavan town expanded rapidly with extensive urban regeneration and suburban expansion. It is the main economic hub of the north central part of Ireland and has an extensive range of financial services, legal, medical, industrial and retail enterprises. Liberty Insurance Ireland, Obelisk Group and CG Power Systems Ireland are a number of major national and international companies whose head offices are located within the environs of the town.\n\n==Cavan Town Hall==\n[[File:Town Hall, Cavan Town, County Cavan, Ireland - geograph.org.uk - 336451.jpg|thumb|The Town Hall located in Market Street, Cavan]]\nThe [[Town Hall]] was designed by [[William Alphonsus Scott|William A. Scott]] (1871-1921), the well-known Dublin-based architect from [[Drogheda]], for the then Cavan Urban District Council.<ref name=\"Parker 2012\">Parker, Dr. Ciar\u00e1n, 'Cavan Urban District Council \u2013 A Brief Look Back' in Scott, Dr. Brendan (Ed.), ''Cavan Town, 1610\u20132010: A Brief History''. Cavan Town Council, Cavan, 2012.</ref> The hall was constructed between November 1908 and late 1909, with it being officially opened on Wednesday, 19 January 1910.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's Town Hall Ball|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=12 January 2007}}</ref> The building was officially opened by Mrs. Henrietta Smith (who also laid the foundation stone), wife of [[Councillor]] Louis C.P. Smith, the Chairman of Cavan Urban District Council at that time. The relatively small and unostentatious Town Hall, located on Townhall Street, is built of [[sandstone]] from a quarry at Latt, on the northern edge of Cavan Town, while the original [[slate]]s came from near [[Carrick-on-Suir]] in [[County Tipperary]].<ref name=\"Parker 2012\"/> The building appears to be designed and built in a version of the [[Arts and Crafts architecture|Arts and Crafts]] style of architecture. It underwent significant redecoration and refurbishment in the 1980s, under the direction of Cavan architect Philip Cullivan. Each March, since 1946, the Town Hall has played host to the Cavan International Drama Festival, a competition which has always drawn the finest in amateur drama. After the abolition of Cavan Town Council left the building empty in 2014, the building reopened in 2015 as the local arts centre, under the name 'Townhall Cavan'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|title=About Us - Townhall Cavan Arts Space|website=www.townhallcavan.ie|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115002856/http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nThe town is located on the junction of two national routes, the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] to [[Dublin]] and [[N55 road|N55]] to [[Athlone]]. The National Development Plan provides for a major upgrading of the route with an M3 motorway from [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] to [[Dublin]] (completed and officially opened on 4 June 2010) and [[2+2 road|type 2 dual carriageway]] from Whitegate on the Meath border to Cavan, which will eventually bypass Virginia too. The N3 and N55 eastern [[bypass route|bypass]] around Cavan town was fully completed in March 2006, eliminating the need for heavy traffic to pass through an already congested town.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Cavan churches.jpg|thumb|View of Cavan [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Cathedral (spire on the right) and the [[Church of Ireland]] Parish Church (spire on the left)]]\n[[File:Cavan centre.jpg|thumb|Cavan town centre]]\n[[File:Cavan courthouse.jpg|thumb|[[Cavan Courthouse]]]]\n\nAlthough Cavan has no railway links today, there were once two railway stations on separate lines, linking the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) and [[Midland Great Western Railway]], then an end junction of the Belfast-Cavan route linking [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] with a branch line to Crossdoney and [[Killeshandra]]. With the Cavan-Dublin route, via Inny Junction, [[Longford]] and [[Mullingar]] on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]]. There is an old railway line running through [[Kingscourt]] on the border of County Meath; this line is now overgrown.\n\nA branch of the [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]] was also indirectly linked to Cavan town via [[Belturbet]] (the C&L terminus) and [[Ballyhaise]] on the GNR line. When the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] closed the section of the Belfast line from [[Portadown]] to [[Glaslough]] in 1957, it was found to be uneconomical to keep running the rump section from Monaghan to Cavan. All these lines (including the Cavan and Leitrim Railway) were closed by 1960. The (GNR) Virginia Road Station, from 1863 to 1958 serviced the Drogheda and Navan extension route to Kells and Oldcastle. Cooperation between the Cavan and Westmeath county councils is striving to integrate this into the national and regional development plan. [[Cavan railway station]] opened on 8 July 1856, closed for passenger services on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cavan station | work=Railscot \u2013 Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=16 September 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302022802/http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | archivedate=2 March 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\nCavan's bus station is owned and operated by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buseireann.ie/|title=Bus \u00c9ireann - View Ireland Bus and Coach Timetables & Buy Tickets|website=www.buseireann.ie|access-date=2016-12-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130235044/http://www.buseireann.ie/|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Bus \u00c9ireann]] and is located on [[Baron Farnham|Farnham]] Street.

Ismail Kurdumeri (who is No31 in chain). After Ismail Kurdumeri the chain has split in two as he had two Ma'zuns, i.e. Muhammad Salih Shirwani (No32) and Khas Muhammad Shirwani. From Khas Muhammad Shirwani the chain goes to Muhammad Yaraghi ad-Daghestani, from him to Jamaluddin Kumuki ad-Daghestani, who had three Ma'zuns, i.e. Mamadibir ar-Rochi ad-Daghestani, [[Imam Shamil]] ad-Daghestani (both had no Ma'zun), and `Abdurrahman as-Sughuri ad-Daghestani. According to Shuaib Afandi Bagini ad-Daghestani, `Abdurrahman as-Sughuri had two ma'zuns, i.e. Muhammad Haji `Obodi ad-Daghestani and Ilyas Tsudakhari ad-Daghestani (d1312 AH). Both had no ma'zuns, and thus the split chain coming from Khas Muhammad Shirwani has ended here. However, there were many dubious Shaykhs, such as Sharafuddin ad-Daghestani, Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani and others who claim to have received Naqshbandi permission in their dream, or by special spiritual experience (rawhani), etc.\n\nThe chain from Muhammad Salih Shirwani (No32) dates back to Mahmud Afandi, Hasan Hilmi Afandi and the rest of the Daghestani Ma'zuns uninterrupted, as can be

Naqshbandi Chain, as different from all other Sufi lineages, is unique in that it stems from the first [[Rashidun|Caliph]], [[Abu Bakr]]. From Abu Bakr, the secret of this transmission was then passed to [[Salman the Persian]], then to [[Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr|Qasim bin Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]]. From Qasim the transmission passed to [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. From as-Sadiq, the transmission passed to later [[sheikh]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://naqshbandi.org/golden-chain/the-chain/|title=The Chain {{!}} The Naqshbandiyya Nazimiyya Sufi Order of America:

Ismail Kurdumeri (who is No31 in chain). After Ismail Kurdumeri the chain has split in two as he had two Ma'zuns, i.e. Muhammad Salih Shirwani (No32) and Khas Muhammad Shirwani. From Khas Muhammad Shirwani the chain goes to Muhammad Yaraghi ad-Daghestani, from him to Jamaluddin Kumuki ad-Daghestani, who had three Ma'zuns, i.e. Mamadibir ar-Rochi ad-Daghestani, [[Imam Shamil]] ad-Daghestani (both had no Ma'zun), and `Abdurrahman as-Sughuri ad-Daghestani. According to Shuaib Afandi Bagini ad-Daghestani, `Abdurrahman as-Sughuri had two ma'zuns, i.e. Muhammad Haji `Obodi ad-Daghestani and Ilyas Tsudakhari ad-Daghestani (d1312 AH). Both had no ma'zuns, and thus the split chain coming from Khas Muhammad Shirwani has ended here. However, there were many dubious Shaykhs, such as Sharafuddin ad-Daghestani, Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani and others who claim to have received Naqshbandi permission in their dream, or by special spiritual experience (rawhani), etc.\n\nThe chain from Muhammad Salih Shirwani (No32) dates back to Mahmud Afandi, Hasan Hilmi Afandi and the rest of the Daghestani Ma'zuns uninterrupted, as can be
