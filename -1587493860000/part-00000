This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find the new situation relieving.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. The episodes should have a balance so that the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation people would not pay attention to everything at the same time. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According Trussell the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]] lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], [[The Last Unicorn]], Liquid Television; Aeon Flux and [[David Lynch]] was a big influence in how when you watch [[Twin Peak]].<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that somewhat was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a livestream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service. Throughout the livestream, small portions of the episodes were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Surrealism]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Mike L.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. The episodes should have a balance so that the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation people would not pay attention to everything at the same time. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According Trussell the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]] lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], [[The Last Unicorn]], Liquid Television; Aeon Flux and [[David Lynch]] was a big influence in how when you watch [[Twin Peak]].<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that somewhat was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of the promotional action for series, Netflix launched on April 19, 2020 on its YouTube channel a live with a countdown to series. Throughout the live, small portions of the episode were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Prince Silversaddle", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor fixes.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

It was released as the third [[single (music)|single]] from the album in October 1994 by [[EMI Latin]]. \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" was written by [[Ricky Vela]], and production was handled by Selena's brother [[A.B. Quintanilla]]. A [[tempo|downtempo]] [[mariachi]] and [[pop ballad]], \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" portrays the [[ranchera]] storyline of a woman in agony after the end of a relationship. Its lyrics express an [[unrequited love]], the singer wishing the best for her former lover and his new partner.\n\nPraised by [[music journalism|music critics]] for its emotive nature, \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" was one of the most successful singles of Selena's career. It topped the United States [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart for seven non-consecutive weeks, her third successive number-one song. It was Selena's first number-one track on the US [[Regional Mexican Airplay]] chart, and became [[Billboard Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart|the most successful US Latin single of 1995]]. It has been ranked the ninth-best [[Tejano music|Tejano]] recording by ''Billboard'' magazine and the eleventh-best Hot Latin Songs chart single in 2011.\n\nThe [[music video]] for \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" was shot in [[San Antonio]]'s [[Amtrak]] station. It received the Music Video of the Year award at the [[Billboard Latin Music Awards|''Billboard'' Latin Music Awards]], and the recording received two [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|Broadcast Music]] honors including Song of the Year. Many musicians have since recorded [[cover version]]s, including Mexican singer [[Pepe Aguilar]], American salsa singer [[Tito Nieves]], and Mexican pop group Palomo. The Palomo version peaked at number six on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart, while Nieves' version reached number seven on the US [[Tropical Songs]] chart.\n\n==Inspiration, writing and production==\nIn 1985, [[Ricky Vela]] joined [[Selena y Los Dinos]] as their [[keyboardist]].{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=62}} Although Vela was attracted to the group's drummer, [[Suzette Quintanilla]], he kept his feelings to himself.<ref name=\"hotlatinartists\">{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Erika|title=Hot Latin Songs Top Artists|journal=Billboard|date=October 8, 2011|volume=123|issue=35|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jim-YANOn5AC&pg=RA1-PA20&dq=No+Me+Queda+Mas+Ricky+Vela#v=onepage&q=No%20Me%20Queda%20Mas%20Ricky%20Vela&f=false|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref> When he confessed his feelings to Suzette's brother, group manager [[Abraham Quintanilla, III]], he began teasing him about it.<ref name=\"hotlatinartists\"/> After Suzette's September 1993 marriage,{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=111}} Vela wrote \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" and it was given to Selena to record for ''[[Amor Prohibido]]''.<ref name=\"hotlatinartists\"/> Selena's brother [[A.B.

It was released as the third [[single (music)|single]] from the album in October 1994 by [[EMI Latin]]. \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" was written by [[Ricky Vela]], and production was handled by Selena's brother [[A.B. Quintanilla]]. A [[tempo|downtempo]] [[mariachi]] and [[pop ballad]], \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" portrays the [[ranchera]] storyline of a woman in agony after the end of a relationship. Its lyrics express an [[unrequited love]], the singer wishing the best for her former lover and his new partner.\n\nPraised by [[music journalism|music critics]] for its emotive nature, \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" was one of the most successful singles of Selena's career. It topped the United States [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart for seven non-consecutive weeks, her third successive number-one song. It was Selena's first number-one track on the US [[Regional Mexican Airplay]] chart, and became [[Billboard Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart|the most successful US Latin single of 1995]]. It has been ranked the ninth-best [[Tejano music|Tejano]] recording by ''Billboard'' magazine and the eleventh-best Hot Latin Songs chart single in 2011.\n\nThe [[music video]] for \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" was shot in [[San Antonio]]'s [[Amtrak]] station. It received the Music Video of the Year award at the [[Billboard Latin Music Awards|''Billboard'' Latin Music Awards]], and the recording received two [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|Broadcast Music]] honors including Song of the Year. Many musicians have since recorded [[cover version]]s, including Mexican singer [[Pepe Aguilar]], American salsa singer [[Tito Nieves]], and Mexican pop group Palomo. The Palomo version peaked at number six on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart, while Nieves' version reached number seven on the US [[Tropical Songs]] chart.\n\n==Inspiration, writing and production==\nIn 1985, [[Ricky Vela]] joined [[Selena y Los Dinos]] as their [[keyboardist]].{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=62}} Although Vela was attracted to the group's drummer, [[Suzette Quintanilla]], he kept his feelings to himself.<ref name=\"hotlatinartists\">{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Erika|title=Hot Latin Songs Top Artists|journal=Billboard|date=October 8, 2011|volume=123|issue=35|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jim-YANOn5AC&pg=RA1-PA20&dq=No+Me+Queda+Mas+Ricky+Vela#v=onepage&q=No%20Me%20Queda%20Mas%20Ricky%20Vela&f=false|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref> When he confessed his feelings to Suzette's brother, group manager [[Abraham Quintanilla, III]], he began teasing him about it.<ref name=\"hotlatinartists\"/> After Suzette's September 1993 marriage,{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=111}} Vela wrote \"No Me Queda M\u00e1s\" and it was given to Selena to record for ''[[Amor Prohibido]]''.<ref name=\"hotlatinartists\"/> Selena's brother [[A.B.

After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as [[Erich Ludendorff]] suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: [[Dolchsto\u00dflegende]]). In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda, which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in 1933. Historian [[Robert Ensor]] explains that \"Hitler...puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny.\"<ref>Robert Ensor in David Thomson, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: volume XII The Era of Violence 1890\u20131945'' (1st edition 1960), p 84.</ref> Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]].

In the years following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films (e.g. the 1925 film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' glorifies [[Communist]] ideals.) In WWII, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the [[Sudetenland]] and attacking Poland. The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of [[totalitarian]] states and the [[Second World War]], are arguably the \"Golden Age of Propaganda\". [[Leni Riefenstahl]], a filmmaker working in [[Nazi Germany]], created one of the best-known propaganda movies, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In the US, [[American Animation in World War II|animation]] became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g.,''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1942), which ridicules [[Hitler]] and advocates the value of freedom.

Literally translated from the [[Latin]] [[gerundive]] as \"things that must be disseminated\", in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term \"propaganda\" can also vary over time. For example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the [[Southern Cone]], the word \"propaganda\" usually refers to the most common manipulative media&nbsp;\u2013 \"advertising\".\n\n[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Poster of the 19th-century [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist]] movement]]\nIn English, ''propaganda'' was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, representing the intentional dissemination of often false, but certainly \"compelling\" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies. According to [[Harold Lasswell]], the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the [[Committee on Public Information|Creel Committee]] in the United States and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in Britain: Writing in 1928, Lasswell observed, \"In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm, for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends. The outcry in the United States against Mr. Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information (or 'Inflammation') helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed. ... The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it. Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate, and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as 'public relations council,' 'specialist in public education,' 'public relations adviser.' \"<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2378152|last1 = Lasswell|first1 = Harold D.|title = The Function of the Propagandist|journal = International Journal of Ethics|volume = 38|issue = 3|pages = 258\u2013268|year = 1928|doi = 10.1086/intejethi.38.3.2378152}} pp. 260\u2013261</ref> In 1949, political science professor Dayton David McKean wrote, \"After World War I the word came to be applied to 'what you don\u2019t like of the other fellow\u2019s publicity,' as Edward L.

Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term: \"Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for [[ideology|ideological]], political or commercial purposes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/wwii-propaganda-private-snafu-flashback|title=This WWII Cartoon Taught Soldiers How to Avoid Certain Death|last=McNearney|first=Allison|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels.\"<ref>Richard Alan Nelson, ''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'' (1996) pp. 232\u2013233</ref> The definition focuses on the communicative process involved \u2013 or more precisely, on the purpose of the process, and allow \"propaganda\" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener. \n\nAccording to historian [[Zbyn\u011bk Zeman]], propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins<ref name=\"new\">{{cite book|title=Selling the War|publisher=Orbis Publishing|first=Zbynek|last=Zeman|date=1978|isbn=978-0-85613-312-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sellingwarartpro0000zema}}</ref> (compare with [[black operation]], a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported.\n<!-- [[File:Edith Cavell propaganda.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of British nurse [[Edith Cavell#Role in World War I propaganda|Edith Cavell]] by the German Army in 1915 was a major theme of [[World War I]] anti-German propaganda.]] -->\n\nThe propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group. Propaganda, in this sense, serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved, not by filling people's minds with approved information, but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view. What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding. The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue, but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda.\n\n[[File:The Papal Belvedere.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Woodcuts (1545) know as the ''Papstspotbilder'' or ''Depictions of the Papacy'' in English,<ref name=Oberman>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_leG5ztYoZwC&pg=PA61|title=The Impact of the Reformation: Essays|first=Heiko Augustinus|last=Oberman|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Wm.

The latter pejoratively call these NRMs [[cult]]s. [[Anti-cult movement|Anti-cult activists]] and [[Christian countercult movement|Christian countercult activists]] accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them. Some social scientists, such as the late Jeffrey Hadden, and [[CESNUR]] affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of \"cults\" and the [[anti-cult movement]] of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Religious Movements Page: Conceptualizing \"Cult\" and \"Sect\" | url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207042448/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archivedate=7 February 2006 | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Polish Anti-Cult Movement (Koscianska) \u2013 CESNUR | url=http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/riga2000/koscianska.htm | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Wartime===\n[[File:AntiJapanesePropagandaTakeDayOff.png|thumb|upright|left|A US Office for War Information poster uses [[stereotype]]d imagery to encourage Americans to work hard to contribute to the war effort]]\n\nPost\u2013World War II usage of the word \"propaganda\" more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas.\n\nPropaganda is a powerful weapon in war; it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy, either internal or external, by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens. This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms (e.g., the racist terms \"Jap\" and \"gook\" used during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively), avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities. Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice, which may be fictitious or may be based on facts (e.g., the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania]] by the German Navy in World War I). The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just. In NATO doctrine, propaganda is defined as \"Any information, ideas, doctrines, or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion, emotions, attitudes, or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly.\"<ref>North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency Aap-6 \u2013  Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.</ref> Within this perspective, information provided does not need to be necessarily false, but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the \"actor\" or \"system\" that performs it.\n\nPropaganda is also one of the methods used in [[psychological warfare]], which may also involve [[false flag]] operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation (e.g., The [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings). The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes (e.g., During the First World War, the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army, and women to work in the country's industry. The propaganda posters were used, because radios and TVs were not very common at that time.).<ref>Callanan, James D. The Evolution of The CIA's Covert Action Mission, 1947\u20131963. Durham University. 1999.</ref> The assumption is that, if people believe something false, they will constantly be assailed by doubts. Since these doubts are unpleasant (see [[cognitive dissonance]]), people will be eager to have them extinguished, and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power. For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented. This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select \"agreeable\" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations.\n\n[[File:Britannialion.jpg|thumb|[[Britannia (emblem)|Britannia]] arm-in-arm with [[Uncle Sam]] symbolizes the British-American alliance in [[World War I]].]]\n\nPropaganda may be administered in insidious ways. For instance, disparaging [[disinformation]] about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system. Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school, such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents, thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a \"well-known fact\", even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source. The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system, without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media. Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals: by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country, they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others.\n\nIn the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin, who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic. On the other hand, the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing.<ref>Karel C.

That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero.

On the other hand, advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news. These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light, primarily meant to persuade rather than inform. Normally they use only subtle [[propaganda techniques]] and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements. If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item, the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily \"believed\" or \"internalized\". Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of \"covert\" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda, which is misleading. Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement.\n\n===Politics===\nPropaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with [[public information]] campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]], posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other [[Mass media|medium]]. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of '''overt propaganda''') and what the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as \"covert propaganda\".\n\nRoderick Hindery argues<ref>https://propagandaandcriticalthought.com/author/rhindery/</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Hindery | first=Roderick | title=Indoctrination and self-deception or free and critical thought | publisher=E.

Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking \"what is or is not propaganda?\" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda, indoctrination, and terrorism/[[counterterrorism]].

[[Software agent]]s or [[Internet bot|bots]] can be used for many things, including populating [[social media]] with [[Media manipulation|automated messages]] and posts with a range of sophistication. During the 2016 U.S. election a cyber-strategy was implemented using bots to direct US voters to Russian political news and information sources, and to spread politically motivated rumors and false news stories. At this point it is considered commonplace contemporary political strategy around the world to implement bots in achieving political goals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Philip N.|last2=Woolley|first2=Samuel|last3=Calo|first3=Ryan|date=2018-04-03|title=Algorithms, bots, and political communication in the US 2016 election: The challenge of automated political communication for election law and administration|journal=Journal of Information Technology & Politics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=81\u201393|doi=10.1080/19331681.2018.1448735|issn=1933-1681|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{details|Propaganda techniques}}\n\n[[File:Anti-capitalism color.gif|right|upright|thumb|[[Anti-Capitalism|Anti-capitalist]] propaganda]]\n\nCommon media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports, government reports, historical revision, [[junk science]], books, leaflets, [[propaganda film|movies]], radio, television, and posters. Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to [[indoctrinate]] the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission, such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. (as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals). The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to [[opinion leader]] through indoctrination.<ref>Garth S. Jowett and Victoria J.: O'Donnell, ''Propaganda & Persuasion'' (5th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\nA number of techniques based in [[social psychology|social psychological]] research are used to generate propaganda. Many of these same techniques can be found under [[Fallacy|logical fallacies]], since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.\n\nSome time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted. That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with ''propagandistic messages''. Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. <!-- Commented out: Below are a number of techniques for generating propaganda: [[File:Destroy the old world Cultural Revolution poster.png|right|thumb|Chinese propaganda to urge people to \"destroy the old world, forge the new world,\" referring to the cultural aspects acceptable and unacceptable by the country's [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], 1966.]] -->\n\nPropaganda can also be turned on its makers.  For example [[postage stamps]] have frequently been tools for government advertising, such as [[North Korea]]'s extensive issues.<ref>[https://qz.com/1017141/north-koreas-america-hating-postage-stamps-are-mini-masterpieces-of-anti-imperialist-propaganda/ North Korea\u2019s America-hating postage stamps are mini masterpieces of anti-imperialist propaganda]</ref>  The presence of [[Stalin]] on numerous Soviet stamps is another example.<ref>[https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/184/199 Stalin on Stamps and other Philatelic Materials:Design, Propaganda, Politics]</ref>  During the [[Third Reich]] [[Hitler]] frequently appeared on postage stamps in Germany and some of the occupied nations.

Social psychologists can be [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociologists]] or [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychologists]]. The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion. For example, communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors (e.g., the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication), influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them. Nobel Prize\u2013winning psychologist [[Herbert A. Simon]] won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are [[cognitive miser]]s. That is, in a society of mass information, people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially, as opposed to logically.\n\nAccording to [[William W. Biddle]]'s 1931 article \"A psychological definition of propaganda\", \"[t]he four principles followed in propaganda are: (1) rely on emotions, never argue; (2) cast propaganda into the pattern of \"we\" versus an \"enemy\"; (3) reach groups as well as individuals; (4) hide the propagandist as much as possible.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/h0074944 |title = A psychological definition of propaganda|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume = 26|issue = 3|pages = 283\u2013295|year = 1931|last1 = Biddle|first1 = W.

The theory postulates five general classes of \"filters\" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media: [[Ownership]] of the medium, the medium's Funding, Sourcing of the news, [[Propaganda model#Flak|Flak]], and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ideology.\n\nThe first three (ownership, funding, and sourcing) are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. Although the model was based mainly on the characterization of United States media, Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles the [[model (abstract)|model]] postulates as the cause of [[media bias]].\n\n=== Self-propaganda ===\n[[Self-propaganda]] is a form of propaganda that refers to the act of an individual convincing them-self of something, no matter how irrational that idea may be.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQE9rD5X0m4C&lpg=PA242&dq=%22self%20propaganda%22&pg=PA242#v=onepage&q=%22self%20propaganda%22&f=false|title=A Mask for Privilege: Anti-Semitism in America|date=1949|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-1615-1|language=en}}</ref> Self propaganda makes it easier for individuals to justify their own actions as well as the actions of others.

Only love builds and, strongly loving Brazil, you will lead it to the greatest of destinies among Nations, fulfilling the desires of exaltation nestled in every Brazilian heart.\"]]\n\nOf all the potential targets for propaganda, children are the most vulnerable because they are the least prepared with the critical reasoning and contextual comprehension they need to determine whether a message is propaganda or not. The attention children give their environment during development, due to the process of developing their understanding of the world, causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately. Also, children are highly imitative: studies by [[Albert Bandura]], [[Dorothea Ross]] and [[Sheila A. Ross]] in the 1960s indicated that, to a degree, [[socialization]], formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of [[indoctrination]]. The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany in the form of the [[Hitler Youth]].\n\n[[John Taylor Gatto]] asserts that modern schooling in the USA is designed to \"dumb us down\" in order to turn children into material suitable to work in factories. This ties into the Herman and Chomsky thesis of [[Political positions of Noam Chomsky#Criticism of United States government|rise of Corporate Power]], and its use in creating educational systems which serve its purposes against those of democracy.\n\n===Anti-Semitic propaganda for children===\nIn [[Nazi]] Germany, the education system was thoroughly co-opted to indoctrinate the German youth with [[anti-Semitic]] ideology.

After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as [[Erich Ludendorff]] suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: [[Dolchsto\u00dflegende]]). In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda, which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in 1933. Historian [[Robert Ensor]] explains that \"Hitler...puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny.\"<ref>Robert Ensor in David Thomson, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: volume XII The Era of Violence 1890\u20131945'' (1st edition 1960), p 84.</ref> Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]].

In the years following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films (e.g. the 1925 film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' glorifies [[Communist]] ideals.) In WWII, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the [[Sudetenland]] and attacking Poland. The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of [[totalitarian]] states and the [[Second World War]], are arguably the \"Golden Age of Propaganda\". [[Leni Riefenstahl]], a filmmaker working in [[Nazi Germany]], created one of the best-known propaganda movies, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In the US, [[American Animation in World War II|animation]] became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g.,''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1942), which ridicules [[Hitler]] and advocates the value of freedom.

Literally translated from the [[Latin]] [[gerundive]] as \"things that must be disseminated\", in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term \"propaganda\" can also vary over time. For example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the [[Southern Cone]], the word \"propaganda\" usually refers to the most common manipulative media&nbsp;\u2013 \"advertising\".\n\n[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Poster of the 19th-century [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist]] movement]]\nIn English, ''propaganda'' was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, representing the intentional dissemination of often false, but certainly \"compelling\" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies. According to [[Harold Lasswell]], the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the [[Committee on Public Information|Creel Committee]] in the United States and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in Britain: Writing in 1928, Lasswell observed, \"In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm, for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends. The outcry in the United States against Mr. Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information (or 'Inflammation') helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed. ... The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it.

Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term: \"Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for [[ideology|ideological]], political or commercial purposes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/wwii-propaganda-private-snafu-flashback|title=This WWII Cartoon Taught Soldiers How to Avoid Certain Death|last=McNearney|first=Allison|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels.\"<ref>Richard Alan Nelson, ''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'' (1996) pp. 232\u2013233</ref> The definition focuses on the communicative process involved \u2013 or more precisely, on the purpose of the process, and allow \"propaganda\" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener. \n\nAccording to historian [[Zbyn\u011bk Zeman]], propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins<ref name=\"new\">{{cite book|title=Selling the War|publisher=Orbis Publishing|first=Zbynek|last=Zeman|date=1978|isbn=978-0-85613-312-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sellingwarartpro0000zema}}</ref> (compare with [[black operation]], a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported.\n<!-- [[File:Edith Cavell propaganda.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of British nurse [[Edith Cavell#Role in World War I propaganda|Edith Cavell]] by the German Army in 1915 was a major theme of [[World War I]] anti-German propaganda.]] -->\n\nThe propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group. Propaganda, in this sense, serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved, not by filling people's minds with approved information, but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view. What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding. The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue, but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda.\n\n[[File:The Papal Belvedere.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Woodcuts (1545) know as the ''Papstspotbilder'' or ''Depictions of the Papacy'' in English,<ref name=Oberman>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_leG5ztYoZwC&pg=PA61|title=The Impact of the Reformation: Essays|first=Heiko Augustinus|last=Oberman|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Wm.

The latter pejoratively call these NRMs [[cult]]s.

This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms (e.g., the racist terms \"Jap\" and \"gook\" used during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively), avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities. Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice, which may be fictitious or may be based on facts (e.g., the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania]] by the German Navy in World War I). The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just. In NATO doctrine, propaganda is defined as \"Any information, ideas, doctrines, or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion, emotions, attitudes, or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly.\"<ref>North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency Aap-6 \u2013  Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.</ref> Within this perspective, information provided does not need to be necessarily false, but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the \"actor\" or \"system\" that performs it.\n\nPropaganda is also one of the methods used in [[psychological warfare]], which may also involve [[false flag]] operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation (e.g., The [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings). The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes (e.g., During the First World War, the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army, and women to work in the country's industry. The propaganda posters were used, because radios and TVs were not very common at that time.).<ref>Callanan, James D. The Evolution of The CIA's Covert Action Mission, 1947\u20131963. Durham University. 1999.</ref> The assumption is that, if people believe something false, they will constantly be assailed by doubts. Since these doubts are unpleasant (see [[cognitive dissonance]]), people will be eager to have them extinguished, and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power. For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented. This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select \"agreeable\" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations.\n\n[[File:Britannialion.jpg|thumb|[[Britannia (emblem)|Britannia]] arm-in-arm with [[Uncle Sam]] symbolizes the British-American alliance in [[World War I]].]]\n\nPropaganda may be administered in insidious ways. For instance, disparaging [[disinformation]] about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system. Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school, such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents, thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a \"well-known fact\", even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source. The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system, without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media. Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals: by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country, they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others.\n\nIn the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin, who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic. On the other hand, the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing.<ref>Karel C.

That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero. Only his eyes and famous mustache remained unaltered. Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his \"majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Zhores A.

On the other hand, advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news. These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light, primarily meant to persuade rather than inform. Normally they use only subtle [[propaganda techniques]] and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements. If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item, the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily \"believed\" or \"internalized\". Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of \"covert\" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda, which is misleading. Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement.\n\n===Politics===\nPropaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with [[public information]] campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]], posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other [[Mass media|medium]]. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of '''overt propaganda''') and what the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as \"covert propaganda\".\n\nRoderick Hindery argues<ref>https://propagandaandcriticalthought.com/author/rhindery/</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Hindery | first=Roderick | title=Indoctrination and self-deception or free and critical thought | publisher=E.

Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking \"what is or is not propaganda?\" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda, indoctrination, and terrorism/[[counterterrorism]]. He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself.\n\n[[File:Is this tomorrow.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Anti-communism|Anti-communist]] propaganda in a 1947 comic book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society warning of \"the dangers of a Communist takeover\"]]\n\nSince [[9/11]] and the appearance of greater media fluidity, propaganda institutions, practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain.

[[Software agent]]s or [[Internet bot|bots]] can be used for many things, including populating [[social media]] with [[Media manipulation|automated messages]] and posts with a range of sophistication. During the 2016 U.S. election a cyber-strategy was implemented using bots to direct US voters to Russian political news and information sources, and to spread politically motivated rumors and false news stories.

Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to [[indoctrinate]] the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission, such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. (as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals). The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to [[opinion leader]] through indoctrination.<ref>Garth S. Jowett and Victoria J.: O'Donnell, ''Propaganda & Persuasion'' (5th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\nA number of techniques based in [[social psychology|social psychological]] research are used to generate propaganda. Many of these same techniques can be found under [[Fallacy|logical fallacies]], since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.\n\nSome time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted. That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with ''propagandistic messages''. Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. <!-- Commented out: Below are a number of techniques for generating propaganda: [[File:Destroy the old world Cultural Revolution poster.png|right|thumb|Chinese propaganda to urge people to \"destroy the old world, forge the new world,\" referring to the cultural aspects acceptable and unacceptable by the country's [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], 1966.]] -->\n\nPropaganda can also be turned on its makers.

Social psychologists can be [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociologists]] or [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychologists]]. The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion. For example, communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors (e.g., the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication), influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them. Nobel Prize\u2013winning psychologist [[Herbert A. Simon]] won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are [[cognitive miser]]s. That is, in a society of mass information, people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially, as opposed to logically.\n\nAccording to [[William W. Biddle]]'s 1931 article \"A psychological definition of propaganda\", \"[t]he four principles followed in propaganda are: (1) rely on emotions, never argue; (2) cast propaganda into the pattern of \"we\" versus an \"enemy\"; (3) reach groups as well as individuals; (4) hide the propagandist as much as possible.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/h0074944 |title = A psychological definition of propaganda|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume = 26|issue = 3|pages = 283\u2013295|year = 1931|last1 = Biddle|first1 = W.

The theory postulates five general classes of \"filters\" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media: [[Ownership]] of the medium, the medium's Funding, Sourcing of the news, [[Propaganda model#Flak|Flak]], and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ideology.\n\nThe first three (ownership, funding, and sourcing) are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important.

The attention children give their environment during development, due to the process of developing their understanding of the world, causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately. Also, children are highly imitative: studies by [[Albert Bandura]], [[Dorothea Ross]] and [[Sheila A. Ross]] in the 1960s indicated that, to a degree, [[socialization]], formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of [[indoctrination]]. The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany in the form of the [[Hitler Youth]].\n\n[[John Taylor Gatto]] asserts that modern schooling in the USA is designed to \"dumb us down\" in order to turn children into material suitable to work in factories.

After practicing self-mortification for six years at Urubela (Buddhagaya) in Gaya, he gave up that practice because it did not give him Vimukthi. Then he discovered Noble Eight-fold path without help from anyone and practiced it, then he attained Buddhatva or enlightenment. Enlightenment is a state of being completely free from lust (raga), hatred (dosa) and delusion (moha). By gaining enlightenment, you enter Nirvana, in which the final stage is Parinirvana.\n\nAt this place, the Buddha was abandoned by the five men who had been his companions of earlier austerities. All they saw was an ordinary man; they mocked his well-nourished appearance. \"Here comes the mendicant Gautama,\" they said, \"who has turned away from asceticism. He is certainly not worth our respect.\" When they reminded him of his former vows, the Buddha replied, \"Austerities only confuse the mind. In the exhaustion and mental stupor to which they lead, one can no longer understand the ordinary things of life, still less the truth that lies beyond the senses. I have given up extremes of either luxury or asceticism. I have discovered the Middle Way\". This is the path which is neither easy (a rich prince) nor hard (living in austere conditions practicing self-denial). Hearing this, the five ascetics became the Buddha's first disciples in Deer Park, [[Sarnath]], 13&nbsp;km n.e. of Benares.\n\nThe disciples of Gautama Siddhartha began to visit the place during the full moon in the month of [[Vesak|Vaisakh]] (April\u2013May), as per the [[Hindu calendar]]. Over time, the place became known as Bodh Gaya, the day of enlightenment as [[Buddha Purnima]], and the tree as the Bodhi Tree.\n\nThe history of Bodh Gaya is documented by many inscriptions and pilgrimage accounts. Foremost among these are the accounts of the [[China|Chinese]] pilgrims [[Faxian]] in the 5th century and [[Xuanzang]] in the 7th century. The area was at the heart of a Buddhist civilization for centuries, until it was [[Islamic invasion of India|conquered]] by Turkic armies in the 13th century.\nThe place-name, Bodh Gaya, did not come into use until the 18th century CE.

The circumstances in connection with the Sangh\u0101r\u0101ma are given by [[Xuanzang]] ([[Samuel Beal|Beal]], op. cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself. It was probably here that [[Buddhaghosa]] met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.\n\nSeveral Buddhist temples and monasteries have been built by the people of [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Japan]],  [[Korea]],  [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tibet]] and [[Vietnam]] in a wide area around the Mahabodhi Temple. These buildings reflect the architectural style, exterior and interior decoration of their respective countries. The statue of Buddha in the Chinese temple is 200 years old and was brought from China. Japan's Nippon temple is shaped like a pagoda. The Myanmar (Burmese) temple is also [[pagoda]] shaped and is reminiscent of [[Bagan]]. The Thai temple has a typical sloping, curved roof covered with golden tiles. Inside, the temple holds a massive bronze statue of Buddha. Next to the Thai temple is 25-metre statue of Buddha located within a garden which has existed there for over 100 years.\n\n;Sujata Stupa\nAcross the [[Phalgu]] river is the [[Sujata Stupa]], in the village of [[Bakraur]].

The unveiling and consecration of the Great Buddha Statue took place on November 18, 1989. The consecration ceremony was attended by the XIVth Dalai Lama, who blessed the 25-meter statue, the first great Buddha ever built in the history of India. The Statue is now a symbol of the holy place Bodhgaya, next to Mahabohdi Temple which is a World Heritage site, and enjoys constant visits of pilgrims from all over the world. Among local people, it is nicknamed \"the 80-foot (25-meter) Buddha Statue.\"\n\nUnder the slogan \"Spread Buddha's rays to the Whole World,\" Daijokyo spent seven years on construction of the Great Buddha Statue, mobilizing 120,000 masons in total. The greatest driving force for this massive project was the pure heart of people, who wish for further expansion of Buddhism from the holy place Bodhgaya, as well as for the realization of world peace.

After practicing self-mortification for six years at Urubela (Buddhagaya) in Gaya, he gave up that practice because it did not give him Vimukthi. Then he discovered Noble Eight-fold path without help from anyone and practiced it, then he attained Buddhatva or enlightenment. Enlightenment is a state of being completely free from lust (raga), hatred (dosa) and delusion (moha). By gaining enlightenment, you enter Nirvana, in which the final stage is Parinirvana.\n\nAt this place, the Buddha was abandoned by the five men who had been his companions of earlier austerities. All they saw was an ordinary man; they mocked his well-nourished appearance. \"Here comes the mendicant Gautama,\" they said, \"who has turned away from asceticism. He is certainly not worth our respect.\" When they reminded him of his former vows, the Buddha replied, \"Austerities only confuse the mind. In the exhaustion and mental stupor to which they lead, one can no longer understand the ordinary things of life, still less the truth that lies beyond the senses. I have given up extremes of either luxury or asceticism. I have discovered the Middle Way\". This is the path which is neither easy (a rich prince) nor hard (living in austere conditions practicing self-denial). Hearing this, the five ascetics became the Buddha's first disciples in Deer Park, [[Sarnath]], 13&nbsp;km n.e. of Benares.\n\nThe disciples of Gautama Siddhartha began to visit the place during the full moon in the month of [[Vesak|Vaisakh]] (April\u2013May), as per the [[Hindu calendar]]. Over time, the place became known as Bodh Gaya, the day of enlightenment as [[Buddha Purnima]], and the tree as the Bodhi Tree.\n\nThe history of Bodh Gaya is documented by many inscriptions and pilgrimage accounts. Foremost among these are the accounts of the [[China|Chinese]] pilgrims [[Faxian]] in the 5th century and [[Xuanzang]] in the 7th century. The area was at the heart of a Buddhist civilization for centuries, until it was [[Islamic invasion of India|conquered]] by Turkic armies in the 13th century.\nThe place-name, Bodh Gaya, did not come into use until the 18th century CE. Historically, it was known as Uruvela, Sambodhi ([[File:Sambodhi inscription.jpg|40px]]Sa\u1e43+[[bodhi]], \u201cComplete Enlightenment\u201d in [[Ashoka]]'s [[Major Rock Edict|Major Rock Edict No.8]]),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Juergensmeyer |first1=Mark |last2=Roof |first2=Wade Clark |title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion |date=2011 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781452266565 |page=148 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA148 |language=en}}</ref> Vajrasana (the \"[[Diamond Throne]]\" of the Buddha) or Mahabodhi (\"Great Enlightenment\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/pilgrim/pg_histbg.htm |title=A History of Bodh Gaya by Venerable S.

The circumstances in connection with the Sangh\u0101r\u0101ma are given by [[Xuanzang]] ([[Samuel Beal|Beal]], op. cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself. It was probably here that [[Buddhaghosa]] met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.\n\nSeveral Buddhist temples and monasteries have been built by the people of [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Japan]],  [[Korea]],  [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tibet]] and [[Vietnam]] in a wide area around the Mahabodhi Temple. These buildings reflect the architectural style, exterior and interior decoration of their respective countries. The statue of Buddha in the Chinese temple is 200 years old and was brought from China. Japan's Nippon temple is shaped like a pagoda. The Myanmar (Burmese) temple is also [[pagoda]] shaped and is reminiscent of [[Bagan]]. The Thai temple has a typical sloping, curved roof covered with golden tiles. Inside, the temple holds a massive bronze statue of Buddha. Next to the Thai temple is 25-metre statue of Buddha located within a garden which has existed there for over 100 years.\n\n;Sujata Stupa\nAcross the [[Phalgu]] river is the [[Sujata Stupa]], in the village of [[Bakraur]]. The stupa was dedicated to the [[milkmaid]] [[Sujata (milkmaid)|Sujata]], who is said to have fed [[Gautama Buddha]] milk and rice as he was sitting under a [[Banyan tree]], ending his seven years of fasting and [[ascetism]], and allowing him to attain illumination through the [[Middle Way]].<ref name=prasoon07>{{cite book |last1=Prasoon|first1=Shrikant |title=Knowing Buddha : [life and teachings] |date=2007 |publisher=Hindoology Books|location=[Delhi] |isbn=9788122309638 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us9wbjmvXfgC&pg=PT32}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Planet |first1=Lonely |last2=Blasi |first2=Abigail |title=Lonely Planet India |date=2017 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=9781787011991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLU7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1251 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=dwivedi06>{{cite book |last1=Dwivedi |first1=Sunita |last2=Lama |first2=Dalai (foreword) |authorlink2=14th Dalai Lama |title=Buddhist heritage sites of India|date=2006 |publisher=Rupa & Co. |location=New Delhi |isbn=8129107384}}</ref> The stupa was built in the 2nd century BCE as confirmed by finds of black polished wares and punch-marked coins in the attending monastery.<ref name=DGS>{{cite book |last1=Geary |first1=David |last2=Sayers |first2=Matthew R. |last3=Amar |first3=Abhishek Singh |title=Cross-disciplinary Perspectives on a Contested Buddhist Site: Bodh Gaya Jataka |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136320675 |pages=35\u201336 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f56437oiblUC&pg=PA35|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==The Great Buddha Statue==\n\nThe Great Buddha Statue also known as 80 feet statue is in Bodhgaya. The unveiling and consecration of the Great Buddha Statue took place on November 18, 1989. The consecration ceremony was attended by the XIVth Dalai Lama, who blessed the 25-meter statue, the first great Buddha ever built in the history of India. The Statue is now a symbol of the holy place Bodhgaya, next to Mahabohdi Temple which is a World Heritage site, and enjoys constant visits of pilgrims from all over the world. Among local people, it is nicknamed \"the 80-foot (25-meter) Buddha Statue.\"\n\nUnder the slogan \"Spread Buddha's rays to the Whole World,\" Daijokyo spent seven years on construction of the Great Buddha Statue, mobilizing 120,000 masons in total. The greatest driving force for this massive project was the pure heart of people, who wish for further expansion of Buddhism from the holy place Bodhgaya, as well as for the realization of world peace. We Daijokyo believers shall never forget this fact.\n\n==Mahabodhi Temple Serial Blasts==\n{{See also|Bodh Gaya bombings}}\n[[File:Pipal tree temple of Bodh Gaya depicted in Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the temple built by [[Asoka]] at Bodh-Gaya around the Bodhi tree.
