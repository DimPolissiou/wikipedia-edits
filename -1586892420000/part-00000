Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely resemble other [[badger]] species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to [[weasel]]s. It is primarily a [[carnivorous]] species and has few natural [[predator]]s because of its thick skin, strength and ferocious defensive abilities.

[[Surplus killing]] is common during these events, with one incident resulting in the death of 17 [[Muscovy duck]]s and 36 [[chicken]]s.<ref name=\"r117\" />\n\nBecause of the toughness and looseness of their skin, honey badgers are very difficult to kill with dogs. Their skin is hard to penetrate, and its looseness allows them to twist and turn on their attackers when held. The only safe grip on a honey badger is on the back of the neck. The skin is also tough enough to resist several [[machete]] blows.

She is fascinated by the human world above. She ventures out with her best friend [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flounder|Flounder]] to collect human artifacts in her [[grotto]] and often goes to the surface of the ocean to visit [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Scuttle|Scuttle]], a seagull who offers inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She swims back to Atlantica and is watched by two eels named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flotsam and Jetsam|Flotsam and Jetsam]] under orders from [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]] the sea witch. Ariel ignores the warnings of her father [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#King Triton|King Triton]], the ruler of Atlantica, and [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Sebastian|Sebastian]], a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact with humans is forbidden.\n\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder, and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the surface to watch a celebration for [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]]'s birthday on a ship. Ariel instantly falls in love with Eric. Shortly afterward, a violent storm arrives, which wrecks the ship and tosses Eric overboard. Ariel rescues him and brings him to shore. She sings to him but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find the girl who saved and sang to him; Ariel vows to find a way to join him in his world. Noticing a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Triton confronts Ariel in her grotto and destroys the artifacts she collected with his trident. After Triton leaves, Ariel begins weeping. Flotsam and Jetsam convince her to visit Ursula.\n\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \"kiss of true love\" from Eric to remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel accepts and is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Unbeknownst to Ariel, Ursula, who harbors a secret vendetta against King Triton, plans to use her as a bargaining chip and take over the kingdom. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at Ariel's near success, Ursula disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel and marry Vanessa instead.\n\nThe next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who immediately pursues the wedding barge. While Sebastian informs Triton, Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. Through all of the commotion the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck breaks, which restores Ariel's voice back to her and breaks Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula then reveals herself and kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release. However, the deal is inviolable; Triton makes a new deal to take Ariel's place as Ursula's servant by giving up his trident in order to save his daughter. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the new ruler, but before she can use the trident, Ariel confronts Ursula and attacks her, and Eric intervenes with a harpoon and hurts Ursula. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes and causes Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. As Ariel hurries to join Eric, the enraged Ursula uses the trident to grow to a monstrous size.\n\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface just before Ursula grows past and towers over them. She then gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. As Ursula is about to destroy Ariel with the trident, Eric steers a wrecked ship and kills Ursula by impaling her with its splintered [[bowsprit]]. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in Ursula's garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel loves Eric, Triton changes her from a mermaid into a human permanently and approves her marriage to Eric. At the wedding, Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Little Mermaid characters}}\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Princess Ariel]], the 16-year-old mermaid princess of Atlantica who is fascinated with humans, especially Prince Eric.<ref name=\"DisneyChar\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters (Third Edition)|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998|pages=344\u2013345|isbn=0-7868-6336-6}}</ref>\n:* Benson also voices Vanessa, Ursula's human alter ego\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]], a human prince saved by Ariel and is determined to find and marry her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2014|title=The-Little-Mermaid \u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715022533/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast|archive-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]], a sea witch who stole Ariel's voice and is determined to ruin her attempts to get Eric to love her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" />\n* [[Samuel E.

However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''Oliver & Company'' as more immediate releases.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> In 1987, songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] became involved with the writing and development of ''The Little Mermaid'' after he was asked to contribute a song to ''Oliver & Company''. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this.

One of the film's most prominent songs, \"[[Part of Your World]]\", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with an audience of school children, who became rowdy during the scene.

Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the popular song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" nearly being cut from 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' when it was appealing to Katzenberg.

She is fascinated by the human world above. She ventures out with her best friend [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flounder|Flounder]] to collect human artifacts in her [[grotto]] and often goes to the surface of the ocean to visit [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Scuttle|Scuttle]], a seagull who offers inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She swims back to Atlantica and is watched by two eels named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flotsam and Jetsam|Flotsam and Jetsam]] under orders from [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]] the sea witch. Ariel ignores the warnings of her father [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#King Triton|King Triton]], the ruler of Atlantica, and [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Sebastian|Sebastian]], a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact with humans is forbidden.\n\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder, and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the surface to watch a celebration for [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]]'s birthday on a ship. Ariel instantly falls in love with Eric. Shortly afterward, a violent storm arrives, which wrecks the ship and tosses Eric overboard. Ariel rescues him and brings him to shore. She sings to him but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find the girl who saved and sang to him; Ariel vows to find a way to join him in his world. Noticing a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Triton confronts Ariel in her grotto and destroys the artifacts she collected with his trident. After Triton leaves, Ariel begins weeping. Flotsam and Jetsam convince her to visit Ursula.\n\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \"kiss of true love\" from Eric to remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel accepts and is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Unbeknownst to Ariel, Ursula, who harbors a secret vendetta against King Triton, plans to use her as a bargaining chip and take over the kingdom. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at Ariel's near success, Ursula disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel and marry Vanessa instead.\n\nThe next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who immediately pursues the wedding barge. While Sebastian informs Triton, Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. Through all of the commotion the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck breaks, which restores Ariel's voice back to her and breaks Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula then reveals herself and kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release. However, the deal is inviolable; Triton makes a new deal to take Ariel's place as Ursula's servant by giving up his trident in order to save his daughter. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the new ruler, but before she can use the trident, Ariel confronts Ursula and attacks her, and Eric intervenes with a harpoon and hurts Ursula. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes and causes Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. As Ariel hurries to join Eric, the enraged Ursula uses the trident to grow to a monstrous size.\n\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface just before Ursula grows past and towers over them. She then gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. As Ursula is about to destroy Ariel with the trident, Eric steers a wrecked ship and kills Ursula by impaling her with its splintered [[bowsprit]]. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in Ursula's garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel loves Eric, Triton changes her from a mermaid into a human permanently and approves her marriage to Eric. At the wedding, Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Little Mermaid characters}}\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Princess Ariel]], the 16-year-old mermaid princess of Atlantica who is fascinated with humans, especially Prince Eric.<ref name=\"DisneyChar\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters (Third Edition)|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998|pages=344\u2013345|isbn=0-7868-6336-6}}</ref>\n:* Benson also voices Vanessa, Ursula's human alter ego\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]], a human prince saved by Ariel and is determined to find and marry her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2014|title=The-Little-Mermaid \u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715022533/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast|archive-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]], a sea witch who stole Ariel's voice and is determined to ruin her attempts to get Eric to love her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" />\n* [[Samuel E.

Katzenberg passed the project over, because at that time the studio was in development on a sequel to their live-action mermaid comedy ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' (1984) and felt ''The Little Mermaid'' would be too similar a project.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> The next day, however, Katzenberg approved of the idea for possible development, along with ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. While in production in the 1980s, the staff found, by chance, original story and visual development work done by [[Kay Nielsen]] for Disney's proposed 1930s Andersen feature.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen's original story was coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\">(2006) ''Treasures Untold: The Making of Disney's 'The Little Mermaid'' [Documentary featurette]. Bonus material from ''The Little Mermaid: Platinum Edition'' DVD. Walt Disney Home Entertainment.</ref>\n\nThat year Clements and Musker expanded the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating the role of the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''Oliver & Company'' as more immediate releases.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> In 1987, songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] became involved with the writing and development of ''The Little Mermaid'' after he was asked to contribute a song to ''Oliver & Company''. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make ''The Little Mermaid'' a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Ashman and composer [[Alan Menken]], both noted for their work as the writers of the successful [[Off-Broadway]] stage musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', teamed up to compose the entire song score.

One of the film's most prominent songs, \"[[Part of Your World]]\", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with an audience of school children, who became rowdy during the scene. This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements, and Keane. Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the popular song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" nearly being cut from 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' when it was appealing to Katzenberg. Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state.

In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that \"religious duty\" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration \u2014|od|1}}</ref> Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from \"[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]\" groups still practicing polygamy.<ref>{{citation |quote= If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].\n\n==Teachings and practices==\n\n===Authorized texts===\n[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]\nThe theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the \"[[standard works]]\". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as \"the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion\".<ref>{{citation |title= History of the Church |volume= 4 |page= 461|title-link= History of the Church (Joseph Smith) }}</ref>\n\nThe Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be \"the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nAnother source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]].

According to the LDS Humanitarian Center website, it ships about 12 million pounds of shoes and clothing, one million hygiene kits, and one million pounds of medical supplies per year, to relieve suffering in more than 100 countries.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/humanitarian-service/center?lang=eng |title= Humanitarian Services: Latter-day Saint Humanitarian Center |work= churchofjesuschrist.org |publisher= LDS Church}}</ref> When a disaster strikes, the church works with local government officials and other organizations to determine the immediate needs, and sends the necessary supplies and food to the affected area within hours.

In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.\n\nIn the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.\n[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]\n\nAs the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.\n\nAcademic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.\n\n[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.\n\nDuring the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199358229|pages=132\u2013137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Religion Journal; Spiritual Issues Lead Many to the Net | author = Sink, Mindy |work=The New York Times\n | date = September 6, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DB1F38F935A3575AC0A9659C8B63 | accessdate =February 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/some-mormons-search-the-web-and-find-doubt.html|title=Some Mormons Search the Web and Find Doubt|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=20 Jul 2013|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe church's support in 2008 of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] sparked heated debate and protest by gay-rights organizations and others.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Mormons Tipped Scale in Ban on Gay Marriage | author = Jesse McKinley and Kirk Johnson |work=The New York Times | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate =February 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |title=San Diego march for marriage equality draws 20,000 protesters |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |work=Gay & Lesbian Times |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090214121324/http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/california-and-same-sex-marriage |title= Commentary: California and Same-Sex Marriage |date= June 30, 2008 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}</ref> The church expressed support for a Salt Lake City ordinance protecting members of the [[gay community|LGBT community]] against discrimination in employment and housing while allowing religious institutions to consider lifestyles in actions such as hiring or providing university accommodations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705343558/Mormon-Church-backs-protection-of-gay-rights-in-Salt-Lake-City.html |title= Mormon Church Backs Gay Protecting City Ordinances |newspaper= Deseret News |first= Scott |last= Taylor |date= November 10, 2009}}</ref> Further controversy resulted in late 2015, when the church changed its guidance to lay leaders about same-sex unions and about minor children living in the home of a parent in a same-sex relationship, whether natural or adopted.<ref name=SaltLakeTrib>{{cite news|last=Dobner|first=Jennifer|title=New Mormon policy makes apostates of married same-sex couples, bars children from rites|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3144035&itype=CMSID|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=November 6, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref> The policy said that these children should only be baptized after reaching legal age, and only if they did not live with parents who were in a same-sex cohabitation or marriage.

In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that \"religious duty\" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration \u2014|od|1}}</ref> Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from \"[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]\" groups still practicing polygamy.<ref>{{citation |quote= If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].\n\n==Teachings and practices==\n\n===Authorized texts===\n[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]\nThe theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the \"[[standard works]]\". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as \"the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion\".<ref>{{citation |title= History of the Church |volume= 4 |page= 461|title-link= History of the Church (Joseph Smith) }}</ref>\n\nThe Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be \"the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nAnother source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]].

Additionally, Joseph Smith taught that the [[Song of Songs|Songs of Solomon]] \"are not inspired writings\".</ref> the divinity of Jesus, and his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and [[resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrection]].

LDS Church theology includes the belief in a \"[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]\" composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead.

Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.\n\nThe main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith.

In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.\n\nIn the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.\n[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]\n\nAs the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.\n\nAcademic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.\n\n[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.\n\nDuring the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199358229|pages=132\u2013137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}</ref> In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Religion Journal; Spiritual Issues Lead Many to the Net | author = Sink, Mindy |work=The New York Times\n | date = September 6, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DB1F38F935A3575AC0A9659C8B63 | accessdate =February 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/some-mormons-search-the-web-and-find-doubt.html|title=Some Mormons Search the Web and Find Doubt|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=20 Jul 2013|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe church's support in 2008 of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] sparked heated debate and protest by gay-rights organizations and others.<ref>\n{{Citation | title = Mormons Tipped Scale in Ban on Gay Marriage | author = Jesse McKinley and Kirk Johnson |work=The New York Times | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate =February 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |title=San Diego march for marriage equality draws 20,000 protesters |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |work=Gay & Lesbian Times |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090214121324/http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=13532 |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/california-and-same-sex-marriage |title= Commentary: California and Same-Sex Marriage |date= June 30, 2008 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}</ref> The church expressed support for a Salt Lake City ordinance protecting members of the [[gay community|LGBT community]] against discrimination in employment and housing while allowing religious institutions to consider lifestyles in actions such as hiring or providing university accommodations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705343558/Mormon-Church-backs-protection-of-gay-rights-in-Salt-Lake-City.html |title= Mormon Church Backs Gay Protecting City Ordinances |newspaper= Deseret News |first= Scott |last= Taylor |date= November 10, 2009}}</ref> Further controversy resulted in late 2015, when the church changed its guidance to lay leaders about same-sex unions and about minor children living in the home of a parent in a same-sex relationship, whether natural or adopted.<ref name=SaltLakeTrib>{{cite news|last=Dobner|first=Jennifer|title=New Mormon policy makes apostates of married same-sex couples, bars children from rites|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3144035&itype=CMSID|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=November 6, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref> The policy said that these children should only be baptized after reaching legal age, and only if they did not live with parents who were in a same-sex cohabitation or marriage.
