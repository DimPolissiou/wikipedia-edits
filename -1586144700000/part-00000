The existence of artifacts like Roman coins shows Karanataka was involved in trade as early as the 1st century CE. In the 4th century BCE the land was ruled by the Mauryans, and Jainism was very popular. After the Mauryas, parts of Karnataka were variously ruled by dynasties either ethnically Kannadiga or outside. The [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadambas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Hoysala Empire|Holysalas]] were some of the many major Kannada kingdoms and dynasties ruling the region. The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was founded by Kannadiga chieftans, and they were great patrons of Kannada art and literature.\n\nThe Kannada language has written inscriptions since 450 CE. Kannada literature is mostly composed of poems and treatises on religious works. Kannada architecture is dominated by stone-carved sculptured palaces and temples. The ruins of [[Hampi]] are a UNESCO World Heritage site. Kannada music and dance is rich and varied, including both complex .\n\nMost Kannadigas are Hindus, but in rural areas villagers practice [[Dravidian folk religion]] similar to their Tamil neighbours, worshipping many ''gramadevataru'' in addition to the main deities. In addition, many in North Karnataka practice [[Lingayatism]], a religious tradition centred around worship of Shiva. There are also small minorities of Jains, remnants of ancient times, and Christians. [[Cuisine of Karnataka|Kannada cuisine]] is varied, with both non-veg and veg items using numerous spices.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Karnataka}}\n[[File:\u0c95\u0ca6\u0c82\u0cac - \u0ca4\u0cca\u0caf\u0cbf\u0cae\u0ca6\u0cc7\u0cb5.jpg|thumb|right|Gold coins issued by [[Kadamba of Hangal|Kadamba King Toyimadeva]], 1048 - 1075 A.D]] [[File:Hoysala emblem.JPG|thumb|Sala fighting the lion, the royal emblem of [[Hoysala Empire]]|alt=]]Settlement in Karnataka is found to be existent at least from the 2nd millennium BC as explored in [[Brahmagiri archaeological site]] near [[Chitradurga]] district, central Karnataka.

There is also literary evidence that the region of Mysore was called \"Mahisha Mandala\" after the mythological demon Mahishasura. Parashurama and Hanumantha are some epic characters to be cited relating to this place. Hanumantha (Hanuman) is said to be born in Kishkindha, Karnataka.\n\n===Punya Koti===\nOne of the most popular and acknowledged [[Jaanapada]] songs is \"Dharani mandala madhyadolage\" which narrates an incidence between mother cow and an aggressive tiger in a place called Karnataka.\n\n===Vishwa Maanava===\nKarnataka as now can be viewed as a multicultural state \u2013 almost all the religions that can be found in India can be found here and there has been lot immigration as well due to which [[multi-ethnic]] diaspora can be seen. As the kingdoms provided a safe centres for development of all cultures we can see a huge diversities from region to region. Even the language and dialects varies from place to place. The language has evolved distinctly in both the backyard (folk/basic/prakrutha) and frontyard (refined and related to Samskrutha/Sanskrit) of the culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} It can be said that the major works of Sanskrit have originated and continues to evolve here.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Shringeri]], Udupi are some of nerve centres. One of the leading examples include a village near [[Shivamogga]] where people speak only Sanskrit till date.

It is we who make him Alpa Maanava or Little Human by putting various constrictions of borders rituals and castes.

Karnataka has sheltered flood victims of northeastern India like Assam and provided them jobs.

But this was a functionally a failure as there always has been a tug of war from centre and states to an extent that from the 1990s to 2010 there have always been different political parties operating at centre and state. North Karnataka had other problems of getting independence more from Nizams. So there were two spheres. Lack of will and coordination and constant fights have been hallmark of politics which has prevented a regional party/media from arising in the land. [[Kerala]] being a neighbour where hugely successful communist ideology in bringing up literacy levels has a backing here and a few [[naxalite]] outfits function in Karnataka.\n\nFunctional failure of all pillars of democracy even being upper riparian state can be clearly seen in the [[Kaveri River Water Dispute]] issue.

Areas that today comprise Karnataka were under as many as 20 different administrative units with the [[Kingdom of Mysore|princely state of Mysore]], [[Hyderabad state|Nizam's Hyderabad]], the [[Bombay Presidency]], the [[Madras Presidency]] and the territory of [[Kodagu]] being the most important ones. In effect, nearly two-thirds of what is now Karnataka fell outside the rule of the [[Wodeyar|Wodeyar kings of Mysore]]. In addition the proposed state had six neighbours \u2014 [[Goa]], [[Maharashtra]], Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, [[Kerala]] \u2014 and all had Kannadigas along the borders overlapping these regions.\n\nWhat this meant for the Kannadigas in these regions was that they were reduced to linguistic minorities wherever they were. Kannadigas in the Hubli-Karnataka region for example, came under the rule of the Bombay presidency where [[Marathi language|Marathi]] was the official language. Those in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region came under the Nizam's rule where [[Urdu]] ruled, while in Mysore Kingdom, Kannada was the official language.\n\nIt was in this backdrop that the movement that first started as a protest against linguistic oppression, soon morphed into one that began demanding a separate state be created consolidating all Kannada speaking regions. This was essentially a movement that was spearheaded by the poets, journalists and writers and was called the ''Ekikarana'' or 'Unification' movement.\nIndia gained independence in 1947. The joy of independence soon gave way to disappointment as the new government started dragging its feet on ''Karnataka Ekikarana'' movement. Kannada speaking areas now got grouped under five administrative units of the Bombay and Madras provinces, Kodagu, and the princely states of Mysore and Hyderabad. The ''Akhila Karnataka Ekikarana Parishat'' met in [[Kasaragod Town|Kasargod]] and reiterated the demand for a separate state for Kannadigas.\n\nThe ratification in parliament of the recommendations of the [[Fazal Ali Committee]] brought joy to the Kannadiga population that now was merged under the state of [[Mysore State|Mysore]].\n\nOn 1 November 1973, under [[Devaraj Urs]] as chief minister, Mysore state was renamed as Karnataka since it was felt that Karnataka was more 'inclusive' of all the other regions of Karnataka than the name Mysore.\n\nKannada unification organisations currently active include:\n*[[Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha]]\n*Karnataka Ekikarana Samithi\n*[[Karnataka Rakshana Vedike]]\n*[[Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha]]\n\n==Kannada ethnic flag==\n[[File:GBerunda.JPG|thumb|60px|right|[[Gandaberunda|Karnataka Emblem]]]]\n[[File:Flag_of_Karnataka.svg|thumb|left|100px|[[Kannada flag|Karnataka Popular Flag]]]]\nThe [[Kannada flag|Kannada ethnic flag]] is a banner with two horizontal stripes, yellow on top and red on the bottom. The flag neither is official nor represents any legendary empire but has become accepted in recent times representing a symbol of culture and welfare. The flag was first conceived by Ma Ramamurthy, a Bangalore-based writer, journalist and social activist, often considered as a commander of Kannada movement in 1960s.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Kannada film industry]]\n* [[Kannada language]]\n* [[Kannada literature]]\n* [[Kannada poetry]]\n* [[Karnataka]]\n* [[Karnataka literature]]\n* [[List of people from Bangalore]]\n* [[List of people from Karnataka]]\n* [[List of people of North Karnataka]]\n* [[North Karnataka]]\n* [[Sanganakallu]]\n* [[Siribhoovalaya]] - a unique literary work<ref>[http://www.pustakshakti.com/pr01.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928065457/http://www.pustakshakti.com/pr01.htm|date=28 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|40em}} \n* John Keay, History of India, 2000, Grove publications, New York, {{ISBN|0-8021-3797-0}}\n* Suryanath U.

The existence of artifacts like Roman coins shows Karanataka was involved in trade as early as the 1st century CE. In the 4th century BCE the land was ruled by the Mauryans, and Jainism was very popular. After the Mauryas, parts of Karnataka were variously ruled by dynasties either ethnically Kannadiga or outside. The [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadambas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Hoysala Empire|Holysalas]] were some of the many major Kannada kingdoms and dynasties ruling the region. The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was founded by Kannadiga chieftans, and they were great patrons of Kannada art and literature.\n\nThe Kannada language has written inscriptions since 450 CE. Kannada literature is mostly composed of poems and treatises on religious works. Kannada architecture is dominated by stone-carved sculptured palaces and temples. The ruins of [[Hampi]] are a UNESCO World Heritage site. Kannada music and dance is rich and varied, including both complex .\n\nMost Kannadigas are Hindus, but in rural areas villagers practice [[Dravidian folk religion]] similar to their Tamil neighbours, worshipping many ''gramadevataru'' in addition to the main deities. In addition, many in North Karnataka practice [[Lingayatism]], a religious tradition centred around worship of Shiva. There are also small minorities of Jains, remnants of ancient times, and Christians. [[Cuisine of Karnataka|Kannada cuisine]] is varied, with both non-veg and veg items using numerous spices.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Karnataka}}\n[[File:\u0c95\u0ca6\u0c82\u0cac - \u0ca4\u0cca\u0caf\u0cbf\u0cae\u0ca6\u0cc7\u0cb5.jpg|thumb|right|Gold coins issued by [[Kadamba of Hangal|Kadamba King Toyimadeva]], 1048 - 1075 A.D]] [[File:Hoysala emblem.JPG|thumb|Sala fighting the lion, the royal emblem of [[Hoysala Empire]]|alt=]]Settlement in Karnataka is found to be existent at least from the 2nd millennium BC as explored in [[Brahmagiri archaeological site]] near [[Chitradurga]] district, central Karnataka.

There is also literary evidence that the region of Mysore was called \"Mahisha Mandala\" after the mythological demon Mahishasura. Parashurama and Hanumantha are some epic characters to be cited relating to this place. Hanumantha (Hanuman) is said to be born in Kishkindha, Karnataka.\n\n===Punya Koti===\nOne of the most popular and acknowledged [[Jaanapada]] songs is \"Dharani mandala madhyadolage\" which narrates an incidence between mother cow and an aggressive tiger in a place called Karnataka.\n\n===Vishwa Maanava===\nKarnataka as now can be viewed as a multicultural state \u2013 almost all the religions that can be found in India can be found here and there has been lot immigration as well due to which [[multi-ethnic]] diaspora can be seen. As the kingdoms provided a safe centres for development of all cultures we can see a huge diversities from region to region. Even the language and dialects varies from place to place. The language has evolved distinctly in both the backyard (folk/basic/prakrutha) and frontyard (refined and related to Samskrutha/Sanskrit) of the culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} It can be said that the major works of Sanskrit have originated and continues to evolve here.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Shringeri]], Udupi are some of nerve centres. One of the leading examples include a village near [[Shivamogga]] where people speak only Sanskrit till date. Bengaluru being Kannada majority has almost all language speakers of India, and kannadigaru are said to be tolerant and welcoming people.\n\n[[File:Basava linga.jpg|thumb|Tha ''aikya'' linga of Basavanna \u2013 the ab-initio of social spiritual reformation and a known vachanakaara, at [[Kudalasangama]]]]\nOne of the most acknowledged concept is to be a ''Vishwa Maanava'' or universal being.

It is we who make him Alpa Maanava or Little Human by putting various constrictions of borders rituals and castes. It hence becomes responsibility of our culture to again make him a Universal Being unbound and free.\" The Kannadiga culture is known to provide shelter and self-respect to people by owning them and their culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Two colonies for refugees from Tibet are formed, one near [[Mundgod]] and one near [[Kushalanagara]], protecting them from Chinese atrocities. Karnataka has sheltered flood victims of northeastern India like Assam and provided them jobs.

But this was a functionally a failure as there always has been a tug of war from centre and states to an extent that from the 1990s to 2010 there have always been different political parties operating at centre and state. North Karnataka had other problems of getting independence more from Nizams. So there were two spheres. Lack of will and coordination and constant fights have been hallmark of politics which has prevented a regional party/media from arising in the land. [[Kerala]] being a neighbour where hugely successful communist ideology in bringing up literacy levels has a backing here and a few [[naxalite]] outfits function in Karnataka.\n\nFunctional failure of all pillars of democracy even being upper riparian state can be clearly seen in the [[Kaveri River Water Dispute]] issue.

Areas that today comprise Karnataka were under as many as 20 different administrative units with the [[Kingdom of Mysore|princely state of Mysore]], [[Hyderabad state|Nizam's Hyderabad]], the [[Bombay Presidency]], the [[Madras Presidency]] and the territory of [[Kodagu]] being the most important ones. In effect, nearly two-thirds of what is now Karnataka fell outside the rule of the [[Wodeyar|Wodeyar kings of Mysore]]. In addition the proposed state had six neighbours \u2014 [[Goa]], [[Maharashtra]], Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, [[Kerala]] \u2014 and all had Kannadigas along the borders overlapping these regions.\n\nWhat this meant for the Kannadigas in these regions was that they were reduced to linguistic minorities wherever they were. Kannadigas in the Hubli-Karnataka region for example, came under the rule of the Bombay presidency where [[Marathi language|Marathi]] was the official language. Those in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region came under the Nizam's rule where [[Urdu]] ruled, while in Mysore Kingdom, Kannada was the official language.\n\nIt was in this backdrop that the movement that first started as a protest against linguistic oppression, soon morphed into one that began demanding a separate state be created consolidating all Kannada speaking regions. This was essentially a movement that was spearheaded by the poets, journalists and writers and was called the ''Ekikarana'' or 'Unification' movement.\nIndia gained independence in 1947. The joy of independence soon gave way to disappointment as the new government started dragging its feet on ''Karnataka Ekikarana'' movement. Kannada speaking areas now got grouped under five administrative units of the Bombay and Madras provinces, Kodagu, and the princely states of Mysore and Hyderabad. The ''Akhila Karnataka Ekikarana Parishat'' met in [[Kasaragod Town|Kasargod]] and reiterated the demand for a separate state for Kannadigas.\n\nThe ratification in parliament of the recommendations of the [[Fazal Ali Committee]] brought joy to the Kannadiga population that now was merged under the state of [[Mysore State|Mysore]].\n\nOn 1 November 1973, under [[Devaraj Urs]] as chief minister, Mysore state was renamed as Karnataka since it was felt that Karnataka was more 'inclusive' of all the other regions of Karnataka than the name Mysore.\n\nKannada unification organisations currently active include:\n*[[Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha]]\n*Karnataka Ekikarana Samithi\n*[[Karnataka Rakshana Vedike]]\n*[[Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha]]\n\n==Kannada ethnic flag==\n[[File:GBerunda.JPG|thumb|60px|right|[[Gandaberunda|Karnataka Emblem]]]]\n[[File:Flag_of_Karnataka.svg|thumb|left|100px|[[Kannada flag|Karnataka Popular Flag]]]]\nThe [[Kannada flag|Kannada ethnic flag]] is a banner with two horizontal stripes, yellow on top and red on the bottom. The flag neither is official nor represents any legendary empire but has become accepted in recent times representing a symbol of culture and welfare. The flag was first conceived by Ma Ramamurthy, a Bangalore-based writer, journalist and social activist, often considered as a commander of Kannada movement in 1960s.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Kannada film industry]]\n* [[Kannada language]]\n* [[Kannada literature]]\n* [[Kannada poetry]]\n* [[Karnataka]]\n* [[Karnataka literature]]\n* [[List of people from Bangalore]]\n* [[List of people from Karnataka]]\n* [[List of people of North Karnataka]]\n* [[North Karnataka]]\n* [[Sanganakallu]]\n* [[Siribhoovalaya]] - a unique literary work<ref>[http://www.pustakshakti.com/pr01.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928065457/http://www.pustakshakti.com/pr01.htm|date=28 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|40em}} \n* John Keay, History of India, 2000, Grove publications, New York, {{ISBN|0-8021-3797-0}}\n* Suryanath U.

A $350 million aviation support package was introduced to fund the measures such as rebates on waiving off parking charges.<ref>{{cite web |title=MOF {{!}} Singapore Budget 2020 {{!}} Supplementary Budget Statement |url=https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |website=www.singaporebudget.gov.sg |accessdate=27 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327004758/https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn spite of this large spending package, several private sector economists were still expecting the economy to contract in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|title=Singapore's 'bazooka' stimulus to cushion COVID-19 pain, but recession still on the cards: Economists|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327072500/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|archive-date=27 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Third stimulus package - \"Solidarity Budget\" ====\nIt was announced on 5 April that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat would propose a third round of support measures through a \"Solidarity Budget\" when Parliament returned on 6 April.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid-19-heng-swee-keat-solidarity-budget-12611084|title=COVID-19: Heng Swee Keat to announce third round of support measures in new 'Solidarity Budget'|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nOn 17 February 2020, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of [[Chan Chun Sing]] with business people from the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore; those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same

A $350 million aviation support package was introduced to fund the measures such as rebates on waiving off parking charges.<ref>{{cite web |title=MOF {{!}} Singapore Budget 2020 {{!}} Supplementary Budget Statement |url=https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |website=www.singaporebudget.gov.sg |accessdate=27 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327004758/https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn spite of this large spending package, several private sector economists were still expecting the economy to contract in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|title=Singapore's 'bazooka' stimulus to cushion COVID-19 pain, but recession still on the cards: Economists|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327072500/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|archive-date=27 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Third stimulus package - \"Solidarity Budget\" ====\nIt was announced on 5 April that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat would propose a third round of support measures through a \"Solidarity Budget\" when Parliament returned on 6 April.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid-19-heng-swee-keat-solidarity-budget-12611084|title=COVID-19: Heng Swee Keat to announce third round of support measures in new 'Solidarity Budget'|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nOn 17 February 2020, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of [[Chan Chun Sing]] with business people from the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore; those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same time|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2020|date=20 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304163310/https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|archive-date=4 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to the leak, SCCCI said that the leak is \"deeply disappointing\" and a \"betrayal of trust\", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tee |first1=Zhuo |title=Leak of closed-door Chan Chun Sing meeting 'deeply disappointing' and a 'betrayal', says Singapore Chinese Chamber president |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227192432/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |archive-date=27 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhile many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, [[The New York Times]] argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|title=As Coronavirus Surveillance Escalates, Personal Privacy Plummets|date=2020-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-24|last2=Sang-Hun|first2=Choe|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324094050/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|archive-date=24 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://sgwuhan.xose.net/ Interactive map of Singapore] \n* [https://corona.arrangy.com Worldwide Coronavirus Map, confirmed Cases] \u2013 Map the route paths of coronavirus confirmed cases.\n* [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation \u2013 Ministry of Health (Singapore)]\n* [https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html??cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna ChannelNewsAsia's COVID-19 clusters]\n* [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore The Straits Times article tracking every single case in Singapore]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n{{Portal bar|COVID-19|Singapore|Medicine|Viruses}}\n\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Medical outbreaks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Singapore]]\n", "name_user": "TheGreatSG'rean", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePostponed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Singapore"}

In 1911 McMaster women, protesting gender inequality and not being allowed to vote in the general student body elections, elected a female representative student body and formed the Women's Student Body. In 1925, the number of day students began outnumbering the number of residence students. To ensure that both day and resident students were properly represented, the student government split in two bodies, the Student Body and the Residence Council. In 1946 the McMaster Student Body was renamed McMaster Students Union. In 1971 the MSU was incorporated as a non-profit organization without share capital under the ''Ontario Corporations Act''.\n\nThe MSU's offices have been located in four buildings over time. First in the Alumni Memorial Building (opened in 1951 as the campus' first student centre), then Wentworth House (1961\u201374), Hamilton Hall (a former science building renovated to serve as a student centre, 1974\u20132002), and the McMaster University Student Centre (MUSC, 2002\u2013present). Referenda in 1987 and 1989 approved a long-term levy that funded approximately two-thirds of the $36 million capital costs of the MUSC. Ground for the new building was broken in March 2000 and the official opening took place in September 2002. A student fee retired the remaining term loan in 2010\u201311.\n\n==Scope==\nThe MSU works to enhance both the academic and extracurricular experience of its members by offering a wide array of resources, services and opportunities to McMaster students and through advocacy of student issues with the university administration and relevant levels of government.\n\nThe MSU represents approximately 24,000 students, each of whom becomes a member of the students union when registering in a minimum of 18 units of undergraduate courses (3 two-term courses, or equivalent) in an academic session. The University collects mandatory membership fees on the MSU\u2019s behalf as a component of tuition/ancillary fees paid by students on registration. Fees, which are partially courseload-sensitive, are up to a maximum of $587.84 for the MSU, plus up to a further $760.71 in other university or student group supplementary fees which are approved by MSU referenda or General Assembly [2019-20 fee schedule].\n\n==Governance==\nThe MSU's [https://web.archive.org/web/20050210133344/http://www.msu.mcmaster.ca/cbp/constitution.php Constitution] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20050210133606/http://www.msu.mcmaster.ca/cbp/bylaws.php Bylaws] establish the political apparatus of the union and its component organs, while a separate collection of [https://web.archive.org/web/20050210133024/http://www.msu.mcmaster.ca/cbp/policies.php Operating Policies] define the functions of service-providing departments and the operating parameters of the organization.\n\nThe political leadership of the MSU is four officers&mdash;a President and three Vice-Presidents (Administration, Education and Finance).  These positions are filled by students, typically after completing three or four years of study, who take a year off classes to work full-time in student government.  The president is elected directly by the student body in annual elections held in early February, while the vice-presidents are elected by the Student Representative Assembly in early April.  Slates and/or political parties, though commonplace at many other student unions, are not a typical feature of the MSU's political culture.\n\nThe MSU's chief [[legislature|legislative body]] is the Student Representative Assembly (SRA), a 35-member parliament comprising the president, vice-presidents, and 31 elected student representatives from nine (9) academic divisions of the University ([[McMaster Arts and Science|Arts & Science]], [[DeGroote School of Business|Business]], [[McMaster Faculty of Engineering|Engineering]], [[McMaster Faculty of Health Sciences|Health Sciences]], Kinesiology (separated from the Faculty of Science),  [[Humanities]], [[McMaster School of Nursing|Nursing]], [[McMaster Faculty of Science|Science]], and [[McMaster Faculty of Social Sciences|Social Sciences]]). The SRA is the MSU's highest policy-setting body and has the sole authority to approve and modify [[legislation]] and elect officers other than the President.\n\nThe [[executive (government)|executive]] branch of government is the Executive Board (EB), which comprises the President, Vice-Presidents, and five SRA members-at-large; as well as the General Manager, Marketing & Communications Director, Administrative Services Coordinator, and the Associate: Vice-President Services. The board, chaired by the President, supervises the functioning of the union's services and [[bureaucracy]] and performs planning and priority-setting tasks in a manner somewhat akin to a [[Westminster System|Westminister]]-style [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].  With the exception of the President, the EB's membership is elected by and responsible to the SRA.  In emergency circumstances and during the summer months it can operate as an executive committee of the SRA and exercise the powers of the full Assembly.  Functional authority for full-time staff and the departments they supervise lies with the Corporate Board of Directors (see below) rather than the EB.\n\n== Elections ==\nMSU holds elections every year for the presidency and for the SRA positions. Elections are conducted using [[online voting]]. Voter turnout in presidential elections was above 40% from 2014 through 2017, but was 28.8% in 2018 and 26.8% in 2019.<ref>https://www.msumcmaster.ca/services-directory/31-elections-department/presidential-election-2017{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Corporate structure==\nThe MSU was incorporated in 1971 as a corporation without share capital.  For corporate purposes, including major financial decision-making and dealings with full-time staff members, the political organs of the union can reconvene in a corporate rather than political format&mdash;the Student Representative Assembly serves as the voting members of the corporation, with the four sabbatical officers assuming the role of a corporate Board of Directors.  The Board oversees day-to-day operations and an annual operating budget of over $13 million.\n\n==Affiliated organizations==\nThe MSU is a member of the [[Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance]] (since 1998), and is a former member of the [[Canadian Alliance of Student Associations]] (2001\u201304 and 2009\u201314). From 1981 to 1998, MSU members were also members of the [[Canadian Federation of Students]].\n\n==Services==\nThe MSU employs 36 permanent staff and over 200 part-time student staff. Its more than 30 operational departments include a restaurant-bar (TwelvEighty), a professional production company (Avtek Productions), First Year Council (FYC), Child Care Centre, convenience store (The Union Market), copy shop (Underground Media + Design), food bank (Food Collective Centre), games room, newspaper ([[The Silhouette]]), radio station (93.3 [[CFMU-FM]]), Student Health Education Centre, and yearbook (Marmor).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msumcmaster.ca/newmsu/msu/ServicesBusinesses.htm|title=MSU Website, Services and Businesses|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928013452/http://www.msumcmaster.ca/newmsu/msu/ServicesBusinesses.htm|archivedate=2011-09-28}}</ref>\n\n== Maroons Investigation 2019 ==\nThe Maroons are a student group created to help facilitate Welcome Week events and increase awareness surrounding MSU services and events. In March 2019, the Silhouette, the student-run newspaper, published an article displaying the numerous cases of sexual assault against the Maroons team. Such incidents go back to an annual ski trip.

In 1911 McMaster women, protesting gender inequality and not being allowed to vote in the general student body elections, elected a female representative student body and formed the Women's Student Body. In 1925, the number of day students began outnumbering the number of residence students. To ensure that both day and resident students were properly represented, the student government split in two bodies, the Student Body and the Residence Council. In 1946 the McMaster Student Body was renamed McMaster Students Union. In 1971 the MSU was incorporated as a non-profit organization without share capital under the ''Ontario Corporations Act''.\n\nThe MSU's offices have been located in four buildings over time. First in the Alumni Memorial Building (opened in 1951 as the campus' first student centre), then Wentworth House (1961\u201374), Hamilton Hall (a former science building renovated to serve as a student centre, 1974\u20132002), and the McMaster University Student Centre (MUSC, 2002\u2013present). Referenda in 1987 and 1989 approved a long-term levy that funded approximately two-thirds of the $36 million capital costs of the MUSC. Ground for the new building was broken in March 2000 and the official opening took place in September 2002. A student fee retired the remaining term loan in 2010\u201311.\n\n==Scope==\nThe MSU works to enhance both the academic and extracurricular experience of its members by offering a wide array of resources, services and opportunities to McMaster students and through advocacy of student issues with the university administration and relevant levels of government.\n\nThe MSU represents approximately 24,000 students, each of whom becomes a member of the students union when registering in a minimum of 18 units of undergraduate courses (3 two-term courses, or equivalent) in an academic session. The University collects mandatory membership fees on the MSU\u2019s behalf as a component of tuition/ancillary fees paid by students on registration. Fees, which are partially courseload-sensitive, are up to a maximum of $587.84 for the MSU, plus up to a further $760.71 in other university or student group supplementary fees which are approved by MSU referenda or General Assembly [2019-20 fee schedule].\n\n==Governance==\nThe MSU's [https://web.archive.org/web/20050210133344/http://www.msu.mcmaster.ca/cbp/constitution.php Constitution] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20050210133606/http://www.msu.mcmaster.ca/cbp/bylaws.php Bylaws] establish the political apparatus of the union and its component organs, while a separate collection of [https://web.archive.org/web/20050210133024/http://www.msu.mcmaster.ca/cbp/policies.php Operating Policies] define the functions of service-providing departments and the operating parameters of the organization.\n\nThe political leadership of the MSU is four officers&mdash;a President and three Vice-Presidents (Administration, Education and Finance).  These positions are filled by students, typically after completing three or four years of study, who take a year off classes to work full-time in student government.  The president is elected directly by the student body in annual elections held in early February, while the vice-presidents are elected by the Student Representative Assembly in early April.  Slates and/or political parties, though commonplace at many other student unions, are not a typical feature of the MSU's political culture.\n\nThe MSU's chief [[legislature|legislative body]] is the Student Representative Assembly (SRA), a 35-member parliament comprising the president, vice-presidents, and 31 elected student representatives from nine (9) academic divisions of the University ([[McMaster Arts and Science|Arts & Science]], [[DeGroote School of Business|Business]], [[McMaster Faculty of Engineering|Engineering]], [[McMaster Faculty of Health Sciences|Health Sciences]], Kinesiology (separated from the Faculty of Science),  [[Humanities]], [[McMaster School of Nursing|Nursing]], [[McMaster Faculty of Science|Science]], and [[McMaster Faculty of Social Sciences|Social Sciences]]). The SRA is the MSU's highest policy-setting body and has the sole authority to approve and modify [[legislation]] and elect officers other than the President.\n\nThe [[executive (government)|executive]] branch of government is the Executive Board (EB), which comprises the President, Vice-Presidents, and five SRA members-at-large; as well as the General Manager, Marketing & Communications Director, Administrative Services Coordinator, and the Associate: Vice-President Services. The board, chaired by the President, supervises the functioning of the union's services and [[bureaucracy]] and performs planning and priority-setting tasks in a manner somewhat akin to a [[Westminster System|Westminister]]-style [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].  With the exception of the President, the EB's membership is elected by and responsible to the SRA.  In emergency circumstances and during the summer months it can operate as an executive committee of the SRA and exercise the powers of the full Assembly.  Functional authority for full-time staff and the departments they supervise lies with the Corporate Board of Directors (see below) rather than the EB.\n\n== Elections ==\nMSU holds elections every year for the presidency and for the SRA positions. Elections are conducted using [[online voting]]. Voter turnout in presidential elections was above 40% from 2014 through 2017, but was 28.8% in 2018 and 26.8% in 2019.<ref>https://www.msumcmaster.ca/services-directory/31-elections-department/presidential-election-2017{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Corporate structure==\nThe MSU was incorporated in 1971 as a corporation without share capital.  For corporate purposes, including major financial decision-making and dealings with full-time staff members, the political organs of the union can reconvene in a corporate rather than political format&mdash;the Student Representative Assembly serves as the voting members of the corporation, with the four sabbatical officers assuming the role of a corporate Board of Directors.  The Board oversees day-to-day operations and an annual operating budget of over $13 million.\n\n==Affiliated organizations==\nThe MSU is a member of the [[Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance]] (since 1998), and is a former member of the [[Canadian Alliance of Student Associations]] (2001\u201304 and 2009\u201314). From 1981 to 1998, MSU members were also members of the [[Canadian Federation of Students]].\n\n==Services==\nThe MSU employs 36 permanent staff and over 200 part-time student staff. Its more than 30 operational departments include a restaurant-bar (TwelvEighty), a professional production company (Avtek Productions), First Year Council (FYC), Child Care Centre, convenience store (The Union Market), copy shop (Underground Media + Design), food bank (Food Collective Centre), games room, newspaper ([[The Silhouette]]), radio station (93.3 [[CFMU-FM]]), Student Health Education Centre, and yearbook (Marmor).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msumcmaster.ca/newmsu/msu/ServicesBusinesses.htm|title=MSU Website, Services and Businesses|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928013452/http://www.msumcmaster.ca/newmsu/msu/ServicesBusinesses.htm|archivedate=2011-09-28}}</ref>\n\n== Maroons Investigation 2019 ==\nThe Maroons are a student group created to help facilitate Welcome Week events and increase awareness surrounding MSU services and events. In March 2019, the Silhouette, the student-run newspaper, published an article displaying the numerous cases of sexual assault against the Maroons team. Such incidents go back to an annual ski trip. After weeks of outcry, former MSU President Ikram Farah, released a statement condemning the incidents and promised an external review will occur.

Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\nThe organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta\u2013Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals\u2013jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organisation carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sri-Sarada-Math</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, [[Shankarananda_(Ramakrishna_monk)|Swami Shankarananda]] and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]].

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world...

This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sri-Sarada-Math</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]].

{"title_page": "Anne Allison", "text_new": "'''Anne Allison''' is a professor of [[cultural anthropology]] at [[Duke University]] in the [[United States]], specializing in contemporary [[Japan]]ese society. She wrote the book ''[[Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club|Nightwork]]'' on [[hostess club]]s and Japanese corporate culture after having worked at a hostess club in [[Tokyo]].\n\nShe received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], and her [[Ph.D.]] in [[anthropology]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1986.\n\n==Work==\n\nAllison's work investigates the intersection between the political economy and the imaginative dreamworld(s) of day-to-day Japanese life.  Her first book, ''Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club'' (University of Chicago Press 1994), examines the Japanese corporate practice of entertaining white-collar, male workers in the sexualized atmosphere of hostess clubs.\n\nHer second book, ''Permitted and Prohibited Desires: Mothers, Comics, and Censorship in Japan'' (Westview-HarperCollins 1996, reissued by University of California Press 2000) studies the intersection of motherhood, productivity, and mass-produced fantasies in contemporary Japan through essays on lunch-boxes, comics, censorship, and stories of mother-son incest.\n\nAllison's third book, ''Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination'' (California, 2006), analyzes the interplay of fantasy, capitalism, and cultural politics in the rise of \"J-cool\" (Japan's brand of \"cool\" youth goods) on the global marketplace. A Japanese edition of this book was published in 2010 by Shinchosha Press under the title Kiku to Pok\u00e9mon: Guro-barusuru nihon no bunkaryouuku.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://culturalanthropology.duke.edu/people?subpage=profile&Gurl=/aas/CA&Uil=anne.allison |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304214405/http://culturalanthropology.duke.edu/people?Gurl=%2Faas%2FCA&Uil=anne.allison&subpage=profile |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2011 |title=Anne Allison |publisher=Duke University Cultural Anthropology |accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHer fourth book focuses on how the Japanese experience insecurity in their daily and social lives is the subject of ''Precarious Japan''. Tacking between the structural conditions of socioeconomic life and the ways people are making do, or not, Anne Allison chronicles the loss of home affecting many Japanese, not only in the literal sense but also in the figurative sense of not belonging. Until the collapse of Japan's economic bubble in 1991, lifelong employment and a secure income were within reach of most Japanese men, enabling them to maintain their families in a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Now, as fewer and fewer people are able to find full-time work, hope turns to hopelessness and security gives way to a pervasive unease.

She wrote the book ''[[Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club|Nightwork]]'' on [[hostess club]]s and Japanese corporate culture after having worked at a hostess club in [[Tokyo]].\n\nShe received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], and her [[Ph.D.]] in [[anthropology]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1986.\n\n==Work==\n\nAllison's work investigates the intersection between the political economy and the imaginative dreamworld(s) of day-to-day Japanese life.  Her first book, ''Nightwork: Sexuality, Pleasure, and Corporate Masculinity in a Tokyo Hostess Club'' (University of Chicago Press 1994), examines the Japanese corporate practice of entertaining white-collar, male workers in the sexualized atmosphere of hostess clubs.\n\nHer second book, ''Permitted and Prohibited Desires: Mothers, Comics, and Censorship in Japan'' (Westview-HarperCollins 1996, reissued by University of California Press 2000) studies the intersection of motherhood, productivity, and mass-produced fantasies in contemporary Japan through essays on lunch-boxes, comics, censorship, and stories of mother-son incest.\n\nAllison's third book, ''Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination'' (California, 2006), analyzes the interplay of fantasy, capitalism, and cultural politics in the rise of \"J-cool\" (Japan's brand of \"cool\" youth goods) on the global marketplace. A Japanese edition of this book was published in 2010 by Shinchosha Press under the title Kiku to Pok\u00e9mon: Guro-barusuru nihon no bunkaryouuku.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://culturalanthropology.duke.edu/people?subpage=profile&Gurl=/aas/CA&Uil=anne.allison |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304214405/http://culturalanthropology.duke.edu/people?Gurl=%2Faas%2FCA&Uil=anne.allison&subpage=profile |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2011 |title=Anne Allison |publisher=Duke University Cultural Anthropology |accessdate=October 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHer fourth book focuses on how the Japanese experience insecurity in their daily and social lives is the subject of ''Precarious Japan''. Tacking between the structural conditions of socioeconomic life and the ways people are making do, or not, Anne Allison chronicles the loss of home affecting many Japanese, not only in the literal sense but also in the figurative sense of not belonging. Until the collapse of Japan's economic bubble in 1991, lifelong employment and a secure income were within reach of most Japanese men, enabling them to maintain their families in a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Now, as fewer and fewer people are able to find full-time work, hope turns to hopelessness and security gives way to a pervasive unease. Yet some Japanese are getting by, partly by reconceiving notions of home, family, and togetherness.\n\n==Duke lacrosse case==\nAllison was a leading faculty figure during the [[Duke lacrosse case]] She is noted for  being  among the \u201c[[Group of 88]]\u201d Duke professors and faculty who published an ad condemning the Duke lacrosse team, three of whose members were accused of rape but ultimately found innocent.
