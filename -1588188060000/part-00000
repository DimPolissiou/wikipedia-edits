It is located at 1600 [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and has been the residence of every U.S. president since [[John Adams]] in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|president and his advisers]].\n\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect [[James Hoban]]{{r|TSGjH}} in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. Hoban modelled the building on [[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]], a building which today houses the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using [[Aquia Creek sandstone]] painted white. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]) added low [[colonnade]]s on each wing that concealed stables and storage.{{r|bwDpG}}  In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the mansion was set ablaze by the [[British Army]] in the [[Burning of Washington]], destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President [[James Monroe]] moved into the partially reconstructed [[Executive Residence]] in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\n\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed [[West Wing]] in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the West Wing and created the first [[Oval Office]], which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor [[attic]] was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [[hip roof]] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed [[East Wing]] was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under [[Harry S. Truman]], the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing [[steel frame]] constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\n\nThe modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president\u2014and [[Blair House]], a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story [[White House basement|basement]]. The property is a [[National Heritage Site (United States)|National Heritage Site]] owned by the [[National Park Service]] and is part of the [[President's Park]]. In 2007, it was ranked second{{r|1AvjX}} on the [[American Institute of Architects]] list of \"[[America's Favorite Architecture]]\".\n\n==Early history==\n\n===1789\u20131800===\n{{further|Presidency of George Washington#Residences}}\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President [[George Washington]] occupied two private houses in New York City as the executive mansion. He lived at the first, known as the [[Samuel Osgood House|Franklin House]] and owned by Treasury Commissioner [[Samuel Osgood]], at 3 Cherry Street through late February 1790.{{r|Baker1897}}{{r|mvorg}}  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters of the [[Alexander Macomb House]] at 39\u201341 Broadway{{r|mvorg}} where he stayed, with his wife and a small staff until August 1790. In May 1790, New York began construction of a \"proper\" house for the presidential mansion, [[Government House (New York City)|Government House]].{{r|Stokes}} Washington never used the mansion because it was not completed until after the national capital was moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in December 1790.{{r|Stokes}}\n\nThe July 1790 [[Residence Act]] designated the capital be permanently located in the new [[Washington, D.C.|Federal District]], and temporarily in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], for ten years while the permanent capital was built.{{r|6ylva}} Philadelphia rented the mansion of the wealthy merchant [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] at 190 High Street (now 524\u201330 Market Street) as the [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797.{{r|ushist}}  Since the house was too small to accommodate the thirty people that made up the presidential family, staff, and servants, Washington had it enlarged.{{r|ushist}}\n\nPresident [[John Adams]] also occupied the High Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House.{{r|jK8YA}}\n\nThe President's House in Philadelphia was converted into the Union Hotel, and later used for stores, before being demolished in 1832.{{r|ushist}}\n\nPhiladelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in 1792. It was nearly completed by the time of Adam's 1797 inauguration. However, Adams declined to occupy it saying he did not have Congressional authorization to lease the building. It remained vacant until it was sold to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1800.{{r|Westcott1894}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=100px>\nFile:The First Presidential Mansion.jpg|First Presidential Mansion: [[Samuel Osgood House]], Manhattan, New York.

He wrote this name on his [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512 \"Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ....\"] (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|978-0-9727611-0-9}}). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: \"(a) In General.\u2014The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\" The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as \"[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]\" and as \"[https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]\" on its website.}} 1791 [[L'Enfant Plan|plan]] for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C.{{r|IYuWd}} Washington and his Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the White House, and the Capital, would be chosen in a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]].{{r|Frary}}\n\nAlthough all proposals for the Capital were rejected, an acceptable drawing for the White House submitted by [[James Hoban]] was selected from several including one submitted anonymously by Jefferson himself.{{r|np7Jl}}\n\nHoban was born in Ireland and trained at the [[Dublin Society of Arts]]. He emigrated to the US after the revolution, first seeking work in Philadelphia and later finding success in [[South Carolina]] where he designed several buildings including the state capitol at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. Hoban ultimately supervised the construction of both the US Capitol and the White House.{{r|u1v6F}}\n\nPresident Washington visited [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in May 1791 on his \"Southern Tour\", and saw the under-construction [[Charleston County Courthouse]] designed by Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.{{r|eYnQA}}\n\nOn July 16, 1792, the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.{{r|nUHxy}}\n\n===Design influences===\nThe building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] or in [[Andrea Palladio]] styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the [[Renaissance]] which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture ([[Palladian architecture]]). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]], which later became the seat of the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament).{{r|Ywh2c}} Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in [[White House Historical Association]] publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]], a neoclassical country house located in [[La Bachellerie]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the [[French Revolution]] for twenty years and then finally built 1812\u20131817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).{{r|France?}} The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that [[Thomas Jefferson]], during his tour of [[Bordeaux]] in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture]] (Bordeaux Architectural College).{{r|johnson}}  On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].{{r|France?}}\n\n===Construction===\n\nConstruction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.{{r|yLpeA}} The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] and free [[African-American]] laborers, as well as employed Europeans.{{r|mJ52j}} Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, employed by Hoban,{{r|whha overview}} as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \"fish scale\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. There are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the [[Croatia]]n island of [[Bra\u010d]] (specifically the [[Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a]] querry whose stone was used to build the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Diocletian's Palace|palace]] of [[Diocletian|Emperor Diocletian]]) was used in the original construction of the building, contrarily researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from [[Aquia Creek]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], [[Virginia]], as importing the stone would be too costly.{{r|zQgqd}}{{r|L0Ydi}}{{r|J1ZuL}} The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|232371.83|1800}}}} today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.{{r|XEjY4}}\n\nShortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] for a \"palace\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.{{r|whha overview}} The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa\u00e7ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were [[whitewash]]ed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nSeveral [[replicas of the White House]] have been constructed.\n\n===Architectural description===\n\nThe north front is the principal fa\u00e7ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and [[parapet]], thus the fa\u00e7ade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a [[Prostyle|prostyle portico]] (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a [[porte cochere]]. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented [[pediment]]s, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a [[lunette]] [[fanlight]]. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral [[festoon]]. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded [[parapet]].\n\nThe mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is a combination of the [[Palladian]] and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa\u00e7ade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa\u00e7ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor [[double staircase]] leading to an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[colonnade]]d [[loggia]] (with the [[Truman Balcony]] at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n===Naming conventions===\n\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the \"President's Palace\", \"Presidential Mansion\", or \"President's House\".{{r|xVvhI}} The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811.{{r|8Rmlj}} A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the [[Burning of Washington]], white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,{{r|A3bMb}} giving the building its namesake hue.{{r|EdqBf}} The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the formal name by having \"White House\u2013Washington\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.{{r|Qtiju}}{{r|WH facts}} The current letterhead wording and arrangement \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath goes back to the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{r|WH facts}}\n\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the United States may have derived from [[Martha Washington]]'s home, [[White House (plantation)|White House Plantation]] in Virginia, where the nation's first president had courted the first lady in the mid-18th century.{{r|D7o2v}}\n\n==Evolution of the White House==\n\n===Early use, the 1814 fire, and rebuilding===\n\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to take residence in the building.{{r|whha overview}} The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\"{{r|whha state dining room}} \nFranklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.{{r|whha state dining room}}\n\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the \"pleasant country residence\"{{r|NRJJd}} in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\"{{r|sacjA}}), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.{{r|whha overview}} Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nIn 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the White House was set ablaze by British troops{{r|whha east room}} during the [[Burning of Washington]], in retaliation for burning of [[Port Dover]] and other towns in [[Upper Canada]]; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,{{r|whha east room}} and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by [[HMS Fantome (1810)|HMS ''Fantome'']] sank en route to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] off [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]] during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,{{r|K9M68}}{{r|iDYQ3}} even though ''Fantome'' had no involvement in that action.{{r|2ZhT4}}\n\nAfter the fire, President [[James Madison]] resided in [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|the Octagon House]] from 1814 to 1815, and then the [[Seven Buildings]] from 1815 to the end of his term.{{r|KQzqy}} Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south [[portico]] was constructed in 1824 during the [[James Monroe]] administration; the north portico was built six years later.{{r|whha overview}} Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.{{r|tbe3z}} An elliptical portico at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]] in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} although this matter is one of great debate.{{r|wSPdx}} Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in|Viceregal Lodge]] (now ''\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in'', residence of the [[President of Ireland]]), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} For the North Portico, a variation on the [[Ionic Order]] was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:The President's House by George Munger, 1814-1815 - Crop.jpg|The White House as it looked following the fire of August 24, 1814\nFile:White-House.jpg|[[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Latrobe]]'s West Wing Colonnade, in this nineteenth-century engraved view, is now the [[James S.

The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for [[malaria]] and other unhealthy conditions.{{r|epstein}} Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at [[Meridian Hill Park|Meridian Hill]] in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.{{r|epstein}} Another site under consideration was Metropolis View, today the campus of [[The Catholic University of America]].{{r|MqIIY}}\n\n[[File:WhiteHouseProposedAddition.jpg|thumb|right|Additions proposed by architect Frederick D.

Arthur]] took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed [[Lucretia Garfield]] moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a [[public auction]].{{r|reeves268}} All that was saved were bust portraits of [[John Adams]] and [[Martin Van Buren]].{{r|reevesn473}} A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\n\nIn the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of [[gold leaf]], and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful [[Tracery|traceries]] woven to spell \"USA\". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.{{r|reeves269}}{{r|bFjvZ}}\n\nIn 1891, First Lady [[Caroline Harrison]] proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.{{r|epstein}} A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.{{r|epstein}} These plans were ultimately rejected.\n\nHowever, in 1902 [[Theodore Roosevelt]] hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.{{r|Yl4bH}}{{r|R6fqD}}  [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the president's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nPresident [[William Howard Taft]] enlisted the help of architect [[Nathan C.

Truman]]{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.{{r|whha overview}} By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at [[Blair House]] from 1949 to 1951.{{r|OA7bu}} The work, done by the firm of [[Philadelphia]] contractor [[John McShain]], required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5.7|1951|r=0}}}} million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{r|vm2mG}} Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.{{r|whha overview}} The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.{{r|whha overview}} While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814\u20131816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawn into paneling; the walls of the [[Vermeil Room]], [[Library (White House)|Library]], [[China Room]], and [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.{{r|UtzOl}}\n\n===Jacqueline Kennedy restoration===\n[[File:BoudinRedRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] as designed by [[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] during the presidency of John F.

She enlisted the help of [[Henry Francis du Pont]] of the [[Winterthur Museum]] to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the [[Crowninshield family]], [[Jane Engelhard]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], and the Oppenheimer family.\n\n[[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] of the [[Maison Jansen|House of Jansen]], a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], French Empire for the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], American Empire for the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], Louis XVI for the [[Yellow Oval Room]], and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the [[Treaty Room]]. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} In the [[Diplomatic Reception Room (White House)|Diplomatic Reception Room]], Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \"Vue de l'Am\u00e9rique Nord\" wallpaper which [[Zuber & Cie]] had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\n\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.{{r|OLizx}} Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\n\nKennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public in [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F.

Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the president. This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.{{r|AbbottRice|p=29}}\n\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.{{r|YsEpb}} Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family\u2014usually represented by the first lady, the [[White House Office of the Curator|White House curator]], and the [[White House Chief Usher|chief usher]]\u2014to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.{{r|nJVBo}}\n\nDuring the Nixon Administration (1969\u20131974), First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]].{{r|t2zEz}} Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.{{r|MF74M}} Her husband created the modern press briefing room over [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s old swimming pool.{{r|press room}} Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.{{r|gMser}}\n\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.{{r|gff8t}} A Carter-era innovation, a set of [[solar heating|solar water heating panels]] that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.{{r|wq6cM}}{{r|Burdick}} Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.{{r|da1980}} The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.{{r|da1980}}\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] refurbished some rooms with the assistance of [[Arkansas]] decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, [[State Dining Room of the White House|State Dining Room]], Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.{{r|wh makeover}} During the administration of [[George W.

Roosevelt]], who used a wheelchair because of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his paralytic illness]]. In the 1990s, [[Hillary Clinton]], at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy [[wheelchair]] access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.{{r|Burdick}} These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. 167 solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.{{r|FCAxL}} In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] had a set of [[solar panel]]s installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.{{r|ztiyM}}{{r|BA0aA}}\n\n===Layout and amenities===\n\nToday the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central [[Executive Residence]] flanked by the [[East Wing]] and [[West Wing]]. The [[White House Chief Usher|Chief Usher]] coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes: six stories and 55,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> (5,100 m<sup>2</sup>) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the [[White House Family Theater]]{{r|JDYhZ}}), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.{{r|WH facts}} It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.{{r|bumiller200901}}\n{{multiple image\n | align =center\n | direction =horizontal\n | perrow = 3\n | image1 = White House and grounds.png\n | width1 = 68\n | caption1 = Layout of entire site\n | image2 = WHComplex.svg\n | width2 = 300\n | caption2 = White House Complex\n | image3 = White House West Wing FloorPlan1.svg\n | width3 = 168\n | caption3 = [[West Wing]]\n | image4 = WHground.svg\n | width4 = 150\n | caption4 = Ground floor\n | image5 = White House State Floor.svg\n | width5 = 153\n | caption5 = State floor\n | image6 = White House FloorPlan2.svg\n | width6 = 150\n | caption6 = Second floor (residence)\n}}\n\n===Executive Residence===\n{{Main|Executive Residence}}\n\nThe original residence is in the center. Two [[colonnade]]s\u2014one on the east and one on the west\u2014designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The [[Executive Residence]] houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the [[East Room]], [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], [[State Dining Room]], [[Family Dining Room]], [[Cross Hall]], [[Entrance Hall]], and [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]].{{r|OwkS5}} The Ground Floor is made up of the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]], [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]], [[China Room]], [[Vermeil Room]], [[White House Library|Library]], the main kitchen, and other offices.{{r|8vyYA}} The second floor family residence includes the [[Yellow Oval Room]], [[East Sitting Hall|East]] and [[West Sitting Hall]]s, the White House Master Bedroom, [[President's Dining Room]], the [[Treaty Room]], [[Lincoln Bedroom]] and [[Queens' Bedroom]], as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.{{r|S4zYx}} The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).{{r|gqDUm}}\n\n===West Wing===\n{{Main|West Wing}}\n\nThe West Wing houses the president's office (the [[Oval Office]]) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], where the president conducts business meetings and where the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meets,{{r|kzExn}} as well as the [[White House Situation Room]], [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]], and [[Roosevelt Room]].{{r|cQOP2}} In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cables and [[LCD]] screens for the display of charts and graphs.{{r|press room2}} The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8&nbsp;million, out of which news outlets paid $2&nbsp;million.{{r|press room2}} In September 2010, [[White House Big Dig|a two-year project]] began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure.{{r|vyYFd}}\n\nSome members of the President's staff are located in the adjacent [[Old Executive Office Building]], formerly the State War and Navy building, and sometimes known as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.{{r|press room2}}\n\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a [[sound stage]] and used as the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] for the popular television show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.{{r|wKroZ}}\n\n===East Wing===\n{{Main|East Wing}}\n\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]], and the White House Social Office. [[Rosalynn Carter]], in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\". The East Wing was built during [[World War II]] in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]].\n\n===Grounds===\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]], which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger [[greenhouse]]s were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, commissioned by  President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the [[White House Rose Garden]] was redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]], which was begun by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old [[American Elm|American Elm (''Ulmus americana'' L.)]] tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|intense flooding]]. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'') planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson's recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years; but in 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring.{{r|CcD01}}{{r|KpnOF}} Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.{{r|U4C8Y}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:White-house-floor1-cross-Hall.jpg|The [[Cross Hall]], connecting the [[State Dining Room]] and the [[East Room]] on the State Floor\nFile:WhSouthLawn.JPEG|[[Marine One]] prepares to land on the South Lawn, where [[State Arrival Ceremony|State Arrival Ceremonies]] are held.\nFile:White House, Blue Sky.jpg|View from the south, with fountain\nFile:1122-WAS-The White House.JPG|View from the north\nFile:The White House at night, 2011.jpg|White House at night, view from the north\n</gallery>\n\n==Public access and security==\n{{See also|White House Visitors Office|List of White House security breaches}}\n\n===Historical accessibility===\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] followed him home, where he greeted them in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President [[Andrew Jackson]] had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected [[Grover Cleveland]] arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President [[Bill Clinton]] briefly revived the New Year's Day open house in his first term.\n\nThe White House remained accessible in other ways; President [[Abraham Lincoln]] complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like \"General\" [[Daniel Pratt (eccentric)|Daniel Pratt]], as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Aviation incidents===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}<!-- April 15, 2015 incident; possibly January 2015 if drones count -->\nIn February 1974, a stolen army helicopter [[1974 White House helicopter incident|landed without authorization]] on the White House's grounds.{{r|bXgDO}} Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane flown by [[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed on the White House grounds, and he died instantly.{{r|JO4kZ}}\n\nAs a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.{{r|ZScbt}}\n\n===Closure of Pennsylvania Avenue===\n[[File:U.S. Secret Service Agent.jpg|left|thumb|A uniformed U.S. Secret Service Agent on Pennsylvania Avenue.]]\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, the [[United States Secret Service]] closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]].\n\nAfter [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], this change was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and [[the Ellipse]].{{r|VuiCP}} In response to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.{{r|F17OZ}}\n\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the [[Old Executive Office Building]] to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House.

It is located at 1600 [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and has been the residence of every U.S. president since [[John Adams]] in 1800. The term \"White House\" is often used as a [[metonym]] for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|president and his advisers]].\n\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect [[James Hoban]]{{r|TSGjH}} in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. Hoban modelled the building on [[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]], a building which today houses the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using [[Aquia Creek sandstone]] painted white. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]) added low [[colonnade]]s on each wing that concealed stables and storage.{{r|bwDpG}}  In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the mansion was set ablaze by the [[British Army]] in the [[Burning of Washington]], destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President [[James Monroe]] moved into the partially reconstructed [[Executive Residence]] in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\n\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed [[West Wing]] in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the West Wing and created the first [[Oval Office]], which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor [[attic]] was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [[hip roof]] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed [[East Wing]] was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under [[Harry S. Truman]], the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing [[steel frame]] constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\n\nThe modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president\u2014and [[Blair House]], a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story [[White House basement|basement]]. The property is a [[National Heritage Site (United States)|National Heritage Site]] owned by the [[National Park Service]] and is part of the [[President's Park]]. In 2007, it was ranked second{{r|1AvjX}} on the [[American Institute of Architects]] list of \"[[America's Favorite Architecture]]\".\n\n==Early history==\n\n===1789\u20131800===\n{{further|Presidency of George Washington#Residences}}\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President [[George Washington]] occupied two private houses in New York City as the executive mansion. He lived at the first, known as the [[Samuel Osgood House|Franklin House]] and owned by Treasury Commissioner [[Samuel Osgood]], at 3 Cherry Street through late February 1790.{{r|Baker1897}}{{r|mvorg}}  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters of the [[Alexander Macomb House]] at 39\u201341 Broadway{{r|mvorg}} where he stayed, with his wife and a small staff until August 1790. In May 1790, New York began construction of a \"proper\" house for the presidential mansion, [[Government House (New York City)|Government House]].{{r|Stokes}} Washington never used the mansion because it was not completed until after the national capital was moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in December 1790.{{r|Stokes}}\n\nThe July 1790 [[Residence Act]] designated the capital be permanently located in the new [[Washington, D.C.|Federal District]], and temporarily in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], for ten years while the permanent capital was built.{{r|6ylva}} Philadelphia rented the mansion of the wealthy merchant [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] at 190 High Street (now 524\u201330 Market Street) as the [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House]], which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797.{{r|ushist}}  Since the house was too small to accommodate the thirty people that made up the presidential family, staff, and servants, Washington had it enlarged.{{r|ushist}} \n\nPresident [[John Adams]] also occupied the High Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House.{{r|jK8YA}}\n\nThe President's House in Philadelphia was converted into the Union Hotel, and later used for stores, before being demolished in 1832.{{r|ushist}}\n\nPhiladelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in 1792. It was nearly completed by the time of Adam's 1797 inauguration. However, Adams declined to occupy it saying he did not have Congressional authorization to lease the building. It remained vacant until it was sold to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1800.{{r|Westcott1894}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=100px>\nFile:The First Presidential Mansion.jpg|First Presidential Mansion: [[Samuel Osgood House]], Manhattan, New York.

However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|978-0-9727611-0-9}}). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: \"(a) In General.\u2014The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\" The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as \"[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]\" and as \"[https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]\" on its website.}} 1791 [[L'Enfant Plan|plan]] for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C.{{r|IYuWd}} Washington and his Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the White House, and the Capital, would be chosen in a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]].{{r|Frary}}\n\nAlthough all proposals for the Capital were rejected, an acceptable drawing for the White House submitted by [[James Hoban]] was selected from several including one submitted anonymously by Jefferson himself.{{r|np7Jl}}\n\nHoban was born in Ireland and trained at the [[Dublin Society of Arts]]. He emigrated to the US after the revolution, first seeking work in Philadelphia and later finding success in [[South Carolina]] where he designed several buildings including the state capitol at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. Hoban ultimately supervised the construction of both the US Capitol and the White House.{{r|u1v6F}}\n\nPresident Washington visited [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in May 1791 on his \"Southern Tour\", and saw the under-construction [[Charleston County Courthouse]] designed by Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.{{r|eYnQA}}\n\nOn July 16, 1792, the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.{{r|nUHxy}}\n\n===Design influences===\nThe building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] or in [[Andrea Palladio]] styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the [[Renaissance]] which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture ([[Palladian architecture]]). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]], which later became the seat of the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament).{{r|Ywh2c}} Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in [[White House Historical Association]] publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]], a neoclassical country house located in [[La Bachellerie]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the [[French Revolution]] for twenty years and then finally built 1812\u20131817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).{{r|France?}} The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that [[Thomas Jefferson]], during his tour of [[Bordeaux]] in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale d'Architecture]] (Bordeaux Architectural College).{{r|johnson}}  On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].{{r|France?}}\n\n===Construction===\n\nConstruction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.{{r|yLpeA}} The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] and free [[African-American]] laborers, as well as employed Europeans.{{r|mJ52j}} Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, employed by Hoban,{{r|whha overview}} as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \"fish scale\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. There are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the [[Croatia]]n island of [[Bra\u010d]] (specifically the [[Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a]] querry whose stone was used to build the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Diocletian's Palace|palace]] of [[Diocletian|Emperor Diocletian]]) was used in the original construction of the building, contrarily researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from [[Aquia Creek]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], [[Virginia]], as importing the stone would be too costly.{{r|zQgqd}}{{r|L0Ydi}}{{r|J1ZuL}} The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|232371.83|1800}}}} today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.{{r|XEjY4}}\n\nShortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] for a \"palace\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.{{r|whha overview}} The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa\u00e7ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were [[whitewash]]ed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nSeveral [[replicas of the White House]] have been constructed.\n\n===Architectural description===\n\nThe north front is the principal fa\u00e7ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and [[parapet]], thus the fa\u00e7ade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a [[Prostyle|prostyle portico]] (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a [[porte cochere]]. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented [[pediment]]s, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a [[lunette]] [[fanlight]]. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral [[festoon]]. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded [[parapet]].\n\nThe mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is a combination of the [[Palladian]] and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa\u00e7ade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa\u00e7ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor [[double staircase]] leading to an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[colonnade]]d [[loggia]] (with the [[Truman Balcony]] at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n===Naming conventions===\n\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the \"President's Palace\", \"Presidential Mansion\", or \"President's House\".{{r|xVvhI}} The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811.{{r|8Rmlj}} A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the [[Burning of Washington]], white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,{{r|A3bMb}} giving the building its namesake hue.{{r|EdqBf}} The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the formal name by having \"White House\u2013Washington\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.{{r|Qtiju}}{{r|WH facts}} The current letterhead wording and arrangement \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath goes back to the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{r|WH facts}}\n\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the United States may have derived from [[Martha Washington]]'s home, [[White House (plantation)|White House Plantation]] in Virginia, where the nation's first president had courted the first lady in the mid-18th century.{{r|D7o2v}}\n\n==Evolution of the White House==\n\n===Early use, the 1814 fire, and rebuilding===\n\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to take residence in the building.{{r|whha overview}} The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\"{{r|whha state dining room}} \nFranklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.{{r|whha state dining room}}\n\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the \"pleasant country residence\"{{r|NRJJd}} in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\"{{r|sacjA}}), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.{{r|whha overview}} Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nIn 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the White House was set ablaze by British troops{{r|whha east room}} during the [[Burning of Washington]], in retaliation for burning of [[Port Dover]] and other towns in [[Upper Canada]]; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,{{r|whha east room}} and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by [[HMS Fantome (1810)|HMS ''Fantome'']] sank en route to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] off [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]] during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,{{r|K9M68}}{{r|iDYQ3}} even though ''Fantome'' had no involvement in that action.{{r|2ZhT4}}\n\nAfter the fire, President [[James Madison]] resided in [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|the Octagon House]] from 1814 to 1815, and then the [[Seven Buildings]] from 1815 to the end of his term.{{r|KQzqy}} Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south [[portico]] was constructed in 1824 during the [[James Monroe]] administration; the north portico was built six years later.{{r|whha overview}} Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.{{r|tbe3z}} An elliptical portico at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Rastignac]] in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} although this matter is one of great debate.{{r|wSPdx}} Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in|Viceregal Lodge]] (now ''\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in'', residence of the [[President of Ireland]]), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.{{r|wh museum 1825-1872}} For the North Portico, a variation on the [[Ionic Order]] was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:The President's House by George Munger, 1814-1815 - Crop.jpg|The White House as it looked following the fire of August 24, 1814\nFile:White-House.jpg|[[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Latrobe]]'s West Wing Colonnade, in this nineteenth-century engraved view, is now the [[James S.

The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for [[malaria]] and other unhealthy conditions.{{r|epstein}} Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at [[Meridian Hill Park|Meridian Hill]] in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.{{r|epstein}} Another site under consideration was Metropolis View, today the campus of [[The Catholic University of America]].{{r|MqIIY}}\n\n[[File:WhiteHouseProposedAddition.jpg|thumb|right|Additions proposed by architect Frederick D. Owen (1901).]]\n[[File:1860s White House.jpg|thumb|right|The [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] during the [[Abraham Lincoln]] administration]]\n\nWhen [[Chester A. Arthur]] took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed [[Lucretia Garfield]] moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a [[public auction]].{{r|reeves268}} All that was saved were bust portraits of [[John Adams]] and [[Martin Van Buren]].{{r|reevesn473}} A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\n\nIn the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of [[gold leaf]], and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful [[Tracery|traceries]] woven to spell \"USA\". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.{{r|reeves269}}{{r|bFjvZ}}\n\nIn 1891, First Lady [[Caroline Harrison]] proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.{{r|epstein}} A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.{{r|epstein}} These plans were ultimately rejected.\n\nHowever, in 1902 [[Theodore Roosevelt]] hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.{{r|Yl4bH}}{{r|R6fqD}}  [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the president's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.{{r|whha overview}}\n\nPresident [[William Howard Taft]] enlisted the help of architect [[Nathan C. Wyeth]] to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the [[Oval Office]].{{r|epstein}}  In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time.{{r|AbbottRice|p=17}} The West Wing was damaged by fire on Christmas Eve 1929; [[Herbert Hoover]] and his aides moved back into it on April 14, 1930.{{r|oeGVZ}} \nIn the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]].{{r|whha overview}}\n\n===Truman reconstruction===\n{{main|White House Reconstruction}}\n[[File:The Shell of the White House during the Renovation-05-17-1950.jpg|thumb|[[Harry S.

Truman]]{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.{{r|whha overview}} By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at [[Blair House]] from 1949 to 1951.{{r|OA7bu}} The work, done by the firm of [[Philadelphia]] contractor [[John McShain]], required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5.7|1951|r=0}}}} million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{r|vm2mG}} Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.{{r|wh museum 1948-1952}} Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.{{r|whha overview}} The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.{{r|whha overview}} While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814\u20131816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawn into paneling; the walls of the [[Vermeil Room]], [[Library (White House)|Library]], [[China Room]], and [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.{{r|UtzOl}}\n\n===Jacqueline Kennedy restoration===\n[[File:BoudinRedRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] as designed by [[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] during the presidency of John F.

She enlisted the help of [[Henry Francis du Pont]] of the [[Winterthur Museum]] to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the [[Crowninshield family]], [[Jane Engelhard]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], and the Oppenheimer family.\n\n[[St\u00e9phane Boudin]] of the [[Maison Jansen|House of Jansen]], a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], French Empire for the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], American Empire for the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], Louis XVI for the [[Yellow Oval Room]], and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the [[Treaty Room]]. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.{{r|wh museum kennedy}} In the [[Diplomatic Reception Room (White House)|Diplomatic Reception Room]], Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \"Vue de l'Am\u00e9rique Nord\" wallpaper which [[Zuber & Cie]] had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\n\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.{{r|OLizx}} Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\n\nKennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public in [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F.

This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.{{r|AbbottRice|p=29}}\n\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.{{r|YsEpb}} Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family\u2014usually represented by the first lady, the [[White House Office of the Curator|White House curator]], and the [[White House Chief Usher|chief usher]]\u2014to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.{{r|nJVBo}}\n\nDuring the Nixon Administration (1969\u20131974), First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]].{{r|t2zEz}} Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.{{r|MF74M}} Her husband created the modern press briefing room over [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s old swimming pool.{{r|press room}} Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.{{r|gMser}}\n\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.{{r|gff8t}} A Carter-era innovation, a set of [[solar heating|solar water heating panels]] that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.{{r|wq6cM}}{{r|Burdick}} Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.{{r|da1980}} The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.{{r|da1980}}\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] refurbished some rooms with the assistance of [[Arkansas]] decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, [[State Dining Room of the White House|State Dining Room]], Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.{{r|wh makeover}} During the administration of [[George W. Bush]], First Lady [[Laura Bush]] refurbished the Lincoln Bedroom in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], and theater were also refurbished.{{r|wh makeover}}\n\nThe White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who used a wheelchair because of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his paralytic illness]]. In the 1990s, [[Hillary Clinton]], at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy [[wheelchair]] access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.{{r|Burdick}} These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. 167 solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.{{r|FCAxL}} In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] had a set of [[solar panel]]s installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.{{r|ztiyM}}{{r|BA0aA}}\n\n===Layout and amenities===\n\nToday the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central [[Executive Residence]] flanked by the [[East Wing]] and [[West Wing]]. The [[White House Chief Usher|Chief Usher]] coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes: six stories and 55,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> (5,100 m<sup>2</sup>) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the [[White House Family Theater]]{{r|JDYhZ}}), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.{{r|WH facts}} It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.{{r|bumiller200901}}\n{{multiple image\n | align =center\n | direction =horizontal\n | perrow = 3\n | image1 = White House and grounds.png\n | width1 = 68\n | caption1 = Layout of entire site\n | image2 = WHComplex.svg\n | width2 = 300\n | caption2 = White House Complex\n | image3 = White House West Wing FloorPlan1.svg\n | width3 = 168\n | caption3 = [[West Wing]]\n | image4 = WHground.svg\n | width4 = 150\n | caption4 = Ground floor\n | image5 = White House State Floor.svg\n | width5 = 153\n | caption5 = State floor\n | image6 = White House FloorPlan2.svg\n | width6 = 150\n | caption6 = Second floor (residence)\n}}\n\n===Executive Residence===\n{{Main|Executive Residence}}\n\nThe original residence is in the center. Two [[colonnade]]s\u2014one on the east and one on the west\u2014designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The [[Executive Residence]] houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the [[East Room]], [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], [[State Dining Room]], [[Family Dining Room]], [[Cross Hall]], [[Entrance Hall]], and [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]].{{r|OwkS5}} The Ground Floor is made up of the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]], [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]], [[China Room]], [[Vermeil Room]], [[White House Library|Library]], the main kitchen, and other offices.{{r|8vyYA}} The second floor family residence includes the [[Yellow Oval Room]], [[East Sitting Hall|East]] and [[West Sitting Hall]]s, the White House Master Bedroom, [[President's Dining Room]], the [[Treaty Room]], [[Lincoln Bedroom]] and [[Queens' Bedroom]], as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.{{r|S4zYx}} The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).{{r|gqDUm}}\n\n===West Wing===\n{{Main|West Wing}}\n\nThe West Wing houses the president's office (the [[Oval Office]]) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], where the president conducts business meetings and where the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meets,{{r|kzExn}} as well as the [[White House Situation Room]], [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room]], and [[Roosevelt Room]].{{r|cQOP2}} In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cables and [[LCD]] screens for the display of charts and graphs.{{r|press room2}} The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8 million, out of which news outlets paid $2 million.{{r|press room2}} In September 2010, [[White House Big Dig|a two-year project]] began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure.{{r|vyYFd}}\n\nSome members of the President's staff are located in the adjacent [[Old Executive Office Building]], formerly the State War and Navy building, and sometimes known as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.{{r|press room2}}\n\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a [[sound stage]] and used as the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] for the popular television show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.{{r|wKroZ}}\n\n===East Wing===\n{{Main|East Wing}}\n\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]], and the White House Social Office. [[Rosalynn Carter]], in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\". The East Wing was built during [[World War II]] in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]].\n\n===Grounds===\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]], which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger [[greenhouse]]s were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, commissioned by  President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the [[White House Rose Garden]] was redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]], which was begun by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old [[American Elm|American Elm (''Ulmus americana'' L.)]] tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|intense flooding]]. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'') planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson's recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years; but in 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring.{{r|CcD01}}{{r|KpnOF}} Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.{{r|U4C8Y}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:White-house-floor1-cross-Hall.jpg|The [[Cross Hall]], connecting the [[State Dining Room]] and the [[East Room]] on the State Floor\nFile:WhSouthLawn.JPEG|[[Marine One]] prepares to land on the South Lawn, where [[State Arrival Ceremony|State Arrival Ceremonies]] are held.\nFile:White House, Blue Sky.jpg|View from the south, with fountain\nFile:1122-WAS-The White House.JPG|View from the north\nFile:The White House at night, 2011.jpg|White House at night, view from the north\n</gallery>\n\n==Public access and security==\n{{See also|White House Visitors Office|List of White House security breaches}}\n\n===Historical accessibility===\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] followed him home, where he greeted them in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President [[Andrew Jackson]] had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected [[Grover Cleveland]] arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President [[Bill Clinton]] briefly revived the New Year's Day open house in his first term.\n\nThe White House remained accessible in other ways; President [[Abraham Lincoln]] complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like \"General\" [[Daniel Pratt (eccentric)|Daniel Pratt]], as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Aviation incidents===\n{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}<!-- April 15, 2015 incident; possibly January 2015 if drones count -->\nIn February 1974, a stolen army helicopter [[1974 White House helicopter incident|landed without authorization]] on the White House's grounds.{{r|bXgDO}} Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane flown by [[Frank Eugene Corder]] crashed on the White House grounds, and he died instantly.{{r|JO4kZ}}\n\nAs a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.{{r|ZScbt}}\n\n===Closure of Pennsylvania Avenue===\n[[File:U.S. Secret Service Agent.jpg|left|thumb|A uniformed U.S. Secret Service Agent on Pennsylvania Avenue.]]\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, the [[United States Secret Service]] closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]].\n\nAfter [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], this change was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and [[the Ellipse]].{{r|VuiCP}} In response to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.{{r|F17OZ}}\n\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the [[Old Executive Office Building]] to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.{{r|6Dutd}} White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after [[Budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]].{{r|1xVao}} The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.{{r|msl6S}}\n\n===Protection===\nThe White House Complex is protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[United States Park Police]].\n\n[[NASAMS]] (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration. The same NASAMS units have since been used to protect the president and all airspace around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.{{r|2YCbp}}{{r|D55GA}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:PennAveWhiteHouse.jpg|For security reasons, the section of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House is closed to all vehicular traffic, except government officials.\nFile:US $20 Series 2006 Reverse.jpg|North front of the White House on the reverse (back) of the [[United States twenty-dollar bill|U.S. $20 bill]].\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Pedro Casanave]]\n* [[Camp David]]\n* [[Germantown White House]]\n* [[Graphics and Calligraphy Office]]\n* [[List of largest houses in the United States]]\n* [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.]]\n* [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States]]\n* [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States#Western White House]]\n* [[Number One Observatory Circle]], residence of the Vice President\n* [[Reportedly haunted locations in the District of Columbia#White House|Reported White House ghosts]]\n* [[:Category:Rooms in the White House]]\n* [[White House Acquisition Trust]]\n* [[White House Chief Calligrapher]]\n* [[White House Chief Floral Designer]]\n* [[White House Christmas tree]]\n* [[White House Communications Agency]]\n* [[White House Endowment Trust]]\n* [[White House Executive Chef]]\n* [[White House Fellows]]\n* ''[[White House History]]''\n* [[White House Social Secretary]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2013a}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Baker1897\">{{cite book|last=Baker|first=William Spohn|title=Washington After the Revolution: 1784-1799|url=https://archive.org/details/washingtonafter00bakegoog|accessdate=January 15, 2020|year=1897|page=[https://archive.org/details/washingtonafter00bakegoog/page/n125 118]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mvorg\">{{cite web |title=Presidential Residency in New York |url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/presidential-residency-in-new-york/ |website=mountvernon.org |publisher=The Fred W.
