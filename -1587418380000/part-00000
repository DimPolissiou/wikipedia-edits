While considered a novel approach by some, it has raised controversy amongst enthusiasts and collectors, increasing the amount of difficulty in obtaining a complete collection{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Purchases from many retailers make no guarantees regarding the contents of a particular packet. Despite attempts to obfuscate the contents of these packets, the bags of Series 1 and 2 have a second figurine-specific bar code on the rear of the packet, next to the EAN/UPC product bar code (which is unique to each series). This has allowed customers to identify individual figures within the packet, significantly decreasing the amount of money and effort required to obtain a complete collection, and eliminates the possibility of unintentionally receiving duplicates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bricks.inof.de/docs/minifig-barcodes/index-en.html|title=Barcodes of the Collectible Minifigures|publisher=bricks.inof.de}}</ref> There are also apps for both [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices that utilize these bar codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.betterthantomorrow.com/minicollector|title=Mini Collector|date=30 August 2010|access-date=17 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003125137/http://blog.betterthantomorrow.com/minicollector/|archive-date=3 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLego has eliminated the figurine-specific bar codes on all Series 3 and 4 packets and replaced them with a braille-like system of dots embossed in the lower seal of the bag.

While considered a novel approach by some, it has raised controversy amongst enthusiasts and collectors, increasing the amount of difficulty in obtaining a complete collection{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Purchases from many retailers make no guarantees regarding the contents of a particular packet. Despite attempts to obfuscate the contents of these packets, the bags of Series 1 and 2 have a second figurine-specific bar code on the rear of the packet, next to the EAN/UPC product bar code (which is unique to each series). This has allowed customers to identify individual figures within the packet, significantly decreasing the amount of money and effort required to obtain a complete collection, and eliminates the possibility of unintentionally receiving duplicates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bricks.inof.de/docs/minifig-barcodes/index-en.html|title=Barcodes of the Collectible Minifigures|publisher=bricks.inof.de}}</ref> There are also apps for both [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices that utilize these bar codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.betterthantomorrow.com/minicollector|title=Mini Collector|date=30 August 2010|access-date=17 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003125137/http://blog.betterthantomorrow.com/minicollector/|archive-date=3 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLego has eliminated the figurine-specific bar codes on all Series 3 and 4 packets and replaced them with a braille-like system of dots embossed in the lower seal of the bag.

He published his first translation from Egyptian in 1906. He translated inscriptions for many important excavations and sites, including [[Fayum]], [[Saqqara]], [[Amarna]], [[Giza]] and [[Luxor]] (including [[Tutankhamun]]).  He was curator at the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] and at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|University Museum]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1934 he was appointed [[Professor of Egyptology (Oxford)|Professor of Egyptology]] at the [[University of Oxford]], a chair he held until his death in 1950.\n\n== Early life and background ==\nGunn was born in London, the son of George Gunn, a member of the [[London Stock Exchange]], and Julia Alice Philp.  His paternal grandparents were Theophilus Miller Gunn [[FRCS]], a prominent London surgeon originally from [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]], and Mary Dally Battiscombe, from [[Bridport]].  Theophilus's father was John Gunn, a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] preacher, brother of [[Daniel Gunn (minister)|Daniel Gunn]], originally from [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] in Scotland, but who spent most of his career in Chard.  Both sides of the family were non-conformist.  His unusual first name came from his grandmother's maiden name.\n\nHe was educated at [[Bedales School]], [[Westminster School]] and [[Allhallows College|Allhallows School, Honiton]]. These [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] were more liberal than the conventional Victorian Public Schools, and provided an open-minded environment.  Bedales, in those days, attracted nonconformists, agnostics and liberal Jews.  It had connections to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] intellectual circles, and to the [[Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family|Wedgwoods, Darwins]], [[Huxley family|Huxleys]] and [[Trevelyan baronets|Trevelyans]].<ref name=Dracula/> At the age of 14, while still in school, he began to read [[hieroglyphs]].<ref name=JEA/> He then went to a tutor in [[Wiesbaden]], but returned to London at the age of 18, due to a change in family finances.<ref name=Ingram/>\n\nHis father expected Jack to follow him to a career in the [[City of London|City]], but he found he hated it. He tried banking, engineering, but they did not suit him. From 1908 to 1911 he was the private secretary to [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]], which suited him better.<ref name=Brit_acad/> In 1911, he moved to Paris where he worked as a journalist for the [[Daily Mail|''Continental Daily Mail.'']]<ref name=JEA/><ref name=Times/>\n\nHe demonstrated a proficiency in languages from an early age, and began working with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] while still in school.  While often described as entirely self-taught, the [[Griffith Institute]] Archives say that he studied hieroglyphs at [[University College, London]], as a student of [[Margaret Murray]].<ref name=Brit_acad/><ref name=Griffith/><ref name=Women_arch/>\n\n== Early career, and involvement with the occult==\nIn 1905 he played the role of \"Priest of the Floods and Storms\" in the [[Theosophical Society]] of London's production of ''The Shrine of the Golden Hawk'', written and directed by [[Florence Farr]].<ref name=Theosophy2/> In 1906 his translation of \"[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep|The Instruction of Ptah-Hotep]] and [[Instructions of Kagemni|The Instruction of Ke'Gemni]]\" (from the [[Prisse Papyrus]] in Paris) was published as part of the \"Wisdom of the East\" series of [[wisdom literature]].<ref name=Ptah_1906/> He later considered the translation to be premature and said: \"I entirely repudiate my translation of the Prisse Papyrus, so far as one can repudiate what is in print.\"<ref name=Brit_acad/>  But it was considered a considerable improvement over previous translations, and is still in print.<ref name=Ptah_2010/>\n\nHe also seems to have been involved with the leaders of both factions of the [[occult]] community in London at the time: [[Arthur Edward Waite]] of the [[magical order]], the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]], and [[Aleister Crowley]], who created his own order, [[A\u2234A\u2234]], after he left the Golden Dawn. On 10 January 1906, Gunn was inducted into Waite's \"Independent and Rectified Rite\".<ref name=Kuntz_1996/>  R. A. Gilbert's biography of Waite describes Gunn as \"an artist, an Egyptologist and an oriental linguist\", and says that, in 1910, he \"argued at great length over the correct transliteration of Hebrew terms used in the Grade rituals.\"<ref name=Gilbert_Waite/> Crowley based his new religion, [[Thelema]], on the translation of the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]], also referred to as the  \"Stele of Revealing\".  He originally (1904) had it translated by the assistant curator of the [[Boulaq Museum]] in Cairo, under the supervision of the Egyptologist [[\u00c9mile Brugsch]].  In 1912, he arranged for another translation, by Gunn and Gardiner.<ref name=Crowley_stele/>\n\nCrowley's periodical, ''[[The Equinox]]'', contained a series of parodies aimed at Waite.  In two of these, Battiscombe Gunn appeared as a minor character.  In Volume 1, number 8 (Sept. 1912), Gunn appears in \"Waite's Wet\", a fictitious account of Waite's return to Crowley's group: \"Waite's photograph, frock-coat and all, was carried in its red plush frame shoulder high by Mr. Battiscombe Gunn...\".  In Volume 1, number 10 (Sept 1913), Gunn appears in \"Dead Weight\" a false description of Waite's death (he actually lived until the 1940s): \"Mr. Battiscombe Gunn was rapidly revising the funeral arrangements of the dying saint, which he proposed to found on some unedited documents of the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]], which showed conclusively that the sacred lotus was, in reality, a corset, and the Weapon of Men Thu a button-hook.\" Letters from Crowley to Gunn indicate that it was more than a casual acquaintance.<ref name=Vinson_Chicago/>\n\nBy 1918, Gunn had lost interest in the [[occult]], but had become an admirer of another former member of the Golden Dawn, the British [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett]], also known as [[Bhikkhu]] Ananda Metteyya.  Gunn was responsible for reintroducing Bennett and [[Clifford Bax]]<ref name=Some_I_Knew/><ref name=Inland_Far/> (Bax was also a friend of Gunn's first wife, Meena, and her son [[Spike Hughes|Patrick, later Spike, Hughes]].<ref name=opening_bars/>). This led to Bennett delivering a series of discourses on Buddhism in Bax's studio, in 1919 and 1920.  These were incorporated in Bennett's ''The Wisdom of the Aryas'' (1923).\n\nGunn experienced a conflict between the scientific and secular aspect of his professional career, and his spiritual interests.<ref name=Inland_Far/> He next turned his interest to [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]].  By 1922,<ref name=Inland_Far/> he was spending the summers (when he was not on excavations in Egypt) in Vienna, where Meena was studying under Freud. \n \nBy the 1930s Gunn had turned completely against the occult. He was highly antagonistic to [[Frederic H. Wood]], who claimed that a long-dead Egyptian princess spoke, in ancient Egyptian, through \"Rosemary\".  This form of \"speaking in tongues\" is known as [[xenoglossy]]. Rosemary's utterances were recorded phonetically and an Egyptologist, Mr. Hulme, claimed that Rosemary's speech conformed to the ancient Egyptian tongue, and could be translated into English.  In the June 1937, issue of the ''[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]]'', Gunn claimed that Hulme had manipulated the transcriptions to fit his own expectations of what he imagined ancient Egyptian to sound like.<ref name=JEA_Rosemary/> A later examination by [[John D. Ray]] (then the Sir Herbert Thompson Professor of Egyptology at the University of Cambridge) confirmed \"there could be no mistaking Hulme's incompetence\".<ref name=Past_Times/> Furthermore, both Gunn and Ray pointed out that Rosemary's visions of camels as domestic transport were inconsistent, as camels were not used for transport in [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty Egypt]].  Wood's book on the subject, ''Egyptian Miracle'', makes repeated derogatory references to Gunn, including \"Also, the passing of our opponent Battiscombe Gunn, in 1950, can be recorded with the comment, De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\"<ref name=Wood/>\n\n== Professional career ==\nBefore he went to Paris in 1911, he had met [[Alan Gardiner]].  They remained lifelong friends, and Gardiner was named in his will to co-ordinate the disposition of his professional papers. In 1913 he visited Egypt for the first time, as [[Epigraphy|epigrapher]] on the staff of [[Flinders Petrie]]'s excavation at Harageh, near [[Fayum]], working with [[Reginald Engelbach]].<ref name=Harageh/> The outbreak of [[World War I]] prevented him returning for the following season.  Returning to England, he enlisted in the [[Artists Rifles]], but was invalided out in 1915.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1920 he worked as an assistant to Gardiner, primarily in the lexicographical work which led to the 1947 publication of ''Ancient Egyptian Onomastica.'' Of this period, Gardiner said: \"He was a real Bohemian and much of his research was carried on in his own lodgings at dead of night.\"<ref name=Gardiner/> A series of articles written while working with Gardiner led to the publication, in 1924, of his major publication, ''Studies in Egyptian Syntax.''<ref name=studies/> In this book, he identified the unusual syntactical relationship between negation and tense, now known as Gunn's Rule.  Gunn's Rule still appears in modern textbooks.<ref name=read/>\n\nIn the winter of 1921 to 1922 he was a member of the team led by [[Thomas Eric Peet]] and [[Leonard Woolley]] excavating at [[Amarna]].<ref name=Amarna/> He was then appointed (1922 to 1928) to the staff of the Service des antiquit\u00e9s de l'\u00c9gypte (the Service of Antiquities of the Egyptian government).  During this time he worked with [[Cecil Mallaby Firth|Cecil Firth]] in the investigations of the pyramid of [[Teti]]. He assisted in the translation of ostraca from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]].  Using field glasses, he was able to read the name [[Sneferu]] in the tomb which was eventually shown to be the tomb of [[Hetepheres I]].\n\nHe became assistant conservator of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] in 1928, the year in which his son, [[J. B. Gunn]] was born.  During the time he lived in [[Maadi]], outside Cairo, he experimented with the manufacture of [[papyrus]], growing the plant in his garden. He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen, and produced successful examples of papyrus, one of which was exhibited in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.<ref name=Cerny/><ref name=Lucas/>\n\nHe moved to the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|University Museum]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1931 as curator of the Egyptian section. In 1934 he was given an honorary M.A. at Oxford, so he could be appointed Professor of Egyptology at the [[University of Oxford]], a chair he held until his death.  He was made a Fellow of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]], and was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1943.\n\nWhile at Oxford, he devoted himself to his pupils and his classes, at the expense of his own research. He was Editor of the ''[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]]'' from 1934 to 1939, and was in active correspondence with a large number of other Egyptologists, all over the world.  During [[World War II]] several of his students (including [[Alec Naylor Dakin]]) worked on code breaking at [[Bletchley Park]]. Other students include [[Ricardo Caminos]], [[Warren Royal Dawson]], [[Peter Lewis Shinnie]],<ref name=Dracula/> [[Paul E. Kahle]] and [[T. G. H. James]].\n\n[[Agatha Christie]]'s 1944 detective novel ''[[Death Comes as the End]],'' set in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], is based on a series of letters that he translated.\n\nFor the book ''Land of Enchanters: Egyptian Short Stories from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'', published in 1947, he provided the English translation of both the Ancient Egyptian and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] stories.<ref name=Enchanters/> A revised edition was published in 2002.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Meacham 50th Anniversary BW.jpg|right|thumb|Family picture in 1935 Back Row: Charles S.

She was born Lillian Meacham, in Maidstone, Kent, but had spent most of her teenage years in Cape Town, South Africa, where her father, C.S. Meacham, was brewery manager and corporate chemist for Ohlsson's Brewery.<ref name=opening_bars/> She was given the nickname Meena by [[Alfred Richard Orage|Orage]], who said that her childhood blond plaits reminded him of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]].  In her late teens, she returned to London to study piano at the [[Royal Academy of Music]].  Her younger sister was Gwendoline Meacham, who became a Scots Nationalist, and changed her name to [[Wendy Wood (artist)|Wendy Wood]].\n\nIn addition to playing piano, for which she won 2 gold medals and then stopped playing, she became part of the circle around [[G. B. Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]].  She was a member of the [[Fabian Society]] and attended [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] lectures.  In 1907, not long before her marriage to Hughes, she had a brief affair with the sculptor, printmaker and typographer [[Eric Gill]], with whom both she and Jack were lifelong friends.<ref name=Gill/> Jack rented a cottage in Ditchling, where Gill was located, in the summer of 1919, and Jack, Meena and Pat all stayed there.<ref name=opening_bars/>\n\nIn 1915, in the midst of World War I, Meena was in Florence, Italy, visiting another suitor, a \"rich American\". Jack escorted her seven-year-old son, Patrick Hughes (later [[Spike Hughes]]) from London to Florence, and then returned.  In his autobiography, \"Opening Bars\", Pat describes his part in her decision to return to England and marry Jack.<ref name=opening_bars/> Her divorce from Herbert Hughes, however, was not finalised until 1922.<ref name=chelsea/>\n\nDuring the early 1920s, while Jack was working in Egypt during the season, Meena spent quite a lot of time in central Europe, and Jack spent his summers there.  In 1924, Meena studied psychoanalysis with [[Sigmund Freud]] in Vienna, and [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] in Budapest.  During this time, Jack was asked to visit Freud and look at his Egyptian antiquities.  He never said anything to Freud, but he was convinced that nearly all of them were fakes.<ref name=second_movement/> Meena was a practising psychoanalyst for the following 45 years, into her 80s.  While Jack was Professor of Egyptology at Oxford, Meena maintained a psychoanalytical practice on [[Harley Street]] in London.  After World War II she worked closely with [[Anna Freud]], and in the 1960s she practised in the US\n\nAfter she completed her psychoanalytic training, Meena accompanied Jack while he was working in Egypt, and in 1928, their son [[J. B. Gunn]], known as Iain, (later a physicist) was born in Cairo.\n\nIn 1940, Meena and Jack were divorced, as Meena wanted to marry Alex Grey-Clarke, a young Harley Street doctor.\n\nIn 1948 Jack married Constance Rogers, a librarian at the [[Ashmolean Museum]].\n\nJack's death, early in 1950, was preceded by some characteristic last words.  He sent for his son Iain and Iain's fianc\u00e9e, and as he lay on his death-bed, delivered a wise and paternal little speech on the advantages of marriage, and gave the two youngsters his blessing.  Then he turned to his wife and said: \"I shall look a bloody fool if I don't die after that, won't I?\", and died within a few moments.\"<ref name=second_movement/>\n\n== References ==\n*[[Dictionary of National Biography]]\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Theosophy2>{{Citation\n  | author = Council of the Federation\n  | title = TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECOND ANNUAL CONGRESS OF THE FEDERATION OF EUROPEAN SECTIONS OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY HELD IN LONDON JULY 6TH, 7Th, 8TH, 9Th, AND 1OTH, 1905\n  | page=21\n  | year = 1905\n  | location = London\n  }}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Brit_acad>{{cite journal\n  | last = Dawson\n  | first = Warren R.\n  | title = Battiscombe George Gunn 1883 \u2013 1950\n  | journal =Proceedings of the British Academy\n  | volume = XXXVI\n  | publisher = Geoffrey Cumberlege\n  | location = London}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Griffith>{{citation\n  | title = Griffith Institute Archive: Gunn MSS\n  |url = http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/4gunn.html}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Women_arch>{{cite book\n  | editor = Getzel M.

He published his first translation from Egyptian in 1906. He translated inscriptions for many important excavations and sites, including [[Fayum]], [[Saqqara]], [[Amarna]], [[Giza]] and [[Luxor]] (including [[Tutankhamun]]).  He was curator at the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] and at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|University Museum]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1934 he was appointed [[Professor of Egyptology (Oxford)|Professor of Egyptology]] at the [[University of Oxford]], a chair he held until his death in 1950.\n\n== Early life and background ==\nGunn was born in London, the son of George Gunn, a member of the [[London Stock Exchange]], and Julia Alice Philp.  His paternal grandparents were Theophilus Miller Gunn [[FRCS]], a prominent London surgeon originally from [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]], and Mary Dally Battiscombe, from [[Bridport]].  Theophilus's father was John Gunn, a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] preacher, brother of [[Daniel Gunn (minister)|Daniel Gunn]], originally from [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] in Scotland, but who spent most of his career in Chard.  Both sides of the family were non-conformist.  His unusual first name came from his grandmother's maiden name.\n\nHe was educated at [[Bedales School]], [[Westminster School]] and [[Allhallows College|Allhallows School, Honiton]]. These [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] were more liberal than the conventional Victorian Public Schools, and provided an open-minded environment.  Bedales, in those days, attracted nonconformists, agnostics and liberal Jews.  It had connections to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] intellectual circles, and to the [[Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family|Wedgwoods, Darwins]], [[Huxley family|Huxleys]] and [[Trevelyan baronets|Trevelyans]].<ref name=Dracula/> At the age of 14, while still in school, he began to read [[hieroglyphs]].<ref name=JEA/> He then went to a tutor in [[Wiesbaden]], but returned to London at the age of 18, due to a change in family finances.<ref name=Ingram/>\n\nHis father expected Jack to follow him to a career in the [[City of London|City]], but he found he hated it. He tried banking, engineering, but they did not suit him. From 1908 to 1911 he was the private secretary to [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]], which suited him better.<ref name=Brit_acad/> In 1911, he moved to Paris where he worked as a journalist for the [[Daily Mail|''Continental Daily Mail.'']]<ref name=JEA/><ref name=Times/>\n\nHe demonstrated a proficiency in languages from an early age, and began working with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] while still in school.  While often described as entirely self-taught, the [[Griffith Institute]] Archives say that he studied hieroglyphs at [[University College, London]], as a student of [[Margaret Murray]].<ref name=Brit_acad/><ref name=Griffith/><ref name=Women_arch/>\n\n== Early career, and involvement with the occult==\nIn 1905 he played the role of \"Priest of the Floods and Storms\" in the [[Theosophical Society]] of London's production of ''The Shrine of the Golden Hawk'', written and directed by [[Florence Farr]].<ref name=Theosophy2/> In 1906 his translation of \"[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep|The Instruction of Ptah-Hotep]] and [[Instructions of Kagemni|The Instruction of Ke'Gemni]]\" (from the [[Prisse Papyrus]] in Paris) was published as part of the \"Wisdom of the East\" series of [[wisdom literature]].<ref name=Ptah_1906/> He later considered the translation to be premature and said: \"I entirely repudiate my translation of the Prisse Papyrus, so far as one can repudiate what is in print.\"<ref name=Brit_acad/>  But it was considered a considerable improvement over previous translations, and is still in print.<ref name=Ptah_2010/>\n\nHe also seems to have been involved with the leaders of both factions of the [[occult]] community in London at the time: [[Arthur Edward Waite]] of the [[magical order]], the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]], and [[Aleister Crowley]], who created his own order, [[A\u2234A\u2234]], after he left the Golden Dawn. On 10 January 1906, Gunn was inducted into Waite's \"Independent and Rectified Rite\".<ref name=Kuntz_1996/>  R. A. Gilbert's biography of Waite describes Gunn as \"an artist, an Egyptologist and an oriental linguist\", and says that, in 1910, he \"argued at great length over the correct transliteration of Hebrew terms used in the Grade rituals.\"<ref name=Gilbert_Waite/> Crowley based his new religion, [[Thelema]], on the translation of the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]], also referred to as the  \"Stele of Revealing\".  He originally (1904) had it translated by the assistant curator of the [[Boulaq Museum]] in Cairo, under the supervision of the Egyptologist [[\u00c9mile Brugsch]].  In 1912, he arranged for another translation, by Gunn and Gardiner.<ref name=Crowley_stele/>\n\nCrowley's periodical, ''[[The Equinox]]'', contained a series of parodies aimed at Waite.  In two of these, Battiscombe Gunn appeared as a minor character.  In Volume 1, number 8 (Sept. 1912), Gunn appears in \"Waite's Wet\", a fictitious account of Waite's return to Crowley's group: \"Waite's photograph, frock-coat and all, was carried in its red plush frame shoulder high by Mr. Battiscombe Gunn...\".  In Volume 1, number 10 (Sept 1913), Gunn appears in \"Dead Weight\" a false description of Waite's death (he actually lived until the 1940s): \"Mr. Battiscombe Gunn was rapidly revising the funeral arrangements of the dying saint, which he proposed to found on some unedited documents of the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]], which showed conclusively that the sacred lotus was, in reality, a corset, and the Weapon of Men Thu a button-hook.\" Letters from Crowley to Gunn indicate that it was more than a casual acquaintance.<ref name=Vinson_Chicago/>\n\nBy 1918, Gunn had lost interest in the [[occult]], but had become an admirer of another former member of the Golden Dawn, the British [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett]], also known as [[Bhikkhu]] Ananda Metteyya.  Gunn was responsible for reintroducing Bennett and [[Clifford Bax]]<ref name=Some_I_Knew/><ref name=Inland_Far/> (Bax was also a friend of Gunn's first wife, Meena, and her son [[Spike Hughes|Patrick, later Spike, Hughes]].<ref name=opening_bars/>). This led to Bennett delivering a series of discourses on Buddhism in Bax's studio, in 1919 and 1920.  These were incorporated in Bennett's ''The Wisdom of the Aryas'' (1923).\n\nGunn experienced a conflict between the scientific and secular aspect of his professional career, and his spiritual interests.<ref name=Inland_Far/> He next turned his interest to [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]].  By 1922,<ref name=Inland_Far/> he was spending the summers (when he was not on excavations in Egypt) in Vienna, where Meena was studying under Freud. \n \nBy the 1930s Gunn had turned completely against the occult. He was highly antagonistic to [[Frederic H. Wood]], who claimed that a long-dead Egyptian princess spoke, in ancient Egyptian, through \"Rosemary\".  This form of \"speaking in tongues\" is known as [[xenoglossy]]. Rosemary's utterances were recorded phonetically and an Egyptologist, Mr. Hulme, claimed that Rosemary's speech conformed to the ancient Egyptian tongue, and could be translated into English.  In the June 1937, issue of the ''[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]]'', Gunn claimed that Hulme had manipulated the transcriptions to fit his own expectations of what he imagined ancient Egyptian to sound like.<ref name=JEA_Rosemary/> A later examination by [[John D. Ray]] (then the Sir Herbert Thompson Professor of Egyptology at the University of Cambridge) confirmed \"there could be no mistaking Hulme's incompetence\".<ref name=Past_Times/> Furthermore, both Gunn and Ray pointed out that Rosemary's visions of camels as domestic transport were inconsistent, as camels were not used for transport in [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty Egypt]].  Wood's book on the subject, ''Egyptian Miracle'', makes repeated derogatory references to Gunn, including \"Also, the passing of our opponent Battiscombe Gunn, in 1950, can be recorded with the comment, De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\"<ref name=Wood/>\n\n== Professional career ==\nBefore he went to Paris in 1911, he had met [[Alan Gardiner]].  They remained lifelong friends, and Gardiner was named in his will to co-ordinate the disposition of his professional papers. In 1913 visited Egypt for the first time, as [[Epigraphy|epigrapher]] on the staff of [[Flinders Petrie]]'s excavation at Harageh, near [[Fayum]], working with [[Reginald Engelbach]].<ref name=Harageh/> The outbreak of [[World War I]] prevented him returning for the following season.  Returning to England, he enlisted in the [[Artists Rifles]], but was invalided out in 1915.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1920 he worked as an assistant to Gardiner, primarily in the lexicographical work which led to the 1947 publication of ''Ancient Egyptian Onomastica.'' Of this period, Gardiner said: \"He was a real Bohemian and much of his research was carried on in his own lodgings at dead of night.\"<ref name=Gardiner/> A series of articles written while working with Gardiner led to the publication, in 1924, of his major publication, ''Studies in Egyptian Syntax.''<ref name=studies/> In this book, he identified the unusual syntactical relationship between negation and tense, now known as Gunn's Rule.  Gunn's Rule still appears in modern textbooks.<ref name=read/>\n\nIn the winter of 1921 to 1922 he was a member of the team led by [[Thomas Eric Peet]] and [[Leonard Woolley]] excavating at [[Amarna]].<ref name=Amarna/> He was then appointed (1922 to 1928) to the staff of the Service des antiquit\u00e9s de l'\u00c9gypte (the Service of Antiquities of the Egyptian government).  During this time he worked with [[Cecil Mallaby Firth|Cecil Firth]] in the investigations of the pyramid of [[Teti]]. He assisted in the translation of ostraca from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]].  Using field glasses, he was able to read the name [[Sneferu]] in the tomb which was eventually shown to be the tomb of [[Hetepheres I]].\n\nHe became assistant conservator of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] in 1928, the year in which his son, [[J. B. Gunn]] was born.  During the time he lived in [[Maadi]], outside Cairo, he experimented with the manufacture of [[papyrus]], growing the plant in his garden. He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen, and produced successful examples of papyrus, one of which was exhibited in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.<ref name=Cerny/><ref name=Lucas/>\n\nHe moved to the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|University Museum]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1931 as curator of the Egyptian section. In 1934 he was given an honorary M.A. at Oxford, so he could be appointed Professor of Egyptology at the [[University of Oxford]], a chair he held until his death.  He was made a Fellow of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]], and was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1943.\n\nWhile at Oxford, he devoted himself to his pupils and his classes, at the expense of his own research. He was Editor of the ''[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]]'' from 1934 to 1939, and was in active correspondence with a large number of other Egyptologists, all over the world.  During [[World War II]] several of his students (including [[Alec Naylor Dakin]]) worked on code breaking at [[Bletchley Park]]. Other students include [[Ricardo Caminos]], [[Warren Royal Dawson]], [[Peter Lewis Shinnie]],<ref name=Dracula/> [[Paul E. Kahle]] and [[T. G. H. James]].\n\n[[Agatha Christie]]'s 1944 detective novel ''[[Death Comes as the End]],'' set in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], is based on a series of letters that he translated.\n\nFor the book ''Land of Enchanters: Egyptian Short Stories from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'', published in 1947, he provided the English translation of both the Ancient Egyptian and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] stories.<ref name=Enchanters/> A revised edition was published in 2002.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Meacham 50th Anniversary BW.jpg|right|thumb|Family picture in 1935 Back Row: Charles S.

B. Gunn]], grandson (physicist), Angela Hughes, great-granddaughter.]]\nBy 1915, Jack had become involved with Meena Hughes, the estranged wife of musician and Irish song collector [[Herbert Hughes (musicologist)|Herbert Hughes]].  She was born Lillian Meacham, in Maidstone, Kent, but had spent most of her teenage years in Cape Town, South Africa, where her father, C.S. Meacham, was brewery manager and corporate chemist for Ohlsson's Brewery.<ref name=opening_bars/> She was given the nickname Meena by [[Alfred Richard Orage|Orage]], who said that her childhood blond plaits reminded him of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]].  In her late teens, she returned to London to study piano at the [[Royal Academy of Music]].  Her younger sister was Gwendoline Meacham, who became a Scots Nationalist, and changed her name to [[Wendy Wood (artist)|Wendy Wood]].\n\nIn addition to playing piano, for which she won 2 gold medals and then stopped playing, she became part of the circle around [[G. B. Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]].  She was a member of the [[Fabian Society]] and attended [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] lectures.  In 1907, not long before her marriage to Hughes, she had a brief affair with the sculptor, printmaker and typographer [[Eric Gill]], with whom both she and Jack were lifelong friends.<ref name=Gill/> Jack rented a cottage in Ditchling, where Gill was located, in the summer of 1919, and Jack, Meena and Pat all stayed there.<ref name=opening_bars/>\n\nIn 1915, in the midst of World War I, Meena was in Florence, Italy, visiting another suitor, a \"rich American\". Jack escorted her seven-year-old son, Patrick Hughes (later [[Spike Hughes]]) from London to Florence, and then returned.  In his autobiography, \"Opening Bars\", Pat describes his part in her decision to return to England and marry Jack.<ref name=opening_bars/> Her divorce from Herbert Hughes, however, was not finalised until 1922.<ref name=chelsea/>\n\nDuring the early 1920s, while Jack was working in Egypt during the season, Meena spent quite a lot of time in central Europe, and Jack spent his summers there.  In 1924, Meena studied psychoanalysis with [[Sigmund Freud]] in Vienna, and [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] in Budapest.  During this time, Jack was asked to visit Freud and look at his Egyptian antiquities.  He never said anything to Freud, but he was convinced that nearly all of them were fakes.<ref name=second_movement/> Meena was a practising psychoanalyst for the following 45 years, into her 80s.  While Jack was Professor of Egyptology at Oxford, Meena maintained a psychoanalytical practice on [[Harley Street]] in London.  After World War II she worked closely with [[Anna Freud]], and in the 1960s she practised in the US\n\nAfter she completed her psychoanalytic training, Meena accompanied Jack while he was working in Egypt, and in 1928, their son [[J. B. Gunn]], known as Iain, (later a physicist) was born in Cairo.\n\nIn 1940, Meena and Jack were divorced, as Meena wanted to marry Alex Grey-Clarke, a young Harley Street doctor.\n\nIn 1948 Jack married Constance Rogers, a librarian at the [[Ashmolean Museum]].\n\nJack's death, early in 1950, was preceded by some characteristic last words.  He sent for his son Iain and Iain's fianc\u00e9e, and as he lay on his death-bed, delivered a wise and paternal little speech on the advantages of marriage, and gave the two youngsters his blessing.  Then he turned to his wife and said: \"I shall look a bloody fool if I don't die after that, won't I?\", and died within a few moments.\"<ref name=second_movement/>\n\n== References ==\n*[[Dictionary of National Biography]]\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Theosophy2>{{Citation\n  | author = Council of the Federation\n  | title = TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECOND ANNUAL CONGRESS OF THE FEDERATION OF EUROPEAN SECTIONS OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY HELD IN LONDON JULY 6TH, 7Th, 8TH, 9Th, AND 1OTH, 1905\n  | page=21\n  | year = 1905\n  | location = London\n  }}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Brit_acad>{{cite journal\n  | last = Dawson\n  | first = Warren R.\n  | title = Battiscombe George Gunn 1883 \u2013 1950\n  | journal =Proceedings of the British Academy\n  | volume = XXXVI\n  | publisher = Geoffrey Cumberlege\n  | location = London}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Griffith>{{citation\n  | title = Griffith Institute Archive: Gunn MSS\n  |url = http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/4gunn.html}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Women_arch>{{cite book\n  | editor = Getzel M.

One of the four founders, George H. Whiteley became the main operator of the company as a result of his experience as a ceramicist.  Whiteley's contributions to the company were invaluable as he was responsible for many innovations such as a patented process involving platinum rings that reduced tooth breakage.  Other innovations (credited to doctors like James Williams who were hired by the company for research purposes) included better fitting [[dentures]], tooth size for people of different face shapes and age specific colored teeth.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the early 1920s, the company selected European distributor E. de Trey & Sons as its primary marketer to Europe, however it quickly became the company's main distributor in the US also.  A rivalry between De Trey and the main other denture equipment producer at the time, Ash Company, nearly eliminated cash flows due to extreme price cutting. The problem was resolved when the two decided to merge their distribution businesses into one named the Amalgamated Dental Company Limited.  In 1925, 45% of Zahnfabrik (artificial teeth producer) was bought by Dentists' Supply and its distributor Amalgamated Dental bought a 30% interest in the manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://companies.jrank.org/pages/1203/Dentsply-International-Inc.html|title=Dentsply International Inc. Business Information, Profile, and History|website=companies.jrank.org}}</ref>\n\nHigh American tariffs and increased efforts to gain market share abroad, especially in Europe and Australia, led the company to set up more research and manufacturing centers abroad.  Its first foreign subsidiary was established in Australia as a means to acquire Natudryl Manufacturing.  In the 1950s and 1960s the company developed many of the ideas used by its equipment today like tooth cleaning machine Dentsply Cavitron and Neolux which improved the finish of plastic teeth. The company renamed itself Dentsply International in 1969 due to its products' brand name being more widely recognized.<ref name=\"sec\" />\n\nKey acquisitions by Dentists' Supply Company: LD Caulk Company in 1963, Ransom and Randolph Company in 1964, F&F Koenigkramer Company (chairs and stools). Largest was Amalgamated Dental Industrial (former distributor that played a major role in helping the company grow early on that also controlled Australia's largest dental supply chain) in 1976.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1993, after it acquired Gendex Corporation in a reverse takeover, the company went public on the [[NASDAQ]].

One of the four founders, George H. Whiteley became the main operator of the company as a result of his experience as a ceramicist.  Whiteley's contributions to the company were invaluable as he was responsible for many innovations such as a patented process involving platinum rings that reduced tooth breakage.  Other innovations (credited to doctors like James Williams who were hired by the company for research purposes) included better fitting [[dentures]], tooth size for people of different face shapes and age specific colored teeth.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the early 1920s, the company selected European distributor E. de Trey & Sons as its primary marketer to Europe, however it quickly became the company's main distributor in the US also.  A rivalry between De Trey and the main other denture equipment producer at the time, Ash Company, nearly eliminated cash flows due to extreme price cutting. The problem was resolved when the two decided to merge their distribution businesses into one named the Amalgamated Dental Company Limited.  In 1925, 45% of Zahnfabrik (artificial teeth producer) was bought by Dentists' Supply and its distributor Amalgamated Dental bought a 30% interest in the manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://companies.jrank.org/pages/1203/Dentsply-International-Inc.html|title=Dentsply International Inc. Business Information, Profile, and History|website=companies.jrank.org}}</ref>\n\nHigh American tariffs and increased efforts to gain market share abroad, especially in Europe and Australia, led the company to set up more research and manufacturing centers abroad.  Its first foreign subsidiary was established in Australia as a means to acquire Natudryl Manufacturing.  In the 1950s and 1960s the company developed many of the ideas used by its equipment today like tooth cleaning machine Dentsply Cavitron and Neolux which improved the finish of plastic teeth. The company renamed itself Dentsply International in 1969 due to its products' brand name being more widely recognized.<ref name=\"sec\" />\n\nKey acquisitions by Dentists' Supply Company: LD Caulk Company in 1963, Ransom and Randolph Company in 1964, F&F Koenigkramer Company (chairs and stools).

Once equipped and after basic training in London, High Wycombe and Dursley, Gloucestershire, 140th Regiment was assigned to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in November 1939.  It was not allocated to a particular Division but was under the control of GHQ and was allocated to individual forces depending on operational need.\n\n==Equipment==\n\nThe British Army in 1939 (unlike the German Infantry) was fully motorised under a mechanisation initiative. The Regiment operated 18-pounder guns towed behind Tractor units (mainly Morris or Guy \u2018Quads\u2019) with an ammunition trailer positioned between the tractor and gun.  The 140th Regiment\u2019s vehicles were identified by a number '10\u2019 in white on a red and blue background.  \n\nThe 18-pounder gun was a quick-firing field gun with the shell and cartridge fixed together.  It was based on a World War One weapon that had been modernised and was mounted on a Mark II carriage with rubber tyres.  The gun barrel was nickel-steel with a single-motion screw breech incorporating a cartridge extractor. The sights were on the right of the gun and incorporated a telescope and clinometer for indirect firing in an arc.  The effective range of the weapon could be 3-5 miles, although in the last days of the Battle of Cassel some of the firing was done over \u2018open sights\u2018 directly at German tanks only a few yards distant.\n\nIn 1939-40, British Field Artillery tactics were organised so as to provide groups of gun strong points, usually camouflaged by trees and supported by communication tracks to supplies and ammunition at the rear and with forward observation posts linked by telegraph wires.  In 1939-40, a Battery was sub-divided into a 12-gun, three Troop arrangement with each Troop sharing radio and communications.  Each gun would have been crewed by six men, a sergeant, in overall charge, the No.3 who was his right hand man, a Lance Bombardier who laid and fired the gun, numbers 2 and 4 loaded and rammed and numbers 5 and 6 fetched and carried the ammunition.\n\n==Officers==\n\nThe following Officers were recorded as members of the 140th Regiment Royal Artillery in March 1940\n\n*Lt Col C.J.

By 9 May 1940, the regiment was part of [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe Regiment advanced into Belgium on 10 May 1940 after the German invasion of Belgium and Holland and allegedly fired the first British artillery round during the Dyle line defence. On the evening of 16 May 1940, the Regiment withdrew via Brussels, Ninove and Tournai to the Escaut line as the French military situation worsened to the South. The Regiment was in action at the village of Ere/St Maur, where the Regiment's first battle casualties occurred. On the 22nd May 1940, the Regiment withdrew across the Franco-Belgian border into the French village of Sainguin-en-Melantois. The two Batteries were in operation together as a single fighting unit until 23 May 1940. After 23 May, as the British and French military situation worsened further, the two Batteries were separated and were assigned to different theatres. \n\n366 Battery, under the command of Lt-Colonel Brooks, was assigned to defend the Eastern escape corridor to Dunkirk and followed a route via Seclin and Lille to the Messines ridge in support of the British defence of the Ypres- Commines line. The Battery was positioned near the village of Wytschaete and inaction during 27-28 May 1940. The Battery withdrew under cover of darkness on 28 May 1940 having disabled its guns and successfully reached the Dunkirk beaches on 29 May 1940. A book written by Lt Colonel Brooks in 1941 entitled ''Grand Party'' (1)  records 366 Battery's involvement in the 1940 campaign including the evacuation at Dunkirk.\n\n367 Battery, together with Regimental HQ, under the command of Colonel C.J. Odling, was assigned to protect the Western corridor and was initially assigned to the 'MacForce' under the command of Lt General Mason-McFarlane on 23 May 1940 before  joining 145 Brigade ('Somerforce') at the French hilltop town of Cassel under the command of Brigadier Hon. Nigel Fitzroy Somerset on 25 May 1940. \n\n==Last stand at Cassel==\n\nDuring the four days between May 25-29 1940, Cassel was effectively converted into a tank-proof fortress with a series of surrounding 'picket' villages including the bunker at Le Peckel, Bavinchove and Zuytpeene which were all doggedly defended (2, 3). On 29 May 1940 orders were received for the garrison at Cassel to retreat in a north-easterly direction towards Dunkirk with a view to joining the evacuation (Operation Dynamo). A breakout was attempted under the cover of darkness but very few of the garrisons troops succeeded in evading the advancing German army who by then had surrounded the town. A large number were captured during the day of 30 May 1940 on the Franco-Belgian border near the town of Watou.\n\nBy 30 May 1940 almost half of the personnel of the 140th Field Regiment had been captured or killed. Although many of the men of 366 Battery were successfully evacuated, very few of 367 Battery escaped capture and most of the survivors of Cassel spent the remainder of the war as POW\u2019s. \n\n==Regiment reforms after Dunkirk==\n\nFourteen officers and 287 men (out of a total of 700) returned from Dunkirk to re-form the Regiment. After Dunkirk, the priority was the defence of the United Kingdom from the expected invasion and so there was urgent pressure for the Regiment to re-form.  In mid-June 1940 the men were concentrated away from the invasion front line at Worksop in Nottinghamshire.  They moved to Salford on 28 June 1940 and to Castor, Peterborough in October 1940 where they were re-equipped. \n\nThe newly equipped 366 Battery became operational in 1941 and their first wartime mission was to contribute to the military garrison in Iceland in June 1941.  The Battery returned to the UK in January 1942 to be merged with the 178th Regiment Royal Artillery, which served in Tunisia and Burma.\n\nThe few remaining men of 367 Battery were joined by 504 and 518 Battery\u2019s, they were equipped with 25-pounder field guns and kept the designation 140th Regiment, R.A. In 1942, the 140th Regiment was re-equipped with the Bishop Self-Propelled Gun, a 25-pounder gun mounted on an adapted Valentine tank, and with this vehicle the Regiment went to Algeria in January 1943 as part of 2nd Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA). At the end of the North African campaign the Regiment was converted to a Medium Regiment with 4.5\u2033 Guns, in the process losing 504 Battery to 75 Heavy Regiment. 140th Medium Regiment (367 & 518 Battery\u2019s) landed in Italy in January 1944 and took part in most of the battles of the Italian Campaign.\n\n==Gunner Eric West, 367 Battery==\nThe story of 140 Regiment's involvement with the B.E.F. in 1940 is published here (4) http://140th-field-regiment-ra-1940.co.uk/ and focuses on the story of Gunner Eric West, including his experience of captivity in Stalag VIIIB 1940-1945 and Long March in 1945.\n\n''''''Captivity and the Long March 1940-45''''''\n\nMany of the regular soldiers of the 140th Regiment captured at Dunkirk were sent to Stalag VIIIB in Silesia as POWs. An account of POW life and the forced 'Long March' that took place during the Russian advance into Germany in 1945 was written by Private Norman Gibbs and has been published in Polish (5) and also features in the 140th Regiment website (4).\n\n''''''In Dunkirk's Grim Days''''''\n\nIn 1948 Brigadier Nigel Somerset was spurred by his feeling that the brave defence of Cassel by his \u2018Somerforce\u2019 was being neglected by historians of the period to write his letter to the Daily Telegraph dated 19 February 1948 \u2018In Dunkirk\u2019s Grim Days' \n\n{{quote|Sir \u2013 I notice that in his memoirs of 1940 Mr. Churchill observes that \u201cAfter the loss of Boulogne and Calais only the remains of the port of Dunkirk and the open beaches next to the Belgian frontier were in our hands.\u201d\nAt the time I was commanding a brigade group holding a sector from Cassel to Hazebrouck. We were heavily attacked by German armour on May 27. At Cassel the Germans were repulsed with the loss of over 20 tanks. At Hazebrouk our force there was surrounded and did not finally capitulate until the evening of May 28.\nNot knowing that the B.E.F. was embarking for the United Kingdom we hourly expected a vigorous counter-attack by British and possibly French troops to restore the situation. We hung on at Cassel until the night of May 29, and then tried to reach the Dunkirk bridgehead.\nGerman operation maps at the time showed Cassel and district still occupied by the enemy, and leaflets were dropped calling on us to surrender, as \u201cyour generals are gone\u201d!\nI feel it is fair neither to myself nor the troops under my command to let this stand pass from mind, especially as so many gave their lives, and most of the remainder of us spent five years in captivity. Incidentally, by holding on at Cassel we not only deprived the Germans of one of the main roads to Dunkirk, but enabled many British detached units and individuals to reach the bridgehead.\nAll these facts appear to have utterly escaped the notice of the authorities at the time owing to the indescribable confusion, and I feel that an opportunity has now been afforded me of bringing them to light.\nYours faithfully, N.

Once equipped and after basic training in London, High Wycombe and Dursley, Gloucestershire, 140th Regiment was assigned to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in November 1939.  It was not allocated to a particular Division but was under the control of GHQ and was allocated to individual forces depending on operational need.\n\n==Equipment==\n\nThe British Army in 1939 (unlike the German Infantry) was fully motorised under a mechanisation initiative. The Regiment operated 18-pounder guns towed behind Tractor units (mainly Morris or Guy \u2018Quads\u2019) with an ammunition trailer positioned between the tractor and gun.  The 140th Regiment\u2019s vehicles were identified by a number '10\u2019 in white on a red and blue background.  \n\nThe 18-pounder gun was a quick-firing field gun with the shell and cartridge fixed together.  It was based on a World War One weapon that had been modernised and was mounted on a Mark II carriage with rubber tyres.  The gun barrel was nickel-steel with a single-motion screw breech incorporating a cartridge extractor. The sights were on the right of the gun and incorporated a telescope and clinometer for indirect firing in an arc.  The effective range of the weapon could be 3-5 miles, although in the last days of the Battle of Cassel some of the firing was done over \u2018open sights\u2018 directly at German tanks only a few yards distant.\n\nIn 1939-40, British Field Artillery tactics were organised so as to provide groups of gun strong points, usually camouflaged by trees and supported by communication tracks to supplies and ammunition at the rear and with forward observation posts linked by telegraph wires.  In 1939-40, a Battery was sub-divided into a 12-gun, three Troop arrangement with each Troop sharing radio and communications.  Each gun would have been crewed by six men, a sergeant, in overall charge, the No.3 who was his right hand man, a Lance Bombardier who laid and fired the gun, numbers 2 and 4 loaded and rammed and numbers 5 and 6 fetched and carried the ammunition.\n\n==Officers==\n\nThe following Officers were recorded as members of the 140th Regiment Royal Artillery in March 1940\n\n*Lt Col C.J.

By 9 May 1940 the regiment was part of [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe Regiment advanced into Belgium on 10 May 1940 after the German invasion of Belgium and Holland and allegedly fired the first British artillery round during the Dyle line defence. On the evening of 16 May 1940 the Regiment withdrew via Brussels, Ninove and Tournai to the Escaut line as the French military situation worsened to the South. The Regiment was in action at the village of Ere/St Maur, where the Regiment's first battle casualties occurred. On the 22nd May 1940 the Regiment withdrew across the Franco-Belgian border into the French village of Sainguin-en-Melantois. The two Batteries were in operation together as a single fighting unit until 23 May 1940. After 23 May, as the British and French military situation worsened further, the two Batteries were separated and were assigned to different theatres. \n\n366 Battery, under the command of Lt-Colonel Brooks, was assigned to defend the Eastern escape corridor to Dunkirk and followed a route via Seclin and Lille to the Messines ridge in support of the British defence of the Ypres- Commines line. The Battery was positioned near the village of Wytschaete and in action during 27-28 May 1940. The Battery withdrew under cover of darkness on 28 May 1940 having disabled its guns and successfully reached the Dunkirk beaches on 29 May 1940. A book written by Lt Colonel Brooks in 1941 entitled ''Grand Party'' (1)  records 366 Battery's involvement in the 1940 campaign including the evacuation at Dunkirk.\n\n367 Battery, together with Regimental HQ, under the command of Colonel C.J. Odling, was assigned to protect the Western corridor and was initially assigned to the 'MacForce' under the command of Lt General Mason-McFarlane on 23 May 1940 before  joining 145 Brigade ('Somerforce') at the French hilltop town of Cassel under the command of Brigadier Hon. Nigel Fitzroy Somerset on 25 May 1940. \n\n==Last stand at Cassel==\n\nDuring the four days between May 25-29 1940, Cassel was effectively converted into a tank-proof fortress with a series of surrounding 'picket' villages including the bunker at Le Peckel, Bavinchove and Zuytpeene which were all doggedly defended (2, 3). On 29 May 1940 orders were received for the garrison at Cassel to retreat in a north-easterly direction towards Dunkirk with a view to joining the evacuation (Operation Dynamo). A breakout was attempted under the cover of darkness but very few of the garrisons troops succeeded in evading the advancing German army who by then had surrounded the town. A large number were captured during the day of 30 May 1940 on the Franco-Belgian border near the town of Watou.\n\nBy 30 May 1940 almost half of the personnel of the 140th Field Regiment had been captured or killed. Although many of the men of 366 Battery were successfully evacuated, very few of 367 Battery escaped capture and most of the survivors of Cassel spent the remainder of the war as POW\u2019s. \n\n==Regiment reforms after Dunkirk==\n\nFourteen officers and 287 men (out of a total of 700) returned from Dunkirk to re-form the Regiment.
