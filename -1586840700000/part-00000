The [[Hugo Awards]] have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe award was first presented in 1984, and has been given annually since. A \"semiprozine\" is defined for the award as a magazine in the field that is not professional but that (unlike a fanzine) either pays its contributors in something other than copies, or is (generally) available only for payment.<ref name=\"thacats\"/>{{#tag:ref|The definition requires that the magazine meet two of the following criteria: it must \"have an average press run of at least 1000 copies; pay its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication; provide at least half the income of any one person; have at least 15% of its total space occupied by advertising; or announce itself to be a semiprozine.\"<ref name=\"SFE3SPZ\">{{Cite web|url=http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/semiprozine|title=Culture : Semiprozine : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|last=Nicholls|first=Peter|last2=Ashley|first2=Mike|date=|website=sf-encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23|last3=Langford|first3=David}}</ref>|group=note}} In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943\u20141946, 1951, and 1954, but the category failed to receive enough to form a ballot each time.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/>\n\nDuring the 37 nomination years, 38 magazines run by 133 editors have been nominated. Of these, only 8 magazines run by 25 editors have won. ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' won 22 times and was nominated every year until a rules change in 2012 made it ineligible for the category. ''Uncanny Magazine'' has won 4 times in a row, 2016\u20132019, while ''Science Fiction Chronicle'', ''[[Clarkesworld Magazine]]'', and ''[[Lightspeed (magazine)|Lightspeed]]'' are the only other magazines to win more than once, with 2 awards out of 18 nominations, 3 out of 4, and 2 out of 5, respectively, while ''Ansible'' has won 1 out of 7 nominations, ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' has won 1 out of 28, and ''[[Weird Tales]]'' has won 1 out of its 3 nominations. As editor of ''Locus'' [[Charles N. Brown]] won 21 of 27 nominations, though he shared 5 of those awards with Kirsten Gong-Wong, 3 with Liza Groen Trombi and 2 with Jennifer A. Hall. ''Uncanny''{{'}}s awards were primarily earned by a team of 5 people, [[Lynne M. Thomas]], Michael Damian Thomas, Michi Trota, Erika Ensign, and Steven Schapansky. The sole editor for ''Chronicle''{{'}}s awards was [[Andrew I. Porter]], while [[David Pringle]] earned ''Interzone''{{'}}s, and [[Ann VanderMeer]] and [[Stephen H. Segal]] were the editors for ''Weird Tales''{{'}}s victory. ''Lightspeed''{{'}}s wins were under [[John Joseph Adams]], Rich Horton, and Stefan Rudnicki, with Wendy N. Wagner and Christie Yant added for the second win, while [[David Langford]] was the editor when ''Ansible'' was awarded. ''Clarkesworld Magazine''{{'}}s winning years were under [[Neil Clarke (editor)|Neil Clarke]], [[Sean Wallace]], and Kate Baker, with 2 of the three also under [[Cheryl Morgan]] and the other under Jason Heller. ''[[The New York Review of Science Fiction]]'' has received the most number of nominations without ever winning at 22, under the helm of [[David G. Hartwell]], [[Kathryn Cramer]], Kevin J. Maroney, and 8 other editors. The next highest number of nominations without winning is 7 for ''[[Speculations]]'' under [[Kent Brewster]], Denise Lee, and [[Susan Fry]].\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] (Worldcon), and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1953 through 1956 and 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1959 all six candidates were recorded.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/> At the 2008 business meeting, an amendment to the World Science Fiction Society's Constitution was passed which would remove this category. The vote to ratify this amendment was held the following year; the ratification failed and the category remained. Instead, a committee was formed to recommend improvements to the category and related categories.<ref name=\"2009Meeting\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each date links to the \"year in literature\" article corresponding with when the work was eligible. Entries with a blue background  won the award for that year; those with a white background are the other nominees on the short-list. Note that ''Thrust'' was renamed to ''Quantum'' and was nominated under both names; no other nominated magazine has undergone a name change during the period the award has been active.<ref

The [[Hugo Awards]] have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe award was first presented in 1984, and has been given annually since. A \"semiprozine\" is defined for the award as a magazine in the field that is not professional but that (unlike a fanzine) either pays its contributors in something other than copies, or is (generally) available only for payment.<ref name=\"thacats\"/>{{#tag:ref|The definition requires that the magazine meet two of the following criteria: it must \"have an average press run of at least 1000 copies; pay its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication; provide at least half the income of any one person; have at least 15% of its total space occupied by advertising; or announce itself to be a semiprozine.\"<ref name=\"SFE3SPZ\">{{Cite web|url=http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/semiprozine|title=Culture : Semiprozine : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|last=Nicholls|first=Peter|last2=Ashley|first2=Mike|date=|website=sf-encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23|last3=Langford|first3=David}}</ref>|group=note}} In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1951, and 1954, but the category failed to receive enough to form a ballot each time.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/>\n\nDuring the 37 nomination years, 38 magazines run by 133 editors have been nominated. Of these, only 8 magazines run by 25 editors have won. ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' won 22 times and was nominated every year until a rules change in 2012 made it ineligible for the category. ''Uncanny Magazine'' has won 4 times in a row, 2016\u20132019, while ''Science Fiction Chronicle'', ''[[Clarkesworld Magazine]]'', and ''[[Lightspeed (magazine)|Lightspeed]]'' are the only other magazines to win more than once, with 2 awards out of 18 nominations, 3 out of 4, and 2 out of 5, respectively, while ''Ansible'' has won 1 out of 7 nominations, ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' has won 1 out of 28, and ''[[Weird Tales]]'' has won 1 out of its 3 nominations. As editor of ''Locus'' [[Charles N. Brown]] won 21 of 27 nominations, though he shared 5 of those awards with Kirsten Gong-Wong, 3 with Liza Groen Trombi and 2 with Jennifer A. Hall. ''Uncanny''{{'}}s awards were primarily earned by a team of 5 people, [[Lynne M. Thomas]], Michael Damian Thomas, Michi Trota, Erika Ensign, and Steven Schapansky. The sole editor for ''Chronicle''{{'}}s awards was [[Andrew I. Porter]], while [[David Pringle]] earned ''Interzone''{{'}}s, and [[Ann VanderMeer]] and [[Stephen H. Segal]] were the editors for ''Weird Tales''{{'}}s victory. ''Lightspeed''{{'}}s wins were under [[John Joseph Adams]], Rich Horton, and Stefan Rudnicki, with Wendy N. Wagner and Christie Yant added for the second win, while [[David Langford]] was the editor when ''Ansible'' was awarded. ''Clarkesworld Magazine''{{'}}s winning years were under [[Neil Clarke (editor)|Neil Clarke]], [[Sean Wallace]], and Kate Baker, with 2 of the three also under [[Cheryl Morgan]] and the other under Jason Heller. ''[[The New York Review of Science Fiction]]'' has received the most number of nominations without ever winning at 22, under the helm of [[David G. Hartwell]], [[Kathryn Cramer]], Kevin J. Maroney, and 8 other editors. The next highest number of nominations without winning is 7 for ''[[Speculations]]'' under [[Kent Brewster]], Denise Lee, and [[Susan Fry]].\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] (Worldcon), and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1953 through 1956 and 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1959 all six candidates were recorded.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/> At the 2008 business meeting, an amendment to the World Science Fiction Society's Constitution was passed which would remove this category. The vote to ratify this amendment was held the following year; the ratification failed and the category remained. Instead, a committee was formed to recommend improvements to the category and related categories.<ref name=\"2009Meeting\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each date links to the \"year in literature\" article corresponding with when the work was eligible. Entries with a blue background  won the award for that year; those with a white background are the other nominees on the short-list. Note that ''Thrust'' was renamed to ''Quantum'' and was nominated under both names; no other nominated magazine has undergone a name change during the period the award has been active.<ref

The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and [[web hosting]]. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf.  When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from [[California]] and joined the team in 1998.  Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] in San Antonio.\n\nAlthough the founders began as application developers for end-users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development\u2013not hosting\u2013but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its [[CEO]]. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its \"Fanatical Support\" offering to focus on service and support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hostsearch.com/interview/rackspace_managed_hosting_interview_october_2004.asp|title=Web Hosting Interview&nbsp;\u2013 Rackspace Managed Hosting|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor [[Norwest Venture Partners]] and [[Sequoia Capital]].

The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and [[web hosting]]. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf.  When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from [[California]] and joined the team in 1998.  Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] in San Antonio.\n\nAlthough the founders began as application developers for end-users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development\u2013not hosting\u2013but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its [[CEO]]. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its \"Fanatical Support\" offering to focus on service and support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hostsearch.com/interview/rackspace_managed_hosting_interview_october_2004.asp|title=Web Hosting Interview&nbsp;\u2013 Rackspace Managed Hosting|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>  On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor [[Norwest Venture Partners]] and [[Sequoia Capital]].

{"title_page": "Derivative test", "text_new": "In [[calculus]], a '''derivative test''' uses the [[derivative]]s of a function to locate the [[stationary point|critical point]]s of a function and determine whether each point is a [[local maximum]], a [[local minimum]], or a [[saddle point]]. Derivative tests can also give information about the [[Concave function|concavity]] of a function.\n\nThe usefulness of derivatives to find extrema is proved mathematically by [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem of stationary points]].\n\n==First-derivative test==\nThe first-derivative test examines a function's [[monotonic function|monotonic]] properties (where the function is increasing or decreasing) focusing on a particular point in its domain. If the function \"switches\" from increasing to decreasing at the point, then the function will achieve a highest value at that point. Similarly, if the function \"switches\" from decreasing to increasing at the point, then it will achieve a least value at that point. If the function fails to \"switch\" and remains increasing or remains decreasing, then no highest or least value is achieved.\n\nOne can examine a function's monotonicity without calculus. However, calculus is usually helpful because there are [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient conditions]] that guarantee the monotonicity properties above, and these conditions apply to the vast majority of functions one would encounter.\n\n===Precise statement of monotonicity properties===\n\nStated precisely, suppose that ''f'' is a [[Continuous function|continuous]] real-valued function of a real variable, defined on some interval containing the point ''x''.\n\n* If there exists a positive number ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that ''f'' is weakly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x''] and weakly decreasing on [''x'', ''x'' + ''r''), then ''f'' has a local maximum at ''x''. This statement also works the other way around, if ''x'' is a local maximum point, then ''f'' is weakly increasing on (''x''\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''r'',\u00a0''x''] and weakly decreasing on [''x'', ''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''r'').\n* If there exists a positive number ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that ''f'' is strictly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x''] and strictly increasing on [''x'', ''x'' + ''r''), then ''f'' is strictly increasing on (''x'' \u2212 ''r'', ''x'' + ''r'') and does not have a local maximum or minimum at ''x''.\n\nThis statement is a direct consequence of how [[local extrema]] are defined. That is, if ''x''<sub>0</sub> is a local maximum point, then there exists ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that ''f''(''x'') \u2264 ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) for ''x'' in (''x''\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''r'', ''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''r''), which means that ''f'' has to increase from ''x''\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''r'' to ''x'' and has to decrease from ''x'' to ''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''r'' because ''f'' is continuous. \n\nNote that in the first two cases, ''f'' is not required to be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing to the left or right of ''x'', while in the last two cases, ''f'' is required to be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. The reason is that in the definition of local maximum and minimum, the inequality is not required to be strict: e.g. every value of a constant function is considered both a local maximum and a local minimum.\n\n===Precise statement of first-derivative test===\n\nThe first-derivative test depends on the \"increasing\u2013decreasing test\", which is itself ultimately a consequence of the [[mean value theorem]]. It is a direct consequence of the way the [[derivative]] is defined and its connection to decrease and increase of a function locally, combined with the previous section.\n\nSuppose ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable defined on some interval containing the critical point ''a''. Further suppose that ''f'' is [[continuous function|continuous]] at ''a'' and [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on some open interval containing ''a'', except possibly at ''a'' itself.\n\n* If there exists a positive number ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that for every ''x'' in (''a'' \u2212 ''r'', ''a'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') \u2265 0,}} and for every ''x'' in (''a'', ''a'' + ''r'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') \u2264 0,}} then ''f'' has a local maximum at ''a''.\n* If there exists a positive number ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that for every ''x'' in (''a'' \u2212 ''r'', ''a'') \u222a (''a'', ''a'' + ''r'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') > 0,}} then ''f'' is strictly increasing at ''a'' and has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum there.\n* If none of the above conditions hold, then the test fails. (Such a condition is not [[vacuous truth|vacuous]]; there are functions that satisfy none of the first three conditions such as ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>\u22c5sin(1/''x'').\n\nAgain, corresponding to the comments in the section on monotonicity properties, note that in the first two cases, the inequality is not required to be strict, while in the next two, strict inequality is required.\n\n===Applications===\n\nThe first-derivative test is helpful in solving [[optimization problem]]s in physics, economics, and engineering. In conjunction with the [[extreme value theorem]], it can be used to find the absolute maximum and minimum of a real-valued function defined on a closed, bounded interval. In conjunction with other information such as concavity, inflection points, and asymptotes, it can be used to sketch the graph of a function.\n\n==Second-derivative test (single variable)==\nAfter establishing the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of a function, the ''second-derivative test'' uses the value of the [[second derivative]] at those points to determine whether such points are a local [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] or a local [[Maxima and minima|minimum]]. If the function ''f'' is twice [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at a critical point ''x'' (i.e. ''{{prime|f}}(x) = 0''), then:\n* If <math>f''(x) < 0</math>, then <math>f</math> has a local maximum at <math>x</math>.\n* If <math>f''(x) > 0</math>, then <math>f</math> has a local minimum at <math>x</math>.\n* If <math>f''(x) = 0</math>, the test is inconclusive.\n\nIn the last case, [[Taylor's theorem#Taylor's theorem in one real variable|Taylor's Theorem]] may be used to determine the behavior of ''f'' near ''x'' using [[higher derivative]]s.\n\n===Proof of the second-derivative test===\nSuppose we have <math>f''(x) > 0</math> (the proof for <math>f''(x) < 0</math> is analogous). By assumption, <math>f'(x) = 0</math>. Then\n\n: <math>0 < f''(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h) - f'(x)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h) - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h)}{h}.</math>\n\nThus, for ''h'' sufficiently small we get\n\n: <math>\\frac{f'(x + h)}{h} > 0,</math>\n\nwhich means that <math>f'(x + h) < 0</math> if <math>h < 0</math> (intuitively, ''f'' is decreasing as it approaches <math>x</math> from the left), and that <math>f'(x + h) > 0</math> if <math>h > 0</math> (intuitively, ''f'' is increasing as we go right from ''x''). Now, by the [[first-derivative test]], <math>f</math> has a local minimum at <math>x</math>.\n\n=== Concavity test ===\n\nA related but distinct use of second derivatives is to determine whether a function is [[Concave function|concave up]] or [[Concave function|concave down]] at a point. It does not, however, provide information about [[inflection points]]. Specifically, a twice-differentiable function ''f'' is concave up if <math>f''(x) > 0</math> and concave down if <math>f''(x) < 0</math>. Note that if <math>f(x) = x^4</math>, then <math>x = 0</math> has zero second derivative, yet is not an inflection point, so the second derivative alone does not give enough information to determine whether a given point is an inflection point.\n\n===Higher-order derivative test===\nThe ''higher-order derivative test'' or ''general derivative test'' is able to determine whether a function's critical points are maxima, minima, or points of inflection for a wider variety of functions than the second-order derivative test. As shown below, the second-derivative test is mathematically identical to the special case of ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 in the higher-order derivative test.\n\nLet ''f'' be a real-valued, sufficiently [[differentiable function]] on the interval <math>I \\subset \\R,\\ c \\in I</math>, and <math>n \\ge 1</math> an integer. Also let all the derivatives of ''f'' at ''c'' be zero up to and including the ''n''-th derivative, but with the (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-th derivative being non-zero:\n\n: <math>f'(c) = \\cdots =f^{(n)}(c) = 0\\quad \\text{and}\\quad f^{(n+1)}(c) \\ne 0.</math>\n\nThere are four possibilities, the first two cases where ''c'' is an extremum, the second two where ''c'' is a (local) saddle point:\n* If ''n'' is odd and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) < 0</math>, then ''c'' is a local maximum.\n* If ''n'' is odd and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) > 0</math>, then ''c'' is a local minimum.\n* If ''n'' is even and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) < 0</math>, then ''c'' is a strictly decreasing point of inflection.\n* If ''n'' is even and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) > 0</math>, then ''c'' is a strictly increasing point of inflection.\n\nSince ''n'' must be either odd or even, this analytical test classifies any stationary point of ''f'', so long as a nonzero derivative shows up eventually.\n\n===Example===\nSay, we want to perform the general derivative test on the function <math>f(x) = x^6 + 5</math> at the point <math>x = 0</math>. To do this, we calculate the derivatives of the function and then evaluate them at the point of interest until the result is nonzero.\n\n: <math>f'(x) = 6x^5</math>, <math>f'(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f''(x) = 30x^4</math>, <math>f''(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(3)}(x) = 120x^3</math>, <math>f^{(3)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(4)}(x) = 360x^2</math>, <math>f^{(4)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(5)}(x) = 720x</math>, <math>f^{(5)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(6)}(x) = 720</math>, <math>f^{(6)}(0) = 720.</math>\n\nAs shown above, at the point <math>x = 0</math>, the function <math>x^6 + 5</math> has all of its derivatives at 0 equal to 0, except for the 6th derivative, which is positive. Thus ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, and by the test, there is a local minimum at 0.\n\n== Multivariable case ==\n{{main article|Second partial derivative test}}\nFor a function of more than one variable, the second-derivative test generalizes to a test based on the [[eigenvalue]]s of the function's [[Hessian matrix]] at the critical point. In particular, assuming that all second-order partial derivatives of ''f'' are continuous on a neighbourhood of a critical point ''x'', then if the eigenvalues of the Hessian at ''x'' are all positive, then ''x'' is a local minimum. If the eigenvalues are all negative, then ''x'' is a local maximum, and if some are positive and some negative, then the point is a [[saddle point]]. If the Hessian matrix is [[singular matrix|singular]], then the second-derivative test is inconclusive.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)]]\n* [[Maxima and minima]]\n* [[Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions]]\n* [[Phase line (mathematics)|Phase line]] \u2013 virtually identical diagram, used in the study of ordinary differential equations\n* [[Hessian matrix#Bordered Hessian|Bordered Hessian]]\n* [[Optimization (mathematics)]]\n* [[Differentiability]]\n* [[Convex function]]\n* [[Second partial derivative test]]\n* [[Saddle point]]\n* [[Inflection point]]\n* [[Stationary point]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |first=Alpha C. |last=Chiang |authorlink=Alpha Chiang |title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalmetho0000chia_h4v2 |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Third |year=1984 |isbn=0-07-010813-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalmetho0000chia_h4v2/page/231 231\u2013267] }}\n*{{cite book |first=Jerrold |last=Marsden |authorlink=Jerrold E.

The reason is that in the definition of local maximum and minimum, the inequality is not required to be strict: e.g. every value of a constant function is considered both a local maximum and a local minimum.\n\n===Precise statement of first-derivative test===\n\nThe first-derivative test depends on the \"increasing\u2013decreasing test\", which is itself ultimately a consequence of the [[mean value theorem]]. It is a direct consequence of the way the [[derivative]] is defined and its connection to decrease and increase of a function locally, combined with the previous section.\n\nSuppose ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable defined on some interval containing the critical point ''a''. Further suppose that ''f'' is [[continuous function|continuous]] at ''a'' and [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on some open interval containing ''a'', except possibly at ''a'' itself.\n\n* If there exists a positive number ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that for every ''x'' in (''a'' \u2212 ''r'', ''a'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') \u2265 0,}} and for every ''x'' in (''a'', ''a'' + ''r'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') \u2264 0,}} then ''f'' has a local maximum at ''a''.\n* If there exists a positive number ''r''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 such that for every ''x'' in (''a'' \u2212 ''r'', ''a'') \u222a (''a'', ''a'' + ''r'') we have {{nobr|''{{\u2032|f}}''(''x'') > 0,}} then ''f'' is strictly increasing at ''a'' and has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum there.\n* If none of the above conditions hold, then the test fails. (Such a condition is not [[vacuous truth|vacuous]]; there are functions that satisfy none of the first three conditions such as ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>\u22c5sin(1/''x'').\n\nAgain, corresponding to the comments in the section on monotonicity properties, note that in the first two cases, the inequality is not required to be strict, while in the next two, strict inequality is required.\n\n===Applications===\n\nThe first-derivative test is helpful in solving [[optimization problem]]s in physics, economics, and engineering. In conjunction with the [[extreme value theorem]], it can be used to find the absolute maximum and minimum of a real-valued function defined on a closed, bounded interval. In conjunction with other information such as concavity, inflection points, and asymptotes, it can be used to sketch the graph of a function.\n\n==Second-derivative test (single variable)==\nAfter establishing the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of a function, the ''second-derivative test'' uses the value of the [[second derivative]] at those points to determine whether such points are a local [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] or a local [[Maxima and minima|minimum]]. If the function ''f'' is twice [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at a critical point ''x'' (i.e. ''{{prime|f}}(x) = 0''), then:\n* If <math>f''(x) < 0</math>, then <math>f</math> has a local maximum at <math>x</math>.\n* If <math>f''(x) > 0</math>, then <math>f</math> has a local minimum at <math>x</math>.\n* If <math>f''(x) = 0</math>, the test is inconclusive.\n\nIn the last case, [[Taylor's theorem#Taylor's theorem in one real variable|Taylor's Theorem]] may be used to determine the behavior of ''f'' near ''x'' using [[higher derivative]]s.\n\n===Proof of the second-derivative test===\nSuppose we have <math>f''(x) > 0</math> (the proof for <math>f''(x) < 0</math> is analogous). By assumption, <math>f'(x) = 0</math>. Then\n\n: <math>0 < f''(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h) - f'(x)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h) - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x + h)}{h}.</math>\n\nThus, for ''h'' sufficiently small we get\n\n: <math>\\frac{f'(x + h)}{h} > 0,</math>\n\nwhich means that <math>f'(x + h) < 0</math> if <math>h < 0</math> (intuitively, ''f'' is decreasing as it approaches <math>x</math> from the left), and that <math>f'(x + h) > 0</math> if <math>h > 0</math> (intuitively, ''f'' is increasing as we go right from ''x''). Now, by the [[first-derivative test]], <math>f</math> has a local minimum at <math>x</math>.\n\n=== Concavity test ===\n\nA related but distinct use of second derivatives is to determine whether a function is [[Concave function|concave up]] or [[Concave function|concave down]] at a point. It does not, however, provide information about [[inflection points]]. Specifically, a twice-differentiable function ''f'' is concave up if <math>f''(x) > 0</math> and concave down if <math>f''(x) < 0</math>. Note that if <math>f(x) = x^4</math>, then <math>x = 0</math> has zero second derivative, yet is not an inflection point, so the second derivative alone does not give enough information to determine whether a given point is an inflection point.\n\n===Higher-order derivative test===\nThe ''higher-order derivative test'' or ''general derivative test'' is able to determine whether a function's critical points are maxima, minima, or points of inflection for a wider variety of functions than the second-order derivative test. As shown below, the second-derivative test is mathematically identical to the special case of ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 in the higher-order derivative test.\n\nLet ''f'' be a real-valued, sufficiently [[differentiable function]] on the interval <math>I \\subset \\R,\\ c \\in I</math>, and <math>n \\ge 1</math> an integer. Also let all the derivatives of ''f'' at ''c'' be zero up to and including the ''n''-th derivative, but with the (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-th derivative being non-zero:\n\n: <math>f'(c) = \\cdots =f^{(n)}(c) = 0\\quad \\text{and}\\quad f^{(n+1)}(c) \\ne 0.</math>\n\nThere are four possibilities, the first two cases where ''c'' is an extremum, the second two where ''c'' is a (local) saddle point:\n* If ''n'' is odd and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) < 0</math>, then ''c'' is a local maximum.\n* If ''n'' is odd and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) > 0</math>, then ''c'' is a local minimum.\n* If ''n'' is even and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) < 0</math>, then ''c'' is a strictly decreasing point of inflection.\n* If ''n'' is even and <math>f^{(n+1)}(c) > 0</math>, then ''c'' is a strictly increasing point of inflection.\n\nSince ''n'' must be either odd or even, this analytical test classifies any stationary point of ''f'', so long as a nonzero derivative shows up eventually.\n\n===Example===\nSay, we want to perform the general derivative test on the function <math>f(x) = x^6 + 5</math> at the point <math>x = 0</math>. To do this, we calculate the derivatives of the function and then evaluate them at the point of interest until the result is nonzero.\n\n: <math>f'(x) = 6x^5</math>, <math>f'(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f''(x) = 30x^4</math>, <math>f''(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(3)}(x) = 120x^3</math>, <math>f^{(3)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(4)}(x) = 360x^2</math>, <math>f^{(4)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(5)}(x) = 720x</math>, <math>f^{(5)}(0) = 0;</math>\n\n: <math>f^{(6)}(x) = 720</math>, <math>f^{(6)}(0) = 720.</math>\n\nAs shown above, at the point <math>x = 0</math>, the function <math>x^6 + 5</math> has all of its derivatives at 0 equal to 0, except for the 6th derivative, which is positive. Thus ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, and by the test, there is a local minimum at 0.\n\n== Multivariable case ==\n{{main article|Second partial derivative test}}\nFor a function of more than one variable, the second derivative test generalizes to a test based on the [[eigenvalue]]s of the function's [[Hessian matrix]] at the critical point. In particular, assuming that all second order partial derivatives of ''f'' are continuous on a neighbourhood of a critical point ''x'', then if the eigenvalues of the Hessian at ''x'' are all positive, then ''x'' is a local minimum.  If the eigenvalues are all negative, then ''x'' is a local maximum, and if some are positive and some negative, then the point is a [[saddle point]].  If the Hessian matrix is [[singular matrix|singular]], then the second derivative test is inconclusive.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)]]\n* [[Maxima and minima]]\n* [[Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions]]\n* [[Phase line (mathematics)|Phase line]] \u2013 virtually identical diagram, used in the study of ordinary differential equations\n* [[Hessian matrix#Bordered Hessian|Bordered Hessian]]\n* [[Optimization (mathematics)]]\n* [[Differentiability]]\n* [[Convex function]]\n* [[Second partial derivative test]]\n* [[Saddle point]]\n* [[Inflection point]]\n* [[Stationary point]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |first=Alpha C. |last=Chiang |authorlink=Alpha Chiang |title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalmetho0000chia_h4v2 |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Third |year=1984 |isbn=0-07-010813-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalmetho0000chia_h4v2/page/231 231\u2013267] }}\n*{{cite book |first=Jerrold |last=Marsden |authorlink=Jerrold E.
