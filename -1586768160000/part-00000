It was not an administrative [[regiment]] in the commonly accepted British Commonwealth sense, but rather a tactical formation manned from other regiments and branches. It was disbanded in 1995 after the [[Somalia Affair]].\n\n==Origin and organizational aspects==\n\n===The concept of the Airborne===\nThe main proponent of the Airborne was General [[Jean Victor Allard]] who, as commander of the Army (i.e. Mobile Command) and then [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of Defence Staff]], created it between 1965 and 1968 as a large rapid-reaction, light mobile force, suitable for overseas [[brigade]]-size missions. It was designed as a flexible short-term immediate response available to the government when it accepted an overseas reinforcement or intervention mission within [[NATO]], or elsewhere. It would be replaced in a brigade's proposed mission area, after no more than a few weeks, once the main body of a heavier brigade was mobilized and transported with its fighting vehicles and support to the area. (See Gen. Allard's memoirs, Chap. 12.)\n\nOver time, and a succession of chiefs of defence, the Airborne remained an object of conflicting concepts of operations, military structure and linguistic identity. Originally designed as a quick-reaction immediate-response force that could, if absolutely necessary, use [[parachute]]s, it was quickly transformed into a highly specialized parachute force, to be used for special parachute missions in the regular order of battle. (See Allard's memoirs.) This, in turn, created controversy since there was no accepted requirement for such a Canadian Forces capability in operational plans, other than the rather pedestrian task of jumping into remote locations in the Canadian Arctic.\n\nThe original concept of the Airborne envisaged a rotation of young [[infantry]] soldiers and officers through its units, serving a maximum of two years. It was to be an essential and exciting posting for all young infantry leaders prior to their promotion to sergeant or captain in their own regiment. Allard wrote: \"this regiment would not reflect the identity of a Victorian-era regiment because its members would serve in it for only a short period (Chap 12).\" However, under Allard's successors, the Airborne became instead another separate regiment, specializing in parachuting, and keeping its members for as long as possible. It adopted all the symbols of a line regiment, including badges, colours, and history (creating a historical link with Canadian [[1st Canadian Parachute Battalion|war-time parachute battalions]]). In particular, it sought to replace the identity of its members from Canada's line regiments with that of the Airborne. This aborted the original operational purpose of the Airborne and, significantly, planted the seeds of an ongoing conflict of identity and loyalty within the Canadian infantry family. Allard wrote that \"those who took this route showed an absolute ignorance of the requirement for quick-reaction in today's world.\"\n\n===Location===\nOn General Allard's retirement, the unit was established at [[CFB Griesbach]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], in 1968.<ref>[http://militarybruce.com/abandoned-canadian-military-bases/abandoned-bases/alberta/ Bruce Forsyth's Canadian Military History Page - Canadian Forces Base Edmonton (Griesbach Barracks)] Retrieved: 2018-11-30</ref> This was a large Air Transport Command base. The prairie weather is ideal for specialized parachute training, and Edmonton is the \"gateway to the North\". But the location in western Canada was disputed by some for operational reasons in that Canada's rapidly declining troop strength was consequently heavily skewed to that part of the continent where neither its population nor its [[NATO]] commitments justified. There was a full brigade in the West, plus the Airborne. In central and eastern Canada, there were only four battalions of infantry.\n\nThe Edmonton location also created linguistic problems. The Airborne's French-speaking elements had initially been left at [[CFB Valcartier]] in Quebec, but they have also moved to Alberta in 1970.  There, it became difficult to keep them up to strength, particularly as many married leaders refused to make their career in an environment unsuitable for their families.\n\nFinally, in the face of recruiting and retention problems, as well as operational concerns, the Airborne was moved to [[CFB Petawawa]] in Ontario, where it remained until it was disbanded.\n\nIn 1970 a [[mechanized infantry]] battalion was added to the regiment and was named 3rd Canadian Mechanized Commando. This unit was an element of the [[4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group|4th Canadian Mechanized Brigade]] and was stationed in CFB Baden, Germany. Although it was part of the regiment it did not have a parachute role. It was disbanded in 1977.\n\n==Organization, size, and identity==\nThe Airborne Regiment also suffered from frequent reorganizations. Initially conceived as a small brigade, its lack of resources forced it from the start to become a rather large [[battlegroup (army)|tactical \"regiment\"]] with two infantry \"commandos\", one English-speaking and the other mostly French-speaking, as well as one artillery battery, one field engineer squadron, one signal squadron, and a service company.\n\nA tug-of-war thus started between advocates of an exclusive \"airborne\" identity versus Canada's other infantry regiments, whose support was needed to promote a flow of soldiers and, in particular, leaders. An uneasy compromise was reached after 10 years, in 1979, when the Airborne was reorganized into three infantry commandos each identified with, and supported from, one of Canada's three line infantry regiments. Over time, this support was generally excellent, and the commandos became a legitimate part of their regimental family of origin. There were, however, occasions when the quality of that support was questioned (see [[Somalia Affair]]).\n\nThe resources provided for the Airborne continued to dwindle. In 1977, when the regiment moved to CFB Petawawa from Edmonton, it became the core of the Airborne Battle Group within the new [[Special Service Force]], an all-arms light brigade group, tasked with the rapid reinforcement of NATO forces in Norway or Denmark. Its airborne artillery and engineer elements were reassigned to their parent units of the brigade. The total peacetime strength of the regiment was down to 750 all ranks.\n\nIn 1992, the Canadian Airborne Regiment was reduced to battalion size (601 members). Its commandos lost their status as distinct administrative units commanded by Commanding Officers and became companies of the Airborne, commanded by an Officer Commanding, albeit maintaining their links with their regiments of origin.\n\nIn the 1970s a mechanized infantry battalion had been created within Canada's [[4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group|down-sized brigade]] in Germany and named 3 Canadian Mechanized Commando; its dress, colours and other symbols were those of the Canadian Airborne Regiment. This designation was a convenient mechanism for manning it from Canada's two English-speaking infantry regiments, allowing both to maintain NATO expertise. However, its role was strictly that of a mechanized infantry battalion and had nothing to do with the parachute operations of the regiment in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Airborne Regiment was ordered to be disbanded by the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] after the [[Somalia Affair]] on September 1, 1995. This move occurred during a period marked by severe defence budget cuts and internal reorganization. Although General [[John de Chastelain]], Chief of Defence Staff, publicly disagreed with the minister on this decision, it is likely that the lack of an obvious role in the force structure outlined in the ''1994 Defence White Paper'', as well as a record of controversy during its peace-time history, allowed much of [[National Defence Headquarters]] leadership to tacitly concur with the minister's reaction to the Somalia Affair.\n\n==Operational service==\n\n===In Canada===\nThe Airborne deployed twice at home in the 1970s: once in response to the [[October Crisis]] in Quebec in 1970, then in 1976 to provide counter-terrorism support during the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Olympics]].\n\n===Cyprus===\nThe Canadian Airborne Regiment's first overseas tour was to [[Cyprus]] in April 1974, viewed at the time as an ordinary peace-keeping task. The contingent was structured around its 1<sup>er</sup> Commando and its field (engineer) squadron.\n\nHowever, in July 1974, an attempt by agents of the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|dictatorship then ruling Greece]] to seize power and unite the island with Greece was met by military intervention from Turkey, which [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded Cyprus]] on July 20. In a two-stage offensive, Turkish troops took control of 38% of the island. Many [[Greek Cypriots]] fled south while many [[Turkish Cypriots]] fled north.\n\nIn the first phase, the 1<sup>er</sup> Commando consolidated its positions on the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] in [[Nicosia]], while the rest of the regiment deployed rapidly from its base in Edmonton. On 14 August the second wave of the Turkish invasion began and both sides began to target UN positions. After the ceasefire, the Turks and Greeks began building defensive positions. Meanwhile, the Airborne troops, with British support, took command of the international airport to deny further troop movement, then intervened with patrols to prevent escalation of the conflict, patrolling the buffer zone between the lines, assisting with the delivery of relief supplies to refugees and organizing exchanges of PoWs. The Airborne lost two killed (Paras Berger and Perron of the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]]) and 30 wounded, while also earning several significant decorations.\n\nThe Airborne continued its peacekeeping rotations to Cyprus, returning to the island in 1981, 1985 (3 Commando under 2nd Regiment [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]]) and 1986 (less 3 Commando).\n\n===Somalia 1992===\nSince the Airborne was designed to deploy rapidly into \"hot\" situations, its 1, 2, and 3 Commando units, with attached support\u2014a total of 900 soldiers\u2014were sent to Somalia late in 1992.

The regiment bears [[battle honour]]s on its Regimental Colours from both units, including Normandy Landing, Dives Crossing and Rhine in the case of the former, and Monte Camino, Monte Majo, Monte La Difensa/Monte La Remetanea, Anzio and Rome in the case of the latter.\n\n===1st Canadian Parachute Battalion===\nThe 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was Canada's original airborne unit, formed on July 1, 1942. Volunteers completed jump training in England then underwent four months of training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and the Parachute Training Wing at Shilo, Manitoba. Part airman, part commando, and part engineer, the paras underwent dangerously realistic exercises to learn demolition and fieldcraft in overcoming obstacles such as barbed wire, bridges, and pillboxes. By March, Canada had its elite battalion, which returned to England to join the 6th Airborne Division as a unit of the Britain's 3rd Parachute Brigade.\n\nThe battalion's service in the European theatre included the airborne invasion on D-Day, a short reinforcement stint in Belgium and the Netherlands, the airborne crossing of the Rhine and the subsequent advance to Wismar where they met the Russians.\n\nWith victory in Europe and the Pacific War ending in August, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was disbanded. The battalion was perpetuated in the infantry commandos of The Canadian Airborne Regiment, whose colours carried the battle honours: Normandy Landing, Dives Crossing, The Rhine, and North-west Europe 1944\u20131945.\n\n===First Special Service Force===\nThe Canadian Airborne Regiment also drew much inspiration from the history of the First Special Service Force. The Regiment bears the FSSF battle honours Monte Camino, Monte Majo, Monte La Difensa/Monte La Rmetanea, Anzio and Rome on its Regimental Colour. As well the unconventional nature of the First Special Service Force, similar to the [[British SAS]] and the current [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] and elsewhere, was not replicated in the more conventional role of the Canadian Airborne Regiment. Nevertheless, its accomplishments served as a model for many members of the new \"Airborne\".\n\nThe First Special Service Force was a unique joint formation of Canadian and American troops assigned to perform sabotage operations in Europe in World War II. Simply named \"special forces\" to conceal its \"commando\" or \"ranger\" purpose, this unit later gained fame as the \"[[Devil's Brigade]]\". The Canadians were designated the \"2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion\".\n\nMembers were handpicked and sent to [[Helena, Montana]], for special training. The Canadians wore American uniforms and equivalent ranks to eliminate any questions of command among the troops. Their work-up took place in three phases, with extensive physical training throughout the program. The first phase included parachute training, small unit tactics and weapons handling\u2014all officers and ranks were required to master the full range of infantry weapons from pistols and carbines to [[bazooka]]s and [[flame thrower]]s. Next came explosives handling and demolition techniques, then a final phase consisted of skiing, rock climbing, adapting to cold weather, and operation of the Weasel combat vehicle. Exercises in amphibious landings and beach assaults were added later.\n\nThe first deployment of FSSF to the Aleutian island of [[Kiska]] disappointed the troops when it was found that the Japanese forces expected there had already evacuated, but the exercise was considered good experience. The force was next sent to Italy, where German forces entrenched in two mountains were inflicting heavy casualties on the 5th US Army. The first regiment, 600 men, scaled a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} cliff by night to surprise the enemy position. Planned as a three- to four-day assault, the battle was won in just two hours. The force remained for three days, packing in supplies for defensive positions and fighting frostbite, then moved on to the second mountain, which was soon overtaken. In the end, FSSF suffered 511 casualties including 73 dead and 116 exhaustion cases. The commander, Colonel [[Robert Frederick]], was wounded twice himself.\n\nFSSF saw continued action throughout the Mediterranean, at [[Monte Sammucro]], [[Radicosa]], and [[Anzio beachhead|Anzio]]. For the final advance on [[Rome]], 1SSF was given the honour of being the lead force in the assault and became the first Allied unit to enter the \"Eternal City\". Their success later continued in southern France and then at the France-Italian border. Often misused as line troops, the force suffered continuously high casualties until it was finally withdrawn from combat.\n\nOn the December 5, 1944, in the town of Menton in southern France, the First Special Service Force was disbanded. Its battle honours included Monte Camino, Monte La Difensa, Monte La Remetanea, Monte Majo, Anzio, Rome, Advance to the Tiber, Italy 1943\u201344, Southern France and Northwest Europe. The Canadians rejoined their home units and the Americans were assigned to either Airborne units or the newly formed 474th Infantry Regiment. Frederick became the youngest Major-General ever in the American army, at the age of 37, and took command of the 45th Division.\n\nThe success, esprit and discipline of FSSF became a template for building modern special forces worldwide.\n\n===Post-war parachute units===\nIn 1947, the [[Canadian Special Air Service Company]] was created with former members of the 1 Can Para and FSSF at its core. It was commanded by Major [[Guy D'Artois]], a Canadian veteran of the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]], First Special Service Force and \"F\" Section Special Operations Executive.\n\nHowever, in 1950, Canada was once again mobilizing, this time for Korea and NATO Europe. Each of Canada's three traditional Regular Force regiments ([[The Royal Canadian Regiment]], [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] and [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]]) expanded to three battalions. A brigade commitment, consisting of airborne and air-delivered troops to defend Canada's North, was undertaken. Battalions of this Brigade were all airborne. It was structured, over the next 20 years, into the \"Mobile Strike Force\" and subsequently reduced in size to the \"Defence of Canada Force\". This parachute role, was switched from one battalion to another within each of Canada's regular infantry regiments, as they rotated to and from Korea and, subsequently, to Europe. The brigade's elements remained garrisoned in their respective bases across the country and seldom exercised as a complete brigade.\n\nEach of the battalions was trained to fly into Canada's North, and seize an airhead or location that could be developed for airlanded operations. When the role changed from one battalion to another, within each regiment, a small nucleus of specialized instructor-planners and riggers generally transferred over to the new battalion; however, the rest of the unit quickly undertook the requisite parachutist qualifications, generally with much enthusiasm; the requirement that parachutists be \"volunteers\" was rarely an issue in converting these tightly-knit infantry units. There were also airborne artillery, signals, medics, and engineer elements in the brigade.\n\nIn 1958 the \"Mobile Strike Force\" was restructured as \"The Defence of Canada Force\", resulting in a reduction to one parachute company in each battalion. At this time the airborne artillery was disbanded and other support elements reduced. The parachute component in each battalion consisted of battalion tactical headquarters, and a large company group (i.e. four platoons) with support detachments of mortars, machine guns, pioneers and reconnaissance detachments. A large reserve of trained parachutists was built up in the other companies.\n\nIn 1968, many of the officers and soldiers of the \"Defence of Canada Force\" provided the nucleus of expertise for the new Canadian Airborne Regiment, being created at CFB Griesbach, Edmonton, Alberta, with its French-speaking element at CFB Valcartier, Quebec.\n\n===Current parachute capability of the Canadian Forces===\nAfter the disbandment of the Canadian Airborne Regiment in 1995, the Canadian army reverted to its former practice of maintaining a parachute company within one of the battalions of each of the regular infantry regiments. The commandos, at that time, returned to their regimental \"homes\" and became a company of the light battalion of each of their regiments (the [[3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment]], the 3rd Battalion [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] and the 3rd Battalion [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]]). As of 2018, only the 3rd Battalion RCR is an airmobile and air assault capable battalion (the first and by now only one in Canada), having been converted to that role in 2011, as part of the growing international deployments of the Army outside Canada (formerly only M company was assigned to the parachute role within the battalion). Unlike the British Army, while personnel of each of the Primary Reserve infantry regiments are parachute trained in the platoon level, aside from the reserve battalion of [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]] (which is airborne capable), no other regiment in the Primary Reserve infantry has any parachute-ready nor air assault companies in their ranks.\n\nIn April 2005, the Canadian government's new defence policy statement was made public. It included a concept of first responders for international tasks consisting of \"special forces\" (such as [[Joint Task Force 2]]) supported by one of the light battalions (presumably on a rotational basis), including the parachute capability of its integral para company.\n\nAs a result, the [[Canadian Special Operations Regiment]] (CSOR) was formed, which unlike the CAR is a joint-service formation, composed of special forces-trained personnel of the Armed Forces. Unlike the CAR, it was awarded a tan Regimental Standard, similar to the [[Royal Canadian Armoured Corps]] armoured regiments designated as horse guards and dragoon guards, which carry crimson standards on parades. Only the FSSF service honours are shared by this regiment with the CAR, as well as its lineage.\n\nThus, since the 3rd Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment is as of the present the only airborne battalion in the Regular Force, as part of the more senior regular regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps it takes part in public parades as the 9th place overall in the Canadian Army according to the [[Canadian Armed Forces order of precedence]], and 1st in the line of march as part of the infantry. The parachute companies of the other two Regular Force infantry regiments march as part of their respective battalions and as such these battalions, as part of their regiments, are ranked as nos.10 and 11 in the Army order of precedence (nos.2 and 3 in the order of precedence of the entire RCIC). (Unlike the CAR, save for regimental ceremonies, the CSOR does not parade in public owing to their role, nor are they part of the official precedence list.)\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:\u201cINTO ACTION\u201d by Andre Gauthier CFB Petawawa.JPG|thumb|right|''Into Action'' (1998) by Andre Gauthier]]\n* ''Into Action'' (1988) by [[Andr\u00e9 Gauthier (sculptor)|Andr\u00e9 Gauthier]] marks the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Airborne Regiment; the sculpture at the entrance to [[Canadian Forces Base Petawawa]]'s Airborne Forces Museum depicts a Canadian paratrooper in winter combat gear.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canada|War}}\n*[[Operation Deliverance]]\n\n==Media==\n* The Canadian Airborne Regiment in Somalia: A socio-cultural inquiry : a study by Donna Winslow (1997)\n* What Manner of Man: Darnell Bass and the Canadian Airborne Regiment by James Ogle (Jan 2006)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050305230122/http://www.commando.org/index.php Unofficial site of the Canadian Airborne Regiment]\n{{Canadian Armed Forces}}\n{{Canadian Forces Land Force Command}}\n{{Canada topics}}\n{{Commons}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canadian Airborne Regiment}}\n[[Category:Former infantry regiments of Canada]]\n[[Category:Airborne units and formations of Canada]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1968]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1995]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2011}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name=Canadian Airborne Regiment\n| image=Canadian Airborne Regiment.png\n| image_size=200px\n| caption=Cap badge of The Canadian Airborne Regiment\n| dates=8 April 1968&nbsp;\u2013 1 September 1995\n| country=[[Canada]]\n| branch=Army\n| type=Parachute Infantry\n| role= - Parachute infantry<br />- Infantry<br />- Reconnaissance<br />- Search and Rescue as part of Canada's Major Air Disaster (MAJAID) response plan.\n| command_structure=[[Royal Canadian Infantry Corps]]\n| size= Approx. 600 members\n| current_commander=\n| garrison= [[CFB Griesbach]](1968-1977)<br />[[CFB Petawawa]](1977-1995)\n| ceremonial_chief= [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]]\n| ceremonial_chief_label=Colonel in Chief\n| colonel_of_the_regiment=\n| nickname=\n| motto= ''Ex coelis'' (From the Clouds)\n| colors=\n| march= ''The Longest Day''\n| mascot=\n| battles=\n| notable_commanders=\n| anniversaries=\n\n}}\n\nThe '''Canadian Airborne Regiment''' ({{lang-fr|R\u00e9giment a\u00e9roport\u00e9 canadien}}) was a [[Canadian Forces]] formation created on April 8, 1968. It was not an administrative [[regiment]] in the commonly accepted British Commonwealth sense, but rather a tactical formation manned from other regiments and branches. It was disbanded in 1995 after the [[Somalia Affair]].\n\n==Origin and organizational aspects==\n\n===The concept of the Airborne===\nThe main proponent of the Airborne was General [[Jean Victor Allard]] who, as commander of the Army (i.e. Mobile Command) and then [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of Defence Staff]], created it between 1965 and 1968 as a large rapid-reaction, light mobile force, suitable for overseas [[brigade]]-size missions. It was designed as a flexible short-term immediate response available to the government when it accepted an overseas reinforcement or intervention mission within [[NATO]], or elsewhere. It would be replaced in a brigade's proposed mission area, after no more than a few weeks, once the main body of a heavier brigade was mobilized and transported with its fighting vehicles and support to the area. (See Gen. Allard's memoirs, Chap. 12.)\n\nOver time, and a succession of chiefs of defence, the Airborne remained an object of conflicting concepts of operations, military structure and linguistic identity. Originally designed as a quick-reaction immediate-response force that could, if absolutely necessary, use [[parachute]]s, it was quickly transformed into a highly specialized parachute force, to be used for special parachute missions in the regular order of battle. (See Allard's memoirs.) This, in turn, created controversy since there was no accepted requirement for such a Canadian Forces capability in operational plans, other than the rather pedestrian task of jumping into remote locations in the Canadian Arctic.\n\nThe original concept of the Airborne envisaged a rotation of young [[infantry]] soldiers and officers through its units, serving a maximum of two years. It was to be an essential and exciting posting for all young infantry leaders prior to their promotion to sergeant or captain in their own regiment. Allard wrote: \"this regiment would not reflect the identity of a Victorian-era regiment because its members would serve in it for only a short period (Chap 12).\" However, under Allard's successors, the Airborne became instead another separate regiment, specializing in parachuting, and keeping its members for as long as possible. It adopted all the symbols of a line regiment, including badges, colours, and history (creating a historical link with Canadian war-time parachute battalions). In particular, it sought to replace the identity of its members from Canada's line regiments with that of the Airborne. This aborted the original operational purpose of the Airborne and, significantly, planted the seeds of an ongoing conflict of identity and loyalty within the Canadian infantry family. Allard wrote that \"those who took this route showed an absolute ignorance of the requirement for quick-reaction in today's world.\"\n\n===Location===\nOn General Allard's retirement, the unit was established at [[CFB Griesbach]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], in 1968.<ref>[http://militarybruce.com/abandoned-canadian-military-bases/abandoned-bases/alberta/ Bruce Forsyth's Canadian Military History Page - Canadian Forces Base Edmonton (Griesbach Barracks)] Retrieved: 2018-11-30</ref> This was a large Air Transport Command base. The prairie weather is ideal for specialized parachute training, and Edmonton is the \"gateway to the North\". But the location in western Canada was disputed by some for operational reasons in that Canada's rapidly declining troop strength was consequently heavily skewed to that part of the continent where neither its population nor its [[NATO]] commitments justified. There was a full brigade in the West, plus the Airborne. In central and eastern Canada, there were only four battalions of infantry.\n\nThe Edmonton location also created linguistic problems. The Airborne's French-speaking elements had initially been left at [[CFB Valcartier]] in Quebec, but they have also moved to Alberta in 1970.  There, it became difficult to keep them up to strength, particularly as many married leaders refused to make their career in an environment unsuitable for their families.\n\nFinally, in the face of recruiting and retention problems, as well as operational concerns, the Airborne was moved to [[CFB Petawawa]] in Ontario, where it remained until it was disbanded.\n\nIn 1970 a [[mechanized infantry]] battalion was added to the regiment and was named 3rd Canadian Mechanized Commando. This unit was an element of the [[4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group|4th Canadian Mechanized Brigade]] and was stationed in CFB Baden, Germany. Although it was part of the regiment it did not have a parachute role. It was disbanded in 1977.\n\n==Organization, size, and identity==\nThe Airborne Regiment also suffered from frequent reorganizations. Initially conceived as a small brigade, its lack of resources forced it from the start to become a rather large [[battlegroup (army)|tactical \"regiment\"]] with two infantry \"commandos\", one English-speaking and the other mostly French-speaking, as well as one artillery battery, one field engineer squadron, one signal squadron, and a service company.\n\nA tug-of-war thus started between advocates of an exclusive \"airborne\" identity versus Canada's other infantry regiments, whose support was needed to promote a flow of soldiers and, in particular, leaders. An uneasy compromise was reached after 10 years, in 1979, when the Airborne was reorganized into three infantry commandos each identified with, and supported from, one of Canada's three line infantry regiments. Over time, this support was generally excellent, and the commandos became a legitimate part of their regimental family of origin. There were, however, occasions when the quality of that support was questioned (see [[Somalia Affair]]).\n\nThe resources provided for the Airborne continued to dwindle. In 1977, when the regiment moved to CFB Petawawa from Edmonton, it became the core of the Airborne Battle Group within the new [[Special Service Force]], an all-arms light brigade group, tasked with the rapid reinforcement of NATO forces in Norway or Denmark. Its airborne artillery and engineer elements were reassigned to their parent units of the brigade. The total peacetime strength of the regiment was down to 750 all ranks.\n\nIn 1992, the Canadian Airborne Regiment was reduced to battalion size (601 members). Its commandos lost their status as distinct administrative units commanded by Commanding Officers and became companies of the Airborne, commanded by an Officer Commanding, albeit maintaining their links with their regiments of origin.\n\nIn the 1970s a mechanized infantry battalion had been created within Canada's [[4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group|down-sized brigade]] in Germany and named 3 Canadian Mechanized Commando; its dress, colours and other symbols were those of the Canadian Airborne Regiment. This designation was a convenient mechanism for manning it from Canada's two English-speaking infantry regiments, allowing both to maintain NATO expertise. However, its role was strictly that of a mechanized infantry battalion and had nothing to do with the parachute operations of the regiment in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Airborne Regiment was ordered to be disbanded by the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] after the [[Somalia Affair]] on September 1, 1995. This move occurred during a period marked by severe defence budget cuts and internal reorganization. Although General [[John de Chastelain]], Chief of Defence Staff, publicly disagreed with the minister on this decision, it is likely that the lack of an obvious role in the force structure outlined in the ''1994 Defence White Paper'', as well as a record of controversy during its peace-time history, allowed much of [[National Defence Headquarters]] leadership to tacitly concur with the minister's reaction to the Somalia Affair.\n\n==Operational service==\n\n===In Canada===\nThe Airborne deployed twice at home in the 1970s: once in response to the [[October Crisis]] in Quebec in 1970, then in 1976 to provide counter-terrorism support during the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Olympics]].\n\n===Cyprus===\nThe Canadian Airborne Regiment's first overseas tour was to [[Cyprus]] in April 1974, viewed at the time as an ordinary peace-keeping task. The contingent was structured around its 1<sup>er</sup> Commando and its field (engineer) squadron.\n\nHowever, in July 1974, an attempt by agents of the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|dictatorship then ruling Greece]] to seize power and unite the island with Greece was met by military intervention from Turkey, which [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded Cyprus]] on July 20. In a two-stage offensive, Turkish troops took control of 38% of the island. Many [[Greek Cypriots]] fled south while many [[Turkish Cypriots]] fled north.\n\nIn the first phase, the 1<sup>er</sup> Commando consolidated its positions on the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] in [[Nicosia]], while the rest of the regiment deployed rapidly from its base in Edmonton. On 14 August the second wave of the Turkish invasion began and both sides began to target UN positions. After the ceasefire, the Turks and Greeks began building defensive positions. Meanwhile, the Airborne troops, with British support, took command of the international airport to deny further troop movement, then intervened with patrols to prevent escalation of the conflict, patrolling the buffer zone between the lines, assisting with the delivery of relief supplies to refugees and organizing exchanges of PoWs. The Airborne lost two killed (Paras Berger and Perron of the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]]) and 30 wounded, while also earning several significant decorations.\n\nThe Airborne continued its peacekeeping rotations to Cyprus, returning to the island in 1981, 1985 (3 Commando under 2nd Regiment [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]]) and 1986 (less 3 Commando).\n\n===Somalia 1992===\nSince the Airborne was designed to deploy rapidly into \"hot\" situations, its 1, 2, and 3 Commando units, with attached support\u2014a total of 900 soldiers\u2014were sent to Somalia late in 1992. The operation was called [[Operation Deliverance]] and formed part of the overall U.S.-led [[Operation Restore Hope]].\n\nThe unit had recently been reduced to battalion size and was still in the throes of reorganization as well as the severe cut-backs by the government at the time. Its positive accomplishments in Somalia have been overshadowed by the torture and murder of Somali teenager [[Shidane Arone]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/canadian-soldiers-under-investigation|title=Canadian soldiers under investigation - CBC Archives|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en}}</ref> soldiers under investigation, which became known as the [[Somalia Affair]]. The unit was subsequently disbanded.\n\n==Lineage of The Canadian Airborne Regiment==\nThe Canadian Airborne Regiment traces its origin to the Second World War\u2013era [[1st Canadian Parachute Battalion]] (1 Can Para) and the [[First Special Service Force]] (FSSF) which was administratively known as the [[2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion]].

As of 2018, only the 3rd Battalion RCR is an airmobile and air assault capable battalion (the first and by now only one in Canada), having been converted to that role in 2011, as part of the growing international deployments of the Army outside Canada (formerly only M company was assigned to the parachute role within the battalion). Unlike the British Army, while personnel of each of the Primary Reserve infantry regiments are parachute trained in the platoon level, aside from the reserve battalion of [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]] (which is airborne capable), no other regiment in the Primary Reserve infantry has any parachute-ready nor air assault companies in their ranks.\n\nIn April 2005, the Canadian government's new defence policy statement was made public. It included a concept of first responders for international tasks consisting of \"special forces\" (such as [[Joint Task Force 2]]) supported by one of the light battalions (presumably on a rotational basis), including the parachute capability of its integral para company.\n\nAs a result, the [[Canadian Special Operations Regiment]] (CSOR) was formed, which unlike the CAR is a joint-service formation, composed of special forces-trained personnel of the Armed Forces. Unlike the CAR, it was awarded a tan Regimental Standard, similar to the [[Royal Canadian Armoured Corps]] armoured regiments designated as horse guards and dragoon guards, which carry crimson standards on parades. Only the FSSF service honours are shared by this regiment with the CAR, as well as its lineage.\n\nThus, since the 3rd Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment is as of the present the only airborne battalion in the Regular Force, as part of the more senior regular regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps it takes part in public parades as the 9th place overall in the Canadian Army according to the [[Canadian Armed Forces order of precedence]], and 1st in the line of march as part of the infantry. The parachute companies of the other two Regular Force infantry regiments march as part of their respective battalions and as such these battalions, as part of their regiments, are ranked as nos.10 and 11 in the Army order of precedence (nos.2 and 3 in the order of precedence of the entire RCIC). (Unlike the CAR, save for regimental ceremonies, the CSOR does not parade in public owing to their role, nor are they part of the official precedence list.)\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:\u201cINTO ACTION\u201d by Andre Gauthier CFB Petawawa.JPG|thumb|right|''Into Action'' (1998) by Andre Gauthier]]\n* ''Into Action'' (1988) by [[Andr\u00e9 Gauthier (sculptor)|Andr\u00e9 Gauthier]] marks the 20th anniversary of the Canadian Airborne Regiment; the sculpture at the entrance to [[Canadian Forces Base Petawawa]]'s Airborne Forces Museum depicts a Canadian paratrooper in winter combat gear.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canada|War}}\n*[[Operation Deliverance]]\n\n==Media==\n* The Canadian Airborne Regiment in Somalia: A socio-cultural inquiry : a study by Donna Winslow (1997)\n* What Manner of Man: Darnell Bass and the Canadian Airborne Regiment by James Ogle (Jan 2006)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050305230122/http://www.commando.org/index.php Unofficial site of the Canadian Airborne Regiment]\n{{Canadian Armed Forces}}\n{{Canadian Forces Land Force Command}}\n{{Canada topics}}\n{{Commons}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canadian Airborne Regiment}}\n[[Category:Former infantry regiments of Canada]]\n[[Category:Airborne units and formations of Canada]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1968]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1995]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "Foofbun", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe concept of the Airborne", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Airborne_Regiment"}

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''.
