It helps to understand what building restoration is in context with the other standards:\n* '''Preservation''' \"places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair.\" All materials added to a building over its life are retained and only work which is necessary to protect it from deterioration is carried out.\n* '''Rehabilitation''' is a standard for preservation but is more lenient because it presumes the building is so deteriorated that it needs some repairs to prevent further deterioration.\n* '''Restoration''' includes preservation, leaving as much material untouched as possible, reconstruction to replace missing elements, and repair work to bring the building to a historically accurate condition in one particular time period. This may include removing some historic building elements (after documenting them) to make the building historically accurate for a specific date in history.\n* '''Reconstruction''' allows the re-creation of a missing building or element in all new, appropriate materials.\n\nThe first steps in a restoration to the Secretary's standards are to study the building and choose a time period for the restoration. The new use of the building should be consistent with the original use or at least with the time period of the restoration. Materials which were added after the chosen time period must be documented and then may be removed while preserving and repairing the appropriate materials. Materials missing may be reconstructed to \"...match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials.\" which are evidence based. Modern chemical and physical treatments may be gently used if they do not damage the historic materials, and archaeological resources will be preserved or mitigated. The standards recognize that there are inherent conflicts with modern codes and regulations for energy efficiency, health, safety, and accessibility. The standards allow sensitive alterations of historic buildings to meet the spirit of the codes and regulations, if necessary.\n\n==Agents of Deterioration==\nAs buildings can sustain various forms of damage and deterioration over time, understanding the cause of this damage and finding the best way to treat and prevent it is an important aspect to building restoration. The Agents of Deterioration are the ten primary sources of damage to heritage objects and buildings comprised in a comprehensive list by the Canadian Conservation Institute. The Agents are physical forces, fire, pests, light (ultraviolet and infrared), [[Relative humidity|incorrect relative humidity]], thieves and vandals, water, pollutants, incorrect temperature and the [[dissociation]] of objects.<ref>Canadian Conservation Institute.

Retrieved on 28 April 2020.</ref> While each of the ten agents can affect a historic building, some agents cause more common types of damage that may be addressed through building restoration.\n\nAs the original components of some historic building are made of wood or other flammable substances, the threat of fire damage can be great. Damage can result from internal fires such as electrical faults, external fires including forest fires and damage due to lightning strikes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Restored chapel|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824110733/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|archivedate=24 August 2015}}</ref> Fire damage can also increase the likelihood of water damage due to exposure to the elements, sprinkler systems and water used by safety personnel to put out the fire. Building restoration needed for this time of damage can include replacing wooden beams and structural elements as soon as possible to ensure that the building does not collapse, removing burnt flooring and plaster, and following a detailed plan of action to make sure that elements of the building are not lost during the restoration process.<ref>Hutton, Tim.

This can include burst pipes or flooding resulting in the peeling of paint from internal walls, the running of dyes from textiles and general staining.<ref>Tremain, David.

Retrieved on 28 April 2020.</ref> Water damage also includes [[mold]] growth and internal deterioration due to incorrect humidity levels or a lack of [[humidity control]] within the building.  For historic buildings in areas that are prone to persistent flooding, the building can be raised or moved to a higher location. To mitigate general water control, an inspection checklist can be created for staff to inspect noticeable pipes, make note of any leaks within the building during storms as well as ensuring exterior elements of the historic building are adequately removing water such as drains and gutters. Internal humidity control devices can also mitigate mold and damage stemming from moisture.\n\nPest control and awareness can prevent a variety of damage to historic buildings as well as preventing further damage in the future. Pests can include a variety of things from termites who can feast on the wooden structural elements of a historic building to rodents who may gnaw on or burrow into the building and objects within the building. Damage created by large pest infestations such as termites can be irreversible, with building restoration taking the form of replacement in order to maintain a sound structure for the building.<ref>Jones, R., Silence, P. & Webster, M.

For historic buildings in areas that are prone to persistent flooding, the building can be raised or moved to a higher location. To mitigate general water control, an inspection checklist can be created for staff to inspect noticeable pipes, make note of any leaks within the building during storms as well as ensuring exterior elements of the historic building are adequately removing water such as drains and gutters. Internal humidity control devices can also mitigate mold and damage stemming from moisture.\n\nPest control and awareness can prevent a variety of damage to historic buildings as well as preventing further damage in the future. Pests can include a variety of things from termites who can feast on the wooden structural elements of a historic building to rodents who may gnaw on or burrow into the building and objects within the building. Damage created by large pest infestations such as termites can be irreversible, with building restoration taking the form of replacement in order to maintain a sound structure for the building.<ref>Jones, R., Silence, P. & Webster, M.

The plague affected [[Roman culture]] and [[Roman literature|literature]] and may have severely affected [[Indo-Roman trade relations]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n== Epidemiology ==\n[[File:Galenosgruppe (Wiener Dioskurides).jpg|thumb|A group of physicians in an image from the [[Vienna Dioscurides]], named after the physician [[Galen]] shown at the top centre.]]\nIn 166, during the epidemic, the Greek physician and writer [[Galen]] travelled from [[Rome]] to his home in [[Asia Minor]] and returned to Rome in 168, when he was summoned by the two [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]], the co-emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]]. He was present at the outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]] in the winter of 168/69. Galen briefly recorded observations and a description of the epidemic in the treatise ''Methodus Medendi'', and he scattered other references to it among his voluminous writings. He described the plague as \"great\" and of long duration and mentions [[fever]], [[diarrhea]] and [[pharyngitis]] as well as a skin eruption and sometimes dry and sometimes [[pus|pustular]] that appeared on the ninth day of the illness. The information that was provided by Galen did not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.<ref>See [[Frank McLynn|McLynn, Frank]], ''Marcus Aurelius, Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', Vintage Books, London, 2009.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill]]<ref>McNeill, W.H. 1976 ''Plagues and Peoples''. New York Anchor Press. {{ISBN|0-385-11256-4}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref> asserts that the Antonine Plague and the later [[Plague of Cyprian]] (251\u2013ca. 270) were outbreaks of two different diseases, one of [[smallpox]] and one of [[measles]] but not necessarily in that order. The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox.<ref>D. Ch.

[[Lucian of Samosata]]'s irony-laden account of the charlatan [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]] records a verse of his \"which he despatched to all the nations during the pestilence... was to be seen written over doorways everywhere\", particularly in the houses that were emptied, Lucian further remarks.<ref>Lucian, ''Alexander'', 36.</ref>\n\nThe epidemic had drastic social and political effects throughout the Roman Empire. [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] (1776\u20131831) concluded that \"as the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague.... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\"<ref>Niebuhr, ''Lectures on the history of Rome'' III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849), quoted by Gilliam 1961:225</ref> During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], Marcus Aurelius wrote his philosophical work ''[[Meditations]]''. A passage (IX.2) states that even the pestilence around him was less deadly than falsehood, evil behaviour and lack of true understanding. As he lay dying, he uttered the words, \"Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others.\" [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737\u20131794) and [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] (1870\u20131952) assigned the Antonine plague less influence than contemporary political and economic trends, respectively.\n\n==Military concerns==\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Sestertius 177 860042.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman coin]] commemorating the victories of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] against the Germanic tribes along the [[Danube]] frontier in the early 170s AD]]\nSome direct effects of the contagion stand out. When imperial forces moved east, under the command of Emperor Verus, after the forces of [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] attacked [[Armenia]], the Romans' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease. According to the 5th-century Spanish writer [[Paulus Orosius]], many towns and villages in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Europe|European]] provinces lost all of their inhabitants. As the disease swept north to the [[Rhine]], it also infected [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Gaul|Gallic]] peoples outside the empire's borders. For a number of years, those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations. With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back. From 167 to his death, Marcus Aurelius personally commanded legions near the [[Danube]], trying, with only partial success, to control the advance of Germanic peoples across the river. A major offensive against the [[Marcomanni]] was postponed to 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops.\n\n==Indian Ocean trade and Han China==\n\nAlthough [[Ge Hong]] was the first writer of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] who accurately described the symptoms of smallpox, the historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]] mused that the plagues afflicting the [[Eastern Han]] Empire during the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146\u2013168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168\u2013189)&nbsp;\u2013 with outbreaks in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185&nbsp;\u2013 were perhaps connected to the Antonine plague on the western end of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]].

He was present at the outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]] in the winter of 168/69. Galen briefly recorded observations and a description of the epidemic in the treatise ''Methodus Medendi'', and he scattered other references to it among his voluminous writings. He described the plague as \"great\" and of long duration and mentions [[fever]], [[diarrhea]] and [[pharyngitis]] as well as a skin eruption and sometimes dry and sometimes [[pus|pustular]] that appeared on the ninth day of the illness. The information that was provided by Galen did not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.<ref>See [[Frank McLynn|McLynn, Frank]], ''Marcus Aurelius, Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', Vintage Books, London, 2009.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill]]<ref>McNeill, W.H. 1976 ''Plagues and Peoples''.

The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox.<ref>D. Ch.

[[Lucian of Samosata]]'s irony-laden account of the charlatan [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]] records a verse of his \"which he despatched to all the nations during the pestilence... was to be seen written over doorways everywhere\", particularly in the houses that were emptied, Lucian further remarks.<ref>Lucian, ''Alexander'', 36.</ref>\n\nThe epidemic had drastic social and political effects throughout the Roman Empire. [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] (1776\u20131831) concluded that \"as the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague.... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\"<ref>Niebuhr, ''Lectures on the history of Rome'' III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849), quoted by Gilliam 1961:225</ref> During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], Marcus Aurelius wrote his philosophical work ''[[Meditations]]''. A passage (IX.2) states that even the pestilence around him was less deadly than falsehood, evil behaviour and lack of true understanding. As he lay dying, he uttered the words, \"Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others.\" [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737\u20131794) and [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] (1870\u20131952) assigned the Antonine plague less influence than contemporary political and economic trends, respectively.\n\n==Military concerns==\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Sestertius 177 860042.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman coin]] commemorating the victories of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] against the Germanic tribes along the [[Danube]] frontier in the early 170s AD]]\nSome direct effects of the contagion stand out. When imperial forces moved east, under the command of Emperor Verus, after the forces of [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] attacked [[Armenia]], the Romans' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease. According to the 5th-century Spanish writer [[Paulus Orosius]], many towns and villages in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Europe|European]] provinces of lost all of their inhabitants. As the disease swept north to the [[Rhine]], it also infected [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Gaul|Gallic]] peoples outside the empire's borders. For a number of years, those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations. With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back. From 167 to his death, Marcus Aurelius personally commanded legions near the [[Danube]], trying, with only partial success, to control the advance of Germanic peoples across the river. A major offensive against the [[Marcomanni]] was postponed to 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops.\n\n==Indian Ocean trade and Han China==\n\nAlthough [[Ge Hong]] was the first writer of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] who accurately described the symptoms of smallpox, the historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]] mused that the plagues afflicting the [[Eastern Han]] Empire during the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146\u2013168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168\u2013189)&nbsp;\u2013 with outbreaks in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185&nbsp;\u2013 were perhaps connected to the Antonine plague on the western end of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]].

The Evolution of Human Sexuality''''' is a 1997 book about the [[evolution]] of [[human sexuality]] by the biologist [[Jared Diamond]].\n\n==Summary==\n{{expand section|date=April 2019}}\nDiamond addresses aspects of human sexuality such as why women's [[ovulation]] is not overtly advertised ([[concealed ovulation]]); why humans have sex in private rather than in public like other mammals; and why the [[ovaries]] are U-shaped.{{sfn|Diamond|1997|pages=1\u2013146}}\n\nThe book is divided into 7 chapters:\n\n# '''The Animal With the Weirdest Sex Life:''' Author proposes that Human Beings have one of the strangest sex lives. He gives following points:\n## Most men and women end up in long-term pair relationship (\"[[marriage]]\"). The couple has sex regularly, and mainly or exclusively with each other. On the other hand, most animals live solitary lives and mate only to [[Copulation (zoology)|copulate]].\n## Marriage is also a partnership for joint rearing of resulting babies. Human males and females both commonly provide parental care. This is in contrast to most mammals, where the female alone takes care of the child.\n## Human couples don't live in an exclusive territory (like [[Gibbon|gibbons]]), they live embedded in society and cooperate with other couples economically.\n## Marriage partners usually have sex in private, unlike most animals.\n## Human ovulation is concealed. Therefore, most human sex is [[Recreation|recreational]] rather than for [[reproduction]]. There are very few animals like [[Bonobo|bonobos]] and [[Dolphin|dolphins]] who show this phenomenon.\n## All women who live past the age of forty or fifty undergo [[menopause]], a complete shut down of fertility.\n# '''The Battle of Sexes:''' Male and female reproductive interests, more often than not, do not coincide. While both of them want to further their spread of genes, who wins is decided by three factors:\n##[[Parental investment|Parental Investment]]: Females, in general, invest much more than the male. This is especially true for [[Mammal|mammals]], where females apart from making costly eggs, go through a period of [[pregnancy]] and [[lactation]].\n## Alternative Opportunities foreclosed by Child Care: In case of women, it takes almost a 2 year gap between first and second child. Men, on the other hand, have no such binding. In theory, one man can impregnate all the fertile women on the planet in months. Most men commit themselves to child care primarily because the human baby is very vulnerable and it is very hard to rear one by the female alone. However, this is not true for all animals. There are exceptions like [[Orangutan|orangutans]] and [[Giraffe|giraffes]] where males make no investment and [[Phalarope|phalaropes]] and [[Spotted sandpiper|Spotted Sandpipers]], where the male does all the child care.\n## Confidence in Parenthood: Women are assured of their parenthood in the child they are rearing. Whereas, men had no sure-fire way before the advent [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]].\n# '''Why Don't Men Breastfeed Their Babies:''' The author proposes that men have almost all the [[Physiology|physiological]] need for [[lactation]], it is just that evolution till now haven't necessitated it. He also proposes that such a scene might be common in the future.\n# '''Wrong Time For Love (Recreational Sex):''' Sex is risky and costly. Why then do human beings, unlike most animals, have recreational sex just for fun? Author says there are two theories to explain it: \"Many-fathers\" theory says that [[concealed ovulation]] allows women to have sex with many men and create paternity confusion, which then decreases the chances of [[infanticide]]. \"Daddy-at-home\" theory says that women entice men to be around, provide and protect, by allowing them to have sex regularly. By combining both, we reach the conclusion that [[concealed ovulation]] arose at a time when our ancestors were [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] to avoid [[infanticide]] (\"many fathers theory\") but once [[concealed ovulation]] evolved, the women chose [[Monogamy|monogamous]] relationships with good cave-men (\"daddy-at-home theory\").\n# '''What Are Men Good For:''' By studying the societies of [[New Guinea]] and [[Ach\u00e9|Ache]], the author questioned what exactly did men contribute in child-care. One argument is protection, but most often that protection is from other men of a different or same tribe. Another argument is providing food and resources. But as studies of the above-mentioned societies have shown, men on an average bring lesser calories by trying to hunt down large animals than what women bring by simply picking up fruits and vegetables. The author classifies men into two categories: \"provider\" who actually bring food supply to the family and \"show-offs\" who try to hunt down big animals and mostly come empty handed. A woman is much better off marrying a \"provider\", but \"show-offs\" often enjoy higher social status.\n# '''Making More by Making Less (Menopause):''' [[Menopause]] makes no sense from an evolutionary perspective. Why would a woman suddenly become infertile, and then remain so for a large part of her life? The author proposes that it is a trade-off. The woman chooses to rear and care for her already born children than to risk bringing another one to life in such an age. She may also care for her grandchildren at such a point. Moreover, older people in traditional societies also provide value in the form of knowledge and wisdom.\n# '''Truth in Advertising (Secondary Sexual Characteristics):''' There are many theories that explain secondary sexual characteristics:\n##[[Fisherian runaway|Fisher's Runaway Selection Model]]: Females get attracted to a particular trait that actually supports survival, male of the species grow more and more of that trait until it becomes useless and counter-evolutionary forces act on it. Male muscles might be an example of it. Though controversial, but length of penis can also be a good example. Here, the counter-evolutionary force is the length of vagina.\n##[[Handicap principle|Zahavi's Handicap Theory:]] It proposes that these signals actually handicap the individual, when the opposite sex looks at their success despite the handicap, they are assured that they are not faking it. Peacock's tail is an example of that. In human societies, status symbols, like fancy clothes and cars might be an example. Beautiful faces are also an example of it as faces are extremely vulnerable.\n## Truth-in-Advertising Theory: It is similar to Zahavi's theory but it views signals as evolutionary advantage rather than handicap.\n\nSome signals are honest, like male muscles and female fat in breasts and hips. While same mean nothing, like pitch of voice, hair etc. The author also proposes that fat deposited in women's body are concentrated in breasts and hips because it deceives men into thinking that the women has better [[lactation]] abilities and larger [[birth canal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jareddiamond.org/Jared_Diamond/Why_Is_Sex_Fun.html|title=Why is Sex Fun?

The Evolution of Human Sexuality''''' is a 1997 book about the [[evolution]] of [[human sexuality]] by the biologist [[Jared Diamond]].\n\n==Summary==\n{{expand section|date=April 2019}}\nDiamond addresses aspects of human sexuality such as why women's [[ovulation]] is not overtly advertised ([[concealed ovulation]]); why humans have sex in private rather than in public like other mammals; and why the [[ovaries]] are U-shaped.{{sfn|Diamond|1997|pages=1\u2013146}}\n\nThe book is divided into 7 chapters:\n\n# '''The Animal With the Weirdest Sex Life:''' Author proposes that Human Beings have one of the strangest sexual lives. He gives following points:\n## Most men and women end up in long-term pair relationship (\"marriage\"). The couple has sex regularly, and mainly or exclusively with each other. On the other hand, most animals live solitary lives and mate only to copulate.\n## Marriage is also a partnership for joint rearing of resulting babies. Human males and females both commonly provide parental care. This is in contrast to most mammals, where the female alone takes care of the child.\n## Human couples don't live in an exclusive territory (like gibbons), they live embedded in society and cooperate with other couples economically.\n## Marriage partners usually have sex in private, unlike most animals.\n## Human ovulation is concealed. Therefore, most human sex is recreational rather than for reproduction. There are very few animals like bonobos and dolphins who show this phenomenon.\n## All women who live past the age of forty or fifty undergo menopause, a complete shut down of fertility.\n# '''The Battle of Sexes:''' Male and female reproductive interests, more often than not, do not collide. While both of them want to further their spread of genes, who wins is decided by three factors:\n## Parental Investment: Females, in general, invest much more than the male. This is especially true for mammals, where females apart from making costly eggs, go through a period of pregnancy and lactation.\n## Alternative Opportunities foreclosed by Child Care: In case of women, it takes almost a 2 year gap between first and second child. Men, on the other hand, have no such binding. In theory, one man can impregnate all the fertile women on the planet in months. Most men commit themselves to child care primarily because the human baby is very vulnerable and it is very hard to rear one by the female alone. However, this is not true for all animals. There are exceptions like orangutans and giraffes where males make no investment and phalaropes and Spotted Sandpipers, where the male does all the child care.\n## Confidence in Parenthood: Women are assured of their parenthood in the child they are rearing. Whereas, men had no sure-fire way before the advent DNA testing.\n# '''Why Don't Men Breastfeed Their Babies:''' The author proposes that men have almost all the physiological need for lactation, it is just that evolution till now haven't necessitated it. He also proposes that such a scene might be common in the future.\n# '''Wrong Time For Love (Recreational Sex):''' Sex is risky and costly. Why then do human beings, unlike most animals, have recreational sex just for fun? Author says there are two theories to explain it: \"Many-fathers\" theory says that concealed ovulation allows women to have sex with many men and create paternity confusion, which then decreases the chances of infanticide. \"Daddy-at-home\" theory says that women entice men to be around, provide and protect, by allowing him to have sex regularly. By combining both, we reach the conclusion that concealed ovulation arose at a time when our ancestors were promiscuous to avoid infanticide (\"many fathers theory\") but once concealed ovulation evolved, the women chose monogamous relationships with good cave-men (\"daddy-at-home theory\").\n# '''What Are Men Good For:''' By studying the societies of New Guinea and Ache, the author questioned what exactly did men contribute in child-care. One argument is protection, but most often that protection is from other men of a different or same tribe. Another argument is providing food and resources. But as studies of the mentioned societies have shown, men on an average bring lesser calories by trying to hunt down large animals than what women bring by simply picking up fruits and vegetables. The author classifies men into two categories: \"provider\" who actually bring food supply to the family and \"show-offs\" who try to hunt down big animals and mostly come empty handed. A woman is much better off marrying a \"provider\", but \"show-offs\" often enjoy higher social status.\n# '''Making More by Making Less (Menopause):''' Menopause makes no sense from an evolutionary perspective. Why would a woman suddenly become infertile, and then remains so for a large part of her life? The author proposes that it is a trade-off. The woman chooses to rear and care for her already born children than to risk bringing another one to life in such an age. She may also care for her grandchildren at such a point. Moreover, older people in traditional societies also provide value in the form of knowledge and wisdom.\n# '''Truth in Advertising (Secondary Sexual Characteristics):''' There are many theories that explain secondary sexual characteristics:\n## Fisher's Runaway Selection Model: Females get attracted to a particular trait that actually supports survival, male of the species grow more and more of that trait until it becomes useless and counter-evolutionary forces act on it. Male muscles might be an example of it. Though controversial, but length of penis can also be a good example. Here, the counter-evolutionary force being length of vagina.\n## Zahavi's Handicap Theory: It proposes that these signals actually handicap the individual, when the opposite sex looks at their success despite the handicap, they are assured that they are not faking. Peacock's tail is an example of that. In human societies, status symbols, like fancy clothes and cars might be an example.Beautiful faces are also an example of it because faces are extremely vulnerable.\n## Truth-in-Advertising Theory: It is similar to Zahavi's theory but it views signals as evolutionary advantage rather than handicap.\n\nSome signals are honest, like male muscles and female fat in breasts and hips. While same mean nothing, like pitch of voice, hair etc. The author also proposes, that fat deposited in women's body are concentrated in breasts and hips because it deceives men into thinking that the women has better lactation abilities and larger birth canal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jareddiamond.org/Jared_Diamond/Why_Is_Sex_Fun.html|title=Why is Sex Fun?

The largest of the Zaza diaspora - about half a million people - is located in Europe, mainly in Germany.\n\n== Ethnogenesis ==\n\nThe Zaza people have lived four thousand years in geographical regions of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Iran. The cuneiform tablets prove that to us in Sumerian, Hittite, Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Urartian, etc. These sources also prove, that in these areas the names Zazanaz or Zaza were used. The 1965 General Census shows Zaza as a recognized ethnic group, as recorded by the Republic of Turkey State Institute of Statistics in 1965 the \u201cSocial and Economic Attributes of the population\u201d. It is know that half of zazas are Alevi and other half are Sunni Muslims. Unfortunately, internationally little is known about the zaza community. The Zazas have been and still is very neglected and nearly forgotten. Some chauvinistic people outside the Zaza community deny the existence of Zaza ethnicity.<ref>[https://zaza-democratic-movement.com/english Zaza people and Zaza language]\n</ref>\nWhile almost all linguists agree that the Zaza language is not a Kurdish dialect but rather an independent language just like [[Gorani language|Gorani]], they also agree on the fact that Zazas and Kurds are ethnically and culturally linked. This ethnic and culturally linkage though is more of an overshadowing of Kurdish identity upon the Zaza.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> For centuries, the Zaza have been surrounded by the Kurds, a people with a homogeneous language and close culture. Therefore, outside of the region, the Zaza have always been considered to be a part of the Kurds, or a \"Kurdish tribe\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nThis suppression of Zaza autonomy has only been increased in the past century as a result of Kurdish political strivings from multiple resistance movements against the government. These political Turko-Kurdish conflicts put significant twin pressure on the Zaza identity.

The lack of documentation, and the decline in the number of native Zaza speakers can largely be attributed to the Turkish laws put in place in the mid-1920s, after the creation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. These laws banned the Kurdish language, of which Zaza was often erroneously considered a dialect, from being spoken in public, being written down, and being published. One specific law, the [[Language Ban Act of 1985]], explicitly stated that only Turkish could be spoken in public, not only greatly discouraged the use of Zaza, but it also endangered the cultural identity of the Zaza.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> The consequences of this process of [[turkification]] were so detrimental that under the Alawi-Zaza population the youngest generations hardly speak the language or teaches it to its children.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\">{{Cite web|url=http://zazaki.de/english/index.htm|title=Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza|website=zazaki.de|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> Only until very recently has Zaza been allowed back in the public sphere of Turkey. But the effects of these past policies are still very present as there has been a lack of literature and substantial development in the language.\n\nDuring the 1980s following the passage of these persecutory laws, the Zaza diaspora resulted in a small renaissance following meager efforts by Zazas in Europe.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\"/> This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by alphabetizing were not fruitless: the number of publications in Zaza increased by the multiple. The rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a revival of Zaza language and culture, it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who unfortunately, rarely spoke Zaza as a mothertongue at the time) in favor of modern western in the Zaza language, and thus their interest in the most important inheritance of their ancestors.<ref name=\"elliance\"/>\n\nThere is a division between Northern and Southern Zaza, most notably in phonological inventory, but Zaza as a whole forms a dialect continuum, with no recognized standard.

The largest of the Zaza diaspora - about half a million people - is located in Europe, mainly in Germany.\n\n== Ethnogenesis ==\n\nThe Zaza people have lived four thousand years in geographical regions of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Iran. The cuneiform tablets prove that to us in Sumerian, Hittite, Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Urartian, etc. These sources also prove, that in these areas the names Zazanaz or Zaza were used. The 1965 General Census shows Zaza as a recognized ethnic group, as recorded by the Republic of Turkey State Institute of Statistics in 1965 the \u201cSocial and Economic Attributes of the population\u201d. It is know that half of zazas are Alevi and other half are Sunni Muslims. Unfortunately, internationally little is known about the zaza community. The Zazas have been and still is very neglected and nearly forgotten. Some chauvinistic people outside the Zaza community deny the existence of Zaza ethnicity.<ref>[https://zaza-democratic-movement.com/english Zaza people and Zaza language]\n</ref>\nWhile almost all linguists agree that the Zaza language is not a Kurdish dialect but rather an independent language just like [[Gorani language|Gorani]], they also agree on the fact that Zazas and Kurds are ethnically and culturally linked. This ethnic and culturally linkage though is more of an overshadowing of Kurdish identity upon the Zaza.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> For centuries, the Zaza have been surrounded by the Kurds, a people with a homogeneous language and close culture. Therefore, outside of the region, the Zaza have always been considered to be a part of the Kurds, or a \"Kurdish tribe\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nThis suppression of Zaza autonomy has only been increased in the past century as a result of Kurdish political strivings from multiple resistance movements against the government. These political Turko-Kurdish conflicts put significant twin pressure on the Zaza identity. Intense political agitation around them encourages the Zazas to be part of the \"imagined community\" of Kurds, the biggest 'ethnic grouping' to be without nationhood, while simultaneously admitting that its participants are the very mixed product \u2014 an homogenisation or cultural mosaic of \"tribes\" over millennia.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\">{{Cite journal|last=Trompf|first=Garry W.|date=2013|title=Ethno-Religious Minorities in the Near East: Some Macrohistorical Reflections with Special Reference to the Zazas|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=17|issue=3|pages=321\u2013344|jstor=23597500|doi=10.1163/1573384X-20130306}}</ref> Also, Kurdish nationalists play on the point that a large component of so-called Zazas do not want to be called by that name at all, but prefer self-inscribing as [[Kirmanji]], a designation sounding one step away from being [[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanji]] speaking Kurds.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in the Zaza language the term Kirmanji is regarded as a synonym for [[Alevism|Alevi]], which is the main religious group of Zazas living in Dersim separate from Northern Kurds. Among the Armenians, the Zazas are also known as Zaza-Kider, i.e. Zaza-Kurds - the fact, which by no means shows the identification of the Zazas with the Kurds, but rather distinguishes them as a specific group from a common Kurdish background.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> A scientific report from 2005 concluded that Zazas share the same genetical pattern as other 'Kurdish groups'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nasidze|first=Ivan|last2=Quinque|first2=Dominique|last3=Ozturk|first3=Murat|last4=Bendukidze|first4=Nina|last5=Stoneking|first5=Mark|date=2005-03-19|title=MtDNA and Y-chromosome Variation in Kurdish Groups|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|volume=69|issue=4|pages=401\u2013412|doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2005.00174.x|pmid=15996169|issn=0003-4800}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Kurds are not the only group to claim linkage to the Zazas. It is debated that the Zaza may possess roots going back to the [[Hittites]] or derive from a migration from the linguistically-related south Caspian.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/> Similar cultural expressions, and folkloric traditions of the \"Old Women\" in connection with the dead would further suggest a possible deeper connection between the Zazas and Hittites.

Some linguists connect the word Dimil\u00ee with the Daylamites (Gilaks)  in the [[Alborz Mountains]] near the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran and believe that the Zaza have migrated from Daylam towards the west. The Armenians call this people Ddmik, the term which goes Middle Iranian delmik i.e. daylamit, the dweller of the Daylam.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> Today, [[Iranian languages]] are still spoken in southern regions of the Caspian Sea (also called the Caspian languages), including [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], [[Sangsari language|Sangsari]], [[Mazanderani language|Mazanderani]], [[Tati language (Iran)|Tati]], [[Semnani languages|Semnani]], and [[Talysh language|Talysh]], and they are grammatically and lexically very close to Zaza; this supports the argument that Zazas emigrated from the southern regions of the Caspian Sea reaching eastern Anatolia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sims-Williams|first1=ed. by Nicholas|title=Old and middle Iranian studies|date=1998|publisher=Reichert|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783895000706|pages=163\u2013177|url=http://zazaki.de/english/articels/Paul-1998-Zaza.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\nThese claims have already been disproven by genetical studies on Zazaki-speakers.

The lack of documentation, and the decline in the number of native Zaza speakers can largely be attributed to the Turkish laws put in place in the mid-1920s, after the creation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. These laws banned the Kurdish language, of which Zaza was often erroneously considered a dialect, from being spoken in public, being written down, and being published. One specific law, the [[Language Ban Act of 1985]], explicitly stated that only Turkish could be spoken in public, not only greatly discouraged the use of Zaza, but it also endangered the cultural identity of the Zaza.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> The consequences of this process of [[turkification]] were so detrimental that under the Alawi-Zaza population the youngest generations hardly speak the language or teaches it to its children.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\">{{Cite web|url=http://zazaki.de/english/index.htm|title=Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza|website=zazaki.de|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> Only until very recently has Zaza been allowed back in the public sphere of Turkey. But the effects of these past policies are still very present as there has been a lack of literature and substantial development in the language.\n\nDuring the 1980s following the passage of these persecutory laws, the Zaza diaspora resulted in a small renaissance following meager efforts by Zazas in Europe.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\"/> This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by alphabetizing were not fruitless: the number of publications in Zaza increased by the multiple. The rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a revival of Zaza language and culture, it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who unfortunately, rarely spoke Zaza as a mothertongue at the time) in favor of modern western in the Zaza language, and thus their interest in the most important inheritance of their ancestors.<ref name=\"elliance\"/>\n\nThere is a division between Northern and Southern Zaza, most notably in phonological inventory, but Zaza as a whole forms a dialect continuum, with no recognized standard. Northern Zaza is strongly associated with historical Dersim, and is spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Elazig province, easter and central Sivas, southern Erzincan, western Erzurum and Bing\u00f6l, and of course, most of Tunceli (the heart of historical Dersim) <ref>[https://elalliance.org/languages/iranic/zaza/ Zaza people and Zaza Language]</ref>\n\n== Connection to Kurds ==\n[[File:Kurdes Zaza de Diarbekir (Kurdistan).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Zaza Kurds in [[Diyarbakir]] (Kurdistan)\", E.Chantre & C.Barry, 1881]]\nKurds and Zazas have for centuries lived in the same areas in Anatolia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Zazas played a key role in the rise of Kurdish nationalism with their rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later the [[Republic of Turkey]].

The Zazas have the attractions of modern Turkey, and the socio-economic (especially educational) benefits it offers other neighboring minorities who eschew involvement in Kurdish separatism (such as the Lazi[c]s to the far north, or Arabic and Syriac-speaking enclaves in and around Mardin).<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nIn an interview with Kurdmedia, Kurdish-Zaza linguist [[Mehemed Malm\u00eesanij]] said the name of this \u201cZazaistan\u201d publisher was the \u201cZaza Culture and Publication House\u201d and was part of the Turkish intelligence services with the task of attacking the Kurdish nationalist movement. \u201cThe conclusion that I draw\u2026 is that these [Zaza nationalist groups] were groups based in the state, or with a more favorable expression, groups that thought in parallel with the state\u201d.{{r|wilgenburg}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Sedat Bucak]]\n*[[Kurdistan]]\n*[[Daylamites]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em|refs=\n<ref name=Lezgin>{{cite web |last=Lezg\u00een |first=Ro\u015fan |title=Among Social Kurdish Groups \u2013 General Glance at Zazas |website=Zazaki.net |url=http://www.zazaki.net/haber/among-social-kurdish-groups-general-glance-at-zazas-503.htm }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Malm\u00eesanij\">{{Cite book |author=Malmisanij |year=1996 |title=Kird, Kirmanc, Dimili or Zaza Kurds |location=Istanbul |publisher=Deng Publishing |url=https://archive.org/details/Kird-Kirmanc-Dimili-Zaza-Kurtleri }}</ref>\n<ref name=Kehl-Bo99>{{cite journal |last=Kehl-Bodrogi |first=Krisztina |date=October 1999 |title=Kurds, Turks, or a People in their own Right?
