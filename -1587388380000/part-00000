It has three platforms and a small [[bus station]], and lies at the junction of the former [[North Midland Railway]] main line between [[Rotherham Masborough]] and Leeds via [[Cudworth, South Yorkshire|Cudworth]] and the former [[South Yorkshire Railway]] line to [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]].\n\n== History ==\nThere have been three stations on the North Midland Railway line at Swinton, the first of which, opened in 1840, built by the N.M.R. occupied the site of the present station, goods facilities occupying what is now the car park. This was replaced by a second station north of the present site, on the opposite side of the road bridge, built by the [[Midland Railway]]. This station became known as [[Swinton Town railway station|Swinton Town]] to distinguish it from [[Swinton Central railway station|Swinton Central]] on the former [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] line. It was served by stopping trains from Sheffield Midland to York and to Leeds City via Cudworth.  The station closed in January 1968 with the rationalisation of local rail services in South Yorkshire. The original station buildings still remain at street level and are used for light industry.\n\n== Redevelopment and rebuilding ==\nBy the late 1980s it was realised that South Yorkshire railways had been cut back too far in the 1960s; in particular, Swinton/[[Wath-upon-Dearne]]/Kilnhurst lacked a station.  The [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive|South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority]] put forward a four-year plan for the improvement of services and stations as part of their Rail Development Plan, this leading to the re-instatement of the \"Swinton Curve\", from the former North Midland Railway at Swinton to the former [[South Yorkshire Railway]] at Mexborough West Junction, the building of a new station at Swinton and the re-routing of all passenger trains via this route. Immediately after reopening by [[British Rail]] in 1990 it was unstaffed, but increased passenger usage led to the establishment in the 1990s of initially a small cabin staffed for the morning peak period only. The cabin later was replaced by a brick building for the ticket office, waiting room and toilet. It is also an interchange for local bus services to Wath and Manvers.\n\nThe ticket office is now manned on Mondays to Saturday between 07:00 and 13:30.  Outside these hours, passengers can buy tickets (or a permit to travel) from a ticket vending machine near the station entrance (card payments only).  Shelters and passenger information screens are located on each platform, with a fully accessible footbridge linking the ticket hall with platforms 2 and 3.<ref>[http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/SWN/details.html Swinton (South Yorks) station facilities] ''National Rail Enquiries''; Retrieved 7 December 2016</ref>\n\n==Services==\nThe station has a similar service level to neighbouring [[Rotherham Central railway station|Rotherham Central]], namely two trains per hour to [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]] (one extending to [[Adwick railway station|Adwick]]), one per hour to [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]] via Moorthorpe and three per hour to [[Sheffield railway station|Sheffield]].

His father, Singamuthu ([[Manivannan]]), had gone to [[Kadapa]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] to work at a [[colliery]] and never returned, prompting Velu and his family to think that he is dead. Velu comes to know that a [[Malaysia]]-based [[crime boss|don]] named Koccha ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]) owed his father a huge sum of money. Velu and his friend Ops ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]) travel to Malaysia as ''Kuruvi'', the trade jargon for low-level contraband carriers. They come to Malaysia at a time when internal rivalry and problems are surfacing in Koccha's family. Koccha's younger sister Radhadevi alias Devi ([[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]]) has refused to marry Soori ([[Pawan (actor)|Pawan]]), the brother of Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), Koccha's Kadapa-based business associate. Irritated and preoccupied, neither Koccha nor his henchmen want to devote any time or attention to resolve Velu's problem. Velu is ill-treated and thrown out of Koccha's place without any help rendered. Determined to return to India only after his father's issue is solved to his satisfaction, Velu conceals himself in Koccha's palace-like residence. He soon finds out about a large diamond owned by Koccha and steals it, feeling that it would pay off his father's debt, and returns to India with Ops. Devi also follows Velu to India, having fallen in love with him, when he saves her from falling from a tall building during New Year's Eve.\n\nKnowing that Velu has stolen his diamond, Koccha and his gang visit Velu's house and threaten his family with dire consequences unless Velu returns the diamond. After confronting Koccha, Velu comes to know that his father isn't dead, but is being held as bonded labour along with many innocent people at Kadapa. Singamuthu had discovered diamonds at the colliery, but refused to allow Koccha and Konda Reddy to illegally mine the diamonds for their own benefit. He had been held prisoner in Kadapa since.\n\nVelu immediately leaves for Kadapa, where he encounters Koccha again. He throws him onto a moving train, paralysing him. He soon discovers a slave camp run by Koccha and Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) at the colliery, where a [[Male promiscuity|womanising]] rowdy named Kadapa Raja ([[G. V. Sudhakar Naidu]]) is torturing the inmates, including Singamuthu. He single-handedly takes on Konda Reddy, Kadapa Raja and their henchmen, killing them all. He drags Konda Reddy's dead body to Koccha's mansion. Koccha, who now uses a wheelchair, recovers on seeing the dead body of his associate and attempts to shoot Velu. He is arrested at that moment by a special task force led by Raj ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]). Singamuthu and the others who were imprisoned in the slave camp are finally freed and reunited with their families. Finally, Velu unites with Devi.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Velu / Vetrivel (Kuruvi)\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Devi / Radhadevi\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Ops, (Velu's Friend)\n* [[Suman (actor)|Suman]] as Kocha, (Kadappa Diamond Kuvari Illegal Business Owner, Enemy role, Devi's Brother)\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as Konda Reddy, (Kocha's Diamond quarry Illegal Business Partner, Enemy role) \n* [[Manivannan]] as Singamuthu, (Kocha's Diamond quarry Workers, Velu father's)\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as (Kocha's wife & Devi's sister-in-law)\n* [[T.

His father, Singamuthu ([[Manivannan]]), had gone to [[Kadapa]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] to work at a [[colliery]] and never returned, prompting Velu and his family to think that he is dead. Velu comes to know that a [[Malaysia]]-based [[crime boss|don]] named Koccha ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]) owed his father a huge sum of money. Velu and his friend Ops ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]) travel to Malaysia as ''Kuruvi'', the trade jargon for low-level contraband carriers. They come to Malaysia at a time when internal rivalry and problems are surfacing in Koccha's family. Koccha's younger sister Radhadevi alias Devi ([[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]]) has refused to marry Soori ([[Pawan (actor)|Pawan]]), the brother of Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), Koccha's Kadapa-based business associate. Irritated and preoccupied, neither Koccha nor his henchmen want to devote any time or attention to resolve Velu's problem. Velu is ill-treated and thrown out of Koccha's place without any help rendered. Determined to return to India only after his father's issue is solved to his satisfaction, Velu conceals himself in Koccha's palace-like residence. He soon finds out about a large diamond owned by Koccha and steals it, feeling that it would pay off his father's debt, and returns to India with Ops. Devi also follows Velu to India, having fallen in love with him, when he saves her from falling from a tall building during New Year's Eve.\n\nKnowing that Velu has stolen his diamond, Koccha and his gang visit Velu's house and threaten his family with dire consequences unless Velu returns the diamond. After confronting Koccha, Velu comes to know that his father isn't dead, but is being held as bonded labour along with many innocent people at Kadapa. Singamuthu had discovered diamonds at the colliery, but refused to allow Koccha and Konda Reddy to illegally mine the diamonds for their own benefit. He had been held prisoner in Kadapa since.\n\nVelu immediately leaves for Kadapa, where he encounters Koccha again. He throws him onto a moving train, paralysing him. He soon discovers a slave camp run by Koccha and Konda Reddy ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) at the colliery, where a [[Male promiscuity|womanising]] rowdy named Kadapa Raja ([[G. V. Sudhakar Naidu]]) is torturing the inmates, including Singamuthu. He single-handedly takes on Konda Reddy, Kadapa Raja and their henchmen, killing them all. He drags Konda Reddy's dead body to Koccha's mansion. Koccha, who now uses a wheelchair, recovers on seeing the dead body of his associate and attempts to shoot Velu. He is arrested at that moment by a special task force led by Raj ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]). Singamuthu and the others who were imprisoned in the slave camp are finally freed and reunited with their families. Finally, Velu unites with Devi.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Velu / Vetrivel (Kuruvi)\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Devi / Radhadevi\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Ops, (Velu's Friend)\n* [[Suman (actor)|Suman]] as Kocha, (Kadappa Diamond Kuvari Illegal Business Owner, Enemy role, Devi's Brother)\n* [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] as Konda Reddy, (Kocha's Diamond quarry Illegal Business Partner, Enemy role) \n* [[Manivannan]] as Singamuthu, (Kocha's Diamond quarry Workers, Velu father's)\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as (Kocha's wife & Devi's sister-in-law)\n* [[T.
