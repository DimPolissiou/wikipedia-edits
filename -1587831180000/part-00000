It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}} It was at this studio where Bowie wrote future ''Ziggy Stardust'' tracks \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features prominent piano by [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)''.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\".

You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Release and aftermath ==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Hunky Dory'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615072909/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|archive-date=15 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Hunky Dory|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823012137/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|archivedate=23 August 2007}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled on Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150839/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|isbn=0-85712-595-8|chapter=David Bowie}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5score = 10/10<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Wolk|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|title=David Bowie: ''Five Years 1969\u20131973''|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206231305/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=David Bowie: ''Hunky Dory'' (reissue)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003202846/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|archivedate=3 October 2003}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002175230/https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10{{sfn|Weisbard|Marks|1995|page=55}}\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|title=Consumer Guide (22)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|date=30 December 1971|accessdate=28 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815194640/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|archive-date=15 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}} It was at this studio where Bowie wrote future ''Ziggy Stardust'' tracks \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\".

However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Release and aftermath ==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Hunky Dory'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615072909/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|archive-date=15 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Hunky Dory|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823012137/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|archivedate=23 August 2007}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled on Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150839/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|isbn=0-85712-595-8|chapter=David Bowie}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5score = 10/10<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Wolk|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|title=David Bowie: ''Five Years 1969\u20131973''|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206231305/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=David Bowie: ''Hunky Dory'' (reissue)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003202846/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|archivedate=3 October 2003}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002175230/https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10{{sfn|Weisbard|Marks|1995|page=55}}\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|title=Consumer Guide (22)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|date=30 December 1971|accessdate=28 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815194640/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|archive-date=15 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

The film changed [[Hindi cinema's]] trend from [[romance films]] to [[action films]], and pioneered [[Bachchan's]] new image of a brooding but explosive person who fights back when cornered, known as \"The Angry Young Man.\"\n\nThe film started a new wave in [[Bollywood]]. At a time when [[India]] was suffering from corruption and low economic growth, and the common man was left with frustration and anger over the system, ''Zanjeer'' began shifting Hindi cinema in a violent and aggressive direction. Reflecting the anger of the masses, [[Amitabh Bachchan]] was seen as the new hero, who had the courage to fight against the wrongs while maintaining moral values at the same time. This film also ended the struggling period for [[Bachchan]], and turned him into a rising star. The film was a [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|blockbuster success]], [[domestically in India]] and [[List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets|overseas in]] the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIt was the first of many collaborations between screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Ever since ''Zanjeer'', [[Salim-Javed]] wrote many of their subsequent scripts with [[Bachchan]] in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), establishing [[Bachchan]] as a superstar.<ref name=\"hindustantimes\" /> In addition to being a turning point for [[Bachchan's]] career and Hindi cinema, ''Zanjeer'' was also a turning point for [[South Indian cinema]], with [[Bachchan's]] acting inspiring future [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Superstar Rajinikanth]].<ref name=\"indianexpress\" /> ''Zanjeer'' remains an important film in the history of [[Indian cinema]] and is regarded as a classic today.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on [[Diwali]] with the murderous intent\n of young Vijay Khanna's parents, committed by a man of unknown identity with a white horse on his charm bracelet, \"zanjeer\". Because of this traumatic event, Vijay has recurring [[nightmare]]s of a white [[stallion]]. Even as a child Vijay stays socially awkward and stays away from the other kids, showing the audience that he believes himself to be alone. Fast forward 20 years, and Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) is now an inspector, an honest police officer in a town where few are just. He receives complaints about a local man, Sher Khan (Pathan) ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), who is running gambling dens. When he calls Khan in for questioning, Khan's superiority complex chafes against Khanna's police authority, as he scolds the officer, telling him he only orders him around due to the uniform he wears. Vijay takes him up on his challenge, and meets him in street clothes to fight him. At fight's end, Sher Khan not only closes his gambling dens, but has gained respect for Vijay. He becomes an [[auto mechanic]], and reforms his ways.\n\nVarious dealings of the underworld continue unabated throughout the town, all tracing back to [[gang]] leader Teja ([[Ajit Khan]]). A mysterious caller continually phones Inspector Khanna to inform him exactly when a crime is about to take place, but hangs up before Khanna can extract any more information out of him. When a traffic accident perpetrated by gang members leaves several children dead, a witness, a street performer named Mala ([[Jaya Bhaduri]]), is bribed by Teja's men to keep quiet. When she is questioned by Vijay, he becomes enraged at her denying she knows anything, and, to sway her differently, takes her into the [[morgue]] to view the mangled bodies of the children. She has a change of heart, and comes clean, asking that the bribe be donated to an [[orphanage]]. She identifies the man behind the traffic accident.\n\nOnce it is known that Mala has broken her word, Teja's men come after her. She is chased through the night, narrowly escaping across the train tracks, and coming to Inspector Khanna's house, desperate for shelter. He lets her in, allows her to stay, and the two discover that they are both [[orphans]], and discuss the fears associated with living alone. Khanna kindly takes her to his brother and sister-in-law, and, under the sister-in-law's tutelage, Mala begins to learn how to keep house, as well as English, and other refinements.\n\nEventually, Vijay is framed for bribery, stripped of his title and position as inspector, and jailed for 6 months on false charges, trapped by Teja. When he is released from jail, he plans to take revenge. Mala, by this time, has developed from a frightened stranger seeking his help to a romantic interest for him. She begs him, to seal their relationship, that he must stop being so vengeful. He agrees, but soon must come to terms with such a promise when he meets, in a Christian cemetery, the informant who had called him in the past when he was an inspector. The man, De Silva ([[Om Prakash]]), appears half-insane, holding onto an empty bottle. He says that on Christmas several years before, his three sons drank poisoned [[moonshine]], and died from it. Until the killer is found, he will continue to wander with the bottle. When local criminals mocked him and called him crazy, he vowed to get back at them as he could: by phoning the inspector when a crime was about to happen.\n\nAfter hearing this news, Vijay becomes depressed, torn between his desire to help the grieving De Silva, and his need to keep his promise to Mala that he would not take any more revenge on the lowlifes of the town. Eventually, along with a concerted effort by Sher Khan to cheer up Vijay, Mala relents, vowing she will not try to control him, and says he must do what is right.\n\nThe trail of tainted [[moonshine]] leads back to Teja and his men. Upon finally cornering the crook on [[Diwali]], [[fireworks]] bursting overhead, Vijay also finds out that the person who murdered his parents, 20 years before, on the same night, is Teja, recognisable by the zanjeer on his wrist. Sher Khan helps him to fight Teja and his men, and take justice into their own hands, until the police arrive. When the hapless police inspector is held at gunpoint by Teja, Vijay manages to drop to retrieve a pistol from the ground, and shoots him dead, his body falling into the swimming pool.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Actor/Actress !!Character/Role !!Notes\n|-\n|[[Amitabh Bachchan]]\n|Insp.

After Khan completed the script, Khan shared the credit with [[Javed Akhtar]], as the screenwriting duo [[Salim-Javed]].<ref name=\"timesofindia\">{{cite news|title=Why Salim Khan was angry with Amitabh Bachchan|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Why-Salim-Khan-was-angry-with-Amitabh-Bachchan/articleshow/27245793.cms|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=13 December 2013}}</ref> \n\n''Zanjeer'' was written as a [[crime film]] with violent [[Action film|action]], and the main character Vijay was conceived as a hard-hitting, \u2018angry with the system\u2019 young man.<ref name=\"indianexpress\"/> At a time when [[Hindi cinema]] was dominated by [[romance film]]s with \"romantic hero\" leads, [[Prakash Mehra]] saw the script as potentially groundbreaking and came on board as the film's director. However, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead \"angry young man\" role, which was turned down by a number of actors due to it going against their \"romantic hero\" image; at the time, the industry was dominated by the \"King of Romance\" [[Rajesh Khanna]] and similar \"romantic hero\" actors.<ref name=\"indianexpress\">{{cite news|title=Revisiting Prakash Mehra\u2019s Zanjeer: The film that made Amitabh Bachchan|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/revisiting-prakash-mehra-zanjeer-the-film-that-made-amitabh-bachchan-4714064/|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref> The role of the lead was first offered to many leading men of the time, including [[Raaj Kumar]], Rajesh Khanna, [[Dharmendra]], and [[Dev Anand]], all of whom turned down the offer.

At the time, Bachchan was a \"failed newcomer\" who, by the age of 30, had twelve flops and only two hits (as a lead in ''[[Bombay to Goa]]'' and supporting role in ''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'').<ref name=\"indianexpress\"/> According to Javed Akhtar, they \"saw his talent, which most makers didn\u2019t.

According to Salim Khan, they \"strongly felt that Amitabh was the ideal casting for ''Zanjeer''\". Bachchan stated, \u201cSalim-Javed saw a fight sequence in ''Bombay to Goa'' where I was chewing gum throughout the fight, as an indicator that I would be the right choice for ''Zanjeer''.\u201d<ref name=\"indianexpress\"/> Salim Khan was responsible for introducing Bachchan to Mehra.<ref name=\"timesofindia\"/>\n\nFor the female lead, [[Mumtaz (actress)|Mumtaz]] was initially offered the role. However, she was engaged at the time, and opted out, choosing marriage over career. Jaya Bhaduri, who was engaged to Bachchan at the time, immediately agreed to take the role, for the sake of her future husband.<ref name=\"indianexpress\"/>\n\nFor the film's promotion, the posters of ''Zanjeer'' initially did not have the names of Salim-Javed on them. Salim-Javed hired a man with a jeep to drive around and paint \"Salim-Javed\" in [[stencil]] font on all the ''Zanjeer'' posters from [[Juhu]] to [[Royal Opera House (Mumbai)|Opera House]]. However, the man was sometimes drunk, which led to him painting \"Salim-Javed\" on the wrong places, such as Pran's face or Bachchan's hands, for some posters.<ref name=\"open\">{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=Salim|authorlink1=Salim Khan|last2=Sukumaran|first2=Shradha|title=Sholay, the Beginning|journal=[[Open (Indian magazine)|OPEN Magazine]]|date=14 August 2010|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/arts-letters/sholay-the-beginning|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Crew==\n*'''Director''': [[Prakash Mehra]]\n*'''Writer''': [[Salim-Javed]] ([[Salim Khan]], [[Javed Akhtar]])\n*'''Producer''': [[Prakash Mehra]], Babboo Mehra\n*'''Production Company''': Prakash Mehra Productions\n*'''Editor''': Ramchandra Mahadik (as R.D.

Reflecting the anger of the masses, [[Amitabh Bachchan]] was seen as the new hero, who had the courage to fight against the wrongs while maintaining moral values at the same time. This film also ended the struggling period for [[Bachchan]], and turned him into a rising star. The film was a [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|blockbuster success]], [[domestically in India]] and [[List of highest-grossing Indian films in overseas markets|overseas in]] the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIt was the first of many collaborations between screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Ever since ''Zanjeer'', [[Salim-Javed]] wrote many of their subsequent scripts with [[Bachchan]] in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), establishing [[Bachchan]] as a superstar.<ref name=\"hindustantimes\" /> In addition to being a turning point for [[Bachchan's]] career and Hindi cinema, ''Zanjeer'' was also a turning point for [[South Indian cinema]], with [[Bachchan's]] acting inspiring future [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Superstar Rajinikanth]].<ref name=\"indianexpress\" /> ''Zanjeer'' remains an important film in the history of [[Indian cinema]] and is regarded as a classic today.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on [[Diwali]] with the murder of young Vijay Khanna's parents, committed by a man of unknown identity with a white horse on his charm bracelet, \"zanjeer\". Because of this traumatic event, Vijay has recurring [[nightmare]]s of a white [[stallion]]. Even as a child Vijay stays socially awkward and stays away from the other kids, showing the audience that he believes himself to be alone. Fast forward 20 years, and Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) is now an inspector, an honest police officer in a town where few are just. He receives complaints about a local man, Sher Khan (Pathan) ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), who is running gambling dens. When he calls Khan in for questioning, Khan's superiority complex chafes against Khanna's police authority, as he scolds the officer, telling him he only orders him around due to the uniform he wears. Vijay takes him up on his challenge, and meets him in street clothes to fight him. At fight's end, Sher Khan not only closes his gambling dens, but has gained respect for Vijay. He becomes an [[auto mechanic]], and reforms his ways.\n\nVarious dealings of the underworld continue unabated throughout the town, all tracing back to [[gang]] leader Teja ([[Ajit Khan]]). A mysterious caller continually phones Inspector Khanna to inform him exactly when a crime is about to take place, but hangs up before Khanna can extract any more information out of him. When a traffic accident perpetrated by gang members leaves several children dead, a witness, a street performer named Mala ([[Jaya Bhaduri]]), is bribed by Teja's men to keep quiet. When she is questioned by Vijay, he becomes enraged at her denying she knows anything, and, to sway her differently, takes her into the [[morgue]] to view the mangled bodies of the children. She has a change of heart, and comes clean, asking that the bribe be donated to an [[orphanage]]. She identifies the man behind the traffic accident.\n\nOnce it is known that Mala has broken her word, Teja's men come after her. She is chased through the night, narrowly escaping across the train tracks, and coming to Inspector Khanna's house, desperate for shelter. He lets her in, allows her to stay, and the two discover that they are both [[orphans]], and discuss the fears associated with living alone. Khanna kindly takes her to his brother and sister-in-law, and, under the sister-in-law's tutelage, Mala begins to learn how to keep house, as well as English, and other refinements.\n\nEventually, Vijay is framed for bribery, stripped of his title and position as inspector, and jailed for 6 months on false charges, trapped by Teja. When he is released from jail, he plans to take revenge. Mala, by this time, has developed from a frightened stranger seeking his help to a romantic interest for him. She begs him, to seal their relationship, that he must stop being so vengeful. He agrees, but soon must come to terms with such a promise when he meets, in a Christian cemetery, the informant who had called him in the past when he was an inspector. The man, De Silva ([[Om Prakash]]), appears half-insane, holding onto an empty bottle. He says that on Christmas several years before, his three sons drank poisoned [[moonshine]], and died from it. Until the killer is found, he will continue to wander with the bottle. When local criminals mocked him and called him crazy, he vowed to get back at them as he could: by phoning the inspector when a crime was about to happen.\n\nAfter hearing this news, Vijay becomes depressed, torn between his desire to help the grieving De Silva, and his need to keep his promise to Mala that he would not take any more revenge on the lowlifes of the town. Eventually, along with a concerted effort by Sher Khan to cheer up Vijay, Mala relents, vowing she will not try to control him, and says he must do what is right.\n\nThe trail of tainted [[moonshine]] leads back to Teja and his men. Upon finally cornering the crook on [[Diwali]], [[fireworks]] bursting overhead, Vijay also finds out that the person who murdered his parents, 20 years before, on the same night, is Teja, recognisable by the zanjeer on his wrist. Sher Khan helps him to fight Teja and his men, and take justice into their own hands, until the police arrive. When the hapless police inspector is held at gunpoint by Teja, Vijay manages to drop to retrieve a pistol from the ground, and shoots him dead, his body falling into the swimming pool.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Actor/Actress !!Character/Role !!Notes\n|-\n|[[Amitabh Bachchan]]\n|Insp.

At the time, Bachchan was a \"failed newcomer\" who, by the age of 30, had twelve flops and only two hits (as a lead in ''[[Bombay to Goa]]'' and supporting role in ''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'').<ref name=\"indianexpress\"/> According to Javed Akhtar, they \"saw his talent, which most makers didn\u2019t.

According to Salim Khan, they \"strongly felt that Amitabh was the ideal casting for ''Zanjeer''\". Bachchan stated, \u201cSalim-Javed saw a fight sequence in ''Bombay to Goa'' where I was chewing gum throughout the fight, as an indicator that I would be the right choice for ''Zanjeer''.\u201d<ref name=\"indianexpress\"/> Salim Khan was responsible for introducing Bachchan to Mehra.<ref name=\"timesofindia\"/>\n\nFor the female lead, [[Mumtaz (actress)|Mumtaz]] was initially offered the role. However, she was engaged at the time, and opted out, choosing marriage over career. Jaya Bhaduri, who was engaged to Bachchan at the time, immediately agreed to take the role, for the sake of her future husband.<ref name=\"indianexpress\"/>\n\nFor the film's promotion, the posters of ''Zanjeer'' initially did not have the names of Salim-Javed on them. Salim-Javed hired a man with a jeep to drive around and paint \"Salim-Javed\" in [[stencil]] font on all the ''Zanjeer'' posters from [[Juhu]] to [[Royal Opera House (Mumbai)|Opera House]].

Under Sheikh Sharif's leadership, the [[Transitional Federal Government]] attempted driving out Al-Shabaab from the capital city and its surroundings, establishing security, peace and reconciliation through the difficult transitional period. \n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn on 25 July 1964 in [[Mahaday]] a town in the southern the Middle Shabelle region where he acquired the knowledge of the Islamic teachings, Arabic and the memorisation of the Qur'an as a child. Sheikh Sharif is from the [[Abgaal]] clan ( [[Abgaal|Cabdale Agoonyar]]) sub-clan of the [[Hawiye]] clan one of Somalia's four main clans, which dominates in the capital. He began his education at the Sheikh Sufi Institute, which was associated with [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Egypt]]. He studied at Libyan and Sudanese universities in the mid-1990s, where he earned a bachelor's degree in [[Law]] and Islamic [[Shariah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7865808.stm|title=Profile: Somalia's President Ahmed|publisher=BBC News|date=3 February 2009}}</ref> Thus, his religious upbringing and education allowed him to succeed his father as the spiritual leader of the Idriseeyah sect of [[Sunni]] Islam in Somalia.\n\nSheikh Sharif completed his fellowship in [[Boston University]] in January 2012.\n\n==Political career==\nSheikh Sharif departed for Somalia in 2000 at a time when Somalia was under the control of warlords and friends could not visit each other in Mogadishu due to clan separation and mistrust. The legacy of the civil war was apparent everywhere in Somalia and Sheikh Sharif had ambitions of saving his country and his people, a dream which no one could imagine could come true at the time. He established Al Shuruuq Agency, a cultural and heritage institution and the Federation of Adolescents in Mogadishu which facilitated social interaction for young Somalis who had never before crossed the boundaries formed by the warlords. As a result, the residents of Mogadishu began to cross the lines where friends, schoolmates, and elders can come together and express themselves in a positive way. Sheikh Sharif became a regional attorney of his home province, middle Shabelle, where he was elected chairman of a provincial court in Jowhar between 2001 and 2002.\n\n===Islamic Courts Union===\n{{Main|Islamic Courts Union}}\n\nArmed groups in the Somali capital who exploited the disintegration of the central government had been responsible for countless kidnappings and killings. The court was established through a campaign which Sheikh Ahmed led to secure the release of an abducted child.
