A special ''Pok\u00e9mon Emerald'' pack contained a limited edition Green Rayquaza SP and the Emerald game. A limited edition backlit edition exists. There is also an [[All Blacks]] edition. An Orange and red version was made as a prize for a speed run competition for Metroid Zero Mission. A red SP with a circle with an M in it was created, modeled after [[Mario|Mario's cap]]; it also came in a bundle that included the game Mario Vs. Donkey Kong.\n\nThe GBA SP is slightly more than half the size of the GBA when closed and roughly the height of Nintendo's [[Game Boy Color]] when open. This model of the Game Boy can play all Game Boy cartridges including Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance carts. The clamshell (or laptop design) protects the screen from scratches and dust, reminiscent of two-screen [[Game & Watch]] units. However, the casing is made from a different material, making it more prone to scratches than previous Game Boy systems. The slot for cartridges has been moved to the bottom of the system, facing down. This makes using special cartridges, such as the [[Game Boy Camera]] and Kirby: Tilt and Tumble, more difficult. The GBA was Nintendo's first handheld system to have a built-in backlight released outside of Japan; however, there was a Japanese exclusive, the GameBoy light that also featured a backlight.\n\nThe GBA SP AC adapter comes with the package to recharge its lithium ion battery, something previous Game Boys did not have (they usually used commercially available batteries). This adapter is also compatible with the original version of the DS. The software library and general hardware specifications are identical to those of the Game Boy Advance.\n\nIn Japan it was released in a variety of standard colors and special packages. In most other regions it was released in Platinum Silver and Charcoal Black. Later, a Flame Red version was released. Six special editions have also been released: a NES Classics model with the same color scheme as a classic NES controller (and designed to resemble a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] deck when closed), a [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] model, a [[Pikachu]] model, and a silver model with a tattoo design printed on it, known as the 'Tribal Edition'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=9501|title=Tribal Edition GBA SP for Europe  - News|author=|date=|website=Nintendo World Report}}</ref> In other regions, such as Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, additional colors have been released, such as Pearl Green and Starlight Gold.<ref>[http://gameforfun.com/es/product.asp?product_id=3663 Gameboy Advance SP Star Light Gold Toys R Us Limited Edition (GFF-3663)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711070758/http://gameforfun.com/es/product.asp?product_id=3663 |date=July 11, 2011 }}</ref>  Additionally, two new special versions have been released in Asia exclusive to that region.\n\nNintendo was planning to have the SP be 3D-compatible, but the resolution of LCD was too low, resulting in Nintendo scrapping it.<ref>[http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/how-nintendo-3ds-made/0/2 Iwata Asks] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.fo/20120711043522/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/%23/3ds/how-nintendo-3ds-made/0/2 |date=July 11, 2012 }}.

Since the [[Nintendo DS]] used the same charging port as the GBA SP, the headphone adapter works with said console.\n\nAs both AC adapter and headphones use the same port, it is not possible to charge the SP and listen to headphones at the same time with the Nintendo brand adapter. There are, however, third-party adapters that \"split\" into two different cords; the power jack on one side, and a TS headphone jack on the other.\n\n==Backlit Model (AGS-101)==\n[[File:Gameboy-Advance-SP-Mk2.jpg|right|thumb|The pearl blue AGS-101 GBA SP model that featured an improved backlit screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/consoles/nintendo-game-boy-advance/4505-10109_7-31590939.html|title=Nintendo Game Boy Advance SP Review - Consoles|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=July 27, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106001937/http://reviews.cnet.com/consoles/nintendo-game-boy-advance/4505-10109_7-31590939.html|archivedate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>]]\nIn September 2005, around the time of the [[Game Boy Micro]]'s release, Nintendo released an improved version of the Game Boy Advance SP in [[North America]], featuring a brighter backlit screen instead of the previous version's frontlit screen.\nThe new model can be distinguished by the following features:\n\n* The box states \"Now with a BRIGHTER backlit screen!\" to distinguish the new model from the older, frontlit models.\n* The backlit SP has the Model Number AGS-101 on the label on the bottom of the unit, whereas the original frontlit SP has the Model Number AGS-001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maru-chang.com/hard/agb/english.htm|title=AGB/AGS/OXY: Game Boy Advance|last=MARU-CHANG|website=maru-chang.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228053943/http://maru-chang.com/hard/agb/english.htm|archivedate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>\n* The mini button at the top center of the console's lower face is now referred to in the manual as the \"Brightness Switch\" and selects between two levels of brightness, \"Normal\" (Low) and \"Bright\" (High) with no off setting. On the frontlit models this button turned the frontlight on or off only. With the backlight set to \"Normal\" (Low) the brightness still surpasses the original AGS-001 with the frontlight on.\n* When powered off, the backlit model's screen is completely black, but the frontlit model's screen is noticeably lighter.\n\nThe North American backlit version comes in three standard colors: \"Pearl Blue\", \"Pearl Pink\" and \"Graphite\" (a greyer version of Onyx Black). There were also two [[Toys \"R\" Us]] exclusive backlit models; a \"[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]\" model<ref>[http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/652/652641p1.html GBA SP Gets Brighter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614220645/http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/652/652641p1.html |date=June 14, 2010 }}</ref> and a \"Limited Edition [[Pikachu]]\" model.\n\nIn 2006, the AGS-101 backlit model also saw a very limited release in [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news230905brightersp|title=Brighter SP coming to Europe|website=eurogamer.net|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612135413/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news230905brightersp|archivedate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> Few models made it to market, likely due to the release of the [[Game Boy Advance]]-compatible [[Nintendo DS]] one year prior.

In addition, only the \"Surf Blue\" color was unique to the AGS-101, the other two colors \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" had already been released as frontlit models - for these reasons it can be very difficult to identify a European backlit SP. Apart from the AGS-101 model number on the base of the unit, the only other obvious distinguishing feature of the European backlit model is the large picture of the Game Boy Advance SP featured on the front of the box. (The European frontlit models of \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" only feature small pictures of the Game Boy Advance SP on the sides of the box and Flower/Tattoo patterns on the front respectively.)\n\nIt is also the final Nintendo handheld to have backwards compatibility with [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] games.\n\n==Unit colors==\n{{See also|List of Game Boy colors and styles#Game Boy Advance SP}}\nThe Game Boy Advance SP had numerous colors and limited editions.\n\n{{div col | colwidth=20em}}\n* [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] (New Zealand only)\n* Blue Kyogre\n* Cobalt Blue\n* Flame Red\n* Famicom 20th Anniversary Edition\n* Gold with Zelda [[Triforce]]\n* Graphite\n* Green Rayquaza\n* Green Venusaur\n* Kingdom Silver (''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' Edition)\n* Mario\n* NES Black (UK and US only as a limited edition)\n* Onyx Black\n* Pearl Blue\n* Pearl Green\n* Pearl Pink\n* Pearl White (Limited Edition)\n* Pikachu Yellow\n* Platinum\n* Platinum & Onyx (Limited Edition)\n* Red Groudon\n* Snow White\n* Spice & Lime\n* SpongeBob\n* Surf Blue (UK only)\n* Torchic Orange\n* Tribal\n* White Rip Curl special edition (Australia only)\n* \"Who Are You?\" (Black with \"Who Are You?\" printed on the top)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nM.

A special ''Pok\u00e9mon Emerald'' pack contained a limited edition Green Rayquaza SP and the Emerald game. A limited edition backlit edition exists. There is also an [[All Blacks]] edition. An Orange and red version was made as a prize for a speed run competition for Metroid Zero Mission. A red SP with a circle with an M in it was created, modeled after [[Mario|Mario's cap]]; it also came in a bundle that included the game Mario Vs. Donkey Kong.{{Main|List of Game Boy colors and styles#Game Boy Advance SP}}\n\nThe GBA SP is slightly more than half the size of the GBA when closed and roughly the height of Nintendo's [[Game Boy Color]] when open. This model of the Game Boy can play all Game Boy cartridges including Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance carts. The clamshell (or laptop design) protects the screen from scratches and dust, reminiscent of two-screen [[Game & Watch]] units. However, the casing is made from a different material, making it more prone to scratches than previous Game Boy systems. The slot for cartridges has been moved to the bottom of the system, facing down. This makes using special cartridges, such as the [[Game Boy Camera]] and Kirby: Tilt and Tumble, more difficult. The GBA was Nintendo's first handheld system to have a built-in backlight released outside of Japan; however, there was a Japanese exclusive, the GameBoy light that also featured a backlight.\n\nThe GBA SP AC adapter comes with the package to recharge its lithium ion battery, something previous Game Boys did not have (they usually used commercially available batteries). This adapter is also compatible with the original version of the DS. The software library and general hardware specifications are identical to those of the Game Boy Advance.\n\nIn Japan it was released in a variety of standard colors and special packages. In most other regions it was released in Platinum Silver and Charcoal Black. Later, a Flame Red version was released. Six special editions have also been released: a NES Classics model with the same color scheme as a classic NES controller (and designed to resemble a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] deck when closed), a [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] model, a [[Pikachu]] model, and a silver model with a tattoo design printed on it, known as the 'Tribal Edition'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=9501|title=Tribal Edition GBA SP for Europe  - News|author=|date=|website=Nintendo World Report}}</ref> In other regions, such as Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, additional colors have been released, such as Pearl Green and Starlight Gold.<ref>[http://gameforfun.com/es/product.asp?product_id=3663 Gameboy Advance SP Star Light Gold Toys R Us Limited Edition (GFF-3663)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711070758/http://gameforfun.com/es/product.asp?product_id=3663 |date=July 11, 2011 }}</ref>  Additionally, two new special versions have been released in Asia exclusive to that region.\n\nNintendo was planning to have the SP be 3D-compatible, but the resolution of LCD was too low, resulting in Nintendo scrapping it.<ref>[http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/how-nintendo-3ds-made/0/2 Iwata Asks] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.fo/20120711043522/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/%23/3ds/how-nintendo-3ds-made/0/2 |date=July 11, 2012 }}.

There are, however, third-party adapters that \"split\" into two different cords; the power jack on one side, and a TS headphone jack on the other.\n\n==Backlit Model (AGS-101)==\n[[File:Gameboy-Advance-SP-Mk2.jpg|right|thumb|The pearl blue AGS-101 GBA SP model that featured an improved backlit screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/consoles/nintendo-game-boy-advance/4505-10109_7-31590939.html|title=Nintendo Game Boy Advance SP Review - Consoles|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=July 27, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106001937/http://reviews.cnet.com/consoles/nintendo-game-boy-advance/4505-10109_7-31590939.html|archivedate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>]]\nIn September 2005, around the time of the [[Game Boy Micro]]'s release, Nintendo released an improved version of the Game Boy Advance SP in [[North America]], featuring a brighter backlit screen instead of the previous version's frontlit screen.\nThe new model can be distinguished by the following features:\n\n* The box states \"Now with a BRIGHTER backlit screen!\" to distinguish the new model from the older, frontlit models.\n* The backlit SP has the Model Number AGS-101 on the label on the bottom of the unit, whereas the original frontlit SP has the Model Number AGS-001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maru-chang.com/hard/agb/english.htm|title=AGB/AGS/OXY: Game Boy Advance|last=MARU-CHANG|website=maru-chang.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228053943/http://maru-chang.com/hard/agb/english.htm|archivedate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>\n* The mini button at the top center of the console's lower face is now referred to in the manual as the \"Brightness Switch\" and selects between two levels of brightness, \"Normal\" (Low) and \"Bright\" (High) with no off setting. On the frontlit models this button turned the frontlight on or off only. With the backlight set to \"Normal\" (Low) the brightness still surpasses the original AGS-001 with the frontlight on.\n* When powered off, the backlit model's screen is completely black, but the frontlit model's screen is noticeably lighter.\n\nThe North American backlit version comes in three standard colors: \"Pearl Blue\", \"Pearl Pink\" and \"Graphite\" (a greyer version of Onyx Black). There were also two [[Toys \"R\" Us]] exclusive backlit models; a \"[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]\" model<ref>[http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/652/652641p1.html GBA SP Gets Brighter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614220645/http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/652/652641p1.html |date=June 14, 2010 }}</ref> and a \"Limited Edition [[Pikachu]]\" model.\n\nIn 2006, the AGS-101 backlit model also saw a very limited release in [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news230905brightersp|title=Brighter SP coming to Europe|website=eurogamer.net|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612135413/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news230905brightersp|archivedate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> Few models made it to market, likely due to the release of the [[Game Boy Advance]]-compatible [[Nintendo DS]] one year prior. The [[Europe]]an version was released in \"Surf Blue\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC1ldBUO-bw|title=Gameboy Advance SP - European AGS-101 Model (Backlit) Unboxing|last=F1RES0UL|date=August 22, 2009|via=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418073359/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC1ldBUO-bw|archivedate=April 18, 2016}}</ref> as well as re-issued in \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" editions.\n\nUnlike the North American release, the European box does not feature any prominent text to distinguish the backlit models from the older frontlit models. In addition, only the \"Surf Blue\" color was unique to the AGS-101, the other two colors \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" had already been released as frontlit models - for these reasons it can be very difficult to identify a European backlit SP. Apart from the AGS-101 model number on the base of the unit, the only other obvious distinguishing feature of the European backlit model is the large picture of the Game Boy Advance SP featured on the front of the box. (The European frontlit models of \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" only feature small pictures of the Game Boy Advance SP on the sides of the box and Flower/Tattoo patterns on the front respectively.)\n\nIt is also the final Nintendo handheld to have backwards compatibility with [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] games.\n\n==Unit colors==\n{{See also|List of Game Boy colors and styles#Game Boy Advance SP}}\nThe Game Boy Advance SP had numerous colors and limited editions.\n\n{{div col | colwidth=20em}}\n* [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] (New Zealand only)\n* Blue Kyogre\n* Cobalt Blue\n* Flame Red\n* Famicom 20th Anniversary Edition\n* Gold with Zelda [[Triforce]]\n* Graphite\n* Green Rayquaza\n* Green Venusaur\n* Kingdom Silver (''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' Edition)\n* Mario\n* NES Black (UK and US only as a limited edition)\n* Onyx Black\n* Pearl Blue\n* Pearl Green\n* Pearl Pink\n* Pearl White (Limited Edition)\n* Pikachu Yellow\n* Platinum\n* Platinum & Onyx (Limited Edition)\n* Red Groudon\n* Snow White\n* Spice & Lime\n* SpongeBob\n* Surf Blue (UK only)\n* Torchic Orange\n* Tribal\n* White Rip Curl special edition (Australia only)\n* \"Who Are You?\" (Black with \"Who Are You?\" printed on the top)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nM.

Nora and Aidan are at a disused farmhouse, caring for Josh, who is a wolf all the time except during the full moon. When Josh returns to his human self and Nora is out as the wolf, he contemplates suicide due to the strain he is placing on his wife and best friend. With Josh's blessing, Aidan meets Kat at a faculty party. When Aidan goes to get drinks, a woman resembling Aidan's long dead wife Suzanna approaches Kat, but disappears before Aidan returns. The next day at the hospital, Aidan's suspicions are raised when Blake, who now works at the same funeral home that Bishop ran previously, tries to take a corpse. Elsewhere, Sally is with Donna in what appears to be a spa, but she soon wants to escape, though Donna warns that they are both a threat to reality. Sally escapes through Donna's death spot, experiencing Donna's death by hanging as a witch during the 17th century, and goes to meet her friends at the farm. Josh is not in his holding cell and, as the werewolf, he confronts the trio in an attempt to commit suicide at Aidan's hand. Sally conjures up a ring of fire to trap him, allowing Nora to tranquilize him. However, Sally disappears into what she thinks is another dimension, and sees a little girl being stabbed by a group of witches. Blake reports to the new head of Boston, who is revealed to be Kenny, looking completely normal.

Though they could be together again, Aidan feels he should remain with Kat, and Suzanna reluctantly agrees. She doesn't reveal the true reason she avoided him for two hundred years, that in her first feast as a vampire she killed their only son, and has been wracked with guilt ever since. Sally believes that she can use magic to change Josh back to normal. She goes to where the soup kitchen once stood, and enters the alternate dimension where she and Donna last fought, discovering a book of spells. That night, on the new moon, Sally conjures up a magical knife that must be stabbed into Josh's heart. Nora volunteers to perform the act, but cannot due to Josh's viciousness. Aidan reluctantly stabs the wolf, and it collapses. Both Aidan and Nora believe Josh is dead due to a botched spell. Sally disappears, and finds herself in the house again, watching the guys move in while she watches them from afar. She realizes that she has traveled into the past each time she has performed a spell. Back at the farm, Aidan is grieving Josh's death when a human hand thrusts out from the wolf's mouth. Aidan tears open the carcass to find the human Josh alive and well. When Sally returns from the past, she worries that the uncompleted spell will cause problems. Later that night, Josh cannot fall asleep, and when he looks in a mirror he sees wolf eyes staring back at him.\n |LineColor = 056444\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 4)\n |EpisodeNumber = 42\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Lil' Smokie\n |DirectedBy = [[Paolo Barzman]]\n |WrittenBy = Nancy Won\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|1|27}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-61\n |Viewers = 1.12<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/28/monday-cable-ratings-monday-night-raw-tops-night-love-hip-hop-fast-n-loud-single-ladies-more/232423/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Monday Night RAW' Tops Night + 'Love & Hip Hop', 'Fast N Loud', 'Single Ladies' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=January 28, 2014|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Sally, enthralled with the spell book, notices that the spells change from day to day, much to her frustration. While the boys are at the hospital, and Nora is out buying wallpaper, Sally finds a spell in the book that will bring back her door. She reads the incantation, but it summons Donna, come to take Sally back to purgatory. Sally burns the spell book and sends Donna back, but the spell book becomes a part of her, giving her knowledge of all its contents. At the hospital, Josh has trouble keeping his wolf at bay and is overwhelmed by his senses. He accidentally lashes out at his attending physician, and runs out. As Aidan prepares to start his shift, he is kidnapped by a group of vampires, and brought to Kenny. Kenny shows Aidan a luxurious new blood lounge, with donated blood and new women, but Aidan doesn't want to be involved. Later that night, two vampires attack Josh while he is out running. He partially transforms into a werewolf and kills them, to his shock. Aidan confronts Kenny, who reveals he childishly thought that if Josh were dead, he and Aidan could run Boston together. Apologizing, he reveals that he is still deformed but has the ability to compel not only humans but also other vampires to see him as normal. Their talk is interrupted by an emergency at the blood lounge. There are piles of ash everywhere; someone has killed all the vampires. The security footage reveals Suzanna as the attacker. Sally offers to heal Nora's burn scars using her new magic knowledge, but disappears after the spell is completed. She finds herself in the house during the 1970s, and spots the same little girl who was stabbed before. Hours later, when Sally returns to the present time, Nora's burns are healed, but as she's showing off the newly decorated room, the wallpaper peels away and reveals a message to Sally saying \"Don't leave me\", leading her to believe the little girl's spirit is trapped in the house.

Aidan doesn't reveal that it is Suzanna, but asks Kenny to talk to Josh and Nora. Nora is ready to accept Kenny's apology, but Josh is upset. While out jogging, Josh's wolf nearly causes him to attack another jogger, but his attention is drawn to a pregnant woman sitting on a park bench, whom he realizes is another werewolf. Caroline reveals that she, her husband Andrew, and their friends, were all attacked by a werewolf while camping three months ago. Since then, she has become pregnant, and is worried about the baby during the transformations. Josh asks her to come to the hospital later, so Nora can perform an ultrasound, which reveals that the baby is healthy, but clawed. Andrew is worried, and Josh's wolf arises, striking fear into Andrew, who leaves with Caroline. Aidan confronts Suzanna about the vampire slaying, and she says it is her job to kill any evil vampires. She asks Aidan to join her, but he is not willing to kill innocent vampires. Later that night, he tips Kenny off to her location, but at the last moment, warns her and tells her to leave Boston. Elsewhere, Sally approaches Zoe to ask for her help in finding the girl she has dubbed \"Lil' Smokie\". They track the family down to a house in another town in Massachusetts, and discover that the little girl, Beatrice Benson, is all grown up, and her daughter is the spitting image of her mother in her youth. Although all seems fine, Sally is suspicious, particularly when she sees the daughter staring at them from the window, but Zoe warns her to let it go. Beatrice is seen looking at a photo album with a photo of a second little girl resembling herself and her daughter staring from a second story window. That night, Caroline and Andrew pay an emergency visit to Josh and Nora, as Caroline's water has broken. As Andrew wonders exactly what Josh has become, Caroline goes into labor. Finally, she gives birth to a partially transformed werewolf who soon reverts into a healthy baby girl they name April.

Kat, shocked and hurt, asks him to leave. Beth and Holly are taunting the heartbroken Aidan when Sally banishes them from the house, and is sent back in time again. Josh and Nora visit Andrew, Caroline, and baby April, and meet another werewolf couple, Mark and Wendy. Josh thinks Mark is trying to exert dominance over him, but Nora disagrees. She decides to hold a baby shower that night. Kenny tries to help Aidan overcome being dumped with blood from the lounge. Josh's sister Emily arrives to spend the night while she waits for an apartment after leaving rehab for alcoholism. Josh and Nora promise her that they will take care of her, but Mark, Wendy, and a whole pack of werewolves arrive with beer. As the party rages on, Mark declares that they will form a pack together in case the peace with the vampires is broken, just as Kenny and Aidan come in drunk on blood. Emily manages to fight temptation and leave the party, and Sally wanting to console her, attempts to cast a spell to allow her to be seen, but it doesn't work. Sally goes back to the 1920s, and watches Aidan and Henry mercilessly kill a pair of flapper girls and an old woman. Kenny approaches Emily, but the spell Sally cast on her allows her to see Kenny's mutations, horrifying her. A fight breaks out between the wolves and Kenny and Aidan, Kenny runs from the house, and Mark leads the werewolves off. The next morning Sally confronts Aidan about what she saw, and he apologizes, saying that he has changed, but she wonders if he really deserves what has happened to him.

She tells a horrified Josh that their wolves must have mated the night before. Josh insists that he and Nora go home, though the group are planning a pancake breakfast, and suggests that he and Nora should move out on their own. Sally's brother Robbie comes to the house to say he is selling it, and that a few prospective buyers are coming. Sally casts a spell to make a vile stench, driving the prospective buyers out, but sending Sally back to the day she and Danny first moved into the house. She watches for weeks as Robbie and Danny confront one another and realizes that Robbie always knew Danny was dangerous, and tried to protect her from him. Back in the present, Robbie shows the house to a family with a young son, who goes upstairs to the bathroom, is lured into a closet, and scratched by the spirit of a young girl. The family leaves in fear. That night, Josh and Nora return after house hunting to find Robbie trying to fix the sink, believing it to be the source of the smell, just as the food disposal turns on and nearly harms him. Josh answers the door and is attacked by Mark who reveals to Nora that Josh and Wendy's wolves mated during the full moon. When she tries to pull him away, Mark knocks her down, driving Josh to partially transform and turn on Mark. Nora calms him down, allowing Mark and Wendy to leave, but now she doesn't trust him, and asks him to sleep on the sofa while she goes upstairs. That night, as Robbie works on the pipes, the water boiler springs a leak and forms a puddle at his feet. Meanwhile, an electric saw on a nearby workbench turns on and falls off the bench into the puddle, electrocuting him. Suzanna approaches Aidan to help him recover from the night before and his broken heart. She reveals that she works as a bartender, and that night at the bar their feelings for each other are rekindled and they consummate their love after more than 200 years apart. She offers to help him have greater self-control, but he turns her down, and after leaving the bar, he spots a young woman whose eye he catches. Sally finally returns to the present and wants to apologize to Robbie, who sees and speaks to her. Alarmed, Sally finds Robbie's corpse on the basement floor.

Sally believes she can bring him back to life, in a different way than Donna did, but will need Donna's help. Aidan goes to ask Suzanna for her help. She agrees, giving him some blood to bring him down, but it is poisoned. She chains him up and forces him to say the name of the woman he killed. He spends the next several hours recounting the names and circumstances of every person he ever drained. Sally returns to the [[big-box store]] that Donna's death spot has since become, forcing Donna to relive the events of her death as a way back onto the living plane as a ghost. Sally's actions send them back in time, and Donna warns that if she abuses magic like this the tether to the present era may snap, leaving her trapped in the past forever. The two watch as Donna is hung for being falsely accused as a witch, and then in her village's makeshift morgue as a real group of witches prepares to bring her back to life. They summon Donna's spirit and the spirit of another girl they sacrifice, using the girl to bring Donna back to life. These are the true consequences of bringing someone back to life. Sally is upset that she cannot simply find another ghost to sacrifice for Robbie's sake, and Donna offers herself, wishing to be finally free, however Robbie ultimately decides to stay dead, since he feels life no longer holds anything for him. Donna asks Sally to seal up her death spot so she can stay in purgatory. Sally agrees, and after doing the spell, travels back in time once more. That night, Josh tries to apologize to Nora, and the two of them begin to become intimate until Nora wants to stop. Josh is unusually insistent because the wolf is taking over. Not ready to handle him in his current state, Nora leaves him the next day. In the past, Sally sees herself taking her bathrobe off to reveal an all-too-familiar outfit.

With all knowledge of what happened to herself in the original timeline, Sally begins to use it to her, as well as Aidan, Josh, and Nora's advantage. Six months later, she plans on renting out the house, but she cannot stop Bridget from dating Danny, much to her regret. She watches the boys discuss moving into the house together, but is horrified when Aidan begins to talk up Rebecca. Sally intercepts them at the bar, turning Rebecca off of going back with Aidan, and reveals all she knows about himself and the vampires, proving that she is from the future. She offers them to rent the house from her, on the condition she is their third roommate, revealing all she knows about them and their vampirism and lycanthropy. She soon helps them decorate the house just the way she remembers, and even teaches Josh the rump roast trick he eventually learns from Ray. However, Ray discovers him in the forest, wondering exactly how he knows this fact. Josh and Aidan return to the house to find Sally talking to the police, as she called them to accuse Danny of murder when she discovers that Bridget is dead. Sally worries that she never does anything right, even though she means the best, but Aidan thanks her for helping him save Rebecca, and they kiss. Three months later, Sally tries to set Josh and Nora up during a dinner date, revealing to Aidan that the two get married in her timeline. They give the two of them time alone by going to a bar, but Marcus approaches them, trying to bring Aidan back into the fold, but Sally stops him by revealing that she knows about his work with the Amish. One month later, Josh is worried about how things are going with Nora, worried he may hurt her, when Sally tells him not to worry, and that he will marry her. As it is the night of the full moon, and when Nora takes him aside to speak with him, they begin to make love until Sally interrupts them, knowing that the full moon is almost risen. She whisks Josh away, keeping Nora at bay, but she is scratched by Josh, cursing her to become a werewolf now. The following month, Sally reveals to Josh that he and Nora got married because Josh turned her, and she tells him that things are fine. Josh apologizes to Sally for turning her, but Sally assuages his guilt. Three months later, Josh is upset about the turn of events, and Aidan reveals that Dr. Reid is going to propose to Nora. Josh is worried about Sally's prophecies, but Aidan has full trust in her, as nothing good has turned out for him. Later that night, Sally reveals to Aidan that they never got together in her timeline. On the next full moon, Josh is nowhere to be seen, and Sally gets ready to change. Before she leaves, they admit their love for each other. The next morning, they still do not know where Josh is, as Sally did not find him in the woods, but they find him with Ray in the house. When Ray leaves, Sally tells Josh that he tries to kill Nora, and that he is the werewolf who turned Josh, and by killing him Josh will be freed. Josh realizes things are not the way that they're supposed to be, and feels out of place in the house, and moves out, upsetting Sally. She is worried she has ruined everything by changing the past. Aidan tries to take her mind off of the way she wants things to be and not worry about Josh, but this just makes her realize they should not be together, as she has changed Aidan into someone who has given up on Josh. Upset, she breaks up with him. One month later, Aidan and Josh are not speaking to each other. Ray talks Josh into going to the blood den to attack vampires while they are strong due to the waxing moon. Aidan is at the blood den with Marcus, now back with the vampires. They meet Sally at the blood den, as she followed Aidan there, just as Aidan and Marcus step out, blood drunk. Sally tries to talk Josh out of attacking them, but Marcus and Josh fight, as Aidan takes on Ray. Sally tries to stop things, but Aidan strikes Ray with a pipe. Aidan and Josh begin arguing. As Sally tries to break up the fight, Ray beats Marcus with the pipe. Marcus ducks and Sally is bashed in the skull. Sally falls to the ground, and as other vampires step out of the blood den, Ray and Josh run away. Aidan watches in tears as Sally dies before him.\n |LineColor = 056444\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 4)\n |EpisodeNumber = 48\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = Too Far, Fast Forward!\n |DirectedBy = Stefan Pleszczynski\n |WrittenBy = Nancy Won\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|10}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-68\n |Viewers = 1.10<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/03/11/monday-cable-ratings-monday-night-raw-leads-night-swamp-people-bates-motel-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-more/243570/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Monday Night RAW' Leads Night + 'Swamp People', 'Bates Motel', 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = In the aftermath of Sally's death at Ray's hands, Aidan gets Bishop to get revenge and he kills Ray, forever cursing Josh. Still feeling Josh is to blame, Aidan threatens him to never be in Boston, again, or else he will kill him. A year later, the flu virus is in full swing. Aidan is smuggling healthy blood out of the hospital as Nora turns a blind eye. Josh has opened a pie shop out of town, and despite Sally's urging that he settle with one of his regular customers, he denies it, as he does not want to make anyone else a werewolf. Aidan approaches Nora, who has begun stealing painkillers from the hospital pharmacy, for spying on him and Bishop, and reminds her of their agreement to not reveal anything to anyone else, while Aidan demands to know about the next shipment which has been mixed into the general supply by accident. The vampires begin rationing off blood, with Bishop having his own private stash. Josh calls Alana to speak to Sally in order to find Donna, but Alana reveals that Sally has possessed Josh to call her, driving a wedge between them. To cover for his lost supply, Aidan steals Bishops stock of blood to sell on the streets. Bishop attacks him later for violating their trust, but does not harm him any further. However, another vampire in Bishop's inner circle is not as lucky, and has his fangs pulled out for stealing from the supply. The following day, Josh is still upset with Sally over possessing him, but he now has some of her memories from the original timeline, one where he, Sally, and Nora are enjoying each other's company. A woman enters the bakery and after Josh disperses Sally with iron, he is attacked by a sickly vampire, which reminds Sally of the virus. She returns to Boston to speak to Aidan, and Josh comes as well, revealing that Josh's werewolf blood is the cure for the virus. The next day, Josh goes to the hospital to see Nora, who is divorcing from Dr. Reid after he cheated on her. Josh has another memory of Sally's in his head, the day of his and Nora's wedding. He leaves, but not before telling her to take care. Aidan replenishes Bishop's blood supply and drinks with him, knowingly giving him tainted blood that he is immune to. Aidan goes back to Sally and Josh to reveal he has poisoned Bishop, and Josh says that they are now even for saving each other's lives, but Aidan asks them to leave, upsetting Sally. Aidan speaks with Bishop who is heavily infected, and in Bishop's praising of Aidan for surpassing him, he mentions how he has gotten rid of his lover and his best friend. Later, he reminisces about his times with Josh and Sally and goes to the bakery to reconcile. However, Sally is suddenly transported to Donna's house where she demands to know what has been happening. Sally tries to reveal the truth to her, but Donna does not believe until she tries to use a butcher's knife to disperse Sally, only for her to be harmed. Sally manages to convince Donna to use her magic to set the timelines straight, but needs both Josh and Aidan's approval. Aidan is willing, but Sally believes Josh has some reservations, but Josh wants the life he has seen in Sally's memories and agrees. Before Donna performs the spell, she warns Sally that she will be flung into the future a bit before she is sent back to the right point in time. And Aidan asks Sally to make sure that his other self remembers the fond memories they shared in this timeline. As Donna chants the incantation, several instances of Sally's spirit fill the room. Sally is sent through time, but the timeline she sees first is one where Aidan, upset over Sally's disappearance, breaks Josh's neck, killing him. As Sally mourns Josh's death, she is flung through time again and watches Aidan oversee an ambulance take away a body. Sally demands to know what he did, when Josh steps next to her, as they both reveal they have called the police to take Robbie's body away in her absence. Aidan cannot remember the intimacy he and Sally shared, and Josh asks where she has been, and she tells them she has been to the past and the future, but the future seems to be much closer than she anticipated, not ready to reveal what she has seen to either of the boys.\n |LineColor = 056444\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 4)\n |EpisodeNumber = 49\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Oh Don't You Die For Me\n |DirectedBy = Paolo Barzman\n |WrittenBy = Mike Ostrowski\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|17}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-67\n |Viewers = 1.13<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/03/18/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-wins-night-fast-n-loud-teen-wolf-bates-motel-switched-at-birth-more/245621/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE Raw' Wins Night, 'Fast N Loud', 'Teen Wolf', 'Bates Motel', 'Switched at Birth' & More|last=Bibel|first=Sara|work=TV by the Numbers|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = With Nora moving out, Josh reconciles with Andrew and Mark, revealing to them that he can transform into the wolf at will. Suzanna gives Aidan an ultimatum: he has to kill the head of the Boston vampires, unaware that she is asking him to kill his own son. Sally tries to get Josh and Nora to patch things up, by asking him to stay later, but during the argument when she spots Aidan coming out of the shower, she begins to remember the events of the alternate timeline. Josh visits Andrew and Caroline in their new house in the country, and Mark reveals that they are actually planning on having a party to form a new pack with Josh as the leader. Later, while Josh and Nora have some niceties before he leaves to go to the party, Suzanna gives Aidan the cross from their hometown's church that she has fashioned into a stake to kill Kenny. At the party, Mark tries to bring Josh's confidence up, until he brings a young woman who seems eager to meet him. When she hugs him, Josh notices that she is in fact a human. Mark reveals that most of the patrons at the party are humans who they wish to willingly turn into werewolves, which shocks him. Aidan approaches Kenny at the funeral home, ready to kill him for essentially filling Bishop's vacancy, until Astrid, the werewolf he met at the party, reveals Kenny has true affection for her. Aidan simply warns him to think about what he is doing, if it will be for her safety or his own ego. In the house, after Sally knocks aspirin out of Nora's hand, she reveals the events of the alternate timeline to her, admitting that she fell in love with Aidan during that time. Sally is still wary of revealing what happened to them to him, but Nora thinks otherwise, and Sally tells her all of the events of her other life. At the party, Josh confronts Caroline and Andrew about Mark's plans, as they knew all along. Josh is adamant that he will not turn them, knowing full well the truth of the condition, but when he leaves they stun him and cage him up in the basement so he can turn the people safely. Mark and Andrew reveal their plan to bolster the werewolves' numbers using him just in case the peace with the vampires ends, and they will follow him regardless. When he refuses to turn, they take a cattle prod to him to force him to change. As the other werewolves gather to see him, Astrid arrives, understanding the full gravity of the situation. Back at the house, Sally finally reveals that Josh owned a pie shop in the alternate timeline, and he was miserable. Nora is still wary about staying in the house because of all that has happened. Aidan goes to Suzanna to reveal that he is Kenny's sire and he asks her for time to rein him in rather than kill him. She gives him two months' time, otherwise she will take care of him herself, and Aidan as well. At the house, Aidan asks Sally's advice on what to do concerning Suzanna, and her advice is just to let her go, awkwardly, not telling him what she knows, but still trying to let him know Suzanna is not the right woman for him. Suddenly, Astrid rings their doorbell, revealing Josh is captured. At the funeral home, a new body comes in, but they are unaware that Suzanna is hiding within the bodybag. Aidan, Sally, and Nora go to save Josh, as the house is empty. Kenny goes back to the funeral home and is subdued by Suzanna using juniper, who has already staked all his workers. Aidan, Sally, and Nora find Josh locked up in the basement and they free him, but not before several of the werewolves come to stop them. Nora takes Josh to safety while Aidan fights the werewolves. Sally stays behind, despite Aidan's protests, and as he is overwhelmed and about to be staked by Mark, she possesses Andrew, giving Aidan a chance to fight back. With Sally's help, Aidan beats the werewolves, leaving everyone but \"Shit Brickhouse\" standing. Sally possesses him and makes out with Aidan as they did in her memories of the other timeline. As they leave, Aidan wants to know why Sally did what she did, but as he answers a text from Kenny, she dissipates before she can tell him anything. He arrives at the funeral home to see Suzanna standing over Kenny's body. Aidan realizes that everything Suzanna has been doing is because of her deep guilt over killing Isaac. She poisons him with juniper and tries to make him stake Kenny, but in his last bit of strength and clarity he stakes her. Back at the house, Nora reveals Josh is fine but Sally is unresponsive. Aidan wants to know why she has done what she did, and Nora reveals to him that Sally loves him.

As she wonders how she arrived, as she did not use magic, she soon realizes that she can hear Josh and Nora, who has stayed in the house waiting for Josh to convalesce, arguing nearby. She emerges from the closet, surprising all three of them. Downstairs, Aidan is asleep, when he feels Sally wake him. He is amazed that they can touch each other, and they begin to passionately kiss, until he is woken from his dream by Nora searching for a sledgehammer. Aidan breaks through the closet into the other room, and Sally tells them this is where she saw a girl get sacrificed. Aidan can smell that someone has died in the room, and spots a blood stain with fresh scratch marks in it. Before they can investigate further, Sally's father comes to the door to tell them that he has sold the house, and they have to move out by Monday. Aidan throws away several of his old belongings, and at Sally's urging, he reveals that he no longer has anything to tie him to his past, and dismisses attempting a relationship with Sally as both of them have bad histories with relationships, even though she reveals that they loved each other during her time traveling. He later goes to speak with Kenny, who has just ended an argument with Astrid about running away together, and he offers to help Kenny fake his death so he can run away, but he asks Aidan to ask Josh and Nora to talk Astrid into it. However, Josh is apprehensive about having Kenny and Astrid run away together, and they argue over what they really want out of everything, even though Sally tries to get them to stop, when all three are distracted by the ghost of a little girl. Sally realizes she is the girl she saw get sacrificed, and she introduces herself as Ramona, the twin sister to Beatrice. Ramona tells them that she has always been in the room, and has grown attached to them even though she could not speak with them. Sally convinces Aidan to talk to Beatrice, who works as a county clerk, but she and Aidan argue about their relationship and the future they may have, all while Aidan looks like he is talking to nobody. Back at the house, Ramona is worried about Josh and the others leaving, when she says Nora has arrived. Josh wants to turn with Nora that night, but Nora is still worried about him and his wolf and has only come so she can speak with Astrid. Josh goes back upstairs to pack, and Nora answers the door for Astrid, but Astrid pulls a gun on her, as the pack has decided to take Josh back by force. Josh tries to go downstairs to save her, but Ramona traps him in the room, as she knows it is not safe for anyone, until Josh changes. Mark and Andrew prepare to take Josh back by force, but the door swings open to reveal Josh has fully transformed. At the clerical office, Aidan's turn has come and he talks to Beatrice, but as soon as he reveals Ramona to her, she calls security to drag him out, horrified by the revelation. Aidan and Sally return home to see the bloodbath, Josh having killed all of the werewolves who came to take him back, including Astrid. Josh and Nora hurry out of the house to the woods, with Aidan promising to take care of things. Josh and Nora head to the campsite that they originally lived during the three-month period where Josh was trapped, because Sally has come up with an idea. While Nora locks herself up in the shed, she enters Josh's mind before he changes. She discovers Josh in his mind, as she knows the only way to solve things is to find the part of Josh that is missing, otherwise the wolf will take over, once more. Josh knows full well the other part of him that is missing, and it is his wolf, that he runs away from. At the house, Aidan has called on Kenny to have a clean up, lying to him that the pack killed Astrid on their own before coming to the house and Josh turning on them. In reality, he has hidden Astrid's corpse upstairs in Ramona's room. He tells Kenny that the only thing left for him is to leave Boston for good. In Josh's mind, Sally sees the futility of his plan of running away from the wolf and hiding during the change, but Sally makes him stand his ground, first by creating a happy place for himself to make the confrontation, the house. With Sally's encouragement, Josh confronts his wolf, telling him that he must live his life, and the wolf only gets the full moon to live. A peace is finally made between Josh and his wolf, who leaves on his own accord. The next morning, Nora finds Josh sitting by himself at the camper, and she realizes that he is finally back to being himself, as Sally watches them from afar. In the hidden room, Aidan puts Astrid's corpse into a body bag to dispose of her, and Ramona asks why he did not let the others take her, and he admits that she was special, but asks her to not bother him anymore, but she is gone. As he leaves the room, he does not notice that there are now fifteen scratch marks in the old bloodstain, when before there were only six. Josh, Nora, and Sally return to the house to find it spotless, and reveals the lie he told Kenny to them, so they can cover for each other. Josh thanks him for keeping him safe, and Sally informs him that he must always confront the wolf, or the wolf will win. In the funeral home, Kenny grieves, when he is visited by Astrid's ghost. She reveals to him that the pack turned on her and forced her to help them take Josh back, and Josh was the one who killed her.\n |LineColor = 056444\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 4)\n |EpisodeNumber = 51\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 12\n |Title = House Hunting\n |DirectedBy = Jeff Renfroe\n |WrittenBy = Lisa Randolph\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|31}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-71\n |Viewers = 1.05<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/04/01/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-wins-night-t-i-and-tiny-black-ink-crew-bates-motel-archer-dallas-more/249790/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE Raw' Wins Night, 'T.I. and Tiny', 'Black Ink Crew', 'Bates Motel', 'Archer', 'Being Human', 'Dallas' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=April 1, 2014|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan visits Kenny to help him prepare for his leaving Boston, but Kenny is not ready now that Astrid is dead, and is suspicious now that he knows Aidan lied to him. However, he gives Aidan the keys to the van so they may all pack. Aidan returns to the house to find Josh, Nora, and Sally with Ramona. As they all plan on leaving, Sally pledges to stay behind, for a bit, to ensure Ramona passes on, but before she can reveal this to her, Ramona disappears. Nora asks Josh why he no longer writes in his \"werewolf\" journal, with Josh saying because the curse was lifted the first time, he no longer needs to keep track of his symptoms. Nora believes he should keep it, and they plan on moving into her old apartment together. Downstairs, after Sally laments the fact that Nora may have sold her favorite pair of tights, Aidan proposes that she \"haunt\" him in the RV in the woods. However, Ramona expresses jealousy that the four are leaving without her. The four argue over belongings, such as the microwave as the popcorn setting is apparently perfect for blood, but they are actually arguing over who gets to keep the \"Dog Man Cat Dude\" statue, with the group ultimately deciding that Josh and Nora get it, but Aidan and Sally get \"visitation rights\". However, their happiness is disrupted by Beatrice's arrival. Beatrice attempts to warn the group about Ramona's true nature. She reveals her parents joined a cult shortly before herself and her twin were born, and they were granted an audience with [[Paimon]], one of the Kings of Hell. Her parents doted upon her, but kept her sister locked up in a hidden room, and never actually named her, and on one night after they had turned ten, Ramona was sacrificed to the devil. The group realizes something more is up when Ramona makes herself known, and Beatrice can still see her. Ramona, however, is furious at Beatrice as she believes her sister let her die, and she kills Beatrice in front of them. All four attempt to escape the house, but each is thrown into a separate room. Aidan finds himself in the basement with the ghost of Henry, who attempts to get Aidan to kill himself so he can become a ghost with Sally. Josh is in the kitchen with the ghost of Julia, who tries to get him to commit suicide so he can save Nora from an inevitable death. Nora is in the bedroom with Emily, who has fallen off the wagon and tries to get Nora to leave Josh as he is hiding something from her. And Sally discovers herself in the bathroom with Kat, who can apparently see Sally perfectly fine, and taunts her over her relationship with Aidan. Sally sees through the ruse first and realizes Ramona is making everyone see things. Sally confronts her, and she simply rebuffs Sally's idea that she is a ghost as well, and simply states that no one has a chance of leaving the house alive, and reveals that she is not trapped in the house but is the house itself. \"Henry\" continues to try to get Aidan to kill himself, as does \"Julia\", but Josh refuses and is rushed at by \"Julia\". Nora reads from the journal, which allegedly has a new entry, as \"Emily\" says that she must leave Josh for the well being of their unborn child, a fact that Nora has not revealed to anyone yet. As Ramona reveals how she has done everything to keep the group in the house, Sally realizes that she had a hand in killing Robbie, and realizes that she is trying to kill the others. Sally manages to get into the bedroom and manages to dispel Ramona's illusion, freeing Nora to go downstairs to help Josh while Sally goes to Aidan. Sally manages to stop Aidan from staking himself, and gets rid of the illusion of Henry. Upstairs, Josh is horrified by the sight of Nora's body on the ground, her throat slashed by the silver knife \"Julia\" attempted to get him to kill himself with. He prepares to kill himself until the real Nora arrives and gets Josh to see through the illusion. Everyone regroups and tries to leave through the backdoor, but are only trapped in the room with Ramona. Sally reveals to them that Ramona is the personification of the house's evil, and that she wants them trapped forever, if not dead. She taunts Ramona, saying that neither of them have killed each other, but Ramona simply says she has time, as she lets Kenny into the house, and Aidan out of the room, but keeping the others trapped. Kenny reveals to Aidan that he knows he is protecting Josh, but Aidan does his best to try to convince Kenny that seeking revenge solves nothing. The two fight, but just as Kenny is to stake Aidan through the heart, Aidan manages to turn it on Kenny. He does his best to try to get Kenny out of the situation alive, but Kenny compels him to believe that Josh has made Sally disappear and dies. Ramona lets everyone else out of the hidden room, and Sally realizes that when the other timeline's Donna sent her back to the normal timeline, she saw these exact events unfold: Aidan killing Josh in mourning over her.

She warns Josh that this will end with his death and it is because of Kenny unless she can do something, and she gets an idea. She opens the door to the basement but before Aidan can attack, she slams him into the wall with psychic powers. After she gets Nora and Josh to lift him into the bed, she performs one last spell. Aidan wakes up and can feel his heartbeat for the first time in centuries. Sally has sacrificed herself to bring him back to life, and she thanks all of them for all they have done before disappearing into nothingness. Ramona, however, is angry that Sally is gone, and attacks them, blowing out all the windows in the house, but the three manage to escape to Nora's apartment. Aidan is amazed that he is alive, but is sure that Sally is gone for good. After getting him his first real food in over 200 years, Aidan lets the two of them live together and he will stay in the RV as they had originally planned. However, after a night of drunkenness and sorrow, Aidan wakes up and realizes something is off. At the house, a construction worker enters and tries to get work done, but is distracted by Ramona. At the RV, Aidan looks in the mirror and sees that he has rapidly aged over night. The construction worker follows Ramona up to her hidden room, and she kills him with a shard of glass, planning on using him to get to the others. At the hospital, Nora presents Aidan with test results, showing that his organs are slowly failing as his age catches up with him. Both are hesitant to tell Josh of the truth, and when it does happen, Aidan accidentally reveals that Nora is pregnant with his child. Later, Aidan visits Sally's grave, leaving a rose behind, and goes to a bar in town, watching as he sees a new vampire try to get a date and meal. Aidan stops him, and demands that he turn him back into a vampire. At Nora's apartment, Josh tells her he plans on opening a diner to work in, but also is worried that he should get medication because of everything that has happened. Nora assures him she trusts in him, regardless of the wolf. Josh drives into town and finds Aidan getting attacked, but not fighting back, and the vampire leaves. Aidan finally admits that he is afraid of dying, because he feels that there is no good end for him with his centuries of monstrosities, but Josh just tells him that he is simply being human. The next morning, Josh drops off breakfast and the newspaper for Aidan, who is planning on seeing everything in Boston before he dies, but he instead happens upon the death of the construction worker in their old house. Aidan has an idea to end things for good, and demands that Josh not get involved, as he has a future with Nora and his child. Josh insists, and Aidan tells him to drop him off for now and meet him in the house in an hour. However, Aidan is planning on taking care of things by himself. He drops some bags off downstairs, and heads upstairs to try to find Ramona, finding his old leather jacket first, before finding her. She taunts him about how he will probably go to hell, and there is nothing that he can do to stop her because her creation was not one of Catholicism so any plans he may have to exorcise her are fruitless. Instead, he taunts her back that nothing she has planned for them will work, and she attacks him, planning on choking him with blood, before throwing him down the stairs, just as Sally died originally. He lands just as she did, but with his final breaths he ignites a cigarette lighter, throwing it onto a puddle of gasoline he had spilled earlier. As the house burns down, so does Ramona's evil spirit, destroying her, and the house, for good. Josh and Nora return to find the house burnt to cinders and Aidan's corpse taken away by paramedics. They enter to survey the damage, only to see Aidan's ghost greet them. They offer to let him haunt them, but he feels he should see the world first, until Josh and Nora tell him his Door has arrived. As he enters through it, he is greeted by Sally's soul, and the two embrace for the first time, as they both pass on to the other side.\n----\nJosh, Nora, Sally, and Aidan appear to celebrate their lives together, in laughter and love, just as Josh wakes up with Nora at his side in a field. When he tells Nora of his dream, she says she saw the same thing, and Josh believes that somewhere in the afterlife Aidan and Sally are making these dreams for them, of a life spent together. Both worry what time it is, with Nora worrying about the pies they have baking, and Josh \"worries\" about their children.

Nora and Aidan are at a disused farmhouse, caring for Josh, who is a wolf all the time except during the full moon. When Josh returns to his human self and Nora is out as the wolf, he contemplates suicide due to the strain he is placing on his wife and best friend. With Josh's blessing, Aidan meets Kat at a faculty party. When Aidan goes to get drinks, a woman resembling Aidan's long dead wife Suzanna approaches Kat, but disappears before Aidan returns. The next day at the hospital, Aidan's suspicions are raised when Blake, who now works at the same funeral home that Bishop ran previously, tries to take a corpse. Elsewhere, Sally is with Donna in what appears to be a spa, but she soon wants to escape, though Donna warns that they are both a threat to reality. Sally escapes through Donna's death spot, experiencing Donna's death by hanging as a witch during the 17th century, and goes to meet her friends at the farm. Josh is not in his holding cell and, as the werewolf, he confronts the trio in an attempt to commit suicide at Aidan's hand. Sally conjures up a ring of fire to trap him, allowing Nora to tranquilize him. However, Sally disappears into what she thinks is another dimension, and sees a little girl being stabbed by a group of witches.

Though they could be together again, Aidan feels he should remain with Kat, and Suzanna reluctantly agrees. She doesn't reveal the true reason she avoided him for two hundred years, that in her first feast as a vampire she killed their only son, and has been wracked with guilt ever since. Sally believes that she can use magic to change Josh back to normal. She goes to where the soup kitchen once stood, and enters the alternate dimension where she and Donna last fought, discovering a book of spells. That night, on the new moon, Sally conjures up a magical knife that must be stabbed into Josh's heart. Nora volunteers to perform the act, but cannot due to Josh's viciousness. Aidan reluctantly stabs the wolf, and it collapses. Both Aidan and Nora believe Josh is dead due to a botched spell. Sally disappears, and finds herself in the house again, watching the guys move in while she watches them from afar. She realizes that she has traveled into the past each time she has performed a spell. Back at the farm, Aidan is grieving Josh's death when a human hand thrusts out from the wolf's mouth. Aidan tears open the carcass to find the human Josh alive and well. When Sally returns from the past, she worries that the uncompleted spell will cause problems.

While the boys are at the hospital, and Nora is out buying wallpaper, Sally finds a spell in the book that will bring back her door. She reads the incantation, but it summons Donna, come to take Sally back to purgatory. Sally burns the spell book and sends Donna back, but the spell book becomes a part of her, giving her knowledge of all its contents. At the hospital, Josh has trouble keeping his wolf at bay and is overwhelmed by his senses. He accidentally lashes out at his attending physician, and runs out. As Aidan prepares to start his shift, he is kidnapped by a group of vampires, and brought to Kenny. Kenny shows Aidan a luxurious new blood lounge, with donated blood and new women, but Aidan doesn't want to be involved. Later that night, two vampires attack Josh while he is out running. He partially transforms into a werewolf and kills them, to his shock. Aidan confronts Kenny, who reveals he childishly thought that if Josh were dead, he and Aidan could run Boston together. Apologizing, he reveals that he is still deformed but has the ability to compel not only humans but also other vampires to see him as normal. Their talk is interrupted by an emergency at the blood lounge. There are piles of ash everywhere; someone has killed all the vampires. The security footage reveals Suzanna as the attacker. Sally offers to heal Nora's burn scars using her new magic knowledge, but disappears after the spell is completed. She finds herself in the house during the 1970s, and spots the same little girl who was stabbed before. Hours later, when Sally returns to the present time, Nora's burns are healed, but as she's showing off the newly decorated room, the wallpaper peels away and reveals a message to Sally saying \"Don't leave me\", leading her to believe the little girl's spirit is trapped in the house.

While out jogging, Josh's wolf nearly causes him to attack another jogger, but his attention is drawn to a pregnant woman sitting on a park bench, whom he realizes is another werewolf. Caroline reveals that she, her husband Andrew, and their friends, were all attacked by a werewolf while camping three months ago. Since then, she has become pregnant, and is worried about the baby during the transformations. Josh asks her to come to the hospital later, so Nora can perform an ultrasound, which reveals that the baby is healthy, but clawed. Andrew is worried, and Josh's wolf arises, striking fear into Andrew, who leaves with Caroline. Aidan confronts Suzanna about the vampire slaying, and she says it is her job to kill any evil vampires. She asks Aidan to join her, but he is not willing to kill innocent vampires.

Elsewhere, Sally approaches Zoe to ask for her help in finding the girl she has dubbed \"Lil' Smokie\". They track the family down to a house in another town in Massachusetts, and discover that the little girl, Beatrice Benson, is all grown up, and her daughter is the spitting image of her mother in her youth. Although all seems fine, Sally is suspicious, particularly when she sees the daughter staring at them from the window, but Zoe warns her to let it go. Beatrice is seen looking at a photo album with a photo of a second little girl resembling herself and her daughter staring from a second story window. That night, Caroline and Andrew pay an emergency visit to Josh and Nora, as Caroline's water has broken. As Andrew wonders exactly what Josh has become, Caroline goes into labor.

As the party rages on, Mark declares that they will form a pack together in case the peace with the vampires is broken, just as Kenny and Aidan come in drunk on blood. Emily manages to fight temptation and leave the party, and Sally wanting to console her, attempts to cast a spell to allow her to be seen, but it doesn't work. Sally goes back to the 1920s, and watches Aidan and Henry mercilessly kill a pair of flapper girls and an old woman.

She tells a horrified Josh that their wolves must have mated the night before. Josh insists that he and Nora go home, though the group are planning a pancake breakfast, and suggests that he and Nora should move out on their own. Sally's brother Robbie comes to the house to say he is selling it, and that a few prospective buyers are coming. Sally casts a spell to make a vile stench, driving the prospective buyers out, but sending Sally back to the day she and Danny first moved into the house. She watches for weeks as Robbie and Danny confront one another and realizes that Robbie always knew Danny was dangerous, and tried to protect her from him. Back in the present, Robbie shows the house to a family with a young son, who goes upstairs to the bathroom, is lured into a closet, and scratched by the spirit of a young girl. The family leaves in fear. That night, Josh and Nora return after house hunting to find Robbie trying to fix the sink, believing it to be the source of the smell, just as the food disposal turns on and nearly harms him. Josh answers the door and is attacked by Mark who reveals to Nora that Josh and Wendy's wolves mated during the full moon. When she tries to pull him away, Mark knocks her down, driving Josh to partially transform and turn on Mark. Nora calms him down, allowing Mark and Wendy to leave, but now she doesn't trust him, and asks him to sleep on the sofa while she goes upstairs. That night, as Robbie works on the pipes, the water boiler springs a leak and forms a puddle at his feet. Meanwhile, an electric saw on a nearby workbench turns on and falls off the bench into the puddle, electrocuting him. Suzanna approaches Aidan to help him recover from the night before and his broken heart. She reveals that she works as a bartender, and that night at the bar their feelings for each other are rekindled and they consummate their love after more than 200 years apart.

She agrees, giving him some blood to bring him down, but it is poisoned. She chains him up and forces him to say the name of the woman he killed. He spends the next several hours recounting the names and circumstances of every person he ever drained. Sally returns to the [[big-box store]] that Donna's death spot has since become, forcing Donna to relive the events of her death as a way back onto the living plane as a ghost. Sally's actions send them back in time, and Donna warns that if she abuses magic like this the tether to the present era may snap, leaving her trapped in the past forever. The two watch as Donna is hung for being falsely accused as a witch, and then in her village's makeshift morgue as a real group of witches prepares to bring her back to life. They summon Donna's spirit and the spirit of another girl they sacrifice, using the girl to bring Donna back to life. These are the true consequences of bringing someone back to life. Sally is upset that she cannot simply find another ghost to sacrifice for Robbie's sake, and Donna offers herself, wishing to be finally free, however Robbie ultimately decides to stay dead, since he feels life no longer holds anything for him. Donna asks Sally to seal up her death spot so she can stay in purgatory. Sally agrees, and after doing the spell, travels back in time once more. That night, Josh tries to apologize to Nora, and the two of them begin to become intimate until Nora wants to stop. Josh is unusually insistent because the wolf is taking over.

Six months later, she plans on renting out the house, but she cannot stop Bridget from dating Danny, much to her regret. She watches the boys discuss moving into the house together, but is horrified when Aidan begins to talk up Rebecca. Sally intercepts them at the bar, turning Rebecca off of going back with Aidan, and reveals all she knows about himself and the vampires, proving that she is from the future. She offers them to rent the house from her, on the condition she is their third roommate, revealing all she knows about them and their vampirism and lycanthropy. She soon helps them decorate the house just the way she remembers, and even teaches Josh the rump roast trick he eventually learns from Ray. However, Ray discovers him in the forest, wondering exactly how he knows this fact. Josh and Aidan return to the house to find Sally talking to the police, as she called them to accuse Danny of murder when she discovers that Bridget is dead.

She whisks Josh away, keeping Nora at bay, but she is scratched by Josh, cursing her to become a werewolf now. The following month, Sally reveals to Josh that he and Nora got married because Josh turned her, and she tells him that things are fine.

Before she leaves, they admit their love for each other. The next morning, they still do not know where Josh is, as Sally did not find him in the woods, but they find him with Ray in the house. When Ray leaves, Sally tells Josh that he tries to kill Nora, and that he is the werewolf who turned Josh, and by killing him Josh will be freed. Josh realizes things are not the way that they're supposed to be, and feels out of place in the house, and moves out, upsetting Sally. She is worried she has ruined everything by changing the past. Aidan tries to take her mind off of the way she wants things to be and not worry about Josh, but this just makes her realize they should not be together, as she has changed Aidan into someone who has given up on Josh. Upset, she breaks up with him. One month later, Aidan and Josh are not speaking to each other.

Josh has opened a pie shop out of town, and despite Sally's urging that he settle with one of his regular customers, he denies it, as he does not want to make anyone else a werewolf. Aidan approaches Nora, who has begun stealing painkillers from the hospital pharmacy, for spying on him and Bishop, and reminds her of their agreement to not reveal anything to anyone else, while Aidan demands to know about the next shipment which has been mixed into the general supply by accident. The vampires begin rationing off blood, with Bishop having his own private stash. Josh calls Alana to speak to Sally in order to find Donna, but Alana reveals that Sally has possessed Josh to call her, driving a wedge between them. To cover for his lost supply, Aidan steals Bishops stock of blood to sell on the streets. Bishop attacks him later for violating their trust, but does not harm him any further. However, another vampire in Bishop's inner circle is not as lucky, and has his fangs pulled out for stealing from the supply. The following day, Josh is still upset with Sally over possessing him, but he now has some of her memories from the original timeline, one where he, Sally, and Nora are enjoying each other's company. A woman enters the bakery and after Josh disperses Sally with iron, he is attacked by a sickly vampire, which reminds Sally of the virus. She returns to Boston to speak to Aidan, and Josh comes as well, revealing that Josh's werewolf blood is the cure for the virus. The next day, Josh goes to the hospital to see Nora, who is divorcing from Dr. Reid after he cheated on her. Josh has another memory of Sally's in his head, the day of his and Nora's wedding. He leaves, but not before telling her to take care. Aidan replenishes Bishop's blood supply and drinks with him, knowingly giving him tainted blood that he is immune to. Aidan goes back to Sally and Josh to reveal he has poisoned Bishop, and Josh says that they are now even for saving each other's lives, but Aidan asks them to leave, upsetting Sally. Aidan speaks with Bishop who is heavily infected, and in Bishop's praising of Aidan for surpassing him, he mentions how he has gotten rid of his lover and his best friend. Later, he reminisces about his times with Josh and Sally and goes to the bakery to reconcile. However, Sally is suddenly transported to Donna's house where she demands to know what has been happening. Sally tries to reveal the truth to her, but Donna does not believe until she tries to use a butcher's knife to disperse Sally, only for her to be harmed. Sally manages to convince Donna to use her magic to set the timelines straight, but needs both Josh and Aidan's approval. Aidan is willing, but Sally believes Josh has some reservations, but Josh wants the life he has seen in Sally's memories and agrees. Before Donna performs the spell, she warns Sally that she will be flung into the future a bit before she is sent back to the right point in time. And Aidan asks Sally to make sure that his other self remembers the fond memories they shared in this timeline. As Donna chants the incantation, several instances of Sally's spirit fill the room. Sally is sent through time, but the timeline she sees first is one where Aidan, upset over Sally's disappearance, breaks Josh's neck, killing him. As Sally mourns Josh's death, she is flung through time again and watches Aidan oversee an ambulance take away a body. Sally demands to know what he did, when Josh steps next to her, as they both reveal they have called the police to take Robbie's body away in her absence. Aidan cannot remember the intimacy he and Sally shared, and Josh asks where she has been, and she tells them she has been to the past and the future, but the future seems to be much closer than she anticipated, not ready to reveal what she has seen to either of the boys.\n |LineColor = 056444\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 4)\n |EpisodeNumber = 49\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Oh Don't You Die For Me\n |DirectedBy = Paolo Barzman\n |WrittenBy = Mike Ostrowski\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|17}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-67\n |Viewers = 1.13<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/03/18/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-wins-night-fast-n-loud-teen-wolf-bates-motel-switched-at-birth-more/245621/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE Raw' Wins Night, 'Fast N Loud', 'Teen Wolf', 'Bates Motel', 'Switched at Birth' & More|last=Bibel|first=Sara|work=TV by the Numbers|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = With Nora moving out, Josh reconciles with Andrew and Mark, revealing to them that he can transform into the wolf at will. Suzanna gives Aidan an ultimatum: he has to kill the head of the Boston vampires, unaware that she is asking him to kill his own son. Sally tries to get Josh and Nora to patch things up, by asking him to stay later, but during the argument when she spots Aidan coming out of the shower, she begins to remember the events of the alternate timeline. Josh visits Andrew and Caroline in their new house in the country, and Mark reveals that they are actually planning on having a party to form a new pack with Josh as the leader. Later, while Josh and Nora have some niceties before he leaves to go to the party, Suzanna gives Aidan the cross from their hometown's church that she has fashioned into a stake to kill Kenny. At the party, Mark tries to bring Josh's confidence up, until he brings a young woman who seems eager to meet him. When she hugs him, Josh notices that she is in fact a human. Mark reveals that most of the patrons at the party are humans who they wish to willingly turn into werewolves, which shocks him. Aidan approaches Kenny at the funeral home, ready to kill him for essentially filling Bishop's vacancy, until Astrid, the werewolf he met at the party, reveals Kenny has true affection for her. Aidan simply warns him to think about what he is doing, if it will be for her safety or his own ego. In the house, after Sally knocks aspirin out of Nora's hand, she reveals the events of the alternate timeline to her, admitting that she fell in love with Aidan during that time. Sally is still wary of revealing what happened to them to him, but Nora thinks otherwise, and Sally tells her all of the events of her other life. At the party, Josh confronts Caroline and Andrew about Mark's plans, as they knew all along. Josh is adamant that he will not turn them, knowing full well the truth of the condition, but when he leaves they stun him and cage him up in the basement so he can turn the people safely. Mark and Andrew reveal their plan to bolster the werewolves' numbers using him just in case the peace with the vampires ends, and they will follow him regardless. When he refuses to turn, they take a cattle prod to him to force him to change. As the other werewolves gather to see him, Astrid arrives, understanding the full gravity of the situation. Back at the house, Sally finally reveals that Josh owned a pie shop in the alternate timeline, and he was miserable. Nora is still wary about staying in the house because of all that has happened. Aidan goes to Suzanna to reveal that he is Kenny's sire and he asks her for time to rein him in rather than kill him. She gives him two months' time, otherwise she will take care of him herself, and Aidan as well. At the house, Aidan asks Sally's advice on what to do concerning Suzanna, and her advice is just to let her go, awkwardly, not telling him what she knows, but still trying to let him know Suzanna is not the right woman for him. Suddenly, Astrid rings their doorbell, revealing Josh is captured. At the funeral home, a new body comes in, but they are unaware that Suzanna is hiding within the bodybag. Aidan, Sally, and Nora go to save Josh, as the house is empty. Kenny goes back to the funeral home and is subdued by Suzanna using juniper, who has already staked all his workers. Aidan, Sally, and Nora find Josh locked up in the basement and they free him, but not before several of the werewolves come to stop them. Nora takes Josh to safety while Aidan fights the werewolves. Sally stays behind, despite Aidan's protests, and as he is overwhelmed and about to be staked by Mark, she possesses Andrew, giving Aidan a chance to fight back. With Sally's help, Aidan beats the werewolves, leaving everyone but \"Shit Brickhouse\" standing. Sally possesses him and makes out with Aidan as they did in her memories of the other timeline. As they leave, Aidan wants to know why Sally did what she did, but as he answers a text from Kenny, she dissipates before she can tell him anything. He arrives at the funeral home to see Suzanna standing over Kenny's body. Aidan realizes that everything Suzanna has been doing is because of her deep guilt over killing Isaac. She poisons him with juniper and tries to make him stake Kenny, but in his last bit of strength and clarity he stakes her. Back at the house, Nora reveals Josh is fine but Sally is unresponsive. Aidan wants to know why she has done what she did, and Nora reveals to him that Sally loves him. Sally soon comes to her senses, but she wakes up in the room in which she saw \"Lil' Smokie\" get sacrificed to the witches in her first trip back in time.\n |LineColor = 056444\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 4)\n |EpisodeNumber = 50\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 11\n |Title = Ramona the Pest\n |DirectedBy = Jeff Renfroe\n |WrittenBy = Chris Dingess\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|24}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-70\n |Viewers = 0.99<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/03/25/monday-cable-ratings-monday-night-raw-leads-night-basketball-wives-single-ladies-fast-n-loud-teen-wolf-more/247623/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Monday Night RAW' Leads Night + 'Basketball Wives', 'Single Ladies', 'Fast N Loud', 'Teen Wolf' & More|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Sally wakes up in the bedroom in which she saw \"Lil' Smokie\" get sacrificed. As she wonders how she arrived, as she did not use magic, she soon realizes that she can hear Josh and Nora, who has stayed in the house waiting for Josh to convalesce, arguing nearby. She emerges from the closet, surprising all three of them. Downstairs, Aidan is asleep, when he feels Sally wake him. He is amazed that they can touch each other, and they begin to passionately kiss, until he is woken from his dream by Nora searching for a sledgehammer. Aidan breaks through the closet into the other room, and Sally tells them this is where she saw a girl get sacrificed. Aidan can smell that someone has died in the room, and spots a blood stain with fresh scratch marks in it. Before they can investigate further, Sally's father comes to the door to tell them that he has sold the house, and they have to move out by Monday. Aidan throws away several of his old belongings, and at Sally's urging, he reveals that he no longer has anything to tie him to his past, and dismisses attempting a relationship with Sally as both of them have bad histories with relationships, even though she reveals that they loved each other during her time traveling. He later goes to speak with Kenny, who has just ended an argument with Astrid about running away together, and he offers to help Kenny fake his death so he can run away, but he asks Aidan to ask Josh and Nora to talk Astrid into it. However, Josh is apprehensive about having Kenny and Astrid run away together, and they argue over what they really want out of everything, even though Sally tries to get them to stop, when all three are distracted by the ghost of a little girl. Sally realizes she is the girl she saw get sacrificed, and she introduces herself as Ramona, the twin sister to Beatrice. Ramona tells them that she has always been in the room, and has grown attached to them even though she could not speak with them. Sally convinces Aidan to talk to Beatrice, who works as a county clerk, but she and Aidan argue about their relationship and the future they may have, all while Aidan looks like he is talking to nobody. Back at the house, Ramona is worried about Josh and the others leaving, when she says Nora has arrived. Josh wants to turn with Nora that night, but Nora is still worried about him and his wolf and has only come so she can speak with Astrid. Josh goes back upstairs to pack, and Nora answers the door for Astrid, but Astrid pulls a gun on her, as the pack has decided to take Josh back by force. Josh tries to go downstairs to save her, but Ramona traps him in the room, as she knows it is not safe for anyone, until Josh changes. Mark and Andrew prepare to take Josh back by force, but the door swings open to reveal Josh has fully transformed. At the clerical office, Aidan's turn has come and he talks to Beatrice, but as soon as he reveals Ramona to her, she calls security to drag him out, horrified by the revelation. Aidan and Sally return home to see the bloodbath, Josh having killed all of the werewolves who came to take him back, including Astrid. Josh and Nora hurry out of the house to the woods, with Aidan promising to take care of things. Josh and Nora head to the campsite that they originally lived during the three-month period where Josh was trapped, because Sally has come up with an idea. While Nora locks herself up in the shed, she enters Josh's mind before he changes. She discovers Josh in his mind, as she knows the only way to solve things is to find the part of Josh that is missing, otherwise the wolf will take over, once more. Josh knows full well the other part of him that is missing, and it is his wolf, that he runs away from. At the house, Aidan has called on Kenny to have a clean up, lying to him that the pack killed Astrid on their own before coming to the house and Josh turning on them. In reality, he has hidden Astrid's corpse upstairs in Ramona's room. He tells Kenny that the only thing left for him is to leave Boston for good. In Josh's mind, Sally sees the futility of his plan of running away from the wolf and hiding during the change, but Sally makes him stand his ground, first by creating a happy place for himself to make the confrontation, the house. With Sally's encouragement, Josh confronts his wolf, telling him that he must live his life, and the wolf only gets the full moon to live. A peace is finally made between Josh and his wolf, who leaves on his own accord. The next morning, Nora finds Josh sitting by himself at the camper, and she realizes that he is finally back to being himself, as Sally watches them from afar. In the hidden room, Aidan puts Astrid's corpse into a body bag to dispose of her, and Ramona asks why he did not let the others take her, and he admits that she was special, but asks her to not bother him anymore, but she is gone. As he leaves the room, he does not notice that there are now fifteen scratch marks in the old bloodstain, when before there were only six. Josh, Nora, and Sally return to the house to find it spotless, and reveals the lie he told Kenny to them, so they can cover for each other. Josh thanks him for keeping him safe, and Sally informs him that he must always confront the wolf, or the wolf will win. In the funeral home, Kenny grieves, when he is visited by Astrid's ghost. She reveals to him that the pack turned on her and forced her to help them take Josh back, and Josh was the one who killed her.\n |LineColor = 056444\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 4)\n |EpisodeNumber = 51\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 12\n |Title = House Hunting\n |DirectedBy = Jeff Renfroe\n |WrittenBy = Lisa Randolph\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|31}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-71\n |Viewers = 1.05<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/04/01/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-wins-night-t-i-and-tiny-black-ink-crew-bates-motel-archer-dallas-more/249790/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE Raw' Wins Night, 'T.I. and Tiny', 'Black Ink Crew', 'Bates Motel', 'Archer', 'Being Human', 'Dallas' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=April 1, 2014|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan visits Kenny to help him prepare for his leaving Boston, but Kenny is not ready now that Astrid is dead, and is suspicious now that he knows Aidan lied to him. However, he gives Aidan the keys to the van so they may all pack. Aidan returns to the house to find Josh, Nora, and Sally with Ramona. As they all plan on leaving, Sally pledges to stay behind, for a bit, to ensure Ramona passes on, but before she can reveal this to her, Ramona disappears. Nora asks Josh why he no longer writes in his \"werewolf\" journal, with Josh saying because the curse was lifted the first time, he no longer needs to keep track of his symptoms. Nora believes he should keep it, and they plan on moving into her old apartment together. Downstairs, after Sally laments the fact that Nora may have sold her favorite pair of tights, Aidan proposes that she \"haunt\" him in the RV in the woods. However, Ramona expresses jealousy that the four are leaving without her. The four argue over belongings, such as the microwave as the popcorn setting is apparently perfect for blood, but they are actually arguing over who gets to keep the \"Dog Man Cat Dude\" statue, with the group ultimately deciding that Josh and Nora get it, but Aidan and Sally get \"visitation rights\". However, their happiness is disrupted by Beatrice's arrival. Beatrice attempts to warn the group about Ramona's true nature. She reveals her parents joined a cult shortly before herself and her twin were born, and they were granted an audience with [[Paimon]], one of the Kings of Hell. Her parents doted upon her, but kept her sister locked up in a hidden room, and never actually named her, and on one night after they had turned ten, Ramona was sacrificed to the devil. The group realizes something more is up when Ramona makes herself known, and Beatrice can still see her. Ramona, however, is furious at Beatrice as she believes her sister let her die, and she kills Beatrice in front of them. All four attempt to escape the house, but each is thrown into a separate room. Aidan finds himself in the basement with the ghost of Henry, who attempts to get Aidan to kill himself so he can become a ghost with Sally. Josh is in the kitchen with the ghost of Julia, who tries to get him to commit suicide so he can save Nora from an inevitable death. Nora is in the bedroom with Emily, who has fallen off the wagon and tries to get Nora to leave Josh as he is hiding something from her. And Sally discovers herself in the bathroom with Kat, who can apparently see Sally perfectly fine, and taunts her over her relationship with Aidan. Sally sees through the ruse first and realizes Ramona is making everyone see things. Sally confronts her, and she simply rebuffs Sally's idea that she is a ghost as well, and simply states that no one has a chance of leaving the house alive, and reveals that she is not trapped in the house but is the house itself. \"Henry\" continues to try to get Aidan to kill himself, as does \"Julia\", but Josh refuses and is rushed at by \"Julia\". Nora reads from the journal, which allegedly has a new entry, as \"Emily\" says that she must leave Josh for the well being of their unborn child, a fact that Nora has not revealed to anyone yet. As Ramona reveals how she has done everything to keep the group in the house, Sally realizes that she had a hand in killing Robbie, and realizes that she is trying to kill the others. Sally manages to get into the bedroom and manages to dispel Ramona's illusion, freeing Nora to go downstairs to help Josh while Sally goes to Aidan. Sally manages to stop Aidan from staking himself, and gets rid of the illusion of Henry. Upstairs, Josh is horrified by the sight of Nora's body on the ground, her throat slashed by the silver knife \"Julia\" attempted to get him to kill himself with. He prepares to kill himself until the real Nora arrives and gets Josh to see through the illusion. Everyone regroups and tries to leave through the backdoor, but are only trapped in the room with Ramona. Sally reveals to them that Ramona is the personification of the house's evil, and that she wants them trapped forever, if not dead. She taunts Ramona, saying that neither of them have killed each other, but Ramona simply says she has time, as she lets Kenny into the house, and Aidan out of the room, but keeping the others trapped. Kenny reveals to Aidan that he knows he is protecting Josh, but Aidan does his best to try to convince Kenny that seeking revenge solves nothing. The two fight, but just as Kenny is to stake Aidan through the heart, Aidan manages to turn it on Kenny. He does his best to try to get Kenny out of the situation alive, but Kenny compels him to believe that Josh has made Sally disappear and dies. Ramona lets everyone else out of the hidden room, and Sally realizes that when the other timeline's Donna sent her back to the normal timeline, she saw these exact events unfold: Aidan killing Josh in mourning over her.

She warns Josh that this will end with his death and it is because of Kenny unless she can do something, and she gets an idea. She opens the door to the basement but before Aidan can attack, she slams him into the wall with psychic powers. After she gets Nora and Josh to lift him into the bed, she performs one last spell. Aidan wakes up and can feel his heartbeat for the first time in centuries. Sally has sacrificed herself to bring him back to life, and she thanks all of them for all they have done before disappearing into nothingness. Ramona, however, is angry that Sally is gone, and attacks them, blowing out all the windows in the house, but the three manage to escape to Nora's apartment. Aidan is amazed that he is alive, but is sure that Sally is gone for good. After getting him his first real food in over 200 years, Aidan lets the two of them live together and he will stay in the RV as they had originally planned. However, after a night of drunkenness and sorrow, Aidan wakes up and realizes something is off. At the house, a construction worker enters and tries to get work done, but is distracted by Ramona. At the RV, Aidan looks in the mirror and sees that he has rapidly aged over night. The construction worker follows Ramona up to her hidden room, and she kills him with a shard of glass, planning on using him to get to the others. At the hospital, Nora presents Aidan with test results, showing that his organs are slowly failing as his age catches up with him. Both are hesitant to tell Josh of the truth, and when it does happen, Aidan accidentally reveals that Nora is pregnant with his child. Later, Aidan visits Sally's grave, leaving a rose behind, and goes to a bar in town, watching as he sees a new vampire try to get a date and meal. Aidan stops him, and demands that he turn him back into a vampire. At Nora's apartment, Josh tells her he plans on opening a diner to work in, but also is worried that he should get medication because of everything that has happened. Nora assures him she trusts in him, regardless of the wolf. Josh drives into town and finds Aidan getting attacked, but not fighting back, and the vampire leaves. Aidan finally admits that he is afraid of dying, because he feels that there is no good end for him with his centuries of monstrosities, but Josh just tells him that he is simply being human. The next morning, Josh drops off breakfast and the newspaper for Aidan, who is planning on seeing everything in Boston before he dies, but he instead happens upon the death of the construction worker in their old house. Aidan has an idea to end things for good, and demands that Josh not get involved, as he has a future with Nora and his child. Josh insists, and Aidan tells him to drop him off for now and meet him in the house in an hour. However, Aidan is planning on taking care of things by himself. He drops some bags off downstairs, and heads upstairs to try to find Ramona, finding his old leather jacket first, before finding her. She taunts him about how he will probably go to hell, and there is nothing that he can do to stop her because her creation was not one of Catholicism so any plans he may have to exorcise her are fruitless. Instead, he taunts her back that nothing she has planned for them will work, and she attacks him, planning on choking him with blood, before throwing him down the stairs, just as Sally died originally. He lands just as she did, but with his final breaths he ignites a cigarette lighter, throwing it onto a puddle of gasoline he had spilled earlier. As the house burns down, so does Ramona's evil spirit, destroying her, and the house, for good. Josh and Nora return to find the house burnt to cinders and Aidan's corpse taken away by paramedics. They enter to survey the damage, only to see Aidan's ghost greet them. They offer to let him haunt them, but he feels he should see the world first, until Josh and Nora tell him his Door has arrived. As he enters through it, he is greeted by Sally's soul, and the two embrace for the first time, as they both pass on to the other side.\n----\nJosh, Nora, Sally, and Aidan appear to celebrate their lives together, in laughter and love, just as Josh wakes up with Nora at his side in a field. When he tells Nora of his dream, she says she saw the same thing, and Josh believes that somewhere in the afterlife Aidan and Sally are making these dreams for them, of a life spent together. Both worry what time it is, with Nora worrying about the pies they have baking, and Josh \"worries\" about their children. Nora picks up their baby daughter playing nearby, calling her Sally, while Josh calls out for Aidan, suddenly being caught in a game of tag with their young son.\n |LineColor = 056444\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb episodes|1595680|Being Human}}\n* {{Tv.com episodes|being-human|79700|Being Human}}\n* {{Epguides|BeingHuman_US|Being Human}}\n\n{{Being Human}}\n\n[[Category:Being Human (TV series) episodes|*]]\n[[Category:2014 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:2014 Canadian television seasons]]\n", "name_user": "Favre1fan93", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_Human_(North_American_season_4)"}

The various species of dogwood are [[native plant|native]] throughout much of [[temperateness|temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] Eurasia and North America, with China, Japan, and the southeastern United States being particularly rich in native species.\n\nSpecies include the common dogwood ''[[Cornus sanguinea]]'' of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood ''([[Cornus florida]])'' of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood ''[[Cornus nuttallii]]'' of western North America, the Kousa dogwood ''[[Cornus kousa]]'' of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), ''[[Cornus canadensis]]'' and ''[[Cornus suecica]]'' respectively.\n\nDepending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine [[genus|genera]] or [[subgenus|subgenera]]; a broadly inclusive genus ''Cornus'' is accepted here.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe name \"dog-tree\" entered the English vocabulary before 1548, becoming \"dogwood\" by 1614. Once the name dogwood was affixed to this kind of tree, it soon acquired a secondary name as the Hound's Tree, while the fruits came to be known as '''dogberries''' or '''houndberries''' (the latter a name also for the berries of [[Solanum nigrum|black nightshade]], alluding to [[Hecate|Hecate's]] hounds). Another theory advances the view that \"dogwood\" was derived from the [[Old English]] '''''dagwood'''''{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} (''*dagwood'' is a form which is unattested), from the use of the slender stems of its very hard [[wood]] for making sharp objects:<ref>{{cite web |title=dogwood |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/dogwood }}</ref> \"dags\" (daggers, skewers, and arrows).<ref name=vedel>Vedel, H., & Lange, J.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] uses \"whippletree\" in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (\"[[The Knight's Tale]]\", verse 2065) to refer to the dogwood. A [[whippletree (mechanism)|whippletree]] is also an element of the traction of a horse-drawn [[cart]], linking the drawpole of the cart to the harnesses of the horses in file; these items still bear the name of the tree from which they are commonly carved.[[File:2016-05-08 1452 Cherokee Princess dogwood.png|thumb|Cherokee Princess dogwood]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nDogwoods have simple, untoothed [[leaf|leaves]] with the [[leaf vein|veins]] curving distinctively as they approach the leaf margins. Most dogwood species have opposite leaves, while a few, such as ''Cornus alternifolia'' and ''C. controversa,'' have their leaves alternate. Dogwood [[flower]]s have four parts. In many species, the flowers are borne separately in open (but often dense) clusters, while in various other species (such as the [[flowering dogwood]]), the flowers themselves are tightly clustered, lacking showy [[petal]]s, but surrounded by four to six large, typically white petal-like [[bract]]s.\n\nThe [[fruit]]s of all dogwood species are [[drupe]]s with one or two seeds, often brightly colorful. The drupes of species in the subgenera ''Cornus'' are edible. Many are without much flavor. ''[[Cornus kousa]]'' and ''[[Cornus mas]]'' are sold commercially as edible fruit trees. The fruits of  ''Cornus kousa'' have a sweet, tropical pudding like flavor in addition to hard pits.  The fruits of ''Cornus mas'' are both tart and sweet when completely ripe. They have been eaten in Eastern Europe for centuries, both as food and medicine to fight colds and flus. They are very high in [[vitamin C]]. However, those of species in subgenus  ''Swida'' are mildly toxic to [[human|people]], though readily eaten by [[bird]]s.\n\nDogwoods are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some species of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], including the [[Pavonia pavonia|emperor moth]], [[the engrailed]], the [[small angle shades]], and the following case-bearers of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. ahenella'', ''C. salicivorella'' (recorded on ''Cornus canadensis''), ''C. albiantennaella'', ''C. cornella'' and ''C. cornivorella,'' with the latter three all feeding exclusively on ''Cornus.''\n\n==Uses==\nDogwoods are widely planted horticulturally, and the dense wood of the larger-stemmed species is valued for certain specialized purposes. Cutting boards and other fine turnings can be made from this fine grained and beautiful wood. Over 32 different varieties of game birds, including quail, feed on the red seeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Dogwood Trees|url=http://www.preppergarden.biz/Dogwood-Trees-for-Preppers-p/wld-dogwood.htm|publisher=Prepper Gardens|accessdate=January 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116024043/http://www.preppergarden.biz/Dogwood-Trees-for-Preppers-p/wld-dogwood.htm|archive-date=2013-11-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Horticulture===\nVarious species of ''Cornus,'' particularly the [[Cornus florida|flowering dogwood]] ''(Cornus florida),'' are ubiquitous in American [[garden]]s and [[landscape|landscaping]]; [[horticulture|horticulturist]] [[Donald Wyman]] stated, \"There is a dogwood for almost every part of the U.S. except the hottest and driest areas\".<ref>Wyman's Garden Encyclopedia, ''s.v.'' \"Cornus\"</ref> In contrast, in [[England]] the lack of sharp winters and hot summers makes ''Cornus florida'' very shy of flowering.<ref>Alice M. Coats, ''Garden Shrubs and their Histories'' (1964) 1992, ''s.v.'' \"Cornus\".</ref>\n\nOther ''Cornus'' species are [[stolon]]iferous shrubs that grow naturally in wet habitats and along waterways. Several of these are used along highways and in naturalizing landscape plantings, especially those species with bright red or bright yellow stems, particularly conspicuous in winter, such as ''[[Cornus stolonifera]]''.\n\nThe following [[cultivars]], of mixed or uncertain origin, have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]\u2019s [[Award of Garden Merit]] (confirmed 2017):<ref>{{cite web  | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 16 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 24 January 2018}}</ref> \n*\u2018Eddie\u2019s White Wonder\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/94390/i-Cornus-i-Eddie-s-White-Wonder/Details\n| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Cornus'' \u2018Eddie\u2019s White Wonder\u2019\n| accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n*\u2018Norman Hadden\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/30663/i-Cornus-i-Norman-Hadden/Details\n| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Cornus'' \u2018Norman Hadden\u2019\n| accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n*\u2018Ormonde\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/30654/i-Cornus-i-Ormonde/Details\n| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Cornus'' \u2018Ormonde\u2019\n| accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n*\u2018Porlock\u2019<ref>{{cite web \n| url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/103072/i-Cornus-i-Porlock/Details\n| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Cornus'' \u2018Porlock\u2019\n| accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fruits===\nThe species ''[[Cornus mas]]'' is commonly cultivated in southeastern Europe for its showy, edible berries, that have the color of the carnelian gemstone.

Dogwood wood is an excellent substitute for [[persimmon]] wood in the heads of certain [[golf|golf clubs]] (\"woods\"). Dogwood lumber is rare in that it is not readily available with any manufacturer and must be cut down by the person(s) wanting to use it.\n\nLarger items have also been occasionally made of dogwood, such as the screw-in basket-style wine or fruit presses. The first kinds of [[laminate]]d [[tennis racket]]s were also made from this wood, cut into thin strips.\n\nDogwood [[Teeth cleaning twig|twigs]] were used by U.S. pioneers to brush their teeth.

Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an [[Involucral bract|involucre]] of large, typically white petal-like [[bracts]], while others have more open clusters of [[petal]]-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are [[native plant|native]] throughout much of [[temperateness|temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] Eurasia and North America, with China, Japan, and the southeastern United States being particularly rich in native species.\n\nSpecies include the common dogwood ''[[Cornus sanguinea]]'' of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood ''([[Cornus florida]])'' of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood ''[[Cornus nuttallii]]'' of western North America, the Kousa dogwood ''[[Cornus kousa]]'' of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries), ''[[Cornus canadensis]]'' and ''[[Cornus suecica]]'' respectively.\n\nDepending on botanical interpretation, the dogwoods are variously divided into one to nine [[genus|genera]] or [[subgenus|subgenera]]; a broadly inclusive genus ''Cornus'' is accepted here.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe name \"dog-tree\" entered the English vocabulary before 1548, becoming \"dogwood\" by 1614. Once the name dogwood was affixed to this kind of tree, it soon acquired a secondary name as the Hound's Tree, while the fruits came to be known as '''dogberries''' or '''houndberries''' (the latter a name also for the berries of [[Solanum nigrum|black nightshade]], alluding to [[Hecate|Hecate's]] hounds). Another theory advances the view that \"dogwood\" was derived from the [[Old English]] '''''dagwood'''''{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} (''*dagwood'' is a form which is unattested), from the use of the slender stems of its very hard [[wood]] for making sharp objects:<ref>{{cite web |title=dogwood |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/dogwood }}</ref> \"dags\" (daggers, skewers, and arrows).<ref name=vedel>Vedel, H., & Lange, J.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] uses \"whippletree\" in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (\"[[The Knight's Tale]]\", verse 2065) to refer to the dogwood. A [[whippletree (mechanism)|whippletree]] is also an element of the traction of a horse-drawn [[cart]], linking the drawpole of the cart to the harnesses of the horses in file; these items still bear the name of the tree from which they are commonly carved.[[File:2016-05-08 1452 Cherokee Princess dogwood.png|thumb|Cherokee Princess dogwood]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nDogwoods have simple, untoothed [[leaf|leaves]] with the [[leaf vein|veins]] curving distinctively as they approach the leaf margins. Most dogwood species have opposite leaves, while a few, such as ''Cornus alternifolia'' and ''C. controversa,'' have their leaves alternate. Dogwood [[flower]]s have four parts. In many species, the flowers are borne separately in open (but often dense) clusters, while in various other species (such as the [[flowering dogwood]]), the flowers themselves are tightly clustered, lacking showy [[petal]]s, but surrounded by four to six large, typically white petal-like [[bract]]s.\n\nThe [[fruit]]s of all dogwood species are [[drupe]]s with one or two seeds, often brightly colorful. The drupes of species in the subgenera ''Cornus'' are edible. Many are without much flavor. ''[[Cornus kousa]]'' and ''[[Cornus mas]]'' are sold commercially as edible fruit trees. The fruits of  ''Cornus kousa'' have a sweet, tropical pudding like flavor in addition to hard pits.  The fruits of ''Cornus mas'' are both tart and sweet when completely ripe. They have been eaten in Eastern Europe for centuries, both as food and medicine to fight colds and flus. They are very high in [[vitamin C]]. However, those of species in subgenus  ''Swida'' are mildly toxic to [[human|people]], though readily eaten by [[bird]]s.\n\nDogwoods are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some species of [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], including the [[Pavonia pavonia|emperor moth]], [[the engrailed]], the [[small angle shades]], and the following case-bearers of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. ahenella'', ''C. salicivorella'' (recorded on ''Cornus canadensis''), ''C. albiantennaella'', ''C. cornella'' and ''C. cornivorella,'' with the latter three all feeding exclusively on ''Cornus.''\n\n==Uses==\nDogwoods are widely planted horticulturally, and the dense wood of the larger-stemmed species is valued for certain specialized purposes. Cutting boards and other fine turnings can be made from this fine grained and beautiful wood. Over 32 different varieties of game birds, including quail, feed on the red seeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Dogwood Trees|url=http://www.preppergarden.biz/Dogwood-Trees-for-Preppers-p/wld-dogwood.htm|publisher=Prepper Gardens|accessdate=January 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116024043/http://www.preppergarden.biz/Dogwood-Trees-for-Preppers-p/wld-dogwood.htm|archive-date=2013-11-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Horticulture===\nVarious species of ''Cornus,'' particularly the [[Cornus florida|flowering dogwood]] ''(Cornus florida),'' are ubiquitous in American [[garden]]s and [[landscape|landscaping]]; [[horticulture|horticulturist]] [[Donald Wyman]] stated, \"There is a dogwood for almost every part of the U.S. except the hottest and driest areas\".<ref>Wyman's Garden Encyclopedia, ''s.v.'' \"Cornus\"</ref> In contrast, in [[England]] the lack of sharp winters and hot summers makes ''Cornus florida'' very shy of flowering.<ref>Alice M. Coats, ''Garden Shrubs and their Histories'' (1964) 1992, ''s.v.'' \"Cornus\".</ref>\n\nOther ''Cornus'' species are [[stolon]]iferous shrubs that grow naturally in wet habitats and along waterways.

The couple have been trying to recover Sally from Limbo, ultimately contacting a medium who at first refuses to help, but finally directs them to Donna, a witch who demands $2,000, Sally's body, and the heart of someone they have killed (they choose Ray). In Limbo, Sally, Nick and Stevie have been trying unsuccessfully to escape Limbo's version of the brownstone when finally Donna's spell releases them. Sally awakes in her human body, fearing that her friends may have woken in their coffins. Elsewhere, Aidan, underground in his coffin, is rescued by Atlee, who reveals that an influenza virus not deadly to humans has killed almost all vampires, including Mother. Atlee is bringing Aidan to the Dutch, who believe his pure blood will cure them. Aidan attempts to overpower Atlee, but Atlee is stronger and drains him of blood. On the way to the Dutch, Atlee, not cured, turns to dust. The car crashes, and Aidan is ejected. As he lies on the ground in pain, visions of Josh and Sally tell him maybe it is his time to die, but he resolves to fight through the pain and live. Elsewhere, Donna performs an incantation in the woods, leading her to where Josh and Nora buried Ray's corpse.

He turns up at the storage unit where Nora is about to lock herself in for the full moon and questions her about Connor and Brynn, then locks himself in with her so they can turn together and he can better judge her truthfulness. At the brownstone, Josh and Sally see Nick and Stevie off on their new lives, and get a call from Aidan, who is surprised that Sally is corporeal and Josh is no longer a werewolf. Josh takes Sally for a night on the town, and reveals he intends to propose to Nora. An old high school friend, Trent, recognizes Sally, though Donna had warned her to see no one from her past. She tells him she faked her death to escape Danny, they hit it off, and later Sally takes him home, but he feels an apprehension he cannot explain, and leaves. Aidan needs blood, and his old source Tracy, who now carries the vampire-killing flu virus, sends him to the black market for pure blood, but the werewolves who have taken over Boston entrap him. Henry appears, saves him, and brings him home to feed on his girlfriend Emma who is infection-free. Aidan realizes that Emma is under compulsion, and refuses to feed. Later an angry Henry discovers that Aidan has let Emma escape, as Aidan promises they will find a new way to survive. At the brownstone the next morning Josh and Sally hear sirens outside, and see Trent's lifeless body being loaded into a body bag. The reason for Donna's warning is now apparent; if Sally sees someone from her past life, they die.

Aidan and Henry hunt for clean blood. Josh refuses to identify flu-free patients for them, but changes his mind. A patient file piques his interest. The patient, Erin, tells Josh she was scratched by a strange dog during the last full moon, and Josh realizes she was attacked by a werewolf and will turn on the next full moon only a day away. The social services worker arrives to take Erin to a foster home, but Josh and Nora claim she has been abused and must stay at the hospital. They decide to take her in and tell her the truth. She doesn't believe it at first, but Josh convinces her with a video of his transformation. Josh gives Aidan the address of a flu-free patient, and he and Henry track the man down. Struggling with an over-eager Henry, Aidan sees a tell tale sign that Henry has ingested virus-tainted blood. He invites Henry to drink his untainted blood, but Henry refuses, saying everyone who Aidan loves ends up dead, and goes off to die alone. Sally, upset over Trent's death, heads to the funeral home where Trent is being prepared for his funeral service, and tries to help his ghost get his Door. He thinks his fianc\u00e9e Candice needs to be told about his infidelity, so Sally tells Candice, only for Candice to reveal she has been cheating on Trent for a year. Candice feels better, however Trent is still without his Door. Max, the undertaker, tells Sally he admires her for bringing comfort to Candice; Sally finds him charming. In the woods, Nora and Erin prepare to turn, with Josh for support. When she turns, Erin tries to attack Josh, who holds his ground until Nora transforms and puts Erin in her place. At the funeral home, Trent finally sees his Door appear. He passes through only to find himself in Donna's soup kitchen. Donna says she is happy to have her \"first delivery\", and that it took awhile for Sally to give in to the urge to see someone from her past. Trent is incredulous that he will spend eternity in the kitchen, but Donna says he will in fact not spend eternity anywhere, and uses an iron meat cleaver to slice through his spirit, turning it to a pile of dust.

When Aidan wakes up, Josh reprimands him for the party, and wants to talk about Henry, but Aidan says he is fine, and no longer needs Josh's help in finding clean blood. Josh wants Aidan to get his job back, since they are strapped for cash after raising Sally from the dead, sending money to Ray's wife and son, and getting a new car after Erin destroyed the old one, but Aidan isn't ready. Sally awakes from a nightmare where people from her past recognize her and die, and talking with Erin she expresses the desire for a new identity. That night, Aidan takes Sally out on the town to a tough bar where he knows no one will know her, also hoping to find a new victim. At the bar, Sally quizzes Aidan and discovers vampires who wish to acquire new identities often assume those of dead children. Aidan ditches Sally to attack a burly biker, leaving him for dead. At Nora's family home Josh meets her father Robert, younger brother R.J., and mother Lynette. Both Josh and Erin, brought along so they can keep an eye on her, notice something off about the family. Alone, Nora reveals to Josh that she killed Brynn after they fought. Josh forgives her, and later asks Robert's permission to marry Nora. Back at the house, Aidan dreams about everyone he has lost, and awakes to find Sally holding a stake to his heart. Holding back tears, she asks why he has a death wish when he finally has all he wanted, and he admits that he has been selfish. He regains his resolve, and signs up at the hospital for nursing duty. R.J. arrives at the brownstone, drunk, telling Nora about Josh's wish to marry her, but she doesn't believe it, and leaves to get coffee to sober him up. Josh returns to find R.J. making out with Erin, is enraged that R.J. is hitting on a 15-year-old, and a fist fight ensues, just as Nora returns. Later Josh discovers Erin has run away. At the funeral home, Sally searches death certificates to find a child's identity to steal when Max walks in. She says she needs a means to leave, and Max offers her a job as an undertaker, for cash.

Sally hears another ghost talking and discovers it is Linda, Max's mother, who keeps watch over him. During dinner at the house, Linda makes comments throughout the evening. When Sally says goodnight to Max, she leans in for a kiss, but he is befuddled and leaves quickly. At the hospital, Aidan, with Beth and Holly taunting him, gives in to temptation and takes a blood sample from Kenny to drink. On the way home he is attacked by werewolves, but repels them, as Liam watches from the shadows. When Nurse Kerwin arrives to take more blood, Kenny begins to wonder about Aidan, and tries various tests on him, finally asking outright if Aidan is a vampire, but Aidan laughs it off. At the funeral home, Max apologizes to Sally about the night before, and they become intimate. Linda reappears, calling Sally a slut. Sally seems to dump Max and quit her job, but then wakes up to discover that it was Linda, who had taken over her body. Sally consults Zoe, who lends her a Soul Lock pendant that will bind Sally's spirit to her body, preventing Linda from taking over. Sally, protected by the Soul Lock, returns to the funeral home and prepares to exorcise Linda, who admits she only wants Max to be happy. Sally helps her see the futility of her methods, meets with Max again, apologizes for \"her\" actions earlier and asks if they can start over. They kiss while Linda looks on happily.

Josh and Nora go to an open house, and after the real estate agent leaves them alone, Josh proposes, and Nora accepts. At the funeral home, Sally is impressed with the embalmer's wax that Max uses on a corpse he is preparing. She tries to take some, but Max catches her, and she reveals the truth about her previous death and decomposing sore. Appalled that she is technically a zombie, he flees. Later he comes around, accepts Sally for who she is, and helps her cover up her sores. At Kat's workplace, Liam and his men approach Aidan and Kat.

She walks him to his RV, expressing the hope that they will meet again. Sally is getting worse; when she brushes her teeth, the toothbrush pierces her cheek and a tooth falls out. In the kitchen, she watches as a mouse is caught in a trap, gives in to temptation, and eats it. Later she finds her cheek and scalp restored. Sally tells Nick she has eaten a mouse, and he confirms that eating freshly killed creatures is the only way to stave off decomposition. Zoe tells Sally that Nick has bitten her, and has been looking at her strangely since. At the hospital, Aidan tells Kenny he will not be able to turn him now that he is dying of the virus and Blake arrives to reclaim Kenny for herself. Josh tries to ease Aidan's final night. Aidan loses consciousness, flashing back to when Suzanna took care of him. Pete arrives, taking up Nora's invitation. He reveals he had the same problems that Josh had after his change, but improved after he accepted Gordon, his wolf, as part of himself through meditation. He leads the other two in a meditation, and helps Josh realize that his wolf is afraid of him. Aidan wakes from another dream of Suzanna to find Josh and Sally at his side. He suffers a seizure, bleeding from his eyes and mouth, and Josh and Sally believe it is the end. However next morning, they are all surprised to find that he is healthy. Aidan believes his cure is the result of drinking Josh's werewolf blood two years prior and Erin's blood during the assassination attempt. He later offers Blake the cure, stressing that only enough blood should be taken so both live, if she promises that Kenny, Josh and Nora are off limits to the vampires. Later that night, Blake lays a trap with dozens of other vampires who plan to drink from a werewolf to cure the virus. Aidan recalls Suzanna imploring him to pursue love, should he find it in the future. He goes to the university to see Kat, embracing and kissing her passionately.

Aidan nearly lets it slip that the author is indeed his father, but their attention is soon drawn to Jeff Westin, Kat's ex-boyfriend and former college professor who has brought along his newest girlfriend, Marissa. Later at Kat's house, Aidan and Kat become intimate. Sally and Josh find Stevie at his parents' house. At first he claims he ran out of money and came home, and that his family is away, but when Josh finds a severed arm in the breadbox, Stevie admits his parents died as a result of seeing him, and he's been eating their dead corpses, but the arm in the breadbox is the mailman's. Stevie asks for help him kill himself, as he has tried and failed. Eventually Josh, knowing that he is too far-gone, tells Sally to leave and does the deed. Stevie's ghost arrives to thank them. His Door appears and Sally sees the same gilded clamshell and realizes something is wrong since ghosts' Doors are never the same, but Stevie passes through before she can stop him. Josh arrives at the RV to find Pete being attacked by vampires seeking the blood cure. Josh tries to save him and is almost killed, but Pete calls out Josh's name, and recognizing it they leave him alone. Aidan, in a flashback, sees Suzanna in labor, as he begs God to let their child live.

With everything falling apart around them, Nora suggests to Josh that they get married soon before Sally dies. Josh's sister Emily takes Josh, Kenny, and Aidan to a strip club for Josh's bachelor party. A figure watches Aidan from across the room. A stripper, Sadie, gives Josh a lap dance in a private room, but she turns out to be a vampire seeking Josh's werewolf blood, and Aidan stakes her through the heart. Emily and Kenny see the whole thing, and Josh reveals the truth about their natures. Emily, upset, storms off. With Kenny resting after Aidan's bite, Josh and Aidan reconcile their differences. Aidan tells Sally that Ilana Myers may know how to fight Donna, and allows Sally to eat his flesh to satisfy her hunger by taking a bite from his stomach. Ilana thinks the clamshell Door must lead to somewhere on Earth rather than to the next world, and that Sally will not be able to escape it either, though once she passes through she may be able to fight back. Sally is reluctant, but Ilana says she must be very powerful, since she has survived an exorcism, and come back from the dead bringing two souls back with her. Ilana grabs an old book off of a shelf, asks how good Sally is at Latin, and prepares her to learn some magic of her own. Aidan leaves the house, still sore from Sally's bite, when the hooded figure from the strip club attacks him. After a fight, Aidan manages to stake the other man, a disfigured vampire. As he crumbles away, he asks why Aidan has done this to him, and Aidan realizes the vampire is Kat's ex-boyfriend Jeff Westin. Ray wakes Ilana, seeking to know what she has told Sally.

The couple have been trying to recover Sally from Limbo, ultimately contacting a medium who at first refuses to help, but finally directs them to Donna, a witch who demands $2,000, Sally's body, and the heart of someone they have killed (they choose Ray). In Limbo, Sally, Nick and Stevie have been trying unsuccessfully to escape Limbo's version of the brownstone when finally Donna's spell releases them. Sally awakes in her human body, fearing that her friends may have woken in their coffins. Elsewhere, Aidan, underground in his coffin, is rescued by Atlee, who reveals that an influenza virus not deadly to humans has killed almost all vampires, including Mother. Atlee is bringing Aidan to the Dutch, who believe his pure blood will cure them. Aidan attempts to overpower Atlee, but Atlee is stronger and drains him of blood. On the way to the Dutch, Atlee, not cured, turns to dust. The car crashes, and Aidan is ejected.

At the brownstone, Josh and Sally see Nick and Stevie off on their new lives, and get a call from Aidan, who is surprised that Sally is corporeal and Josh is no longer a werewolf. Josh takes Sally for a night on the town, and reveals he intends to propose to Nora. An old high school friend, Trent, recognizes Sally, though Donna had warned her to see no one from her past. She tells him she faked her death to escape Danny, they hit it off, and later Sally takes him home, but he feels an apprehension he cannot explain, and leaves. Aidan needs blood, and his old source Tracy, who now carries the vampire-killing flu virus, sends him to the black market for pure blood, but the werewolves who have taken over Boston entrap him.

Later an angry Henry discovers that Aidan has let Emma escape, as Aidan promises they will find a new way to survive. At the brownstone the next morning Josh and Sally hear sirens outside, and see Trent's lifeless body being loaded into a body bag.

Aidan tells Sally that Ilana Myers may know how to fight Donna, and allows Sally to eat his flesh to satisfy her hunger by taking a bite from his stomach. Ilana thinks the clamshell Door must lead to somewhere on Earth rather than to the next world, and that Sally will not be able to escape it either, though once she passes through she may be able to fight back.

Kat arrives to attend the ceremony, which Aiden will officiate. Nora discovers that Sally hasn't got long to live and they decide to postpone the wedding. As her death draws near Sally begins to feel afraid, and Aidan walks her through it, assuaging her fears as she passes away. It is only a few moments later that she feels herself awake, a ghost once more. Aiden pulls the heart from Sally's corpse, believing it will be the perfect weapon to use against Donna's black magic. Josh says his goodbyes to Nora, as the three friends go through the clamshell Door. They awake in what appears to be the soup kitchen, but Josh can see Sally perfectly, as they are now in some alternate pocket dimension that Donna calls home. Donna has brought Ray to protect her; Josh battles the wolf while Aiden and Sally confront Donna, with Sally reciting the incantation she got from Ilana; while it does have some effect, Donna reveals it was only a \"true face\" spell. Josh manages to behead Ray, killing him once and for all. Donna is starving and prepares to eat Sally's spirit, while commending her on fighting back. Aidan throws Sally's heart into a flame Donna has made, and it begins to immolate Donna. However, Donna uses the flames to return the source of the magical pain to Sally, whose spirit goes up in flames. Sally says she loves Aidan and Josh before Donna uses a cleaver to disperse her spirit, ingesting the dust it has left behind. Gloating over her victory, Donna radiates a bright light; then screams in agony and suddenly Josh, Aidan, and Sally's spirit are back in the bedroom, and they realize they have won. Josh says that they should postpone the wedding until after the full moon so he can properly see Sally, but Emily arrives, having come to terms with the gang's supernatural nature, and insists they have the wedding that day as planned. Later, in a cabin in the woods, Josh and Nora enjoy their honeymoon bed. When the fire dies low, Nora decides to get some more firewood, but as she exits the cabin, Liam confronts her.\n |LineColor = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 39\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n |Title = Ruh\u2013Roh\n |DirectedBy = Stefan Pleszczynski\n |WrittenBy = Anna Fricke\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|4|8}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-58\n |Viewers = 1.07<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/04/09/monday-cable-ratings-monday-night-raw-wins-night-teen-mom-2-mtv-movie-sneak-peek-bates-motel-more/177080/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Monday Night RAW' Wins Night + 'Teen Mom 2', 'MTV Movie Sneak Peek', 'Bates Motel' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = At gunpoint, Liam takes Josh and Nora to a warehouse in Boston, showing them a nest of the strange new vampires created after the flu-cursed vampires drank too much werewolf blood. Liam says they kill without conscience, even young children. Liam wants to make a family with Josh and Nora, but they refuse, and Nora reveals she killed Brynn. Back at the house, Kenny has woken up, screaming in terror at what he has become. Kat discovers Sally's corpse and runs away. Aiden confesses to Sally he has long wanted a family, in part due to what happened to his wife and son (shown in flashbacks). Learning of Kenny, Liam locks Josh and Nora with the feral vampires and returns to the brownstone to kill him in revenge. Josh and Nora escape, burning the vampires away, and arrive just in time to stop Liam, but Aiden is the one to kill him, which will leave Josh a wolf forever. The ravenous Kenny drinks from Nora, and would have killed her if Josh had not stopped him. Josh admits to Nora that he now feels closer to his wolf than before, particularly after the event with Donna. Aiden has Blake compel Kat so that she forgets what she has seen. Aidan takes Kenny out to the woods, and Kenny realizes that it is the end, and that he had no control of himself. After another flashback to Suzanna's death, Aidan screams at Kenny to run away. Several days pass and it is now the morning following the full moon. Sally discovers that Donna is now spiritually connected to her; after arguing, Donna's ghost drags Sally into a bottomless chasm. Aidan is walking in town, passing by a cab that comes to a halt. As he walks off in the other direction, a woman identical to his wife Suzanna steps out of the cab, seemingly following the same path as Aidan. In the woods, Nora awakes from the previous night's full moon, but cannot find Josh. She looks around, wondering where he is, and when she finds him, he is still a wolf.

Rodman was published<ref>https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/the-great-eastern/</ref> on June 4, 2019, by [[Melville House Publishing]]. \n\nIt is a sprawling adventure set in the 1850s-1870s in New York, London, Paris, India, and the North Atlantic. The story pits two of literature's most iconic anti-heroes against each other: [[Captain Nemo]] and [[Captain Ahab]]. Caught between them is real-life British engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], builder of the century's greatest ship, {{SS|Great Eastern}}. Brunel is kidnapped by Nemo to help design a submarine with which to fight the laying of the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], which links the two colonialist forces Nemo hates, England and the US. Brunel finds himself going up against his own ship, and the strange man hired to protect it, Captain Ahab.\n\nIn March 2019, the film rights to ''The Great Eastern'' were acquired by the UK film company Great Point Media, and Rodman was commissioned to write the screen adaptation.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Howard A.

Nora moves in with Josh, Aidan, and Sally, and while unable to see her, convinces Sally to attend her high school reunion. As the full moon approaches, Nora starts asking Josh things about what he goes through, fearing that she too is now a werewolf. Sally attends her reunion, meeting with her high school friend Stevie Adkins who committed suicide their junior year, and Diane Alcott, the vapid prom queen who died on a missionary trip in Africa. When Diane ignores Stevie, even in death, Sally confronts her, leading to Diane having a revelation and her Door appearing to send her to the other side. Upset as she missed her Door, Stevie consoles her by telling her that she can still dream in death. When she is alone that night, she sleeps and has a dream where she sees her door. When she opens it, she is attacked by some unknown dark force, causing her to abruptly wake up and find herself floating several feet in the air. Aidan appears before the council of vampires at the Halloway Hotel and Mother who decides that Bishop's \"orphans\" are to be culled and Aidan will be the second-in-command to her own daughter who will control Boston. She also adds that if Aidan is successful in grooming her daughter, he will be free of the council. That night, Nora drops Josh off in the woods so he can transform, and when she begins to hear his transformation, she is relieved that she has not been infected until she doubles over in pain and begins to transform, as well. As she is trapped in the car and calling out to him, Josh is shot at by Heggeman who has been tasked by Mother to kill him to remove any distractions to keep Aidan focused on her daughter. As Heggeman lifts the gun to shoot Josh again, the screen cuts to black, and a shot is heard.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?\n |DirectedBy = [[Paolo Barzman]]\n |WrittenBy = Nancy Won\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|1|23}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-35\n |Viewers = 1.65<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/24/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-rules-pretty-little-liars-love-hip-hop-rise-being-human-lost-girl-wwe-raw-more/117525/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Rules, 'Pretty Little Liars,' Love & Hip Hop' Rise + 'Being Human,' 'Lost Girl,' 'WWE RAW' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=January 24, 2012|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Josh looks at Heggeman who has him in his sights when Nora, fully transformed, attacks Heggeman and kills him. Aidan digs up Suren, Mother's daughter, and brings her to the Halloway Hotel so she can feed on willing people so she may regain her strength. Sally, horrified at the actual sensation she had in her nightmare, seeks solace with Stevie and his friends Dylan and \"Boner\", who Josh and Nora meet when they get home. Josh reveals to Aidan that Nora has killed Heggeman. Nora tries to clear her head as Sally reveals to Stevie she physically felt something when she opened the Door in her dream. Aidan attempts to help Suren take her place as Boston's head vampire by suggesting that they install a new vampire police officer as their assistant, but she has other plans, having chosen the still human police officer Cecilia to pick a new subject rather than one of Bishop's sires. Suren tries to get Aidan to turn her, but he refuses. Josh tries to console Nora at work when he is reminded that he has to attend the first-year med student mixer. Josh later manages to convince her to go, where she gets drunk to take solace in the fact that she is now a werewolf and that she has miscarried her and Josh's child. Dylan convinces Sally to go to a party to \"Rage\", where Sally discovers that ghosts can take over living people's bodies if they are willing or in a weaker state of mind. Sally relishes the fact that she can eat, drink, and feel things, again, until Dylan tries to make a move on her in their stolen bodies. Sally refuses and Stevie pulls them out of their bodies to help her, before causing Dylan to disintegrate entirely. Josh decides to drop out of medical school, and try to find a cure for his and Nora's condition instead. Aidan discovers Suren has turned Cecilia, and she tells him he will do everything to make her the best so he can be free of Mother. Sally fears that she now knows that ghosts can permanently destroy each other, but Nora convinces her that it is better to know what one is capable of, with her remembering that she did kill Heggeman as the wolf.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = All Out of Blood\n |DirectedBy = Paolo Barzman\n |WrittenBy = Chris Dingess\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|1|30}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-40\n |Viewers = 1.66<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/31/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-rules-pretty-little-liars-being-human-lost-girl-wwe-raw-housewives-bh-more/118084/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Rules + 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Being Human,' 'Lost Girl,' 'WWE RAW,' 'Housewives BH' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Gorman|first=Bill|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = When Josh rents storage rooms for himself and Nora to safely \"wolf out\" in, Nora is far from thrilled. While they argue over it, with Nora revealing she remembers killing Heggeman, Sally, watching from a few feet away, is distracted by a dark, shadowy figure lurking in the distance before it vanishes suddenly.  Meanwhile, Aidan and Julia enjoy a lovely morning together, except for the fact that Aidan almost bites her, instead taking out his urges with a blood pack. At the hospital, Josh and Sally confront Aidan about his whereabouts, and he finally admits to seeing someone he likes. Josh expresses concern but Aidan convinces him that he is fine as long as he has plenty of bagged blood to drink\u2014which might become a problem since the hospital has started locking up their blood supplies. The nursery catches Sally's attention and she accidentally discovers nurse Zoe Gonzales, a human who can not only see and talk to ghosts but also helps them merge with babies to be reincarnated. Later that night, Josh and Aidan enjoy a brief if awkward moment of male bonding about sexual conquest but the good feelings are short lived. The next morning, they discover that the woman Aidan is seeing is Josh's former fianc\u00e9. After a painful reunion (of sorts) between Josh and Julia, tensions are high all around. Josh is angry with Aidan, who likes Julia but can no longer act on it, Nora is angry with Josh and jealous of Julia, and Julia hates Josh for leaving her. Later, Aidan approaches Julia and breaks off the relationship, both because of tensions with Josh and his inability to stop himself from feeding on her. When Sally sees Zoe helping a ghost merge with a newborn baby to become reincarnated, she makes it her goal to become reincarnated, too. After having a heart to heart with Zoe, Sally convinces her to come to the house and interview her \"roommates\" Aidan and Josh. Aidan and Josh pretend to be humans who can see ghosts and try to give Zoe a good impression of Sally, but Zoe passes on reincarnating her when they reveal Sally nearly killed Danny. Sally tries to jump into a baby herself, but has to stop when the dark spirit that has been following her around attacks her. She realizes that if she does jump into a baby, the spirit will kill her. Thankfully, Zoe offers Sally help in fending off the evil spirit. Without access to the hospital's blood bank, Aidan is falling deeper and deeper into despair and sickness. He cannot stop sweating, he is weak, pale and, most of all, he is hungry. Finally, he gives in and goes to a woman who lets vampires feed off her for money and he drinks his fill. Josh and Sally are not sure that Nora is going to show up for their full moon lockdown, and they are almost right. Nora spends her day stalking Julia with the intention of hurting her. Realizing she is a danger to others, Nora shows up for Sally to lock both she and Josh up before the full moon. After a few minutes, Josh and Nora's wolf forms dent the storage rooms' doors.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 17\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = (I Loathe You) For Sentimental Reasons\n |DirectedBy = [[Charles Binam\u00e9]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Mike Ostrowski]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|6}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-36\n |Viewers = 1.45<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/07/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-rules-pretty-little-liars-being-human-lost-girl-wwe-raw-housewives-bh-more-2/119040/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Rules + 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Being Human,' 'WWE RAW,' 'Housewives BH' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=February 7, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan approaches the old woman he has been paying for her blood, but she says she can no longer give any blood but offers her daughter instead for him later. At the hospital, Josh is approached by Brynn, another werewolf, who needs him to break her twin brother Connor out before the next full moon. Sally tries to help Zoe flirt with the new surgeon, Dr. Tim Forrest, to no avail, and Zoe invites her to come to the support group she holds for ghosts. Aidan goes back to drink from the old woman's daughter, but when he discovers that she is a young child, he is revolted and runs off. He is called in by Suren to consult with a proposed addition to their group: a local mobster. Aidan believes he will not be an asset, despite Suren's insistence after the mobster brings them one of Bishop's orphans. Josh is approached by Brynn and Connor who take him out to a club, revealing that they are purebred werewolves, rather than having been turned. When Josh mentions he is seeking out a cure, it piques Connor's interest, and later when he mentions he is trying to find the biological switch that initiates the transformation to turn it off, Connor and Brynn reveal that they want to become the wolf permanently. Josh is appalled at their wishes, but with their funding he may be able to solve the problem, and asks Nora to come meet them. At Zoe's support group, Sally meets up again with Nick, at which Zoe is surprised that they know each other. After accepting what seems like a date, she talks with Zoe the following day who reveals that she is seeing Nick intimately. Nick later confirms this, and his newfound ability to avoid reliving his death day after day after meeting Zoe, which leaves Sally heartbroken. Later, while idly watching Dr. Forrest and his girlfriend Janet being intimate, Sally takes the opportunity to possess Janet so she can feel a loving embrace. While mulling over the mobster's inclusion as a vampire, Aidan has flashbacks to 1930 when his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Henry started to want more out of his immortal life, specifically what Suren would give them. When Aidan turned down Suren's advances, Henry took up the offer and became Suren's lover. In the present, he tells Suren that he has made up his mind and will turn the mobster. As he begins drinking the mobster's blood, he has another flashback before he starts draining the mobster dry. He proclaims that this time he will have Suren, who begins feeding on the mobster before the two vampires make love to each other.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Addicted to Love\n |DirectedBy = Charles Binam\u00e9\n |WrittenBy = Lisa Randolph\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|13}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-37\n |Viewers = 1.35<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/14/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-leads-pretty-little-liars-being-human-wwe-raw-housewives-bh-more/119820/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Leads + 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Being Human,' 'WWE RAW,' 'Housewives BH' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Gorman|first=Bill|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201533/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/14/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-leads-pretty-little-liars-being-human-wwe-raw-housewives-bh-more/119820/|archive-date=February 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan begins to fall into bad habits as his affair with Suren gets deeper, including feeding on live blood. Their affair does not go unnoticed by Mother, who has them go after the orphans. Flashbacks to 1930 continue, with Aidan having become angered at Henry for having affairs with other women under Suren's nose. When Suren finally discovered Henry with another woman, the emotional distress led her to attack the woman in the hotel's crowded ballroom, forcing Mother to call on all of the vampires to lock down the room and kill all of the human occupants. This also led to Suren being \"grounded\" for the next 80 years, and Aidan warned Henry that he should not come back to Boston ever again. In the present, Sally continues to use Janet's body to enjoy the sensations of life and sex with Dr. Forrest. However, when this comes to the attention of Josh and Aidan, they warn her she should stop. She agrees, but the pull is too strong and the next time she possesses Janet she gets stuck. She seeks out Josh's help at the hospital in Janet's body, but Dr. Forrest's arrival waylays her plans. He brings her home so she can meet his mother, but the shadow entity appears before Sally, and as she yells at it, it rushes at her and removes her from Janet's body. Later, Janet comes to the gang's house, having had a part of Sally's memories stuck in her after the ordeal. When Sally goes to try to apologize with her, she finds Janet drawing the shadowy figure fervishly, until she writes down the name \"Reaper\" on one of the drawings. Elsewhere, Josh has been sharing his plans to find the cure with Connor, Brynn, and an irritated Nora. Nora's condition is only made worse when her abusive ex-boyfriend Will has come to town. With the full moon approaching, Connor manages to convince Josh to retaliate against Will for what he did to Nora. However, Brynn talks to Nora first, knowing that she is not willing to be cured. Nora reveals that she has been stalking Will ever since he came into town, and has been waiting for the full moon to come to exact her own revenge. That night, three werewolves viciously attack Will, devouring him. Josh wakes up in the warehouse alone, while Nora wakes up satiated in the woods with Brynn and Connor.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 19\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Mama Said There'd Be Decades Like These\n |DirectedBy = [[Stefan Pleszczynski]]\n |WrittenBy = Jeremy Carver & Anna Fricke\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|20}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-38\n |Viewers = 1.43<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/22/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-rules-again-wwe-raw-t-i-and-tiny-pretty-little-liars-being-human-much-more/121190/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Rules Again + 'WWE RAW,' 'T.I. and Tiny,' 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Being Human' & Much More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=February 22, 2012|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = After trying to get in contact with Nora who is not returning his calls, Josh goes to clean out a room when he discovers that a dying patient is Sally's mother Rena. While Sally tries to get Josh to make her father comfortable, and make sure that her mother does not spend the afterlife in a hospital gown, Josh crosses paths with two detectives who inform him that Will has been found dead and they are looking for Nora. Elsewhere, Aidan hunts down the orphan's vampire dens to find Henry, but has no luck, so he instead takes out his energy by drinking blood. However, he gets so drunk on the blood that he begins to see visions of Bishop, who advises Aidan to hunt down Henry and kill him. When Rena dies, Sally greets her ghost to try to reconnect with her, but Rena has other plans which involve reuniting with their dead neighbor Gerry Patterson who she was having an affair with before he died ten years ago. Sally gets upset that her mother would rather continue an affair than spend time looking after her family, but her mother says she did not want to come see Sally because she is still living in the house where she was killed. Josh tries to confront Connor and Brynn about the cops and Nora's disappearance, but their elitist attitude, particularly regarding how Will's corpse shows he could not have been killed by a human, puts him off. He goes to ask Aidan if Cecilia could help him, but Aidan is too preoccupied with visions of Bishop to be of assistance. Josh approaches Cecilia on his own, offering up the purebred werewolves in return for her services in taking the cops off the case, which she follows through with when the two detectives find Josh at his storage unit and she uses her vampiric suggestion powers to remove Josh from their radar. That night, Josh tells Connor and Brynn that he has gotten rid of the cops, while also tipping off Cecilia to their location. Aidan has flashbacks to his time coming back from overseas after World War I, introducing Henry to Bishop, who believes Henry has a rebellious streak in him. Back in the present, Henry and Aidan have their confrontation, with Aidan nearly killing Henry but giving up at the last minute, knowing he cannot kill his own son. He promises Henry that he will find a way to reincorporate him into the vampire fold, regardless of having ruined everything in the past regarding Suren's actions.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 20\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = The Ties That Blind\n |DirectedBy = Stefan Pleszczynski\n |WrittenBy = C\u00e9line Geiger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|27}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-39\n |Viewers = 1.36<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/28/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-comes-out-on-top-closely-followed-by-wwe-raw/122195/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Comes Out on Top, Closely Followed by 'WWE RAW'|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Josh and Nora awake nude in the woods after a full moon, unsure of the events the night before. In a flashback to 24 hours earlier, Aidan and Josh are preparing to leave for work when they realize that strange things are happening, and believe Sally is losing control of her abilities, but she claims it is not her but some poltergeist come to bother her. At the hospital, Josh finds Nora who is still conflicted over what happened. Josh reveals she hurt him by leaving without any answer, and mentions that the twins said they were in contact with her, which they were not. Elsewhere in the hospital, Aidan is approached by Atlee of the Dutch who believes Aidan knows something about Heggeman's disappearance. Back at the house, Sally continues to see the effects of the poltergeist, and when she ascends the stairs, it attacks her, with the threatening voice of Danny. She goes to see Aidan at the hospital, wondering if Danny is somehow behind the Reaper's appearance, but they soon discover that Danny was murdered in prison. Aidan tells her to use iron to disperse Danny's essence and assures her that she is the stronger ghost, if he is truly the Reaper, and then confronts Josh about Cecilia's sudden disappearance. Josh reveals that Cecilia did help him, and in exchange he told her that the twins killed Heggeman. When he finally gets Cecilia's phone to pick up, Connor is on the other line, revealing that they have captured Cecilia and want to have a showdown with Aidan in the woods that night: a full moon. Aidan tells Atlee that he knows where the purebred wolves who killed Heggeman are and have him come along to save Cecilia and get revenge. Elsewhere, Nora and Josh have a fight, as Nora (and the twins) believe Cecilia was sent by Aidan to kill the twins, and she goes to the woods to change with the twins. At the house, Sally has her showdown with Danny, who reveals his ghostly form. While Sally believes she has the upper hand, Danny's death in prison has taught him more in a short period of time and overpowers her until the Reaper appears to kill Danny's spirit, before taking on a more corporeal form. The Reaper tells Sally that she is an aberration in the natural order, as she passed over her door, and he has come to remove her from existence, but Danny's death has given her more time. Josh goes to a shed in the woods where Nora and the twins are preparing for the full moon. But Josh is surprised when Aidan arrives, as the twins have brought him for a vampire hunt. Josh reveals that he was the one who gave the twins' location to Cecilia, which surprises Nora and the twins. As Josh and Nora start to transform, Aidan retreats into the woods to inform Atlee that they will have to face four werewolves, instead of two, and Atlee retreats. Josh, Nora, and the twins hunt Aidan through the woods until he manages to find Cecilia, and Heggeman's rifle. As the rifle has no ammunition and Cecilia is too weak to be of any help to Aidan, she pleads with him to leave her behind so he may be safe. He lets her down and makes his escape as the werewolves tear Cecilia apart. Sally meets up with the Reaper, again, who realizes that she is a special case, but the order must be restored and she should say her goodbyes. The next morning, Josh and Nora wake, and Nora's revelation that she likes being the wolf more and does not want the cure Josh truly wants leads to their breakup. They meet up with the twins, with Connor amazed that Josh tried to kill them when Aidan returns and uses Heggeman's rifle to shoot Connor with a silver bullet, killing him as he reverts to his wolf form. Brynn breaks down in tears at the death of her brother as Aidan leaves with Connor's body to present to Atlee so he may say he is the one who took revenge for Heggeman's death, so long as he never returns to Boston. Josh and Aidan return to the house, where Sally wants to tell them about the Reaper, but they are in no mood to talk, leaving Sally ready to leave without saying goodbye.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 21\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n |Title = I've Got You Under Your Skin\n |DirectedBy = [[Stefan Schwartz]]\n |WrittenBy = Nancy Won\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|3|5}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-41\n |Viewers = 1.40<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/03/06/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-beats-wwe-american-pickers-basketball-wives-pretty-little-liars-more/123275/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Beats 'WWE', 'American Pickers,' 'Basketball Wives,' 'Pretty Little Liars' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = It has been a week since the events of the full moon. Sally is on edge as the Reaper has not sought her out to \"shred\" her, but he appears to her to give her an ultimatum as he has found a loophole. Sally can either be reaped or become the new Reaper. Josh has been out of work for the past week, in a slump since the breakup with Nora. Aidan, however, has called in Emily to cheer Josh up. When Sally asks Aidan for advice on the Reaper, he suggests she shred him before he gets the chance to shred her. Emily plans Josh's recovery from the breakup, saying that the two of them should go out drinking. Sally goes to see Stevie to ask his advice on how to shred ghosts, but he warns her that shredding makes ghosts dark and it is not something she wants to do. Aidan meets with Suren who is upset that Cecilia has been killed. Suren also reveals that Mother will be making a trip to Boston to check on her progress, but she has lied to her and said that Bishop's orphans have been culled so they must take care of them. Aidan hunts down Henry to warn him, finding him at the house of a human who offers passage across the threshold in exchange for money. Aidan tells Henry to gather all of the orphans at the house because he has found a way to save them and Henry. Josh leaves work early, as the hospital reminds him too much of Nora, and catches up with Emily at the bar where he finds she has been hanging out with Julia. Still not ready to face his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Josh orders drinks, which is out of character for him. As the night goes on, Sally ultimately faces the Reaper, managing to shred him before he can do the same to her. However, the Reaper quickly reforms his spiritual form, surprised that Sally had the gall to attack him, but also instilling the exhilaration in her of being a Reaper. Realizing she has no way out, she takes on his offer to be a Reaper and he takes her out on her first assignment. Elsewhere, the orphans gather at Henry's beckoning where Aidan promises them that they will have safe passage to Baltimore, where the vampire society has no hold. However, the owner of the house is brought in front of Suren who offers to buy the house from him for a large sum of money. He agrees, and her living lawyer takes ownership of the house. Aidan and Henry quickly trap the orphans in the basement and escape the house as the lawyer uninvites the vampires from his new house, causing the orphans to turn to ash. Henry is upset, but Aidan reminds him that this is the only way to end his exile. At the bar, Julia throws insults at Josh, feeling somehow relieved at his worse situation, until Emily needs to be taken home as she has drunk too much and hit on a straight girl. At Julia's apartment, after they put Emily to bed, Julia realizes she has come to Boston to find Josh and to find answers. Josh tells her as much of the truth as possible (without revealing his transformation into a werewolf), saying he did not want to hurt her, and leaves the apartment to head back home. The Reaper takes Sally to Stevie, saying that he has been shredding too many ghosts and is stalking his former bully to shred him once he dies and that he must be reaped. Sally, upset that she will have to reap her best friend, tries to talk to Stevie to find a way out of him being reaped, but when he admits he will shred his former bully, Sally realizes she cannot help him and the Reaper shreds him. Aidan presents Henry to Suren, who is ready to take out revenge for what he did 80 years prior by flaying him alive. Aidan tells Henry this is the only way he can re-enter vampire society and leaves him in Suren's hands. The next day, Aidan sees that Sally is still on this plane of existence, and Josh sees Emily off, but not before she tells him he missed his chance to have angry and drunk [[makeup sex]] with Julia.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = When I Think About You I Shred Myself\n |DirectedBy = Stefan Schwartz\n |WrittenBy = Mike Ostrowski\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|3|12}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-42\n |Viewers = 1.36<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/03/13/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-monday-night-raw-leads-pawn-stars-american-chopper-ti-and-tiny/124191/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE Monday Night Raw' leads 'Pawn Stars', 'American Chopper' & 'TI and Tiny'|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=March 13, 2012|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan takes Henry back to the house so he may be able to recover from being skinned alive by Suren, while Josh and Sally go off to their respective \"jobs\". Sally and the Reaper discuss her new duties, which begins with shredding Walter, a ghost from Zoe's support group, after he starts possessing, again. She is not yet ready, so the Reaper takes matters into his own hands. At the hospital, Josh and Julia have some small talk, as they were better friends than future spouses, until Josh sees his old friend Stu, who did not survive the werewolf attack years ago. Stu has been living as a ghost in Ithaca and has come to see Josh, who he knows is a werewolf. Sally returns to the house after meeting with the Reaper to find Boner, who the Reaper told her was shredded by Stevie. She goes to Zoe and Nick for advice, and they say she should come to the support group for help. At the hospital, with Stu's \"assistance\", Josh and Julia begin to rekindle their relationship during a required sexual harassment seminar. At the house, Aidan has brought two willing young women to bring Henry back to health, using his mental powers to make them believe Henry is not missing his skin, so Henry may feed without killing them. This brings back memories of when they first met in 1918 France, when Henry was an [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] medic, and still alive, and Aidan was a soldier who \"miraculously\" survived a German attack. While the attending physician tells Henry not to give Aidan morphine and leave him to die, Aidan orders Henry to remove the bullets from his body, healing quickly as time passes. When an injured French soldier comes to the field hospital, Aidan drinks the blood from his discarded wound dressings, but not without the French soldier seeing him. He begins to rant and rave that Aidan is a vampire, but Henry protects Aidan's identity until the French soldier tries to stake Aidan. Henry intervenes in the scuffle until he is staked. Aidan drinks from his blood before wiping out the entire field hospital, save for Henry, who he sires into a vampire and saves a survivor for him to be his first kill. Josh and Julia meet at a bar, where Julia asks if they should become intimate. Stu pushes Josh not to follow through, and Josh leaves, until he apparently has a change of mind. They return to Julia's apartment, where it is revealed that Stu has possessed Josh to make love to Julia. Josh awakes in the night and confronts Stu about what he did, realizing that Stu has only come to Boston to follow her. Now Josh can either break her heart or put her in danger around the full moon. When Julia awakens to find Josh by himself, she curls up next to him, and Josh ultimately chooses to stay with her. Sally heads to the support group, but she finds that the Reaper has shredded all of the ghosts before she could make it. She tries to talk to Zoe, but Zoe fears her for reasons she does not understand. Back at the house, Aidan's mental suggestion to the two girls starts to wear off, and they see the blood covering them and Henry. Aidan decides to kill both of them, and Henry takes his fill. The next day, Josh returns to the house to find Henry with his skin, and Aidan overseeing movers taking away two large boxes dripping with blood, angering Josh when he realizes what has happened. Inside, Nick approaches Sally, saying he will find a way to help her, while she is struggling to salt herself in to protect herself from the Reaper, which suddenly appears to attack Nick for falling in love with a living person. Sally yells at the Reaper to leave Nick alone, and proclaims she will never be like him, until the Reaper takes her appearance and says she is already him. Sally flashes back to when Tony told her that the longer ghosts stay on the living plane, they begin to lose connection with reality. She then realizes that the Reaper is only a manifestation of her dark side and she has been the one responsible for all of the Reaper's shreddings. Aidan and Josh come into the house just as Sally shreds Nick, and then proceeds to attack the boys until Aidan uses an iron fire poker to disperse her essence. The two trap her in a ring of salt on the staircase, and when she awakes she proceeds to scream at them in a demonic voice to let her go.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 23\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Dream Reaper\n |DirectedBy = Paolo Barzman\n |WrittenBy = [[Keto Shimizu]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|3|19}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-43\n |Viewers = 1.43<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/03/20/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-pretty-little-liars-top-night-american-chopper-basketball-wives-lost-girl-more/125225/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE RAW,' 'Pretty Little Liars' Top Night + 'American Chopper,' 'Basketball Wives,' 'Lost Girl' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan and Josh try to figure out what to do with Sally, who has fallen into a catatonic state since the \"Reaper\" took over. As Aidan has never encountered something like this in the past, they decide to seek out Zoe's help, even though Sally has just shredded Nick. Zoe is reluctant at first, as she watched Sally shred all of her ghosts, but Aidan pleads with her to help and she agrees. Upon learning the full story, she realizes that Sally's subconscious has created the Reaper as a form of feeling guilty for passing up her door, and this entity has taken hold of Sally. Inside Sally's mind, she is living out a fantasy where she is still alive and she is living in the house with her fianc\u00e9 \"Scott\", the Reaper personality. As Sally is preparing breakfast, she sees Josh's reflection in a microwave, but she cannot remember him. Meanwhile, Scott is continuously pushing her that they should move out of the house, an attempt to make sure his personality will overwrite Sally's. Aidan and Josh's attempts to contact Sally while she is out cold anger \"Scott\", deciding to trap them all in the house, and once he puts Sally in bed in her mind, making her think she is ill, she takes control of Sally's ghostly body. He first taunts them, bringing up Aidan's murders and Josh's breakup with Nora, before revealing to Zoe that Nick has been shredded. Aidan is beginning to feel the effects of live blood withdrawal, and Zoe is tempting him, and it is also the night of the full moon. If Sally is not saved, Zoe will be killed by one of the housemates. The two try to push Zoe to save Sally, even if they are all trapped together, but her insistence that she will not help forces the two to reveal their supernatural natures. Zoe attempts a \"mind meld\" with Sally, hoping that by contacting Sally's mind she will be able to free herself. As their consciousnesses merge, Zoe falls limp. She finds herself at Sally and \"Scott's\" engagement party, where she does her best to convince Sally that she is living in a fantasy and that \"Scott\" is not who he seems. To try to convince her, Zoe reminds Sally that she has shredded Nick, but Nick is alive and well in her fantasy. In the house, Josh tries to find a way to shift in the house without killing either Zoe or Aidan, but Aidan cannot hold back and begins feeding on Zoe until Josh tears him away. He then offers up his blood to Aidan to drink from to keep Zoe alive, and after some hesitation he drinks from Josh, feeling an immediate buzz from the werewolf blood, until he starts to convulse in pain. In Sally's mind, Zoe is beginning to get through to her, as Sally remembers Nick's drowning death, until \"Scott\" attacks Zoe. It is not until Aidan lets out a ghastly scream from his body violently rejecting Josh's blood that Sally's self-contained illusion is broken, leaving only Sally, Zoe, and \"Scott\" left. With the illusion failing, allowing Sally to see Aidan in pain and Josh trying to revive him does she reject \"Scott\" and goes through her death once more, awakening in her ghostly body, freeing everyone. Zoe walks off, still angry, and Josh breaks the salt ring before running off to the woods to change. Aidan, recovered but seeping blood from every orifice, welcomes Sally home before he goes upstairs to rest. Zoe comes back with dressing on her wound to tell Sally she will never forgive her for what she did to Nick. Sally is left alone, except for \"Scott\" who reminds her that he is a part of her and will always be there, waiting for her to slip, again.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 24\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 11\n |Title = Don't Fear the Scott\n |DirectedBy = Paolo Barzman\n |WrittenBy = Chris Dingess\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|3|26}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-44\n |Viewers = 1.25<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/03/27/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-basketball-wives-secret-life-of-the-american-teenager-pawn-stars-more/126127/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE RAW,' 'Basketball Wives', 'Secret Life of the American Teenager', 'Pawn Stars' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Suren feels confident that she has fulfilled Mother's demand of her to put Boston back into order, and Aidan knows that he will no longer be forced to be involved with the vampire community, and the two will be able to freely spend time together. Elsewhere, Josh and Julia enjoy time with each other, with Josh asking her if she would not mind coming to his place, but Julia still feels hurt from the break-up with Aidan. Sally does her best to ignore \"Scott\", who insists that she acknowledge he still exists as a part of her. She later reveals to the boys that \"Scott\" is still bothering her, but she thinks that if she makes amends for what she has done she may be able to get rid of him. Aidan mentions that Janet, who Sally had possessed months ago, has been admitted to Suffolk County Hospital's psychiatric ward. The next day, she goes to see Janet and believes that if Josh acts as a go between she can help Janet, but Josh refuses to help. Elsewhere, Josh asks Aidan if he could bring Suren over to serve as a double date so Julia could feel more comfortable coming over, and he acquiesces. Aidan convinces Suren to follow through, as if she is to become a part of his life she has to accept his mundane life. The dinner goes through several awkward silences, until Suren and Josh bond over liking ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]''. Things take a turn when Suren realizes Julia and Aidan dated, without Aidan having told her, but nothing happens between the girls. That night, Aidan comforts Suren in the fact that she has a place in his life. Josh and Julia arrive at hospital for work the next day only to find Nora has come back. Julia leaves the two alone, and Nora reveals that Brynn was not the person she thought and she wants to make amends with Josh, but he has fallen back in love with Julia. Sally finds Nora in the hospital, who cannot get her job back, and after revealing the events of the past couple of weeks, Sally convinces Nora to help her get through to Janet. Elsewhere in the hospital, Julia presses Josh to make the right choice between her and Nora. With the Reaper egging her on to stop helping, Sally, through Nora, manages to convince Janet she is not crazy and that she is sorry for what she has done. Feeling stronger in herself, \"Scott\" disappears just as Josh sees that Sally had Nora help her, cementing the decision in his mind to stay with Julia. At the Halloway Hotel, Mother states her pleasure in how Suren and Aidan have put Boston back in order. She still feels Suren is not ready to leave, forcing her to keep her place in Boston. However, Mother does not go back on her deal with Aidan, but instead of freedom she excommunicates Aidan from vampire society, with threat of death to anyone who disobeys. After asking Henry to send a message, Aidan and Suren meet and decide to leave Boston. After saying a tearful goodbye to Josh and Sally, Aidan leaves the house to go on the run with Suren. Later, Nora goes to see Josh one more time, still wanting to make amends, by revealing she has found the way to lift the werewolf curse. Josh has to kill Ray, the werewolf who turned him, but not during a full moon. Aidan and Suren make it to a seedy hotel, but when Suren says she is hungry, Aidan leaves the room to find a suitable victim to only find Henry has given up their location and has brought reinforcements to kill Aidan.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 25\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 12\n |Title = Partial Eclipse of the Heart\n |DirectedBy = Adam Kane\n |WrittenBy = Lisa Randolph\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|4|2}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-45\n |Viewers = 1.27<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/03/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-bodyslams-competition-basketball-wives-la-las-full-court-lifesecret-life-of-the-american-teenagerpawn-stars/127242/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: WWE Bodyslams Competition, 'Basketball Wives,' 'La Las Full Court Life, 'Secret Life of the American Teenager, 'Pawn Stars'|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=April 3, 2012|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan prepares to face off against Henry and the two vampires he brought with him when Henry helps Aidan in killing the other vampires, having only saved face by pretending to hunt down Aidan and Suren. Henry wants to help Aidan go on the run, but knows that Suren's presence will prevent that. While Aidan thanks Henry, he also partially stakes him so he can tell Mother a good story while he remains with Suren. Back in Boston, Josh goes to seek out Ray, with Nora's knowledge that killing him will cure the both of them, but he sees that Ray has reunited with his family. Ray finds Josh and advises him that he should tell his loved ones the truth, something that Josh struggles with when he returns to Boston to find that his and Julia's old mutual friend from Ithaca Chelsea has come to town to see the both of them. While he deals with reuniting with an old friend, Sally seeks out Zoe at the hospital to ask for forgiveness, but cannot find her in the nursery. Sally manages to find her, when Zoe reveals that being in the nursery only gives her bad memories and she does not want to help ghosts anymore. At a restaurant, Josh has met up with Julia and Chelsea to reveal they are a couple, once more. When Julia gets up from the table, Chelsea sternly asks Josh to tell Julia the truth about matters, before leaving when Julia returns. Sally follows Zoe, trying to get her to change her mind about ghosts when they realize that there is a solar eclipse happening. Walter, one of the ghosts Sally shredded, suddenly appears in the park, and when Sally tells Zoe this is where she shredded him she remembers that solar eclipses somehow weaken the barrier between the living and spiritual worlds. Sally realizes that means Nick must have rematerialized as well, and they both head to the brownstone. Julia and Josh enjoy each other's company, and just as Josh is ready to tell Julia that he is a werewolf the solar eclipse begins to affect him, as well, beginning a partial transformation. He runs out of the restaurant, Julia following him, until he is met with a dead end in an alleyway. He turns to face Julia, partially transformed, startling her as she backs up into the street and is hit by a car. Josh rushes to her aid, but still transforming, runs away from the growing crowd. Sally makes it to the house to talk to Nick, who reveals that they are in some sort of terrifying [[purgatory]], that they call [[Limbo]], where they can only feel pain but not existence. When Zoe arrives, Sally stays with Danny who is actually happy to see her, knowing that he somewhat deserves his fate in Limbo, while Nick lies to Zoe that he is now in a better place. The eclipse ends and the two return back to purgatory. Zoe thanks Sally for letting her see Nick one last time, while Sally feels guilty that she has put so many in such a terrifying place. Aidan, however, has driven many miles to [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], to the hiding place of the Dutch to seek help from Atlee, who has since been made the leader of the Dutch because of the werewolf Aidan gave him. Aidan blackmails him into giving himself and Suren a place to hide and returns to the motel, only to find that Suren has left. Suren, feeling the blood withdrawal symptoms and not enjoying her situation has returned to Boston on her own to reclaim her place as its leader. That night, Josh returns to the accident scene to reveal the truth to Julia, but she reveals that she has already died and Josh is speaking to her ghost. She tells him he should have been truthful from the start, but she has always loved him, before her Door appears and she uses it to pass through to the other side.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 26\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n |Title = It's My Party and I'll Die If I Want To\n |DirectedBy = Adam Kane\n |WrittenBy = Jeremy Carver & Anna Fricke\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|4|9}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-46\n |Viewers = 1.38<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/10/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-wins-night-wwe-raw-basketball-wives-hardcore-history-secret-life-of-the-american-teen-la-las-full-court-life-more/128247/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Wins Night, 'WWE Raw', 'Basketball Wives', 'Hardcore History', 'Secret Life of the American Teen', 'La La's Full Court Life' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Josh resolves to kill Ray to save both himself and Nora from the werewolf curse while Aidan resolves to kill Mother so he and Suren may be together at last. Josh enlists Sally to possess Ray's wife, using her to call Ray out to a deserted stretch of road under the guise of fixing a flat tire. However, this act brings the Reaper entity back into Sally's mind. Once Ray arrives, Josh marches Ray out into the woods at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Aidan infiltrates Mother's coven and attempts to kill her and finds that Henry (who helped Aidan get inside) has been severely beaten and may be dead. Aidan is eventually captured and brought before Mother, who kills Suren in front of him. As she turns to ashes, Aidan screams in fury and attempts to kill Mother but is overpowered. Aidan is then locked in a coffin and buried alive. Elsewhere, Sally returns to the hospital to seek out her mother so she may shred her in order for Sally to be able to enter Limbo to save all of the ghosts she shredded herself, as taking another ghost's Door would condemn them to insanity. Rena refuses to kill her own daughter, and after she disappears Sally comes across Nora and she tells her Josh's plans. Sally returns back to their shared house, the Reaper still taunting her, as Rena approaches her to tell Sally how proud she is of her now that she's become so strong in death. The reconciliation brings Rena's Door forth and she offers it to Sally, believing that if she can find a way back from the Door, another will come for her. Sally thanks her mother for the offer, but takes her fate into her own hands by shredding herself, all while the Reaper protests until he too is destroyed with Sally's spirit. Back in the woods, Josh hesitates shooting Ray, who then attacks Josh and knocks the gun from his hand. Before Ray can kill Josh, Nora arrives armed with her own weapon. She and Ray have a stand-off and everything fades to black as a gunshot is heard. With Aidan buried alive and Josh's fate unknown, the empty brownhouse is quiet until a radio starts to tune itself into a particular station.

Nora moves in with Josh, Aidan, and Sally, and while unable to see her, convinces Sally to attend her high school reunion. As the full moon approaches, Nora starts asking Josh things about what he goes through, fearing that she too is now a werewolf. Sally attends her reunion, meeting with her high school friend Stevie Adkins who committed suicide their junior year, and Diane Alcott, the vapid prom queen who died on a missionary trip in Africa. When Diane ignores Stevie, even in death, Sally confronts her, leading to Diane having a revelation and her Door appearing to send her to the other side. Upset as she missed her Door, Stevie consoles her by telling her that she can still dream in death. When she is alone that night, she sleeps and has a dream where she sees her door. When she opens it, she is attacked by some unknown dark force, causing her to abruptly wake up and find herself floating several feet in the air. Aidan appears before the council of vampires at the Halloway Hotel and Mother who decides that Bishop's \"orphans\" are to be culled and Aidan will be the second-in-command to her own daughter who will control Boston. She also adds that if Aidan is successful in grooming her daughter, he will be free of the council. That night, Nora drops Josh off in the woods so he can transform, and when she begins to hear his transformation, she is relieved that she has not been infected until she doubles over in pain and begins to transform, as well. As she is trapped in the car and calling out to him, Josh is shot at by Heggeman who has been tasked by Mother to kill him to remove any distractions to keep Aidan focused on her daughter. As Heggeman lifts the gun to shoot Josh again, the screen cuts to black, and a shot is heard.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?\n |DirectedBy = [[Paolo Barzman]]\n |WrittenBy = Nancy Won\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|1|23}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-35\n |Viewers = 1.65<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/24/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-rules-pretty-little-liars-love-hip-hop-rise-being-human-lost-girl-wwe-raw-more/117525/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Rules, 'Pretty Little Liars,' Love & Hip Hop' Rise + 'Being Human,' 'Lost Girl,' 'WWE RAW' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=January 24, 2012|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Josh looks at Heggeman who has him in his sights when Nora, fully transformed, attacks Heggeman and kills him. Aidan digs up Suren, Mother's daughter, and brings her to the Halloway Hotel so she can feed on willing people so she may regain her strength. Sally, horrified at the actual sensation she had in her nightmare, seeks solace with Stevie and his friends Dylan and \"Boner\", who Josh and Nora meet when they get home. Josh reveals to Aidan that Nora has killed Heggeman. Nora tries to clear her head as Sally reveals to Stevie she physically felt something when she opened the Door in her dream. Aidan attempts to help Suren take her place as Boston's head vampire by suggesting that they install a new vampire police officer as their assistant, but she has other plans, having chosen the still human police officer Cecilia to pick a new subject rather than one of Bishop's sires. Suren tries to get Aidan to turn her, but he refuses. Josh tries to console Nora at work when he is reminded that he has to attend the first-year med student mixer. Josh later manages to convince her to go, where she gets drunk to take solace in the fact that she is now a werewolf and that she has miscarried her and Josh's child. Dylan convinces Sally to go to a party to \"Rage\", where Sally discovers that ghosts can take over living people's bodies if they are willing or in a weaker state of mind. Sally relishes the fact that she can eat, drink, and feel things, again, until Dylan tries to make a move on her in their stolen bodies. Sally refuses and Stevie pulls them out of their bodies to help her, before causing Dylan to disintegrate entirely. Josh decides to drop out of medical school, and try to find a cure for his and Nora's condition instead. Aidan discovers Suren has turned Cecilia, and she tells him he will do everything to make her the best so he can be free of Mother. Sally fears that she now knows that ghosts can permanently destroy each other, but Nora convinces her that it is better to know what one is capable of, with her remembering that she did kill Heggeman as the wolf.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = All Out of Blood\n |DirectedBy = Paolo Barzman\n |WrittenBy = Chris Dingess\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|1|30}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-40\n |Viewers = 1.66<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/31/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-rules-pretty-little-liars-being-human-lost-girl-wwe-raw-housewives-bh-more/118084/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Rules + 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Being Human,' 'Lost Girl,' 'WWE RAW,' 'Housewives BH' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Gorman|first=Bill|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = When Josh rents storage rooms for himself and Nora to safely \"wolf out\" in, Nora is far from thrilled. While they argue over it, with Nora revealing she remembers killing Heggeman, Sally, watching from a few feet away, is distracted by a dark, shadowy figure lurking in the distance before it vanishes suddenly.  Meanwhile, Aidan and Julia enjoy a lovely morning together, except for the fact that Aidan almost bites her, instead taking out his urges with a blood pack. At the hospital, Josh and Sally confront Aidan about his whereabouts, and he finally admits to seeing someone he likes. Josh expresses concern but Aidan convinces him that he is fine as long as he has plenty of bagged blood to drink\u2014which might become a problem since the hospital has started locking up their blood supplies. The nursery catches Sally's attention and she accidentally discovers nurse Zoe Gonzales, a human who can not only see and talk to ghosts but also helps them merge with babies to be reincarnated. Later that night, Josh and Aidan enjoy a brief if awkward moment of male bonding about sexual conquest but the good feelings are short lived. The next morning, they discover that the woman Aidan is seeing is Josh's former fianc\u00e9. After a painful reunion (of sorts) between Josh and Julia, tensions are high all around. Josh is angry with Aidan, who likes Julia but can no longer act on it, Nora is angry with Josh and jealous of Julia, and Julia hates Josh for leaving her. Later, Aidan approaches Julia and breaks off the relationship, both because of tensions with Josh and his inability to stop himself from feeding on her. When Sally sees Zoe helping a ghost merge with a newborn baby to become reincarnated, she makes it her goal to become reincarnated, too. After having a heart to heart with Zoe, Sally convinces her to come to the house and interview her \"roommates\" Aidan and Josh. Aidan and Josh pretend to be humans who can see ghosts and try to give Zoe a good impression of Sally, but Zoe passes on reincarnating her when they reveal Sally nearly killed Danny. Sally tries to jump into a baby herself, but has to stop when the dark spirit that has been following her around attacks her. She realizes that if she does jump into a baby, the spirit will kill her. Thankfully, Zoe offers Sally help in fending off the evil spirit. Without access to the hospital's blood bank, Aidan is falling deeper and deeper into despair and sickness. He cannot stop sweating, he is weak, pale and, most of all, he is hungry. Finally, he gives in and goes to a woman who lets vampires feed off her for money and he drinks his fill. Josh and Sally are not sure that Nora is going to show up for their full moon lockdown, and they are almost right. Nora spends her day stalking Julia with the intention of hurting her. Realizing she is a danger to others, Nora shows up for Sally to lock both she and Josh up before the full moon. After a few minutes, Josh and Nora's wolf forms dent the storage rooms' doors.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 17\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = (I Loathe You) For Sentimental Reasons\n |DirectedBy = [[Charles Binam\u00e9]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Mike Ostrowski]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|6}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-36\n |Viewers = 1.45<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/07/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-rules-pretty-little-liars-being-human-lost-girl-wwe-raw-housewives-bh-more-2/119040/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Rules + 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Being Human,' 'WWE RAW,' 'Housewives BH' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=February 7, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan approaches the old woman he has been paying for her blood, but she says she can no longer give any blood but offers her daughter instead for him later. At the hospital, Josh is approached by Brynn, another werewolf, who needs him to break her twin brother Connor out before the next full moon. Sally tries to help Zoe flirt with the new surgeon, Dr. Tim Forrest, to no avail, and Zoe invites her to come to the support group she holds for ghosts. Aidan goes back to drink from the old woman's daughter, but when he discovers that she is a young child, he is revolted and runs off. He is called in by Suren to consult with a proposed addition to their group: a local mobster. Aidan believes he will not be an asset, despite Suren's insistence after the mobster brings them one of Bishop's orphans. Josh is approached by Brynn and Connor who take him out to a club, revealing that they are purebred werewolves, rather than having been turned. When Josh mentions he is seeking out a cure, it piques Connor's interest, and later when he mentions he is trying to find the biological switch that initiates the transformation to turn it off, Connor and Brynn reveal that they want to become the wolf permanently. Josh is appalled at their wishes, but with their funding he may be able to solve the problem, and asks Nora to come meet them. At Zoe's support group, Sally meets up again with Nick, at which Zoe is surprised that they know each other. After accepting what seems like a date, she talks with Zoe the following day who reveals that she is seeing Nick intimately. Nick later confirms this, and his newfound ability to avoid reliving his death day after day after meeting Zoe, which leaves Sally heartbroken. Later, while idly watching Dr. Forrest and his girlfriend Janet being intimate, Sally takes the opportunity to possess Janet so she can feel a loving embrace. While mulling over the mobster's inclusion as a vampire, Aidan has flashbacks to 1930 when his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Henry started to want more out of his immortal life, specifically what Suren would give them. When Aidan turned down Suren's advances, Henry took up the offer and became Suren's lover. In the present, he tells Suren that he has made up his mind and will turn the mobster. As he begins drinking the mobster's blood, he has another flashback before he starts draining the mobster dry. He proclaims that this time he will have Suren, who begins feeding on the mobster before the two vampires make love to each other.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Addicted to Love\n |DirectedBy = Charles Binam\u00e9\n |WrittenBy = Lisa Randolph\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|13}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-37\n |Viewers = 1.35<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/14/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-leads-pretty-little-liars-being-human-wwe-raw-housewives-bh-more/119820/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Leads + 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Being Human,' 'WWE RAW,' 'Housewives BH' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Gorman|first=Bill|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201533/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/14/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-leads-pretty-little-liars-being-human-wwe-raw-housewives-bh-more/119820/|archive-date=February 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan begins to fall into bad habits as his affair with Suren gets deeper, including feeding on live blood. Their affair does not go unnoticed by Mother, who has them go after the orphans. Flashbacks to 1930 continue, with Aidan having become angered at Henry for having affairs with other women under Suren's nose. When Suren finally discovered Henry with another woman, the emotional distress led her to attack the woman in the hotel's crowded ballroom, forcing Mother to call on all of the vampires to lock down the room and kill all of the human occupants. This also led to Suren being \"grounded\" for the next 80 years, and Aidan warned Henry that he should not come back to Boston ever again. In the present, Sally continues to use Janet's body to enjoy the sensations of life and sex with Dr. Forrest. However, when this comes to the attention of Josh and Aidan, they warn her she should stop. She agrees, but the pull is too strong and the next time she possesses Janet she gets stuck. She seeks out Josh's help at the hospital in Janet's body, but Dr. Forrest's arrival waylays her plans. He brings her home so she can meet his mother, but the shadow entity appears before Sally, and as she yells at it, it rushes at her and removes her from Janet's body. Later, Janet comes to the gang's house, having had a part of Sally's memories stuck in her after the ordeal. When Sally goes to try to apologize with her, she finds Janet drawing the shadowy figure fervishly, until she writes down the name \"Reaper\" on one of the drawings. Elsewhere, Josh has been sharing his plans to find the cure with Connor, Brynn, and an irritated Nora. Nora's condition is only made worse when her abusive ex-boyfriend Will has come to town. With the full moon approaching, Connor manages to convince Josh to retaliate against Will for what he did to Nora. However, Brynn talks to Nora first, knowing that she is not willing to be cured. Nora reveals that she has been stalking Will ever since he came into town, and has been waiting for the full moon to come to exact her own revenge. That night, three werewolves viciously attack Will, devouring him. Josh wakes up in the warehouse alone, while Nora wakes up satiated in the woods with Brynn and Connor.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 19\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Mama Said There'd Be Decades Like These\n |DirectedBy = [[Stefan Pleszczynski]]\n |WrittenBy = Jeremy Carver & Anna Fricke\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|20}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-38\n |Viewers = 1.43<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/22/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-rules-again-wwe-raw-t-i-and-tiny-pretty-little-liars-being-human-much-more/121190/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Rules Again + 'WWE RAW,' 'T.I. and Tiny,' 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Being Human' & Much More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=February 22, 2012|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = After trying to get in contact with Nora who is not returning his calls, Josh goes to clean out a room when he discovers that a dying patient is Sally's mother Rena. While Sally tries to get Josh to make her father comfortable, and make sure that her mother does not spend the afterlife in a hospital gown, Josh crosses paths with two detectives who inform him that Will has been found dead and they are looking for Nora. Elsewhere, Aidan hunts down the orphan's vampire dens to find Henry, but has no luck, so he instead takes out his energy by drinking blood. However, he gets so drunk on the blood that he begins to see visions of Bishop, who advises Aidan to hunt down Henry and kill him. When Rena dies, Sally greets her ghost to try to reconnect with her, but Rena has other plans which involve reuniting with their dead neighbor Gerry Patterson who she was having an affair with before he died ten years ago. Sally gets upset that her mother would rather continue an affair than spend time looking after her family, but her mother says she did not want to come see Sally because she is still living in the house where she was killed. Josh tries to confront Connor and Brynn about the cops and Nora's disappearance, but their elitist attitude, particularly regarding how Will's corpse shows he could not have been killed by a human, puts him off. He goes to ask Aidan if Cecilia could help him, but Aidan is too preoccupied with visions of Bishop to be of assistance. Josh approaches Cecilia on his own, offering up the purebred werewolves in return for her services in taking the cops off the case, which she follows through with when the two detectives find Josh at his storage unit and she uses her vampiric suggestion powers to remove Josh from their radar. That night, Josh tells Connor and Brynn that he has gotten rid of the cops, while also tipping off Cecilia to their location. Aidan has flashbacks to his time coming back from overseas after World War I, introducing Henry to Bishop, who believes Henry has a rebellious streak in him. Back in the present, Henry and Aidan have their confrontation, with Aidan nearly killing Henry but giving up at the last minute, knowing he cannot kill his own son. He promises Henry that he will find a way to reincorporate him into the vampire fold, regardless of having ruined everything in the past regarding Suren's actions.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 20\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = The Ties That Blind\n |DirectedBy = Stefan Pleszczynski\n |WrittenBy = C\u00e9line Geiger\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|2|27}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-39\n |Viewers = 1.36<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/28/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-comes-out-on-top-closely-followed-by-wwe-raw/122195/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Comes Out on Top, Closely Followed by 'WWE RAW'|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Josh and Nora awake nude in the woods after a full moon, unsure of the events the night before. In a flashback to 24 hours earlier, Aidan and Josh are preparing to leave for work when they realize that strange things are happening, and believe Sally is losing control of her abilities, but she claims it is not her but some poltergeist come to bother her. At the hospital, Josh finds Nora who is still conflicted over what happened. Josh reveals she hurt him by leaving without any answer, and mentions that the twins said they were in contact with her, which they were not. Elsewhere in the hospital, Aidan is approached by Atlee of the Dutch who believes Aidan knows something about Heggeman's disappearance. Back at the house, Sally continues to see the effects of the poltergeist, and when she ascends the stairs, it attacks her, with the threatening voice of Danny. She goes to see Aidan at the hospital, wondering if Danny is somehow behind the Reaper's appearance, but they soon discover that Danny was murdered in prison. Aidan tells her to use iron to disperse Danny's essence and assures her that she is the stronger ghost, if he is truly the Reaper, and then confronts Josh about Cecilia's sudden disappearance. Josh reveals that Cecilia did help him, and in exchange he told her that the twins killed Heggeman. When he finally gets Cecilia's phone to pick up, Connor is on the other line, revealing that they have captured Cecilia and want to have a showdown with Aidan in the woods that night: a full moon. Aidan tells Atlee that he knows where the purebred wolves who killed Heggeman are and have him come along to save Cecilia and get revenge. Elsewhere, Nora and Josh have a fight, as Nora (and the twins) believe Cecilia was sent by Aidan to kill the twins, and she goes to the woods to change with the twins. At the house, Sally has her showdown with Danny, who reveals his ghostly form. While Sally believes she has the upper hand, Danny's death in prison has taught him more in a short period of time and overpowers her until the Reaper appears to kill Danny's spirit, before taking on a more corporeal form. The Reaper tells Sally that she is an aberration in the natural order, as she passed over her door, and he has come to remove her from existence, but Danny's death has given her more time. Josh goes to a shed in the woods where Nora and the twins are preparing for the full moon. But Josh is surprised when Aidan arrives, as the twins have brought him for a vampire hunt. Josh reveals that he was the one who gave the twins' location to Cecilia, which surprises Nora and the twins. As Josh and Nora start to transform, Aidan retreats into the woods to inform Atlee that they will have to face four werewolves, instead of two, and Atlee retreats. Josh, Nora, and the twins hunt Aidan through the woods until he manages to find Cecilia, and Heggeman's rifle. As the rifle has no ammunition and Cecilia is too weak to be of any help to Aidan, she pleads with him to leave her behind so he may be safe. He lets her down and makes his escape as the werewolves tear Cecilia apart. Sally meets up with the Reaper, again, who realizes that she is a special case, but the order must be restored and she should say her goodbyes. The next morning, Josh and Nora wake, and Nora's revelation that she likes being the wolf more and does not want the cure Josh truly wants leads to their breakup. They meet up with the twins, with Connor amazed that Josh tried to kill them when Aidan returns and uses Heggeman's rifle to shoot Connor with a silver bullet, killing him as he reverts to his wolf form. Brynn breaks down in tears at the death of her brother as Aidan leaves with Connor's body to present to Atlee so he may say he is the one who took revenge for Heggeman's death, so long as he never returns to Boston. Josh and Aidan return to the house, where Sally wants to tell them about the Reaper, but they are in no mood to talk, leaving Sally ready to leave without saying goodbye.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 21\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n |Title = I've Got You Under Your Skin\n |DirectedBy = [[Stefan Schwartz]]\n |WrittenBy = Nancy Won\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|3|5}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-41\n |Viewers = 1.40<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/03/06/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-beats-wwe-american-pickers-basketball-wives-pretty-little-liars-more/123275/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Beats 'WWE', 'American Pickers,' 'Basketball Wives,' 'Pretty Little Liars' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = It has been a week since the events of the full moon.

When Sally asks Aidan for advice on the Reaper, he suggests she shred him before he gets the chance to shred her. Emily plans Josh's recovery from the breakup, saying that the two of them should go out drinking. Sally goes to see Stevie to ask his advice on how to shred ghosts, but he warns her that shredding makes ghosts dark and it is not something she wants to do. Aidan meets with Suren who is upset that Cecilia has been killed. Suren also reveals that Mother will be making a trip to Boston to check on her progress, but she has lied to her and said that Bishop's orphans have been culled so they must take care of them. Aidan hunts down Henry to warn him, finding him at the house of a human who offers passage across the threshold in exchange for money. Aidan tells Henry to gather all of the orphans at the house because he has found a way to save them and Henry. Josh leaves work early, as the hospital reminds him too much of Nora, and catches up with Emily at the bar where he finds she has been hanging out with Julia. Still not ready to face his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Josh orders drinks, which is out of character for him. As the night goes on, Sally ultimately faces the Reaper, managing to shred him before he can do the same to her. However, the Reaper quickly reforms his spiritual form, surprised that Sally had the gall to attack him, but also instilling the exhilaration in her of being a Reaper. Realizing she has no way out, she takes on his offer to be a Reaper and he takes her out on her first assignment. Elsewhere, the orphans gather at Henry's beckoning where Aidan promises them that they will have safe passage to Baltimore, where the vampire society has no hold. However, the owner of the house is brought in front of Suren who offers to buy the house from him for a large sum of money. He agrees, and her living lawyer takes ownership of the house. Aidan and Henry quickly trap the orphans in the basement and escape the house as the lawyer uninvites the vampires from his new house, causing the orphans to turn to ash. Henry is upset, but Aidan reminds him that this is the only way to end his exile. At the bar, Julia throws insults at Josh, feeling somehow relieved at his worse situation, until Emily needs to be taken home as she has drunk too much and hit on a straight girl. At Julia's apartment, after they put Emily to bed, Julia realizes she has come to Boston to find Josh and to find answers. Josh tells her as much of the truth as possible (without revealing his transformation into a werewolf), saying he did not want to hurt her, and leaves the apartment to head back home. The Reaper takes Sally to Stevie, saying that he has been shredding too many ghosts and is stalking his former bully to shred him once he dies and that he must be reaped. Sally, upset that she will have to reap her best friend, tries to talk to Stevie to find a way out of him being reaped, but when he admits he will shred his former bully, Sally realizes she cannot help him and the Reaper shreds him. Aidan presents Henry to Suren, who is ready to take out revenge for what he did 80 years prior by flaying him alive. Aidan tells Henry this is the only way he can re-enter vampire society and leaves him in Suren's hands. The next day, Aidan sees that Sally is still on this plane of existence, and Josh sees Emily off, but not before she tells him he missed his chance to have angry and drunk [[makeup sex]] with Julia.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = When I Think About You I Shred Myself\n |DirectedBy = Stefan Schwartz\n |WrittenBy = Mike Ostrowski\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|3|12}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-42\n |Viewers = 1.36<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/03/13/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-monday-night-raw-leads-pawn-stars-american-chopper-ti-and-tiny/124191/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE Monday Night Raw' leads 'Pawn Stars', 'American Chopper' & 'TI and Tiny'|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=March 13, 2012|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan takes Henry back to the house so he may be able to recover from being skinned alive by Suren, while Josh and Sally go off to their respective \"jobs\". Sally and the Reaper discuss her new duties, which begins with shredding Walter, a ghost from Zoe's support group, after he starts possessing, again. She is not yet ready, so the Reaper takes matters into his own hands. At the hospital, Josh and Julia have some small talk, as they were better friends than future spouses, until Josh sees his old friend Stu, who did not survive the werewolf attack years ago. Stu has been living as a ghost in Ithaca and has come to see Josh, who he knows is a werewolf. Sally returns to the house after meeting with the Reaper to find Boner, who the Reaper told her was shredded by Stevie. She goes to Zoe and Nick for advice, and they say she should come to the support group for help. At the hospital, with Stu's \"assistance\", Josh and Julia begin to rekindle their relationship during a required sexual harassment seminar. At the house, Aidan has brought two willing young women to bring Henry back to health, using his mental powers to make them believe Henry is not missing his skin, so Henry may feed without killing them. This brings back memories of when they first met in 1918 France, when Henry was an [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] medic, and still alive, and Aidan was a soldier who \"miraculously\" survived a German attack. While the attending physician tells Henry not to give Aidan morphine and leave him to die, Aidan orders Henry to remove the bullets from his body, healing quickly as time passes. When an injured French soldier comes to the field hospital, Aidan drinks the blood from his discarded wound dressings, but not without the French soldier seeing him. He begins to rant and rave that Aidan is a vampire, but Henry protects Aidan's identity until the French soldier tries to stake Aidan. Henry intervenes in the scuffle until he is staked. Aidan drinks from his blood before wiping out the entire field hospital, save for Henry, who he sires into a vampire and saves a survivor for him to be his first kill. Josh and Julia meet at a bar, where Julia asks if they should become intimate. Stu pushes Josh not to follow through, and Josh leaves, until he apparently has a change of mind. They return to Julia's apartment, where it is revealed that Stu has possessed Josh to make love to Julia. Josh awakes in the night and confronts Stu about what he did, realizing that Stu has only come to Boston to follow her. Now Josh can either break her heart or put her in danger around the full moon. When Julia awakens to find Josh by himself, she curls up next to him, and Josh ultimately chooses to stay with her. Sally heads to the support group, but she finds that the Reaper has shredded all of the ghosts before she could make it. She tries to talk to Zoe, but Zoe fears her for reasons she does not understand. Back at the house, Aidan's mental suggestion to the two girls starts to wear off, and they see the blood covering them and Henry. Aidan decides to kill both of them, and Henry takes his fill. The next day, Josh returns to the house to find Henry with his skin, and Aidan overseeing movers taking away two large boxes dripping with blood, angering Josh when he realizes what has happened. Inside, Nick approaches Sally, saying he will find a way to help her, while she is struggling to salt herself in to protect herself from the Reaper, which suddenly appears to attack Nick for falling in love with a living person. Sally yells at the Reaper to leave Nick alone, and proclaims she will never be like him, until the Reaper takes her appearance and says she is already him. Sally flashes back to when Tony told her that the longer ghosts stay on the living plane, they begin to lose connection with reality. She then realizes that the Reaper is only a manifestation of her dark side and she has been the one responsible for all of the Reaper's shreddings. Aidan and Josh come into the house just as Sally shreds Nick, and then proceeds to attack the boys until Aidan uses an iron fire poker to disperse her essence. The two trap her in a ring of salt on the staircase, and when she awakes she proceeds to scream at them in a demonic voice to let her go.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 23\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Dream Reaper\n |DirectedBy = Paolo Barzman\n |WrittenBy = [[Keto Shimizu]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|3|19}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-43\n |Viewers = 1.43<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/03/20/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-pretty-little-liars-top-night-american-chopper-basketball-wives-lost-girl-more/125225/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE RAW,' 'Pretty Little Liars' Top Night + 'American Chopper,' 'Basketball Wives,' 'Lost Girl' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan and Josh try to figure out what to do with Sally, who has fallen into a catatonic state since the \"Reaper\" took over. As Aidan has never encountered something like this in the past, they decide to seek out Zoe's help, even though Sally has just shredded Nick. Zoe is reluctant at first, as she watched Sally shred all of her ghosts, but Aidan pleads with her to help and she agrees. Upon learning the full story, she realizes that Sally's subconscious has created the Reaper as a form of feeling guilty for passing up her door, and this entity has taken hold of Sally. Inside Sally's mind, she is living out a fantasy where she is still alive and she is living in the house with her fianc\u00e9 \"Scott\", the Reaper personality. As Sally is preparing breakfast, she sees Josh's reflection in a microwave, but she cannot remember him. Meanwhile, Scott is continuously pushing her that they should move out of the house, an attempt to make sure his personality will overwrite Sally's. Aidan and Josh's attempts to contact Sally while she is out cold anger \"Scott\", deciding to trap them all in the house, and once he puts Sally in bed in her mind, making her think she is ill, she takes control of Sally's ghostly body. He first taunts them, bringing up Aidan's murders and Josh's breakup with Nora, before revealing to Zoe that Nick has been shredded. Aidan is beginning to feel the effects of live blood withdrawal, and Zoe is tempting him, and it is also the night of the full moon. If Sally is not saved, Zoe will be killed by one of the housemates. The two try to push Zoe to save Sally, even if they are all trapped together, but her insistence that she will not help forces the two to reveal their supernatural natures. Zoe attempts a \"mind meld\" with Sally, hoping that by contacting Sally's mind she will be able to free herself. As their consciousnesses merge, Zoe falls limp. She finds herself at Sally and \"Scott's\" engagement party, where she does her best to convince Sally that she is living in a fantasy and that \"Scott\" is not who he seems. To try to convince her, Zoe reminds Sally that she has shredded Nick, but Nick is alive and well in her fantasy. In the house, Josh tries to find a way to shift in the house without killing either Zoe or Aidan, but Aidan cannot hold back and begins feeding on Zoe until Josh tears him away. He then offers up his blood to Aidan to drink from to keep Zoe alive, and after some hesitation he drinks from Josh, feeling an immediate buzz from the werewolf blood, until he starts to convulse in pain. In Sally's mind, Zoe is beginning to get through to her, as Sally remembers Nick's drowning death, until \"Scott\" attacks Zoe. It is not until Aidan lets out a ghastly scream from his body violently rejecting Josh's blood that Sally's self-contained illusion is broken, leaving only Sally, Zoe, and \"Scott\" left. With the illusion failing, allowing Sally to see Aidan in pain and Josh trying to revive him does she reject \"Scott\" and goes through her death once more, awakening in her ghostly body, freeing everyone. Zoe walks off, still angry, and Josh breaks the salt ring before running off to the woods to change. Aidan, recovered but seeping blood from every orifice, welcomes Sally home before he goes upstairs to rest. Zoe comes back with dressing on her wound to tell Sally she will never forgive her for what she did to Nick. Sally is left alone, except for \"Scott\" who reminds her that he is a part of her and will always be there, waiting for her to slip, again.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 24\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 11\n |Title = Don't Fear the Scott\n |DirectedBy = Paolo Barzman\n |WrittenBy = Chris Dingess\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|3|26}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-44\n |Viewers = 1.25<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/03/27/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-basketball-wives-secret-life-of-the-american-teenager-pawn-stars-more/126127/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE RAW,' 'Basketball Wives', 'Secret Life of the American Teenager', 'Pawn Stars' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Suren feels confident that she has fulfilled Mother's demand of her to put Boston back into order, and Aidan knows that he will no longer be forced to be involved with the vampire community, and the two will be able to freely spend time together. Elsewhere, Josh and Julia enjoy time with each other, with Josh asking her if she would not mind coming to his place, but Julia still feels hurt from the break-up with Aidan. Sally does her best to ignore \"Scott\", who insists that she acknowledge he still exists as a part of her. She later reveals to the boys that \"Scott\" is still bothering her, but she thinks that if she makes amends for what she has done she may be able to get rid of him. Aidan mentions that Janet, who Sally had possessed months ago, has been admitted to Suffolk County Hospital's psychiatric ward. The next day, she goes to see Janet and believes that if Josh acts as a go between she can help Janet, but Josh refuses to help. Elsewhere, Josh asks Aidan if he could bring Suren over to serve as a double date so Julia could feel more comfortable coming over, and he acquiesces. Aidan convinces Suren to follow through, as if she is to become a part of his life she has to accept his mundane life. The dinner goes through several awkward silences, until Suren and Josh bond over liking ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]''. Things take a turn when Suren realizes Julia and Aidan dated, without Aidan having told her, but nothing happens between the girls. That night, Aidan comforts Suren in the fact that she has a place in his life. Josh and Julia arrive at hospital for work the next day only to find Nora has come back. Julia leaves the two alone, and Nora reveals that Brynn was not the person she thought and she wants to make amends with Josh, but he has fallen back in love with Julia. Sally finds Nora in the hospital, who cannot get her job back, and after revealing the events of the past couple of weeks, Sally convinces Nora to help her get through to Janet. Elsewhere in the hospital, Julia presses Josh to make the right choice between her and Nora. With the Reaper egging her on to stop helping, Sally, through Nora, manages to convince Janet she is not crazy and that she is sorry for what she has done. Feeling stronger in herself, \"Scott\" disappears just as Josh sees that Sally had Nora help her, cementing the decision in his mind to stay with Julia. At the Halloway Hotel, Mother states her pleasure in how Suren and Aidan have put Boston back in order. She still feels Suren is not ready to leave, forcing her to keep her place in Boston. However, Mother does not go back on her deal with Aidan, but instead of freedom she excommunicates Aidan from vampire society, with threat of death to anyone who disobeys. After asking Henry to send a message, Aidan and Suren meet and decide to leave Boston. After saying a tearful goodbye to Josh and Sally, Aidan leaves the house to go on the run with Suren. Later, Nora goes to see Josh one more time, still wanting to make amends, by revealing she has found the way to lift the werewolf curse. Josh has to kill Ray, the werewolf who turned him, but not during a full moon. Aidan and Suren make it to a seedy hotel, but when Suren says she is hungry, Aidan leaves the room to find a suitable victim to only find Henry has given up their location and has brought reinforcements to kill Aidan.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 25\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 12\n |Title = Partial Eclipse of the Heart\n |DirectedBy = Adam Kane\n |WrittenBy = Lisa Randolph\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|4|2}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-45\n |Viewers = 1.27<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/03/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-bodyslams-competition-basketball-wives-la-las-full-court-lifesecret-life-of-the-american-teenagerpawn-stars/127242/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: WWE Bodyslams Competition, 'Basketball Wives,' 'La Las Full Court Life, 'Secret Life of the American Teenager, 'Pawn Stars'|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=April 3, 2012|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Aidan prepares to face off against Henry and the two vampires he brought with him when Henry helps Aidan in killing the other vampires, having only saved face by pretending to hunt down Aidan and Suren. Henry wants to help Aidan go on the run, but knows that Suren's presence will prevent that. While Aidan thanks Henry, he also partially stakes him so he can tell Mother a good story while he remains with Suren. Back in Boston, Josh goes to seek out Ray, with Nora's knowledge that killing him will cure the both of them, but he sees that Ray has reunited with his family. Ray finds Josh and advises him that he should tell his loved ones the truth, something that Josh struggles with when he returns to Boston to find that his and Julia's old mutual friend from Ithaca Chelsea has come to town to see the both of them. While he deals with reuniting with an old friend, Sally seeks out Zoe at the hospital to ask for forgiveness, but cannot find her in the nursery. Sally manages to find her, when Zoe reveals that being in the nursery only gives her bad memories and she does not want to help ghosts anymore. At a restaurant, Josh has met up with Julia and Chelsea to reveal they are a couple, once more. When Julia gets up from the table, Chelsea sternly asks Josh to tell Julia the truth about matters, before leaving when Julia returns. Sally follows Zoe, trying to get her to change her mind about ghosts when they realize that there is a solar eclipse happening. Walter, one of the ghosts Sally shredded, suddenly appears in the park, and when Sally tells Zoe this is where she shredded him she remembers that solar eclipses somehow weaken the barrier between the living and spiritual worlds. Sally realizes that means Nick must have rematerialized as well, and they both head to the brownstone. Julia and Josh enjoy each other's company, and just as Josh is ready to tell Julia that he is a werewolf the solar eclipse begins to affect him, as well, beginning a partial transformation. He runs out of the restaurant, Julia following him, until he is met with a dead end in an alleyway. He turns to face Julia, partially transformed, startling her as she backs up into the street and is hit by a car. Josh rushes to her aid, but still transforming, runs away from the growing crowd. Sally makes it to the house to talk to Nick, who reveals that they are in some sort of terrifying [[purgatory]], that they call [[Limbo]], where they can only feel pain but not existence. When Zoe arrives, Sally stays with Danny who is actually happy to see her, knowing that he somewhat deserves his fate in Limbo, while Nick lies to Zoe that he is now in a better place. The eclipse ends and the two return back to purgatory. Zoe thanks Sally for letting her see Nick one last time, while Sally feels guilty that she has put so many in such a terrifying place. Aidan, however, has driven many miles to [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], to the hiding place of the Dutch to seek help from Atlee, who has since been made the leader of the Dutch because of the werewolf Aidan gave him. Aidan blackmails him into giving himself and Suren a place to hide and returns to the motel, only to find that Suren has left. Suren, feeling the blood withdrawal symptoms and not enjoying her situation has returned to Boston on her own to reclaim her place as its leader. That night, Josh returns to the accident scene to reveal the truth to Julia, but she reveals that she has already died and Josh is speaking to her ghost. She tells him he should have been truthful from the start, but she has always loved him, before her Door appears and she uses it to pass through to the other side.\n |LineColor = 490709\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 26\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n |Title = It's My Party and I'll Die If I Want To\n |DirectedBy = Adam Kane\n |WrittenBy = Jeremy Carver & Anna Fricke\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|4|9}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-46\n |Viewers = 1.38<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/10/monday-cable-ratings-pawn-stars-wins-night-wwe-raw-basketball-wives-hardcore-history-secret-life-of-the-american-teen-la-las-full-court-life-more/128247/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Pawn Stars' Wins Night, 'WWE Raw', 'Basketball Wives', 'Hardcore History', 'Secret Life of the American Teen', 'La La's Full Court Life' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Josh resolves to kill Ray to save both himself and Nora from the werewolf curse while Aidan resolves to kill Mother so he and Suren may be together at last. Josh enlists Sally to possess Ray's wife, using her to call Ray out to a deserted stretch of road under the guise of fixing a flat tire. However, this act brings the Reaper entity back into Sally's mind. Once Ray arrives, Josh marches Ray out into the woods at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Aidan infiltrates Mother's coven and attempts to kill her and finds that Henry (who helped Aidan get inside) has been severely beaten and may be dead. Aidan is eventually captured and brought before Mother, who kills Suren in front of him. As she turns to ashes, Aidan screams in fury and attempts to kill Mother but is overpowered. Aidan is then locked in a coffin and buried alive. Elsewhere, Sally returns to the hospital to seek out her mother so she may shred her in order for Sally to be able to enter Limbo to save all of the ghosts she shredded herself, as taking another ghost's Door would condemn them to insanity. Rena refuses to kill her own daughter, and after she disappears Sally comes across Nora and she tells her Josh's plans. Sally returns back to their shared house, the Reaper still taunting her, as Rena approaches her to tell Sally how proud she is of her now that she's become so strong in death. The reconciliation brings Rena's Door forth and she offers it to Sally, believing that if she can find a way back from the Door, another will come for her. Sally thanks her mother for the offer, but takes her fate into her own hands by shredding herself, all while the Reaper protests until he too is destroyed with Sally's spirit. Back in the woods, Josh hesitates shooting Ray, who then attacks Josh and knocks the gun from his hand. Before Ray can kill Josh, Nora arrives armed with her own weapon. She and Ray have a stand-off and everything fades to black as a gunshot is heard. With Aidan buried alive and Josh's fate unknown, the empty brownhouse is quiet until a radio starts to tune itself into a particular station.

He was the penultimate [[Grand Chancellor of China|Chancellor]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] who rose to great power in the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years of the dynasty]]. As one of the central figures of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of [[Cao Wei]] and ultimately the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], and was posthumously honoured as \"Emperor Wu of Wei\" although he never was an emperor during his life time. He is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature; however, he has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius with unrivalled charisma who treated his subordinates like his family. He is still a very disputed historical figure but there is no question that he was the most successful warlord of his time.\n\nDuring the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure most of Northern China - the most populated and developed part of China. Cao Cao was also very successful in restoring public order and rebuilding the economy as the [[Grand chancellor (China)|imperial chancellor]]; however his manipulation of [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] as a puppet and figurehead was heavily criticised, with state affairs effectively being controlled by Cao Cao instead of the emperor himself. Opposition directly gathered around warlords [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]], whom Cao Cao was unable to quell.\n\nCao Cao was also skilled in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] and wrote many war journals including remarks added to ''[[The Art of War]]'' written by [[Sun Tzu]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{Further|History of the Han dynasty}}\n\nCao Cao was born in Qiao, [[Principality of Pei]] (present-day [[Bozhou]], [[Anhui]]), in 155.<ref name=\"auto\">de Crespigny (2010), p. 35</ref> His father [[Cao Song]] was a foster son of [[Cao Teng]], who in turn was one of the favourite [[eunuch]]s of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]]. Some historical records, including the ''Biography of Cao Man'', claim that Cao Song's original family name was [[Xiahou]] and that he was thus a relative of [[Xiahou Dun]], however not all sources agree on this.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nCao was known for his craftiness as an adolescent. According to the ''Biography of Cao Man'', Cao Cao's uncle complained to Cao Song about Cao Cao's indulgence in hunting and music with [[Yuan Shao]]. In retaliation, Cao Cao feigned a fit before his uncle, who immediately rushed to inform Cao Song. When Cao Song went to see his son, Cao Cao behaved normally. When asked, Cao Cao replied, \"I have never had a fit, but I lost the love of my uncle, and therefore he deceived you.\" Afterwards, Cao Song ceased to believe his brother regarding Cao Cao, and thus Cao Cao became even more blatant and insistent in his wayward pursuits.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAt that time, there was a man named [[Xu Shao]] who lived in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]] and was famous for his ability to evaluate a person's potentials and talents. Cao Cao paid him a visit in hopes of receiving an evaluation that would help him politically. At first, Xu Shao refused to make a statement; however, under persistent questioning, he finally said, \"You would be a capable minister in peaceful times and an unscrupulous hero in chaotic times.\"<ref>(\u6cbb\u4e16\u4e4b\u80fd\u81e3\uff0c\u4e71\u4e16\u4e4b\u5978\u96c4\u3002) Chen Shou.

Upon taking up the post, he placed rows of multicolored stakes outside his office and ordered his deputies to flog those who violated the law, regardless of their status. An uncle of [[Jian Shuo]], one of the most powerful and influential eunuchs under [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], was caught walking in the city after the evening curfew by Cao Cao's men and was flogged. This prompted Jian Shuo and other higher authorities to ostensibly promote Cao Cao to the post of governor of [[Qingfeng County|Dunqiu County]] while actually moving him out of the imperial capital. Cao Cao remained in this position for little more than a year, being dismissed from office in 178 for his distant family ties with the disgraced [[Empress Song (Han dynasty)|Empress Song]].<ref>de Crespigny (2010), pp. 33\u201334</ref> Around 180, Cao Cao returned to court as a Consultant (\u8b70\u90ce) and presented two memoranda against the eunuchs' influence in court and government corruption during his tenure, to limited effect.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184, Cao Cao was recalled to Luoyang and appointed Captain of the Cavalry (\u9a0e\u90fd\u5c09) and sent to [[Yingchuan]] in [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]] to suppress the rebels. He was successful and was sent to [[Jinan Commandery|Jinan]] as Chancellor (\u76f8) to prevent the spread of Yellow Turban influence there. In Jinan, Cao Cao aggressively enforced the ban on unorthodox cults, destroyed shrines, and supported state [[Confucianism]]. He offended the local leading families in the process, and resigned on grounds of poor health around 187, fearing that he had put his family in danger.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 39</ref> He was offered the post of Administrator of [[Dong Commandery]] (\u6771\u90e1), but he declined and returned to his home in [[Pei County]]. Around that time, Wang Fen (\u738b\u82ac) tried to recruit Cao Cao to join his coup to replace Emperor Ling with the Marquis of Hefei, but Cao Cao refused. The plot came to nothing, and Wang Fen killed himself.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 40</ref>\n\n== Alliance against Dong Zhuo (189\u2013191) ==\n{{Main|Campaign against Dong Zhuo}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:5px; float:right; width:20%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|A summary of the major events in Cao Cao's life\n|-\n| 155\n| Born in Qiao.\n|-\n| 180s\n| Led troops against [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in [[Yuzhou (nine ancient provinces)|Yingchuan]].\n|-\n| 190\n| Joined the [[coalition against Dong Zhuo]].\n|-\n| 196\n| Received [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] in [[Xuchang|Xu City]].\n|-\n| 200\n| Won the [[Battle of Guandu]].\n|-\n| 208\n| Lost the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n|-\n| 213\n| Created Duke of Wei and given ten commanderies as his dukedom.\n|-\n| 216\n| Received the title King of Wei.\n|-\n| 220\n| Died in [[Luoyang]].\n|-\n| \u2014\n| Enthroned posthumously as Emperor Wu.\n|}\n\nAfter 18 months in retirement, Cao Cao returned to the capital [[Luoyang]] in 188. That year, he was appointed Colonel Who Arranges the Army (\u5178\u8ecd\u6821\u5c09), fourth of eight heads of a newly established imperial army, the [[Army of the Western Garden]]. The effectiveness of this new force was never tested, since it was disbanded the very next year.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 43</ref>\n\nIn 189, Emperor Ling died and was succeeded by his eldest son ([[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]]), although state power was mainly controlled by [[Empress He (Han dynasty)|Empress Dowager He]] and her advisors. The empress dowager's brother, General-in-Chief [[He Jin]], plotted with [[Yuan Shao]] to eliminate the [[Ten Attendants]] (a group of influential eunuchs in the imperial court). He Jin summoned [[Dong Zhuo]], a seasoned general of [[Liang Province]], to lead an army into [[Luoyang]] to pressure the empress dowager to surrender power, braving accusations of Dong's \"infamy\". But before Dong Zhuo arrived, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuchs and Luoyang was thrown into chaos as Yuan Shao's supporters [[Massacre of the Eunuchs|fought the eunuchs]]. Dong Zhuo's army easily rid the palace grounds of opposition. After he deposed Emperor Shao, Dong Zhuo placed the puppet [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] on the throne, since he deemed that Emperor Xian was more capable than the original puppet Emperor Shao.\n\nAfter rejecting Dong Zhuo's offer of appointment, Cao Cao left Luoyang for Chenliu (southeast of present-day [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]], Cao's hometown), where he built an army. The next year, regional warlords [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|formed a military alliance]] under Yuan Shao against Dong. Cao Cao joined them, becoming one of the few active fighting members of the coalition. Although the warlords liberated the capital of Luoyang, Dong Zhuo's court managed to flee westwards to the former capital of [[Chang'an]], abducting Emperor Xian. The coalition fell apart after months of inactivity, and China fell into civil war while Dong Zhuo was killed in 192 by [[L\u00fc Bu]].\n\n== Carving a territory (191\u2013199) ==\n[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Cao Cao]]\n\n=== Conquest of Yan Province (191\u2013195) ===\n{{Main|Cao Cao's invasion of Xu Province|Battle of Yan Province}}\n\nThrough short-term and regional-scale wars, Cao Cao continued to expand his power. In 191, Cao Cao was appointed Administrator of Dong commandery (Dongjun) in [[Chenliu]]. This happened after he successfully fought against the bandit chieftain Bo Rao, and Yuan Shao named him Administrator in the stead of the ineffectual Wang Hong. He cleared Dong of bandits, and when the Inspector of [[Yan Province]] [[Liu Dai]] died the following year, he was invited by [[Bao Xun]] and other officers to become the Governor of Yan Province, and deal with an uprising of Yellow Turbans in [[Qing Province]] who raided Yan. Despite several setbacks, Cao Cao managed to subdue the rebels by the end of 192, likely through negotiations, and added their 30,000 troops to his army.<ref name=\"2006dict36\">{{Cite book |last=de Crespigny |first=Rafe |date=2006 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49OvCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |pages=35\u201339 |isbn=9789047411840 |accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref> In early 193, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao fought against the latter's cousin [[Yuan Shu]] in several battles such as [[Battle of Fengqiu|Fengqiu]], driving him away to the River Huai.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36}}\n\nCao Cao's father [[Cao Song]] was killed in autumn 193 by troops of [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]], governor of [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu Province]] (who claimed to be innocent, and that Cao Song's murderers had been [[mutiny|mutineers]]). Enraged, Cao Cao massacred thousands of civilians in Xu during two punitive expeditions in 193 and 194, to avenge his father.<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/> Because he took the bulk of his soldiers to Xu Province in order to defeat Tao Qian, most of his territory was left undefended. A number of discontented officers led by [[Chen Gong]] and [[Zhang Chao]] ([[Zhang Miao]]\u2019s brother) plotted to rebel. They convinced Zhang Miao to be their leader, and to ask [[L\u00fc Bu]] to come with reinforcements. Chen Gong invited L\u00fc Bu to be the new Inspector of Yan province. L\u00fc Bu accepted this invitation and led his soldiers into the province. Since Cao Cao's army was away, many of the local commanders figured that fighting would be a lost cause and surrendered to L\u00fc Bu as soon as he arrived. However three counties \u2013 Juancheng, Dong\u2019a, and Fan, remained loyal to Cao Cao and when Cao Cao returned, he gathered his own forces at Juancheng.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThroughout 194 and 195, Cao Cao and L\u00fc Bu fought several battles of some size for the control of Yan Province. Though L\u00fc Bu initially did well in holding [[Puyang]], Cao Cao won almost every engagement outside of Puyang. Cao Cao's decisive victory came in a battle near Dongming.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} L\u00fc Bu and Chen Gong led a large army to assault Cao Cao's forces. At that time, Cao Cao was out with a small army, harvesting grain. Seeing L\u00fc Bu and Chen Gong approaching, Cao Cao hid his soldiers in some woods and behind a dam. He then sent a small force ahead to skirmish with L\u00fc Bu's army. Once the two forces were committed, he unleashed his hidden soldiers. L\u00fc Bu's army was devastated by this attack and many of his soldiers fled.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nL\u00fc Bu and Chen Gong both fled after that battle. Since Xu province was now under [[Liu Bei]]\u2019s command and Liu Bei had been Cao Cao\u2019s enemy in the past, they fled to Xu for safety. Cao Cao decided not to pursue them and instead set about crushing L\u00fc Bu\u2019s loyalists in Yan, consolidating his hold over that province. Eighteen months after the rebellion started, Cao had destroyed Zhang Miao and his family, and regained Yan Province by the end of 195.<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/>\n\n=== Securing the emperor (196) ===\nCao Cao moved his headquarters in early 196 from Puyang to Xu City (\u8a31, present-day [[Xuchang]]), where he built military agricultural colonies for the settlement of refugees and supply of food for his troops.<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/>\n\nAround August 196, [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] returned to Luoyang under the escort of [[Yang Feng]] and [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]]. Cao Cao joined Emperor Xian in autumn 196<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/> and convinced him to move the capital to Xu City as suggested by [[Xun Yu]] and other advisors, as Luoyang was ruined by war and [[Chang'an]] was not under Cao's military control. He was appointed [[Ministry of Works (imperial China)|Minister of Works]] (after negotiating with his nominal superior Yuan Shao), and Director of Retainers (\u53f8\u96b8 S\u012b l\u00ec), granting him nominal control over [[Sili Province]].<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/> Furthermore, he became General-in-Chief (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd) and Marquis of Wuping (\u6b66\u5e73\u4faf), though both titles had little practical application. While some viewed the emperor as a puppet under Cao Cao's control, Cao adhered to a strict personal code until his death that he would not usurp the throne. When he was approached by his advisors to overthrow the Han dynasty and start his own dynasty, he replied, \"If heaven bestows such a fate upon me, let me be [[King Wen of Zhou]].\"<ref>(\u82e5\u5929\u547d\u5728\u543e\uff0c\u543e\u4e3a\u5468\u6587\u738b\u77e3\u3002) Chen Shou. ''Records of Three Kingdoms'', Volume 1, Biography of Cao Cao. King Wen was a high official at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]] in ancient China. At the time, the corruption of [[King Zhou of Shang]] prompted many uprisings, including that of King Wen; but King Wen insisted that he would not take the throne himself as it is improper for him, a subordinate, to harm the Shang dynasty. Instead, he allowed his son ([[King Wu of Zhou]]) to destroy the Shang dynasty and establish the [[Zhou dynasty]] after his own death, and thus fulfilling his personal code of honour but also ridding the world of a terrible ruler. He was then named King Wen of Zhou posthumously by King Wu of Zhou. Here, Cao Cao was inferring that if the Cao family were to come to power and establish a new dynasty, it would be by his descendants and not him.</ref>\n\nTo maintain a good relationship with Yuan Shao, who had become the most powerful warlord in China when he united the northern four provinces, Cao Cao lobbied to have Yuan appointed Minister of Works. However, this had the opposite effect, as Yuan Shao believed that Cao Cao was trying to humiliate him, since Minister of Works technically ranked lower than General-in-Chief, and therefore refused to accept the title. To pacify Yuan Shao, Cao Cao offered his own position to him, while becoming Minister of Works himself. While this temporarily resolved the conflict, it was the catalyst for the [[Battle of Guandu]] later.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Battling Zhang Xiu, Yuan Shu, and L\u00fc Bu (197\u2013198) ===\n[[File:Dahuting Tomb mural, cavalry and chariots, Eastern Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|400px|A mural showing chariots and cavalry, from the [[Dahuting]] Tomb of the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25\u2013220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China]]\n{{Further|War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu}}\n[[Liu Biao]] was a major power at that time, holding all of Jing province. Jing had always been prosperous, but it had grown in size because many people fled from the northern wars and sought refuge there. Therefore, Liu Biao constituted a danger to Cao Cao. [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] commanded Liu Biao's territory on the border with Cao Cao, so Cao Cao went to attack him. In early 197 Zhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao, but later attacked his camp in the night (the [[War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu#Battle of Wancheng|Battle of Wancheng]]), killing many people and forcing Cao Cao to flee.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36}}\n\nAfter taking a few months to recover, Cao Cao turned his attention to [[Yuan Shu]], who had recently proclaimed himself emperor of his new Zhong dynasty. In the name of restoring the Han dynasty, Cao Cao and other warlords formed a [[Campaign against Yuan Shu|coalition against Yuan Shu]], and Cao Cao seized all Yuan Shu's holdings north of the Huai River in the autumn of 197, while the latter's remaining territory suffered drought and a bad harvest, further decreasing his power.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=1012\u20131013}}\n\nLater in 197, Cao Cao returned south to attack Liu Biao/Zhang Xiu once more. This time, Cao Cao was very successful and greatly damaged their army. Cao Cao attacked Zhang Xiu again in 198 leading to the [[War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu|Battle of Rangcheng]] and was again victorious. He ultimately retreated from this campaign because he received word that Yuan Shao was planning to march on Xu, though this report turned out to be in error.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36}}\n\nIn April 198, Cao Cao sent envoys to incite the western warlords to attack Chang'an, still controlled by Dong Zhuo's successor [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]]. One of Li Jue's subordinates, Duan Wei (\u6bb5\u7168), mutinied and killed Li Jue along with his family in the summer of 198. Duan Wei sent Li Jue's head to Xu City (as a token of his submission to Cao Cao).<ref>de Crespigny, Rafe (2006), p. 418.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, L\u00fc Bu was growing more aggressive. He drove Liu Bei (who fled to Cao Cao) out of his territory again and allied with Yuan Shu. Since Zhang Xiu had recently been crushed, he was in no position to be a threat in the south, so Cao Cao went east to deal with L\u00fc Bu.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36}}\n\n=== Conquest of Xu and Yu Provinces (199) ===\n{{Further|Battle of Xiapi|Campaign against Yuan Shu}}\nCao Cao defeated L\u00fc Bu in numerous battles and eventually surrounded him at [[Battle of Xiapi|Xiapi]]. L\u00fc Bu tried to break free but could not do so. Ultimately, many of his officers and soldiers defected to Cao Cao. Some were kidnapped by defectors. L\u00fc Bu grew disheartened and surrendered to Cao Cao, who executed him on 7 February 199.{{efn|name=death date|The Australian sinologist [[Rafe de Crespigny]] wrote in ''A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms 23-220 AD'' that L\u00fc Bu died in the year 198.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=624-625}} This date is incorrect even though the 3rd year of the Jian'an era of the reign of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] largely corresponds to the year 198 in the Gregorian calendar. That is because the 11th month of the 3rd year of Jian'an was from 16 December 198 to 14 January 199 in the Gregorian calendar, so the 12th month was already into the year 199. The ''Zizhi Tongjian'' recorded that L\u00fc Bu surrendered to Cao Cao on the ''guiyou'' day of the 12th month of the 3rd year of the Jian'an era.

[[Liu Bei]], then a guest in Yuan Shao's army, suggested that he instigate rebellion in Cao Cao's territories as many followers of Yuan were in Cao's lands.

The people resorted to cannibalism out of desperation. Without food, many armies were defeated without fighting. From this experience, Cao Cao saw the importance of an ample food supply in building a strong military. He began a series of agricultural programs in cities such as Xu City and Chenliu. Refugees were recruited and given wasteland to cultivate. Later, encampments not faced with imminent danger of war were also made to farm. This system was continued and spread to all regions under Cao Cao as his realm expanded. Although Cao Cao's primary intention was to build a powerful army, the agricultural program also improved the living standards of the people, especially war refugees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nBy 203, Cao Cao had eliminated most of [[Yuan Shao]]'s forces. This afforded him more attention on construction within his realm. In autumn of that year, Cao Cao passed an order decreeing the promotion of education throughout the counties and cities within his jurisdiction. An official in charge of education was assigned to each county with more than 500 households. Youngsters with potential and talent were selected for schooling.

He was sceptical about whether those who claim to be Cao Cao's descendants are really so, because genealogical records dating from the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279) are already so rare in the present day, much less those dating from the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220\u2013280). Besides, according to historical records, Cao Ding was a younger brother of the eunuch [[Cao Teng]], who adopted Cao Cao's biological father, [[Cao Song]]. Therefore, Cao Cao had no known blood relations with Cao Ding. In other words, Cao Ding was not Cao Cao's real granduncle (this assuming that there was no intra-family adoption, which was actually common in China). Zhu Ziyan mentioned that Fudan University's research only proves that those self-proclaimed descendants of Cao Cao are related to Cao Ding; it does not directly relate them to Cao Cao.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u4e0a\u6d77\u5b78\u8005\u5546\u69b7\u5fa9\u65e6\u66f9\u64cdDNA\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u50c5\u6191\u66f9\u9f0e\u7259\u9f52\u96e3\u63ed\u8eab\u4e16 [Scholars from Shanghai (University) discuss Fudan (University)'s research on Cao Cao's DNA: A tooth from Cao Ding is insufficient to determine (Cao Cao's) ancestry]|url=http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/chn/chnpolitics/phoenixtv/20131211/02105257954.html|website=Sina News|accessdate=30 August 2014|language=Chinese|date=11 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poetry}}\n* [[Cao Wei family trees]]\n* [[Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms]]\n* [[Empty Fort Strategy]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Reflist|group=Sanguozhi zhu}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|author=[[Chen Shou]]|title=[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]|publisher=Yue Lu Shu She|year=2002|isbn=7-80665-198-5}}\n* Domes, Jurgen.

[[courtesy name]] '''Mengde''', was a Chinese warlord and poet. He was the penultimate [[Grand Chancellor of China|Chancellor]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] who rose to great power in the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years of the dynasty]]. As one of the central figures of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of [[Cao Wei]] and ultimately the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], and was posthumously honoured as \"Emperor Wu of Wei\" although he never was an emperor during his life time. He is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature; however, he has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius with unrivalled charisma who treated his subordinates like his family. He is still a very disputed historical figure but there is no question that he was the most successful warlord of his time.\n\nDuring the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure most of Northern China - the most populated and developed part of China. Cao Cao was also very successful in restoring public order and rebuilding the economy as the [[Grand chancellor (China)|imperial chancellor]]; however his manipulation of [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] as a puppet and figurehead was heavily criticised, with state affairs effectively being controlled by Cao Cao instead of the emperor himself. Opposition directly gathered around warlords [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]], whom Cao Cao was unable to quell.\n\nCao Cao was also skilled in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] and wrote many war journals including remarks added to famous the Art of War written by Sun Tzu.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Further|History of the Han dynasty}}\n\nCao Cao was born in Qiao, [[Principality of Pei]] (present-day [[Bozhou]], [[Anhui]]), in 155.<ref name=\"auto\">de Crespigny (2010), p. 35</ref> His father [[Cao Song]] was a foster son of [[Cao Teng]], who in turn was one of the favourite [[eunuch]]s of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]]. Some historical records, including the ''Biography of Cao Man'', claim that Cao Song's original family name was [[Xiahou]] and that he was thus a relative of [[Xiahou Dun]], however not all sources agree on this.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nCao was known for his craftiness as an adolescent. According to the ''Biography of Cao Man'', Cao Cao's uncle complained to Cao Song about Cao Cao's indulgence in hunting and music with [[Yuan Shao]]. In retaliation, Cao Cao feigned a fit before his uncle, who immediately rushed to inform Cao Song. When Cao Song went to see his son, Cao Cao behaved normally. When asked, Cao Cao replied, \"I have never had a fit, but I lost the love of my uncle, and therefore he deceived you.\" Afterwards, Cao Song ceased to believe his brother regarding Cao Cao, and thus Cao Cao became even more blatant and insistent in his wayward pursuits.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAt that time, there was a man named [[Xu Shao]] who lived in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]] and was famous for his ability to evaluate a person's potentials and talents. Cao Cao paid him a visit in hopes of receiving an evaluation that would help him politically. At first, Xu Shao refused to make a statement; however, under persistent questioning, he finally said, \"You would be a capable minister in peaceful times and an unscrupulous hero in chaotic times.\"<ref>(\u6cbb\u4e16\u4e4b\u80fd\u81e3\uff0c\u4e71\u4e16\u4e4b\u5978\u96c4\u3002) Chen Shou. ''Records of Three Kingdoms'', Volume 1, Biography of Cao Cao.</ref> Cao Cao laughed and left. There are two other versions of this comment in other unofficial historical records.{{which|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Early career and Yellow Turban Rebellion (175\u2013188) ==\n[[File:Cao Cao statue.jpg|thumb|left|198px|Statue of Cao Cao in [[Wuhan]]]]\n\nAt the age of 20, Cao Cao was appointed district captain of [[Luoyang]]. Upon taking up the post, he placed rows of multicolored stakes outside his office and ordered his deputies to flog those who violated the law, regardless of their status. An uncle of [[Jian Shuo]], one of the most powerful and influential eunuchs under [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], was caught walking in the city after the evening curfew by Cao Cao's men and was flogged. This prompted Jian Shuo and other higher authorities to ostensibly promote Cao Cao to the post of governor of [[Qingfeng County|Dunqiu County]] while actually moving him out of the imperial capital. Cao Cao remained in this position for little more than a year, being dismissed from office in 178 for his distant family ties with the disgraced [[Empress Song (Han dynasty)|Empress Song]].<ref>de Crespigny (2010), pp. 33\u201334</ref> Around 180, Cao Cao returned to court as a Consultant (\u8b70\u90ce) and presented two memoranda against the eunuchs' influence in court and government corruption during his tenure, to limited effect.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184, Cao Cao was recalled to Luoyang and appointed Captain of the Cavalry (\u9a0e\u90fd\u5c09) and sent to [[Yingchuan]] in [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]] to suppress the rebels. He was successful and was sent to [[Jinan Commandery|Jinan]] as Chancellor (\u76f8) to prevent the spread of Yellow Turban influence there. In Jinan, Cao Cao aggressively enforced the ban on unorthodox cults, destroyed shrines, and supported state [[Confucianism]]. He offended the local leading families in the process, and resigned on grounds of poor health around 187, fearing that he had put his family in danger.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 39</ref> He was offered the post of Administrator of [[Dong Commandery]] (\u6771\u90e1), but he declined and returned to his home in [[Pei County]]. Around that time, Wang Fen (\u738b\u82ac) tried to recruit Cao Cao to join his coup to replace Emperor Ling with the Marquis of Hefei, but Cao Cao refused. The plot came to nothing, and Wang Fen killed himself.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 40</ref>\n\n== Alliance against Dong Zhuo (189\u2013191) ==\n{{Main|Campaign against Dong Zhuo}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:5px; float:right; width:20%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|A summary of the major events in Cao Cao's life\n|-\n| 155\n| Born in Qiao.\n|-\n| 180s\n| Led troops against [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in [[Yuzhou (nine ancient provinces)|Yingchuan]].\n|-\n| 190\n| Joined the [[coalition against Dong Zhuo]].\n|-\n| 196\n| Received [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] in [[Xuchang|Xu City]].\n|-\n| 200\n| Won the [[Battle of Guandu]].\n|-\n| 208\n| Lost the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n|-\n| 213\n| Created Duke of Wei and given ten commanderies as his dukedom.\n|-\n| 216\n| Received the title King of Wei.\n|-\n| 220\n| Died in [[Luoyang]].\n|-\n| \u2014\n| Enthroned posthumously as Emperor Wu.\n|}\n\nAfter 18 months in retirement, Cao Cao returned to the capital [[Luoyang]] in 188. That year, he was appointed Colonel Who Arranges the Army (\u5178\u8ecd\u6821\u5c09), fourth of eight heads of a newly established imperial army, the [[Army of the Western Garden]]. The effectiveness of this new force was never tested, since it was disbanded the very next year.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 43</ref>\n\nIn 189, Emperor Ling died and was succeeded by his eldest son ([[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]]), although state power was mainly controlled by [[Empress He (Han dynasty)|Empress Dowager He]] and her advisors. The empress dowager's brother, General-in-Chief [[He Jin]], plotted with [[Yuan Shao]] to eliminate the [[Ten Attendants]] (a group of influential eunuchs in the imperial court). He Jin summoned [[Dong Zhuo]], a seasoned general of [[Liang Province]], to lead an army into [[Luoyang]] to pressure the empress dowager to surrender power, braving accusations of Dong's \"infamy\". But before Dong Zhuo arrived, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuchs and Luoyang was thrown into chaos as Yuan Shao's supporters [[Massacre of the Eunuchs|fought the eunuchs]]. Dong Zhuo's army easily rid the palace grounds of opposition. After he deposed Emperor Shao, Dong Zhuo placed the puppet [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] on the throne, since he deemed that Emperor Xian was more capable than the original puppet Emperor Shao.\n\nAfter rejecting Dong Zhuo's offer of appointment, Cao Cao left Luoyang for Chenliu (southeast of present-day [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]], Cao's hometown), where he built an army. The next year, regional warlords [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|formed a military alliance]] under Yuan Shao against Dong. Cao Cao joined them, becoming one of the few active fighting members of the coalition. Although the warlords liberated the capital of Luoyang, Dong Zhuo's court managed to flee westwards to the former capital of [[Chang'an]], abducting Emperor Xian. The coalition fell apart after months of inactivity, and China fell into civil war while Dong Zhuo was killed in 192 by [[L\u00fc Bu]].\n\n== Carving a territory (191\u2013199) ==\n[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Cao Cao]]\n\n=== Conquest of Yan Province (191\u2013195) ===\n{{Main|Cao Cao's invasion of Xu Province|Battle of Yan Province}}\n\nThrough short-term and regional-scale wars, Cao Cao continued to expand his power. In 191, Cao Cao was appointed Administrator of Dong commandery (Dongjun) in [[Chenliu]]. This happened after he successfully fought against the bandit chieftain Bo Rao, and Yuan Shao named him Administrator in the stead of the ineffectual Wang Hong. He cleared Dong of bandits, and when the Inspector of [[Yan Province]] [[Liu Dai]] died the following year, he was invited by [[Bao Xun]] and other officers to become the Governor of Yan Province, and deal with an uprising of Yellow Turbans in [[Qing Province]] who raided Yan. Despite several setbacks, Cao Cao managed to subdue the rebels by the end of 192, likely through negotiations, and added their 30,000 troops to his army.<ref name=\"2006dict36\">{{Cite book |last=de Crespigny |first=Rafe |date=2006 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49OvCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |pages=35\u201339 |isbn=9789047411840 |accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref> In early 193, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao fought against the latter's cousin [[Yuan Shu]] in several battles such as [[Battle of Fengqiu|Fengqiu]], driving him away to the River Huai.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36}}\n\nCao Cao's father [[Cao Song]] was killed in autumn 193 by troops of [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]], governor of [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu Province]] (who claimed to be innocent, and that Cao Song's murderers had been [[mutiny|mutineers]]). Enraged, Cao Cao massacred thousands of civilians in Xu during two punitive expeditions in 193 and 194, to avenge his father.<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/> Because he took the bulk of his soldiers to Xu Province in order to defeat Tao Qian, most of his territory was left undefended. A number of discontented officers led by [[Chen Gong]] and [[Zhang Chao]] ([[Zhang Miao]]\u2019s brother) plotted to rebel. They convinced Zhang Miao to be their leader, and to ask [[L\u00fc Bu]] to come with reinforcements. Chen Gong invited L\u00fc Bu to be the new Inspector of Yan province. L\u00fc Bu accepted this invitation and led his soldiers into the province. Since Cao Cao's army was away, many of the local commanders figured that fighting would be a lost cause and surrendered to L\u00fc Bu as soon as he arrived. However three counties \u2013 Juancheng, Dong\u2019a, and Fan, remained loyal to Cao Cao and when Cao Cao returned, he gathered his own forces at Juancheng.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThroughout 194 and 195, Cao Cao and L\u00fc Bu fought several battles of some size for the control of Yan Province. Though L\u00fc Bu initially did well in holding [[Puyang]], Cao Cao won almost every engagement outside of Puyang. Cao Cao's decisive victory came in a battle near Dongming.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} L\u00fc Bu and Chen Gong led a large army to assault Cao Cao's forces. At that time, Cao Cao was out with a small army, harvesting grain. Seeing L\u00fc Bu and Chen Gong approaching, Cao Cao hid his soldiers in some woods and behind a dam. He then sent a small force ahead to skirmish with L\u00fc Bu's army. Once the two forces were committed, he unleashed his hidden soldiers. L\u00fc Bu's army was devastated by this attack and many of his soldiers fled.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nL\u00fc Bu and Chen Gong both fled after that battle. Since Xu province was now under [[Liu Bei]]\u2019s command and Liu Bei had been Cao Cao\u2019s enemy in the past, they fled to Xu for safety. Cao Cao decided not to pursue them and instead set about crushing L\u00fc Bu\u2019s loyalists in Yan, consolidating his hold over that province. Eighteen months after the rebellion started, Cao had destroyed Zhang Miao and his family, and regained Yan Province by the end of 195.<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/>\n\n=== Securing the emperor (196) ===\nCao Cao moved his headquarters in early 196 from Puyang to Xu City (\u8a31, present-day [[Xuchang]]), where he built military agricultural colonies for the settlement of refugees and supply of food for his troops.<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/>\n\nAround August 196, [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] returned to Luoyang under the escort of [[Yang Feng]] and [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]]. Cao Cao joined Emperor Xian in autumn 196<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/> and convinced him to move the capital to Xu City as suggested by [[Xun Yu]] and other advisors, as Luoyang was ruined by war and [[Chang'an]] was not under Cao's military control. He was appointed [[Ministry of Works (imperial China)|Minister of Works]] (after negotiating with his nominal superior Yuan Shao), and Director of Retainers (\u53f8\u96b8 S\u012b l\u00ec), granting him nominal control over [[Sili Province]].<ref name=\"2006dict36\"/> Furthermore, he became General-in-Chief (\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd) and Marquis of Wuping (\u6b66\u5e73\u4faf), though both titles had little practical application. While some viewed the emperor as a puppet under Cao Cao's control, Cao adhered to a strict personal code until his death that he would not usurp the throne. When he was approached by his advisors to overthrow the Han dynasty and start his own dynasty, he replied, \"If heaven bestows such a fate upon me, let me be [[King Wen of Zhou]].\"<ref>(\u82e5\u5929\u547d\u5728\u543e\uff0c\u543e\u4e3a\u5468\u6587\u738b\u77e3\u3002) Chen Shou. ''Records of Three Kingdoms'', Volume 1, Biography of Cao Cao. King Wen was a high official at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]] in ancient China. At the time, the corruption of [[King Zhou of Shang]] prompted many uprisings, including that of King Wen; but King Wen insisted that he would not take the throne himself as it is improper for him, a subordinate, to harm the Shang dynasty. Instead, he allowed his son ([[King Wu of Zhou]]) to destroy the Shang dynasty and establish the [[Zhou dynasty]] after his own death, and thus fulfilling his personal code of honour but also ridding the world of a terrible ruler. He was then named King Wen of Zhou posthumously by King Wu of Zhou. Here, Cao Cao was inferring that if the Cao family were to come to power and establish a new dynasty, it would be by his descendants and not him.</ref>\n\nTo maintain a good relationship with Yuan Shao, who had become the most powerful warlord in China when he united the northern four provinces, Cao Cao lobbied to have Yuan appointed Minister of Works. However, this had the opposite effect, as Yuan Shao believed that Cao Cao was trying to humiliate him, since Minister of Works technically ranked lower than General-in-Chief, and therefore refused to accept the title. To pacify Yuan Shao, Cao Cao offered his own position to him, while becoming Minister of Works himself. While this temporarily resolved the conflict, it was the catalyst for the [[Battle of Guandu]] later.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Battling Zhang Xiu, Yuan Shu, and L\u00fc Bu (197\u2013198) ===\n[[File:Dahuting Tomb mural, cavalry and chariots, Eastern Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|400px|A mural showing chariots and cavalry, from the [[Dahuting]] Tomb of the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25\u2013220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China]]\n{{Further|War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu}}\n[[Liu Biao]] was a major power at that time, holding all of Jing province. Jing had always been prosperous, but it had grown in size because many people fled from the northern wars and sought refuge there. Therefore, Liu Biao constituted a danger to Cao Cao. [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] commanded Liu Biao's territory on the border with Cao Cao, so Cao Cao went to attack him. In early 197 Zhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao, but later attacked his camp in the night (the [[War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu#Battle of Wancheng|Battle of Wancheng]]), killing many people and forcing Cao Cao to flee.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36}}\n\nAfter taking a few months to recover, Cao Cao turned his attention to [[Yuan Shu]], who had recently proclaimed himself emperor of his new Zhong dynasty. In the name of restoring the Han dynasty, Cao Cao and other warlords formed a [[Campaign against Yuan Shu|coalition against Yuan Shu]], and Cao Cao seized all Yuan Shu's holdings north of the Huai River in the autumn of 197, while the latter's remaining territory suffered drought and a bad harvest, further decreasing his power.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=1012\u20131013}}\n\nLater in 197, Cao Cao returned south to attack Liu Biao/Zhang Xiu once more. This time, Cao Cao was very successful and greatly damaged their army. Cao Cao attacked Zhang Xiu again in 198 leading to the [[War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu|Battle of Rangcheng]] and was again victorious. He ultimately retreated from this campaign because he received word that Yuan Shao was planning to march on Xu, though this report turned out to be in error.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36}}\n\nIn April 198, Cao Cao sent envoys to incite the western warlords to attack Chang'an, still controlled by Dong Zhuo's successor [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]]. One of Li Jue's subordinates, Duan Wei (\u6bb5\u7168), mutinied and killed Li Jue along with his family in the summer of 198. Duan Wei sent Li Jue's head to Xu City (as a token of his submission to Cao Cao).<ref>de Crespigny, Rafe (2006), p. 418.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, L\u00fc Bu was growing more aggressive. He drove Liu Bei (who fled to Cao Cao) out of his territory again and allied with Yuan Shu. Since Zhang Xiu had recently been crushed, he was in no position to be a threat in the south, so Cao Cao went east to deal with L\u00fc Bu.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36}}\n\n=== Conquest of Xu and Yu Provinces (199) ===\n{{Further|Battle of Xiapi|Campaign against Yuan Shu}}\nCao Cao defeated L\u00fc Bu in numerous battles and eventually surrounded him at [[Battle of Xiapi|Xiapi]]. L\u00fc Bu tried to break free but could not do so. Ultimately, many of his officers and soldiers defected to Cao Cao. Some were kidnapped by defectors. L\u00fc Bu grew disheartened and surrendered to Cao Cao, who executed him on 7 February 199.{{efn|name=death date|The Australian sinologist [[Rafe de Crespigny]] wrote in ''A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms 23-220 AD'' that L\u00fc Bu died in the year 198.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=624-625}} This date is incorrect even though the 3rd year of the Jian'an era of the reign of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] largely corresponds to the year 198 in the Gregorian calendar.

Although Cao Cao's primary intention was to build a powerful army, the agricultural program also improved the living standards of the people, especially war refugees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nBy 203, Cao Cao had eliminated most of [[Yuan Shao]]'s forces. This afforded him more attention on construction within his realm. In autumn of that year, Cao Cao passed an order decreeing the promotion of education throughout the counties and cities within his jurisdiction. An official in charge of education was assigned to each county with more than 500 households. Youngsters with potential and talent were selected for schooling. This prevented a lapse in the training of intellectuals in those years of war, and, in Cao Cao's words, would benefit the people.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Poetry===\n[[File:Long Corridor-\u66f9\u64cd\u8d4b\u8bd7.JPG|thumb|300px|Cao Cao cites a poem before the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]], portrait at the [[Long Corridor]] of the [[Summer Palace]], Beijing]]\n{{main|Poetry of Cao Cao}}\n\nCao Cao was an accomplished poet, as were his sons [[Cao Pi]] and [[Cao Zhi]]. He was also a patron of poets such as [[Xu Gan]].<ref>Davis, p. vi</ref> Of Cao Cao's works, only a remnant remain today. His verses, unpretentious yet profound, helped to reshape the poetic style of his time and beyond, eventually contributing to the poetry styles associated with [[Tang poetry|Tang dynasty poetry]]. Cao Cao, Cao Pi and Cao Zhi are known collectively as the \"Three Caos\". The Three Caos' poetry, together with additional poets, became known as the [[Jian'an poetry|''Jian'an'' style]], which contributed eventually to Tang and later poetry. Cao Cao also wrote verse in the older four-character per line style characteristic of the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]''. [[Burton Watson]] describes Cao Cao as: \"the only writer of the period who succeeded in infusing the old four-character metre with any vitality, mainly because he discarded the archaic diction associated with it and employed the ordinary poetic language of his time.\"<ref>Watson, p. 38</ref> Cao Cao is also known for his early contributions to the [[Shanshui poetry]] genre, with his 4-character-per-line, 14-line poem [http://www.vincentpoon.com/the-sea------.html \"View of the Blue Sea\" (\u89c0\u6ec4\u6d77)].<ref>Yip, 130\u201333</ref>\n\n== Alleged mausoleum ==\n{{main|Cao Cao Mausoleum}}\n\nOn 27 December 2009, the Henan Provincial Cultural Heritage Bureau reported the discovery of Cao Cao's tomb in Xigaoxue Village, [[Anyang County]], [[Henan]].

Its discovery was not reported and the local authorities knew of it only when they seized a stone tablet carrying the inscription 'King Wu of Wei' \u2014 Cao Cao's posthumous title \u2014 from grave robbers who claimed to have stolen it from the tomb.

He was sceptical about whether those who claim to be Cao Cao's descendants are really so, because genealogical records dating from the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279) are already so rare in the present day, much less those dating from the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220\u2013280). Besides, according to historical records, Cao Ding was a younger brother of the eunuch [[Cao Teng]], who adopted Cao Cao's biological father, [[Cao Song]]. Therefore, Cao Cao had no known blood relations with Cao Ding. In other words, Cao Ding was not Cao Cao's real granduncle (this assuming that there was no intra-family adoption, which was actually common in China).

Close to the full moon, Josh is still upset that he almost killed a vampire and he asks Ray to leave after the night is through. Ray tries to convince him that the wolf is not a curse and that he wants to make a pack with Josh, revealing that he was the one who turned Josh two years earlier. Aidan attacks the vampire priest and removes the priest's fangs. Elsewhere, Sally uses her poltergeist-like powers to wreck Danny's apartment in revenge. Ray wakes up and Josh tells him to stay away from him. The priest learns from Bishop that his fangs won't grow back, and Danny finds his apartment wrecked and Sally's ring in the middle. Back at the house Josh makes dinner for Aidan, Sally, and himself (even though he's the only one who eats) and reveals that Ray was the one who cursed him.\n |LineColor = A61C1C\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Being Human (North American season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = It Takes Two to Make a Thing Go Wrong\n |DirectedBy = Charles Binam\u00e9\n |WrittenBy = Jeremy Carver & Anna Fricke\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2011|2|21}}\n |ProdCode = 137959-26\n |Viewers = 1.39<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/02/23/monday-cable-ratings-wwe-raw-leads-night-pretty-little-liars-skins-rises-big-time-rush-being-human-more/83568|title=Monday Cable Ratings: WWE Raw Leads Night; 'Pretty Little Liars,' 'Skins' Rises + 'Big Time Rush,' 'Being Human' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Danny throws away Sally's engagement ring and it finds its way back to her, and she discovers it is an object that she can hold.

When their father, a psychologist, comes home, he confronts Josh about his lycanthropy, which he believes is a case [[clinical lycanthropy]]. Back in Boston, Aidan confronts Bishop about Marcus' actions, but Bishop only says that it is how a werewolf would be treated after one attacks a vampire. Josh tries to explain to his father that he is not suffering from a psychosis when Aidan drops by to try to help things, only for the garlic in Josh's mother's cooking to cause his vampire attributes to surface. Marcus arrives at the house and Josh locks him out. Aidan attacks Marcus, but Marcus leaves of his own accord. Josh admits to his family the truth about being a werewolf and later talks with Aidan about revealing the truth to loved ones, deciding he will stay at home.

Bernie believes he has superpowers now and plans on only using them to hurt bad people, but Aidan tells him he should not hurt any humans. Later, Aidan comes across a crime scene with the bullies killed and Bishop berates him for having turned a child, despite Aidan telling him it was Rebecca who turned Bernie.

Aidan attempts to interfere but the fight still takes place. Despite the other werewolf's greater size and experience, Josh is able to emerge victorious.

The Dutch want Bishop to return with them after culling his family by two-thirds. Josh finally manages to talk with Nora, saying that he did not know if he could get anyone pregnant. Nora also agrees that she was not sure if she could get pregnant for the same real reasons. In a last-ditch effort, Sally possesses the exorcist, lashing out at Danny in the exorcist's body until he throws her against the wall, separating them. However, the exorcist has seen Sally's memories of her death and ends the ritual, saying that Danny deserves whatever Sally has in store for him.

Aidan's memories of Celine are further shown, revealing her pressuring to become a vampire and Bishop's threatening visit, leading Aidan to want to take Celine on the run. Meanwhile, Sally visits Danny, using her ghostly powers to make him hurt himself, which brings her back to normal. In an effort to eliminate Sally, Danny attempts to burn the house down, but Sally uses her ghostly abilities to trap him there until Aidan and Josh get home. Josh puts out the fire and Aidan attacks Danny, both revealing that they can see Sally and that they are not human. Aidan prepares to kill Danny at Sally's beckoning, but Josh pleads with both that Sally should not have a life on her hands. Sally acquiesces but then appears to Danny, saying that she will make his life a living hell unless he admits the arson and her murder to the police. Later, Nora has an [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]], and the obstetrician reveals that the baby is healthy, but Nora is fourteen weeks pregnant rather than seven. Aidan goes to Celine, offering to turn her into a vampire now but she declines. Aidan also asks her why she was not home when he went to pick her up to take her out of Montreal, but she does not reveal to him that Bishop kidnapped her, raped her, drank her blood and threatened her family.

Sally, who returned home at Aidan's request, finds that her door has disappeared and that she can now interact with physical objects. Celine returns and comforts Aidan, revealing to him what Bishop did to her years ago and asking him to take her life to restore his. Reluctantly Aidan drains Celine's blood which allows him to heal rapidly.

Aidan gets Josh his job as an orderly at the hospital. At the hospital, Josh is accosted by Bishop, who says he wants to fight Aidan at a factory. Sally and Josh decide to protect Aidan by telling Bishop that Aidan wants to fight at the hospital basement. They plan to lock Bishop in the basement with Josh, who by then will have turned into a werewolf and will be able to kill Bishop. Josh leaves Nora a good-bye note and heads for the basement to transform. Aidan figures out what Josh is doing and has Sally lock him in the room alone and tells Bishop the fight will indeed be at the factory. However, Nora has followed Josh and enters the room to find him at the mid-point of his transformation.

Back in Boston, Aidan confronts Bishop about Marcus' actions, but Bishop only says that it is how a werewolf would be treated after one attacks a vampire. Josh tries to explain to his father that he is not suffering from a psychosis when Aidan drops by to try to help things, only for the garlic in Josh's mother's cooking to cause his vampire attributes to surface.

Bernie believes he has superpowers now and plans on only using them to hurt bad people, but Aidan tells him he should not hurt any humans. Later, Aidan comes across a crime scene with the bullies killed and Bishop berates him for having turned a child, despite Aidan telling him it was Rebecca who turned Bernie. Sally tries to figure out a way to help Nick and realizes that she takes her boyfriends' problems onto herself, but Nick reassures her that now he has something good to come back to after the \"echo\". Aidan takes Bernie to the woods to stalk a deer; he uses this excuse to stake the boy. Meanwhile, Bishop thanks Marcus for killing the two bullies so that Aidan would kill Bernie.

While imprisoned, Josh learns more about werewolves from an old man, revealed to be the other werewolf he will fight. Unable to physically help him, Sally tries to provide emotional support. Aidan attempts to interfere but the fight still takes place. Despite the other werewolf's greater size and experience, Josh is able to emerge victorious. However, the knowledge that he killed another causes Josh a lot of emotional trauma.

The Dutch want Bishop to return with them after culling his family by two-thirds. Josh finally manages to talk with Nora, saying that he did not know if he could get anyone pregnant. Nora also agrees that she was not sure if she could get pregnant for the same real reasons. In a last-ditch effort, Sally possesses the exorcist, lashing out at Danny in the exorcist's body until he throws her against the wall, separating them.

Meanwhile, Sally visits Danny, using her ghostly powers to make him hurt himself, which brings her back to normal.

Josh puts out the fire and Aidan attacks Danny, both revealing that they can see Sally and that they are not human. Aidan prepares to kill Danny at Sally's beckoning, but Josh pleads with both that Sally should not have a life on her hands. Sally acquiesces but then appears to Danny, saying that she will make his life a living hell unless he admits the arson and her murder to the police.

Aidan goes to Celine, offering to turn her into a vampire now but she declines. Aidan also asks her why she was not home when he went to pick her up to take her out of Montreal, but she does not reveal to him that Bishop kidnapped her, raped her, drank her blood and threatened her family.

Sally, who returned home at Aidan's request, finds that her door has disappeared and that she can now interact with physical objects. Celine returns and comforts Aidan, revealing to him what Bishop did to her years ago and asking him to take her life to restore his. Reluctantly Aidan drains Celine's blood which allows him to heal rapidly. Scenes of the past are interspersed throughout, showing how Aidan met Josh two years ago when Josh was working in a restaurant and was attacked by Marcus and another vampire. Aidan gets Josh his job as an orderly at the hospital. At the hospital, Josh is accosted by Bishop, who says he wants to fight Aidan at a factory. Sally and Josh decide to protect Aidan by telling Bishop that Aidan wants to fight at the hospital basement. They plan to lock Bishop in the basement with Josh, who by then will have turned into a werewolf and will be able to kill Bishop. Josh leaves Nora a good-bye note and heads for the basement to transform. Aidan figures out what Josh is doing and has Sally lock him in the room alone and tells Bishop the fight will indeed be at the factory. However, Nora has followed Josh and enters the room to find him at the mid-point of his transformation. Josh manages to shove her out of the room and lock the door before fully turning, with Nora watching in horror and then falling to the ground in pain, the moon also affecting her pregnancy and causing her to have a miscarriage. The fully transformed Josh and Nora lock eyes underneath the doorway. Elsewhere, Aidan and Bishop brutally beat each other in the factory. Aidan ultimately beheads Bishop.
