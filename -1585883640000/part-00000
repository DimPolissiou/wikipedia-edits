It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]] after which it was named.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence. The highest temperature ever recorded in Red Deer was {{convert|37.2|C|0}} on 8 July 1906,<ref name=\"July 1906\"/> 2 July 1924,<ref name=\"July 1924\"/> and 28 & 29 June 1937.<ref name=\"June

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]] after which it was named.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence. The highest temperature ever recorded in Red Deer was {{convert|37.2|C|0}} on 8 July 1906,<ref name=\"July 1906\"/> 2 July 1924,<ref name=\"July 1924\"/> and 28 & 29 June 1937.<ref name=\"June

The first stage is an equilateral triangle, and each successive stage is formed from adding outward bends to each side of the previous stage, making smaller equilateral triangles.  The areas enclosed by the successive stages in the construction of the snowflake converge to {{sfrac|8|5}} times the area of the original triangle, while the perimeters of the successive stages increase without bound. Consequently, the snowflake encloses a finite area, but has an [[Arc length#Curves with infinite length|infinite perimeter]].\n\n==Construction==\nThe Koch snowflake can be constructed by starting with an [[equilateral triangle]], then recursively altering each line segment as follows:\n# divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.\n# draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from step 1 as its base and points outward.\n# remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from step 2.\n\nThe first [[iteration]] of this process produces the outline of a [[hexagram]].\n\nThe Koch snowflake is the limit approached as the above steps are followed indefinitely. The Koch curve originally described by [[Helge von Koch]] is constructed using only one of the three sides of the original triangle. In other words, three Koch curves make a Koch snowflake.\n\nA Koch curve\u2013based representation of a nominally flat surface can similarly be created by repeatedly segmenting each line in a sawtooth pattern of segments with a given angle.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alonso-Marroquin |first=F. |last2=Huang |first2=P. |last3=Hanaor |first3=D. |last4=Flores-Johnson |first4=E. |last5=Proust |first5=G. |last6=Gan |first6=Y. |last7=Shen |first7=L. |title=Static friction between rigid fractal surfaces |journal=Physical Review E |year=2015 |volume=92 |pages=032405 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.92.032405 |url=https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/13835/2/F%20Alonso-Marroquin%202015%20Static%20friction%20between%20rigid%20fractal%20surfaces.pdf }} \u2014 Study of fractal surfaces using Koch curves.</ref> \n[[File:Koch rough surface.png|thumb|A fractal rough surface built from multiple Koch curve iterations]]\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Perimeter of the Koch snowflake===\n\nEach iteration multiplies the number of sides in the Koch snowflake by four, so the number of sides after {{mvar|n}} iterations is given by:\n\n:<math>N_{n} = N_{n-1} \\cdot 4 = 3 \\cdot 4^{n}\\, .</math>\n\nIf the original equilateral triangle has sides of length {{mvar|s}}, the length of each side of the snowflake after {{mvar|n}} iterations is:\n\n:<math>S_{n} = \\frac{S_{n-1}}{3} = \\frac{s}{3^{n}}\\, ,</math>\n\nan inverse [[power of three]] multiple of the original length.\nThe perimeter of the snowflake after {{mvar|n}} iterations is:\n\n:<math> P_{n} = N_{n} \\cdot S_{n} = 3 \\cdot s \\cdot {\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}^n\\, .</math>\n\nThe Koch curve has an [[infinite length]], because the total length of the curve increases by a factor of {{sfrac|4|3}} with each iteration. Each iteration creates four times as many line segments as in the previous iteration, with the length of each one being {{sfrac|1|3}} the length of the segments in the previous stage. Hence, the length of the curve after {{mvar|n}} iterations will be ({{sfrac|4|3}})<sup>{{mvar|n}}</sup> times the original triangle perimeter and is unbounded, as {{mvar|n}} tends to infinity.\n\n====Limit of perimeter====\n\nAs the number of iterations tends to infinity, the limit of the perimeter is:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P_n = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} 3 \\cdot s \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\right)^n = \\infty\\, ,</math>\n\nsince <big>|</big>{{sfrac|4|3}}<big>|</big>&nbsp;>&nbsp;1.\n\nAn {{sfrac|[[Natural logarithm|ln]] 4|ln 3}}-dimensional measure exists, but has not been calculated so far.

However, such a tessellation is not possible using only snowflakes of one size. Since each Koch snowflake in the tessellation can be subdivided into seven smaller snowflakes of two different sizes, it is also possible to find tessellations that use more than two sizes at once.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fractal tilings|journal=Mathematical Gazette|first=Aidan|last=Burns|volume=78|issue=482|year=1994|pages=193\u20136|jstor=3618577}}.</ref> Koch snowflakes and Koch antisnowflakes of the same size may be used to tile the plane.\n\n== Thue\u2013Morse sequence and turtle graphics ==\nA [[turtle graphics|turtle graphic]] is the curve that is generated if an automaton is programmed with a sequence.\nIf the [[Thue\u2013Morse sequence]] members are used in order to select program states:\n\n* If {{math|1=''t''(''n'') = 0}}, move ahead by one unit,\n* If {{math|1=''t''(''n'') = 1}}, rotate counterclockwise by an angle of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}},\n\nthe resulting curve converges to the Koch snowflake.\n\n==Representation as Lindenmayer system==\nThe Koch curve can be expressed by the following [[rewrite system]] ([[Lindenmayer system]]):\n\n:'''Alphabet''' :   F\n:'''Constants''' :   +, \u2212\n:'''Axiom''' :   F\n:'''Production rules''':\n:       F \u2192 F+F--F+F\n\nHere, ''F'' means \"draw forward\", ''-'' means \"turn right 60\u00b0\", and ''+'' means \"turn left 60\u00b0\".\n\nTo create the Koch snowflake, one would use F--F--F (an equilateral triangle) as the axiom.\n\n== Variants of the Koch curve ==\n{{anchor|Variants}}\n\nFollowing von Koch's concept, several variants of the Koch curve were designed, considering right angles ([[Quadratic function|quadratic]]), other angles ([[De Rham curve#Ces\u00e0ro curves|Ces\u00e0ro]]), circles and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and their extensions to higher dimensions (Sphereflake and Kochcube, respectively)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The first stage is an equilateral triangle, and each successive stage is formed from adding outward bends to each side of the previous stage, making smaller equilateral triangles.  The areas enclosed by the successive stages in the construction of the snowflake converge to {{sfrac|8|5}} times the area of the original triangle, while the perimeters of the successive stages increase without bound. Consequently, the snowflake encloses a finite area, but has an [[Arc length#Curves with infinite length|infinite perimeter]].\n\n==Construction==\nThe Koch snowflake can be constructed by starting with an [[equilateral triangle]], then recursively altering each line segment as follows:\n# divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.\n# draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from step 1 as its base and points outward.\n# remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from step 2.\n\nThe first [[iteration]] of this process produces the outline of a [[hexagram]].\n\nThe Koch snowflake is the limit approached as the above steps are followed indefinitely. The Koch curve originally described by [[Helge von Koch]] is constructed using only one of the three sides of the original triangle. In other words, three Koch curves make a Koch snowflake.\n\nA Koch curve\u2013based representation of a nominally flat surface can similarly be created by repeatedly segmenting each line in a sawtooth pattern of segments with a given angle.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alonso-Marroquin |first=F. |last2=Huang |first2=P. |last3=Hanaor |first3=D. |last4=Flores-Johnson |first4=E. |last5=Proust |first5=G. |last6=Gan |first6=Y. |last7=Shen |first7=L. |title=Static friction between rigid fractal surfaces |journal=Physical Review E |year=2015 |volume=92 |pages=032405 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.92.032405 |url=https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/13835/2/F%20Alonso-Marroquin%202015%20Static%20friction%20between%20rigid%20fractal%20surfaces.pdf }} \u2014 Study of fractal surfaces using Koch curves.</ref> \n[[File:Koch rough surface.png|thumb|A fractal rough surface built from multiple Koch curve iterations]]\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Perimeter of the Koch snowflake===\n\nEach iteration multiplies the number of sides in the Koch snowflake by four, so the number of sides after {{mvar|n}} iterations is given by:\n\n:<math>N_{n} = N_{n-1} \\cdot 4 = 3 \\cdot 4^{n}\\, .</math>\n\nIf the original equilateral triangle has sides of length {{mvar|s}}, the length of each side of the snowflake after {{mvar|n}} iterations is:\n\n:<math>S_{n} = \\frac{S_{n-1}}{3} = \\frac{s}{3^{n}}\\, ,</math>\n\nan inverse [[power of three]] multiple of the original length.\nThe perimeter of the snowflake after {{mvar|n}} iterations is:\n\n:<math> P_{n} = N_{n} \\cdot S_{n} = 3 \\cdot s \\cdot {\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}^n\\, .</math>\n\nThe Koch curve has an [[infinite length]], because the total length of the curve increases by a factor of {{sfrac|4|3}} with each iteration. Each iteration creates four times as many line segments as in the previous iteration, with the length of each one being {{sfrac|1|3}} the length of the segments in the previous stage. Hence, the length of the curve after {{mvar|n}} iterations will be ({{sfrac|4|3}})<sup>{{mvar|n}}</sup> times the original triangle perimeter and is unbounded, as {{mvar|n}} tends to infinity.\n\n====Limit of perimeter====\n\nAs the number of iterations tends to infinity, the limit of the perimeter is:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P_n = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} 3 \\cdot s \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\right)^n = \\infty\\, ,</math>\n\nsince <big>|</big>{{sfrac|4|3}}<big>|</big>&nbsp;>&nbsp;1.\n\nAn {{sfrac|[[Natural logarithm|ln]] 4|ln 3}}-dimensional measure exists, but has not been calculated so far.

The unapologetic slab-sided functionalism of the Kadett B disappointed some commentators.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, customers were not deterred, possibly because the simple car body enabled the car to provide an aggressively priced practical and modern car with far more interior space than the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]] which hitherto had dominated the German small car market without serious challenge for more than a decade.\n\nThe range of bodies was widened with the Kadett B. The entry level model, priced in September 1965 at 5,175 [[Deutsche Mark|Marks]], was the two-door \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon). In addition, for the first time since 1940, it was again possible to buy a four-door Kadett \"Limousine\". In September 1967 a fast back \"Limousine\" model, designated as the \"Kadett LS\" and offered with two or four doors, joined the range.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 218</ref>\n\nA three-door \"Car-A-Van\" (kombi/estate/station wagon) was offered from the 1965 launch, with a five-door \"Car-A-Van\" added to the range in 1967.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 221</ref>\n\nOpel also offered a two-door Kadett coup\u00e9 with reduced headroom for the passengers in the rear. The coup\u00e9 body introduced in 1965 included a thick [[C-pillar]] with reduced side-windows between the C-pillar and the [[B-pillar]]. The thick C-pillar incorporated three prominent air extractor slots reminiscent of the gills on a fish, as a result of which this coup\u00e9 acquired the soubriquet ''\"Kiemencoup\u00e9\"'' ([[gill|gills coup\u00e9]]). A coup\u00e9 body with larger side windows for the passengers in the back appeared in 1967 identified as the \"Coup\u00e9 F\", initially only on the more lavishly equipped cars, but from 1971 all Kadett B coup\u00e9s used the newer body. The newer Coup\u00e9, with an increased quantity of glass, was slightly heavier than the \"gills-coup\u00e9\" as well as being less aerodynamically efficient, leading to a small reduction in claimed top speed.\n\n==Engines==\n\n===Smaller OHV engines===\n\n====1.1-litre (1965\u20131973)====\nAt launch, and for the next two years till September 1967, all Kadett Bs were fitted with an [[Opel OHV engine|OHV four-cylinder \"over-square\" water-cooled engine]]. The unit followed the architecture of the 993&nbsp;cc engine first seen in the 1962 Kadett A, from which it was a development. Both engines featured a {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} cylinder stroke, but for the engine in the Kadett B, generally referred to as a 1.1-litre or 1,100&nbsp;cc unit, the bore was increased by {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}}, which made it even more [[Stroke ratio#Square, oversquare and undersquare engines|over-square]] and resulted in a capacity increase to 1,078&nbsp;cc. There were as before two levels of power: stated output for the standard engine was {{Convert|45|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm, while the \"high-compression\" engine, listed as the \"1100 S\" motor, produced {{Convert|55|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm. Both engine versions were fitted with a Solex 35 PDSI carburetor, but the higher compression ratio on the {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit necessitated the use of higher octane \"super grade\" fuel.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213 & 215</ref> There was also a \"low-compression\" {{Convert|40|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of this engine used for certain export markets outside western Europe where available fuel came with a significantly lower octane rating than was normal for \"regular\" grade fuel in Germany.\n\nIn September 1967, as part of a larger proliferation of engine and trim options, a more powerful version of the 1,078&nbsp;cc engine became available, listed as the \"1100 SR\" motor, fitted with two  Solex 35 PDSI carburetors and providing a maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200&nbsp;rpm. The compression ratio was further raised, now to 9.2:1 and fitting the {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit raised the claimed top speed to 140&nbsp;km/h (87&nbsp;mph) as against 125&nbsp;km/h (78&nbsp;mph) and 135&nbsp;km/h (84&nbsp;mph)  for the {{Convert|45|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} powered Kadetts.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nHowever, the early 1970s saw increasing awareness of the dangers to health arising from [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] being added to road fuel, and the oil companies responded to the resulting political and regulatory pressures by reducing both the levels of [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] in fuel and the availability at filling stations of higher octane petrol/gasoline.   High-compression versions of the Opel 1,078&nbsp;cc engine were therefore withdrawn from August 1971, leaving just a {{Convert|50|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit which used the 7.8:1 compression ratio that had been used in the base version back in 1965, delivering a reduced torque (presumably as art of a tradeoff against higher power output).   Between August 1971 and July 1973 the niche hitherto occupied by the higher-compression 1,078&nbsp;cc units was filled by a newly bored out 1,196&nbsp;cc version of what was, in other respects, the engine much as before.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213, 215, 217, 221 & 222</ref>\n\nBy the time the Kadett B was replaced in 1973 there had been no fewer than six differently sized engines available for it from Opel: by far the most popular was the 1,078&nbsp;cc motor that powered 89% (2.3 million of 2.6 million) of the Kadett Bs produced.<ref name=osw216>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p. 216</ref>\n\n====1.2-litre (1971\u20131973)====\nThe 1.2-litre unit that, in the Kadett B, replaced in August 1971 the higher-compression versions of the 1.1-litre motor was listed as the \"1200 S\" motor. It retained the {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} cylinder stroke of the original version of this engine, but the cylinder bore was further increased, giving an overall engine capacity of 1,196&nbsp;cc and maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213 & 223</ref>\n\nOnly 95,000 Kadett Bs were fitted with the 1.2-litre engine which nevertheless went on to power successor Kadett and Corsa models until 1993. In the shorter term, in March 1972 this became the entry level power unit for base level versions of the recently introduced [[Opel Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 245, 246 & 246</ref>\n\n====1.0-litre (export only: 1972-1973)====\nIn 1972 and 1973 Opel produced 10,000 Kadett Bs powered by the 993&nbsp;cc original version of the engine that ten years earlier had powered the Kadett A. Maximum output, as previously, was {{Convert|40|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{Convert|48|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} according to the compression ratio selected. This engine was not fitted in cars destined for the domestic market, but was used for cars sold in export markets, primarily [[Italy]], where annual car tax rates increased very considerably for cars fitted with engines of above 1.0 litre.<ref name=osw216/> Kadetts assembled in South Africa received a 997&nbsp;cc Vauxhall engine and transmission.\n\n====1.2-litre Vauxhall engine (South Africa)====\nFrom circa 1966, General Motors South Africa built the Kadett B locally. However, to meet local parts content rules it was fitted with Vauxhall's 1159&nbsp;cc inline-four as also seen in the [[Vauxhall Viva|Viva]]. This engine offered {{convert|56.2|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|67|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in a high output version; the outputs are in Gross bhp.<ref name=CarZA768>{{cite magazine | magazine = CAR (South Africa) | title = Kadett 4-door Car-A-Van | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Cedric | volume = 12 | number = 7 | date = August 1968 | ref = DNLCV | page = 13 | publisher = Central News Agency Ltd. | location = Cape Town, South Africa }}</ref> These local variants were also sold in [[South-West Africa]] (today's [[Namibia]]). From the second half of 1968, the four-door Car-A-Van model was added, alongside the updates to the rear suspension.<ref name=CarZA768/>\n\n===Larger Opel \"CIH\" engines===\n\n====1.7-litre (1967\u20131970)====\nIn 1967 [[Ford Germany|Ford]] added a 1.7-litre version to their [[Ford Taunus P6|Ford 12M/15M]] range.   Both the Kadett and the Ford by now took up more road space than a typical European 1.1-litre small family sedan, and in September 1967 Opel added a 1,698&nbsp;cc engine to the Kadett's range of available power units. A suitable unit already existed, having been fitted in the [[Opel Rekord Series B|Opel Rekord]] since 1965. The engine in question had been the manufacturer's second all-new engine design since the [[Second World War|war]], although much of its underlying philosophy came from [[General Motors]] developments in Detroit and from experience with the new engine developed for the Kadett A earlier in the 1960s. Opel's so-called [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine followed the trends of the time in replacing side-valves with an [[ohv|overhead valvegear]] configuration, which was no doubt facilitated by the [[Stroke ratio#Square, oversquare and undersquare engines|over-square]] architecture of the cylinder block:  the engine also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders.   However, instead of operating directly on the cylinder valves, the camshaft still operated the valves using rods and rocker arms because, unusually (except within general Motors) the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves.   One reason for this may have been cosmetic.  Opel's CIH engine configuration enabled a succession of Opels to feature the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments favoured. As on the smaller Kadett engines with their side-mounted camshafts, the \"in head\" camshaft on the Opel CIH engine was chain driven, a weight-saving option which reduced lumpiness and friction at higher engine speeds when compared with the [[Gear|gear-cogs]] which had been used to drive camshafts in the previous generation of Opel engines.\n\nThe engine, known as the 1.7S or 1700S, was listed for the Kadett only for three years, between September 1967 and August 1970. The lower-compression {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} version fitted in many [[Opel Rekord Series C|Rekords]] was not offered to Kadett buyers. In the Kadett B the engine provided a maximum output of {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} employing a relatively high 9.5:1 compression ratio. That translated, in manual transmission cars, into a top speed of 153&nbsp;km/h (95&nbsp;mph) or 155&nbsp;km/h (96&nbsp;mph) according to body type. Despite its being listed for three years, only 6,000 Kadetts with the 1,698&nbsp;cc engine were produced, suggesting that the manufacturer preferred to fit engines of this size in their larger [[Opel Rekord Series C|Rekord model]] (which between 1966 and 1971 took more than half a million of the 1,698&nbsp;cc units), while persuading Kadett customers looking for more power to switch their preference to the (in most respects similar) 1,897&nbsp;cc version of the CIH engine.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 216, 219 & 228</ref>\n\n====1.9-litre (1967\u20131973)====\nAlso listed from 1967, and fitted in 143,000 Kadett Bs was the 1,897&nbsp;cc version of the [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine. Again, only the high-compression version of the engine was listed for the Kadett, providing maximum output of {{Convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,100 rpm, using a 9.5:1 compression ratio. After August 1971 the compression ratio was reduced to 9.0:1 due to the reduction in octane levels available at filling stations. In practice, though the engine was listed for the Kadett B until 1973, very few of the Kadetts produced in 1972 and 1973 were fitted with it as the focus of dealers' and customers' attention switched to the manufacturer's newer [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 219</ref>\n\nThe 1.9-litre engine was fitted in the top of the range \"Opel Rallye Kadett\" as an alternative to the smaller high-compression 1.2-litre engine also offered for this sportingly attired variant, readily identifiable from the thick black side stripe and the black paint on the lid of the bonnet/hood.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214, 218, 219 & 220</ref>\n\nIn Germany the \"1900 S\" engine was offered only in the coup\u00e9-bodied \"Opel Rallye Kadett\" although for certain export markets, notably the USA, this engine was available in all body versions offered.\n\nBetween April 1970 and the end of the Kadett B's model life a more highly tuned \"HL\" (\u201eHochleistung\u201c/''\"High powered\"'') version of the 1.9-litre engine could be fitted to a Rallye Sprint version of the car, power further increased to {{Convert|106|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. \"Hochleistung\" cars could be purchased from Opel dealers and from at least one specialist engine tuning business, but they never appeared on Opel price lists in Germany where the cars were always rare. The {{Convert|106|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} powered Kadett B Rallye Sprint was less of a rarity in [[Sweden]] where a high proportion of the cars produced were sold.\n\n====1.5-litre (export only: 1967-1970)====\nThe smallest of Opel's [[:de:Opel CIH|(CIH)]] engines never found its way into Kadetts for the domestic market, but the 1,492&nbsp;cc unit was installed in 44,000 Kadett saloons/sedans and estates/station wagons destined for export between 1967 and 1970, primarily for Austria, Sweden and the USA (where it was only offered for the 1968 model year). The version fitted in the Kadetts was a {{Convert|65|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} high-compression unit.\n\n==Running gear==\n\n===Transmission===\nThe car came with a four-speed all-synchromesh manual transmission as standard, gear selection being performed using a centrally positioned floor-mounted lever.   From November 1968 on the larger-engined cars, and from February 1969 also on the smaller-engined Kadetts, it became possible to specify the alternative of a \"GM Strasbourg\" [[Turbo-Hydramatic 180]] three-speed automatic transmission, available at the extra cost (initially) of 800 Marks.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Brakes===\nThe Kadett B was the first Kadett to offer disc brakes on the front wheels.   {{convert|238|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter disc brakes at the front came included as standard fittings on all but the cheapest versions, complemented by {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter drum brakes at the back.   The brakes were controlled hydraulically.   From February 1967 the single hydraulic braking circuit was replaced by a dual circuit braking system:  this built in reserve of redundancy in the braking control system reflected a growing interest in primary and secondary safety which was becoming a feature of German auto-design in the 1960s.   Whether as an option on the base model or as a standard feature across the rest of the range, where disc brakes were fitted Opel also included servo-assistance in the braking system from February 1967.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213, 215, 217, 219, 221-223</ref>\n\n===Steering and suspension===\nThe Kadett B inherited its suspension from the Kadett A.   Two years after launch, however, in August 1967, the simple longitudinally mounted leaf springs with a centrally connected rigid axle which till then had suspended the rear wheels were replaced with a more sophisticated set-up incorporating coil springs, trailing arms and a [[Panhard rod]].   Road holding was usefully improved.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>   At the same time, reflecting growing preoccupation with secondary safety in the marketplace, the old steering wheel was replaced with a padded \"Safety\" steering wheel, now mounted on a telescopic steering column which was designed to collapse in the event of a serious collision.\n\n==Versions and trim levels==\n\n===standard \"Kadett\", \"Kadett L\" and \"Kadett LS\"===\nThe basic car was known simply as the Opel Kadett or the \u201cstandard\u201d Opel Kadett, but for a few hundred Marks more customers could choose an Opel Kadett \u201cL\u201d with a less Spartan interior and a little more chrome on the outside, along with over-riders on the bumpers.    When the fastback saloon was offered, between 1967 and 1970, it was identified as the Kadett \u201cLS\u201d.\n\n===\u201cRallye Kadett\u201d===\nThe \u201cRallye Kadett\u201d was offered only with the coup\u00e9 body, which it combined with the twin carburettor \u201cSR\u201d  version of the 1.1-litre engine (between 1965 and 1971) or the high-compression 1.9-litre engine (between 1967 and 1973).   The Rallye Kadett came with twin halogen driving lights and, on the inside, a black panel of rocker switches as part of the dash-board along with black synthetic leather seat coverings.   It also came with matte black panels on the bonnet/hood (\u201cto reduce reflection\u201d) and black stripes along the side.   Customers worried by the flamboyant look of all the black paint could order a Rallye Kadett without it, but very few Rallye Kadett buyers opted for the \u201cunderstated\u201d paintwork option.\n\n===Opel Olympia===\n{{main|Opel Olympia}}\n[[File:1968-Opel-Olympia.jpg|thumb|1968 Opel Olympia 2-door sedan, with the standard vinyl roof]]\n\nThe Olympia name was revived in 1967. This time it was only a luxury version of the contemporary [[Opel Kadett B]]. Interior finishings were of a higher order than in the Kadett. Engines were an 1100&nbsp;cc unit with {{convert|60|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} taken from the Kadett and two larger units, a 1700&nbsp;cc with {{convert|75|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 1900&nbsp;cc with {{convert|90|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} which were normally used in the [[Opel Rekord]].<ref name=WC68>{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1968 | editor-last = d'Angelo | editor-first = Sergio | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | page = 664 | year = 1968 }}</ref> The bodywork was of the \"fastback\" style, rather than of the more upright regular sedan-style bodywork used on most Kadetts. The Olympia was not highly successful and was replaced in 1970 by the all new [[Opel Ascona]].\n\n===Limited edition \"run-out\" specials===\nThe Kadett B was in production for 8 years, which represented a longer production run than was achieved by any other Kadett before or subsequently.   This freed up the manufacturer to focus new model development on the important [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models which appeared in 1970.   The Kadett B's strong marketplace performance was helped by the lukewarm reception German buyers gave to the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] which in its original incarnation German buyers perceived as cramped, crude and uncomfortable.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 396 & 397: \"Der grossere Teil der Produktion ging ins Ausland, weil der Ford Escort [Mk I] auf dem deutschen Markt wegen seiner pummeligen Form, seiner simplen Konstruktion, seiner holprigen Stra\u00dfenlage und seines bescheidenen Komforts nur m\u00e4\u00dfigen Zuspruch fand...   848 388 [Escort Mk Is fertigten] die deutschen Ford-Werke, doch nur 234 667 Exemplaren fanden deutsche K\u00e4ufer.\"</ref>   At the end of 1972, with rumours of a replacement appearing in the trade press, Opel nevertheless felt it necessary to prepare a series of special edition Opel Kadetts with a number of \"options\" included as standard features, but with little chance for customers to vary the specifications.   By building large batches of identically equipped cars the manufacturer was able to provide attractively low prices to customers prepared to forego the chance to specify their Kadett \"\u00e0 la carte\" from the colour, trim and options lists.   Forty years on, some of the options listed have become standard on cars of this class, while others have fallen completely out of favour.\n\nThe limited edition cars were built and sold for the 1973 model year, which was the Kadett B's run-out (or final) year.\n\n====Kadett Sport (1973)====\nThe special edition Kadett Sport came with matte black exterior decor reminiscent of the Kadett Rallye, but whereas the Kadett Rallye came with a coupe body the Kadett-Sport used only the two-door \"Limousine\" sedan/saloon body.   Also the recommended price was 1,171 Marks (12%) lower than for the similarly powered 1.2-litre {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} Kadett Rallye.\n\nThe Kadett-Sport buyer could specify any one of three eye-catching body colours: \"roof-tile red\", \"yellow ochre\" and \"lemon yellow\"  ''(Ziegelrot, Ocker und Citrusgelb)''.   Appropriate features included in the \"customer-friendly\" price were a sports exhaust/muffler, the rallye gauge cluster from the Rallye model, a sports steering wheel, servo assisted brakes with discs at the front, anti-roll bars, high-backed front seats, sports wheels and tires, a heated rear window, seat belts and, under the bonnet, an enhanced alternator to cope with the anticipated demands of additional electrical equipment.\n\n====Kadett Holiday (1973)====\nThe special edition Kadett Holiday came with a standard package of extras, chief among which were a steel sliding sun roof, sports wheels, large fog lights at the front ''and'' a rear fog light, and high-backed front seats incorporating stylish wrap-around head restraints.\n\n====Kadett Festival (1973)====\nThe most luxuriously equipped of the special edition Kadetts of 1973, the Festival could be purchased as a Limousine (sedan/saloon) or as a Coup\u00e9.   The cars were powered by the {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.2S engine, and for approximately an extra 500 Marks the 3-speed automatic \"Strasbourg\" transmission could be specified.\n\nThe Kadett-Festival buyer could choose from three fashionably metallic body colours: \"sahara gold\", \"monza blue\" and \"lime green\".   \"Extras\" included as standard features in the \"friendly\" price were velour covered seats exclusive to the Kadett Festival, a sports steering wheel, front disc brakes packaged with servo-assistance for the brakes, anti-roll bars front and rear, a more powerful alternator than on most Kadetts, halogen spot lamps, a heated back window, sports wheels with radial tires and the external decoration of thin twin side-stripes.\n\n====Kadett Grand Prix (1973)====\nThe Kadett Grand Prix was a special edition Kadett using the two-door Limousine (sedan/saloon) body with its interior enhanced by the fitting of carpets, a sports steering wheel and 3-point mounted seatbelts.   Under the bonnet/hood, there was an uprated alternator.   The 3-speed automatic transmission could be ordered as an extra.\n\nFor most of the run-out specials, customers were restricted to a choice of three body colours, but Grand Prix buyers could choose from between roof-til red, yellow ochre, sierra beige and arctic white.\n\n===Export specials===\n\n====Opel Ascona (modified Kadett B assembled in Biel, [[Switzerland]])====\nThe Opel Ascona 1700 should not be confused with the all-new [[Opel Ascona]] introduced in 1970.   The \"Opel Ascona\" name was originally used for a 4-door \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon)-bodied edition of the Kadett B powered by the manufacturer's 1,698&nbsp;cc [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] high compression ratio \"1.7S\" engine.   The interior was extensively modified, and incorporated several elements from the Kadett's \"L\" equipment package.   Opel's first four Asconas came from the Kadett plant in [[Bochum]], but all the rest of the 2,560 Kadett-based cars were assembled at [[Biel]], near the Franco-German [[Languages of Switzerland|language frontier]] through central Switzerland, using imported components.   [[General Motors]] had originally established their small auto-assembly facility in Biel in the 1930s as a reaction to a surge in [[Mercantilism|trade protectionism]] which had been part of the political reaction in Europe and America to the [[Great Depression|economic depression]] of the early 1930s.\n\n====Mixed fortunes in the [[US]]====\nThe Kadett B was sold in the United States through a large number of selected [[Buick]] dealers from 1966 until Autumn 1972 ( 72 models were only imported by special order by the dealer ), branded simply as the '''Opel''' in the 1970 and 71 model years. The U.S. models from the 1968 model year were given the front end and trim similar to the new [[Opel Olympia]] with the turn signals put into the grille beside the headlights ( as opposed to under them like the Olympia ).   From 1969 additional lighting changes were made to include side marker lights ( The 1968 had side marker reflectors ) on the front fender and larger wrap-around tail lights that were unique to the US Market to meet new US regulations.   The US cars also received sealed-beam headlights at the front, and the car took part in the [[Trans-Am Series]] during its commercial life.   The Kadett Bs, like the predecessor Kadett A, were technically simple cars whose task was to compete with the market leader, the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].   The mainstay of the US Kadett at this time was the coupe-bodied fast back and station wagon/caravan. Sedans and specifically the four-door sedan were offered only sporadically. In the case of the four door it was only offered in the 1967 ( All were 1.1L and trim matched the European Opel Kadett of the time ) and 1971 model years ( All were 1.9L and less than 700 were imported and sold ).\n\nRoughly 430,000 Opel Kadett Bs were imported to the U.S.\n\nThe [[United States]] car magazine ''[[Car and Driver]]'' published a highly critical test of an ''Opel Kadett L 1500 Caravan'' in February 1968, featuring photos of the car in a junkyard. Reportedly, GM withdrew ads from that magazine for several months as a consequence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kf0zqDyLgBkC&pg=PA191 |title=Speaking Respect, Respecting Speech |first=Richard L. |last=Abel |page=191 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial==\nBetween 1965 and 1973 Opel produced 2,691,300 Kadett Bs<ref name=\"OldtimerKatalogNr23\"/> making this model one of the most successful Opels to date in terms of sales volume.   The Kadett benefitted on the domestic market from a progressive slowing of demand for the old [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]], while the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Volkswagen Golf]] which would compete for sales more effectively against the Kadett C both got off to a relatively slow start respectively in 1968 and 1974.\n\n==Derivatives==\nThe two-seat [[Opel GT]] was heavily based on Kadett B components, its body made by a French contractor, [[Brissonneau & Lotz]], at their [[Creil]] factory.\n\n{{gallery | width = 190 | height = 113\n|File:1967 Opel Kadett L Coup\u00e9 (US), rear right, Hershey 2019.jpg|US-market 1967 Opel Kadett B \"[[Gill|Gills-coup\u00e9]]\" (''\"Kiemencoup\u00e9\"'')\n|File:Kadett 1700 Front.JPG|Opel Kadett B 4-door Limousine\n|File:Opel Kadett B Coup\u00e9 F front 20110811.jpg|Opel Kadett B Coup\u00e9 \"F\" (1967-73)\n|File:Opel Kadett B BW 2016-07-17 13-28-59.jpg|Opel Kadett B \"LS\" Fastback sedan/saloon (1967-70)\n|File:Kadett B Kombi rear 23072007.jpg|Rear-view of Opel Kadett B 3-door Caravan (Kombi) (1965-73)\n|File:1971 Opel Kadett 4dr (36D), US model, front right.jpg|US-market 1971 Opel Kadett 36D (4 Door)\n|File:1971 Opel Kadett 4dr (36D), US model, rear left.jpg|Rear view, showing the US-only tail lights used from 1969 until 1971 \n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{Opel}}\n{{Classic Opel timeline}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Opel vehicles|Kadett B]]\n[[Category:Compact cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox automobile\n|image         = File:Opel Kadett B Westhausen 2015.JPG\n|caption       = Opel Kadett B 2-door Limousine\n|manufacturer  = [[Opel]] ([[General Motors]])\n|name          = Opel Kadett B\n|production    = 1965\u20131973\n|class         = [[Small family car]] ([[C-segment|C]])\n|body_style    = {{unbulleted list | 2/4-door notchback / fastback [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] | 3/5-door [[Station wagon|\"Car-A-Van\" estate]] | 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] }}\n|engine        = 1972-73: 993&nbsp;cc 40/48 PS [[Opel OHV engine|ohv]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (export)<br>1965-73: 1078&nbsp;cc 45/50/55/60 PS [[Opel OHV engine|ohv]] I4<br>1971-73: 1196&nbsp;cc 60 PS [[Opel OHV engine|ohv]] I4<br>1967-70: 1492&nbsp;cc 65 PS [[:de:Opel CIH|CIH]] I4 (export)<br>1967-70: 1698&nbsp;cc 75 PS [[:de:Opel CIH|CIH]] I4<br>1967-73: 1897&nbsp;cc 90/106 PS [[:de:Opel CIH|CIH]] I4<br>([[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline engines]])\n|assembly      = {{ubl\n  |West Germany: [[Bochum]]\n  | [[Johor Bahru]], [[Malaysia]] ({{abbr|Capital Motor|Capital Motor Assembly Corporation}})<ref name=leeps1>{{cite journal |author=Leeps |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19890604&id=tKFUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5932,900833&hl=en | title = Rust Busters | journal = [[New Straits Times]] | page = New Sunday Times, 21 |date=1989-06-04 |accessdate=2020-03-26 }}</ref>\n  }}\n|transmission  =\n|length        = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|4100|mm|in|abbr=on}} (estate) | {{convert|4105|mm|in|abbr=on}} (sedan) | {{convert|4182|mm|in|abbr=on}} (coup\u00e9, fastback) }}\n|width         = {{convert|1573|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|height        = {{convert|1274|mm|in|abbr=on}}<br> to {{convert|1405|mm|in|abbr=on}}<br>(according to wheel size and body type)\n|weight        =\n|wheelbase     = {{convert|2416|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|related       = [[Opel Olympia]] A \n|predecessor   = [[Opel Kadett A]]\n|successor     = [[Opel Kadett C]]\n}}\nThe '''[[Opel Kadett]] B''' is a car that was launched by [[Opel]] at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in late summer 1965.<ref name=OldtimerKatalogNr23>{{citation |first=G\u00fcnther | last = Zink | title =Oldtimer Katalog |volume=23|page=265|date =2009 |isbn=978-3868520675 | language = German | publisher=HEEL Verlag |location=K\u00f6nigswinter }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last= Oswald |first= Werner |year= 2003 |title= Deutsche Autos 1945\u20131990 | trans-title = German cars, 1945-1990 |volume= 3 |publisher= Motorbuch Verlag |language= German |isbn= 3-613-02116-1 | page = 213 | ref= Oswald Band 3}}</ref> The Kadett B was larger all-round than the [[Opel Kadett A|Kadett A]]: 5% longer both overall and in terms of the wheelbase, 7% wider and 9% heavier (unladen weight), albeit {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} lower in basic standard \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon) form.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 199 & 215</ref> Production ended in July 1973, with the [[Opel Kadett C|successor model]] introduced a month later following the summer shut-down, in August.\n\n==Bodies: more choice==\n[[File:Kadett-varia.JPG|thumb|Opel Kadett B body options]]\n\nOpel had built a reputation for providing stylish cars, and the simple well balanced proportions of the recently introduced [[Opel Rekord Series A]] had continued the tradition. The unapologetic slab-sided functionalism of the Kadett B disappointed some commentators.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, customers were not deterred, possibly because the simple car body enabled the car to provide an aggressively priced practical and modern car with far more interior space than the [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]] which hitherto had dominated the German small car market without serious challenge for more than a decade.\n\nThe range of bodies was widened with the Kadett B. The entry level model, priced in September 1965 at 5,175 [[Deutsche Mark|Marks]], was the two-door \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon). In addition, for the first time since 1940, it was again possible to buy a four-door Kadett \"Limousine\". In September 1967 a fast back \"Limousine\" model, designated as the \"Kadett LS\" and offered with two or four doors, joined the range.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 218</ref>\n\nA three-door \"Car-A-Van\" (kombi/estate/station wagon) was offered from the 1965 launch, with a five-door \"Car-A-Van\" added to the range in 1967.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 221</ref>\n\nOpel also offered a two-door Kadett coup\u00e9 with reduced headroom for the passengers in the rear. The coup\u00e9 body introduced in 1965 included a thick [[C-pillar]] with reduced side-windows between the C-pillar and the [[B-pillar]]. The thick C-pillar incorporated three prominent air extractor slots reminiscent of the gills on a fish, as a result of which this coup\u00e9 acquired the soubriquet ''\"Kiemencoup\u00e9\"'' ([[gill|gills coup\u00e9]]). A coup\u00e9 body with larger side windows for the passengers in the back appeared in 1967 identified as the \"Coup\u00e9 F\", initially only on the more lavishly equipped cars, but from 1971 all Kadett B coup\u00e9s used the newer body. The newer Coup\u00e9, with an increased quantity of glass, was slightly heavier than the \"gills-coup\u00e9\" as well as being less aerodynamically efficient, leading to a small reduction in claimed top speed.\n\n==Engines==\n\n===Smaller OHV engines===\n\n====1.1-litre (1965\u20131973)====\nAt launch, and for the next two years till September 1967, all Kadett Bs were fitted with an [[Opel OHV engine|OHV four-cylinder \"over-square\" water-cooled engine]]. The unit followed the architecture of the 993&nbsp;cc engine first seen in the 1962 Kadett A, from which it was a development. Both engines featured a {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} cylinder stroke, but for the engine in the Kadett B, generally referred to as a 1.1-litre or 1,100&nbsp;cc unit, the bore was increased by {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}}, which made it even more [[Stroke ratio#Square, oversquare and undersquare engines|over-square]] and resulted in a capacity increase to 1,078&nbsp;cc. There were as before two levels of power: stated output for the standard engine was {{Convert|45|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm, while the \"high-compression\" engine, listed as the \"1100 S\" motor, produced {{Convert|55|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm. Both engine versions were fitted with a Solex 35 PDSI carburetor, but the higher compression ratio on the {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit necessitated the use of higher octane \"super grade\" fuel.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213 & 215</ref> There was also a \"low-compression\" {{Convert|40|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of this engine used for certain export markets outside western Europe where available fuel came with a significantly lower octane rating than was normal for \"regular\" grade fuel in Germany.\n\nIn September 1967, as part of a larger proliferation of engine and trim options, a more powerful version of the 1,078&nbsp;cc engine became available, listed as the \"1100 SR\" motor, fitted with two  Solex 35 PDSI carburetors and providing a maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200&nbsp;rpm. The compression ratio was further raised, now to 9.2:1 and fitting the {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit raised the claimed top speed to 140&nbsp;km/h (87&nbsp;mph) as against 125&nbsp;km/h (78&nbsp;mph) and 135&nbsp;km/h (84&nbsp;mph)  for the {{Convert|45|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|55|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} powered Kadetts.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nHowever, the early 1970s saw increasing awareness of the dangers to health arising from [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] being added to road fuel, and the oil companies responded to the resulting political and regulatory pressures by reducing both the levels of [[Tetraethyllead|lead]] in fuel and the availability at filling stations of higher octane petrol/gasoline.   High-compression versions of the Opel 1,078&nbsp;cc engine were therefore withdrawn from August 1971, leaving just a {{Convert|50|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} unit which used the 7.8:1 compression ratio that had been used in the base version back in 1965, delivering a reduced torque (presumably as art of a tradeoff against higher power output).   Between August 1971 and July 1973 the niche hitherto occupied by the higher-compression 1,078&nbsp;cc units was filled by a newly bored out 1,196&nbsp;cc version of what was, in other respects, the engine much as before.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213, 215, 217, 221 & 222</ref>\n\nBy the time the Kadett B was replaced in 1973 there had been no fewer than six differently sized engines available for it from Opel: by far the most popular was the 1,078&nbsp;cc motor that powered 89% (2.3 million of 2.6 million) of the Kadett Bs produced.<ref name=osw216>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p. 216</ref>\n\n====1.2-litre (1971\u20131973)====\nThe 1.2-litre unit that, in the Kadett B, replaced in August 1971 the higher-compression versions of the 1.1-litre motor was listed as the \"1200 S\" motor. It retained the {{convert|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} cylinder stroke of the original version of this engine, but the cylinder bore was further increased, giving an overall engine capacity of 1,196&nbsp;cc and maximum output of {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213 & 223</ref>\n\nOnly 95,000 Kadett Bs were fitted with the 1.2-litre engine which nevertheless went on to power successor Kadett and Corsa models until 1993. In the shorter term, in March 1972 this became the entry level power unit for base level versions of the recently introduced [[Opel Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 245, 246 & 246</ref>\n\n====1.0-litre (export only: 1972-1973)====\nIn 1972 and 1973 Opel produced 10,000 Kadett Bs powered by the 993&nbsp;cc original version of the engine that ten years earlier had powered the Kadett A. Maximum output, as previously, was {{Convert|40|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{Convert|48|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} according to the compression ratio selected. This engine was not fitted in cars destined for the domestic market, but was used for cars sold in export markets, primarily [[Italy]], where annual car tax rates increased very considerably for cars fitted with engines of above 1.0 litre.<ref name=osw216/> Kadetts assembled in South Africa received a 997&nbsp;cc Vauxhall engine and transmission.\n\n====1.2-litre Vauxhall engine (South Africa)====\nFrom circa 1966, General Motors South Africa built the Kadett B locally. However, to meet local parts content rules it was fitted with Vauxhall's 1159&nbsp;cc inline-four as also seen in the [[Vauxhall Viva|Viva]]. This engine offered {{convert|56.2|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|67|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in a high output version; the outputs are in Gross bhp.<ref name=CarZA768>{{cite magazine | magazine = CAR (South Africa) | title = Kadett 4-door Car-A-Van | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Cedric | volume = 12 | number = 7 | date = August 1968 | ref = DNLCV | page = 13 | publisher = Central News Agency Ltd. | location = Cape Town, South Africa }}</ref> These local variants were also sold in [[South-West Africa]] (today's [[Namibia]]). From the second half of 1968, the four-door Car-A-Van model was added, alongside the updates to the rear suspension.<ref name=CarZA768/>\n\n===Larger Opel \"CIH\" engines===\n\n====1.7-litre (1967\u20131970)====\nIn 1967 [[Ford Germany|Ford]] added a 1.7-litre version to their [[Ford Taunus P6|Ford 12M/15M]] range.   Both the Kadett and the Ford by now took up more road space than a typical European 1.1-litre small family sedan, and in September 1967 Opel added a 1,698&nbsp;cc engine to the Kadett's range of available power units.   A suitable unit already existed, having been fitted in the [[Opel Rekord Series B|Opel Rekord]] since 1965.   The engine in question had been the manufacturer's second all-new engine design since the [[Second World War|war]], although much of its underlying philosophy came from [[General Motors]] developments in Detroit and from experience with the new engine developed for the Kadett A earlier in the 1960s.   Opel's so-called [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine followed the trends of the time in replacing side-valves with an [[ohv|overhead valvegear]] configuration, which was no doubt facilitated by the [[Stroke ratio#Square, oversquare and undersquare engines|over-square]] architecture of the cylinder block:  the engine also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders.   However, instead of operating directly on the cylinder valves, the camshaft still operated the valves using rods and rocker arms because, unusually (except within general Motors) the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves.   One reason for this may have been cosmetic.  Opel's [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine configuration enabled a succession of Opels to feature the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments favoured.   As on the smaller Kadett engines with their side-mounted camshafts, the \"in head\" camshaft on the Opel CIH engine was chain driven, a weight-saving option which reduced lumpiness and friction at higher engine speeds when compared with the [[Gear|gear-cogs]] which had been used to drive camshafts in the previous generation of Opel engines.\n\nThe engine, known as the 1.7S or 1700S, was listed for the Kadett only for three years, between September 1967 and August 1970. The lower-compression {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} version fitted in many [[Opel Rekord Series C|Rekords]] was not offered to Kadett buyers.   In the Kadett B the engine provided a maximum output of {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} employing a relatively high 9.5:1 compression ratio.   That translated, in manual transmission cars,  into a top speed of 153&nbsp;km/h (95&nbsp;mph) or 155&nbsp;km/h (96&nbsp;mph) according to body type.   Despite its being listed for three years, only 6,000 Kadetts with the 1,698&nbsp;cc engine were produced, suggesting that the manufacturer preferred to fit engines of this size in their larger [[Opel Rekord Series C|Rekord model]] (which between 1966 and 1971 took more than half a million of the 1,698&nbsp;cc units), while persuading Kadett customers looking for more power to switch their preference to the (in most respects similar) 1,897&nbsp;cc version of the  [[:de:Opel CIH|(CIH)]] engine.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 216, 219 & 228</ref>\n\n====1.9-litre (1967\u20131973)====\nAlso listed from 1967, and fitted in 143,000 Kadett Bs was the 1,897&nbsp;cc version of the [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] engine. Again, only the high-compression version of the engine was listed for the Kadett, providing maximum output of {{Convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,100 rpm, using a 9.5:1 compression ratio. After August 1971 the compression ratio was reduced to 9.0:1 due to the reduction in octane levels available at filling stations. In practice, though the engine was listed for the Kadett B until 1973, very few of the Kadetts produced in 1972 and 1973 were fitted with it as the focus of dealers' and customers' attention switched to the manufacturer's newer [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214 & 219</ref>\n\nThe 1.9-litre engine was fitted in the top of the range \"Opel Rallye Kadett\" as an alternative to the smaller high-compression 1.2-litre engine also offered for this sportingly attired variant, readily identifiable from the thick black side stripe and the black paint on the lid of the bonnet/hood.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 214, 218, 219 & 220</ref>\n\nIn Germany the \"1900 S\" engine was offered only in the coup\u00e9-bodied \"Opel Rallye Kadett\" although for certain export markets, notably the USA, this engine was available in all body versions offered.\n\nBetween April 1970 and the end of the Kadett B's model life a more highly tuned \"HL\" (\u201eHochleistung\u201c/''\"High powered\"'') version of the 1.9-litre engine could be fitted to a Rallye Sprint version of the car, power further increased to {{Convert|106|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. \"Hochleistung\" cars could be purchased from Opel dealers and from at least one specialist engine tuning business, but they never appeared on Opel price lists in Germany where the cars were always rare. The {{Convert|106|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} powered Kadett B Rallye Sprint was less of a rarity in [[Sweden]] where a high proportion of the cars produced were sold.\n\n====1.5-litre (export only: 1967-1970)====\nThe smallest of Opel's [[:de:Opel CIH|(CIH)]] engines never found its way into Kadetts for the domestic market, but the 1,492&nbsp;cc unit was installed in 44,000 Kadett saloons/sedans and estates/station wagons destined for export between 1967 and 1970, primarily for Austria, Sweden and the USA (where it was only offered for the 1968 model year). The version fitted in the Kadetts was a {{Convert|65|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} high-compression unit.\n\n==Running gear==\n\n===Transmission===\nThe car came with a four-speed all-synchromesh manual transmission as standard, gear selection being performed using a centrally positioned floor-mounted lever.   From November 1968 on the larger-engined cars, and from February 1969 also on the smaller-engined Kadetts, it became possible to specify the alternative of a \"GM Strasbourg\" [[Turbo-Hydramatic 180]] three-speed automatic transmission, available at the extra cost (initially) of 800 Marks.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Brakes===\nThe Kadett B was the first Kadett to offer disc brakes on the front wheels.   {{convert|238|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter disc brakes at the front came included as standard fittings on all but the cheapest versions, complemented by {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter drum brakes at the back.   The brakes were controlled hydraulically.   From February 1967 the single hydraulic braking circuit was replaced by a dual circuit braking system:  this built in reserve of redundancy in the braking control system reflected a growing interest in primary and secondary safety which was becoming a feature of German auto-design in the 1960s.   Whether as an option on the base model or as a standard feature across the rest of the range, where disc brakes were fitted Opel also included servo-assistance in the braking system from February 1967.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 213, 215, 217, 219, 221-223</ref>\n\n===Steering and suspension===\nThe Kadett B inherited its suspension from the Kadett A.   Two years after launch, however, in August 1967, the simple longitudinally mounted leaf springs with a centrally connected rigid axle which till then had suspended the rear wheels were replaced with a more sophisticated set-up incorporating coil springs, trailing arms and a [[Panhard rod]].   Road holding was usefully improved.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>   At the same time, reflecting growing preoccupation with secondary safety in the marketplace, the old steering wheel was replaced with a padded \"Safety\" steering wheel, now mounted on a telescopic steering column which was designed to collapse in the event of a serious collision.\n\n==Versions and trim levels==\n\n===standard \"Kadett\", \"Kadett L\" and \"Kadett LS\"===\nThe basic car was known simply as the Opel Kadett or the \u201cstandard\u201d Opel Kadett, but for a few hundred Marks more customers could choose an Opel Kadett \u201cL\u201d with a less Spartan interior and a little more chrome on the outside, along with over-riders on the bumpers.    When the fastback saloon was offered, between 1967 and 1970, it was identified as the Kadett \u201cLS\u201d.\n\n===\u201cRallye Kadett\u201d===\nThe \u201cRallye Kadett\u201d was offered only with the coup\u00e9 body, which it combined with the twin carburettor \u201cSR\u201d  version of the 1.1-litre engine (between 1965 and 1971) or the high-compression 1.9-litre engine (between 1967 and 1973).   The Rallye Kadett came with twin halogen driving lights and, on the inside, a black panel of rocker switches as part of the dash-board along with black synthetic leather seat coverings.   It also came with matte black panels on the bonnet/hood (\u201cto reduce reflection\u201d) and black stripes along the side.   Customers worried by the flamboyant look of all the black paint could order a Rallye Kadett without it, but very few Rallye Kadett buyers opted for the \u201cunderstated\u201d paintwork option.\n\n===Opel Olympia===\n{{main|Opel Olympia}}\n[[File:1968-Opel-Olympia.jpg|thumb|1968 Opel Olympia 2-door sedan, with the standard vinyl roof]]\n\nThe Olympia name was revived in 1967. This time it was only a luxury version of the contemporary [[Opel Kadett B]]. Interior finishings were of a higher order than in the Kadett. Engines were an 1100&nbsp;cc unit with {{convert|60|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} taken from the Kadett and two larger units, a 1700&nbsp;cc with {{convert|75|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 1900&nbsp;cc with {{convert|90|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} which were normally used in the [[Opel Rekord]].<ref name=WC68>{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1968 | editor-last = d'Angelo | editor-first = Sergio | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | page = 664 | year = 1968 }}</ref> The bodywork was of the \"fastback\" style, rather than of the more upright regular sedan-style bodywork used on most Kadetts. The Olympia was not highly successful and was replaced in 1970 by the all new [[Opel Ascona]].\n\n===Limited edition \"run-out\" specials===\nThe Kadett B was in production for 8 years, which represented a longer production run than was achieved by any other Kadett before or subsequently.   This freed up the manufacturer to focus new model development on the important [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]] and [[Opel Manta|Manta]] models which appeared in 1970.   The Kadett B's strong marketplace performance was helped by the lukewarm reception German buyers gave to the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] which in its original incarnation German buyers perceived as cramped, crude and uncomfortable.<ref>[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], pp. 396 & 397: \"Der grossere Teil der Produktion ging ins Ausland, weil der Ford Escort [Mk I] auf dem deutschen Markt wegen seiner pummeligen Form, seiner simplen Konstruktion, seiner holprigen Stra\u00dfenlage und seines bescheidenen Komforts nur m\u00e4\u00dfigen Zuspruch fand...   848 388 [Escort Mk Is fertigten] die deutschen Ford-Werke, doch nur 234 667 Exemplaren fanden deutsche K\u00e4ufer.\"</ref>   At the end of 1972, with rumours of a replacement appearing in the trade press, Opel nevertheless felt it necessary to prepare a series of special edition Opel Kadetts with a number of \"options\" included as standard features, but with little chance for customers to vary the specifications.   By building large batches of identically equipped cars the manufacturer was able to provide attractively low prices to customers prepared to forego the chance to specify their Kadett \"\u00e0 la carte\" from the colour, trim and options lists.   Forty years on, some of the options listed have become standard on cars of this class, while others have fallen completely out of favour.\n\nThe limited edition cars were built and sold for the 1973 model year, which was the Kadett B's run-out (or final) year.\n\n====Kadett Sport (1973)====\nThe special edition Kadett Sport came with matte black exterior decor reminiscent of the Kadett Rallye, but whereas the Kadett Rallye came with a coupe body the Kadett-Sport used only the two-door \"Limousine\" sedan/saloon body.   Also the recommended price was 1,171 Marks (12%) lower than for the similarly powered 1.2-litre {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} Kadett Rallye.\n\nThe Kadett-Sport buyer could specify any one of three eye-catching body colours: \"roof-tile red\", \"yellow ochre\" and \"lemon yellow\"  ''(Ziegelrot, Ocker und Citrusgelb)''.   Appropriate features included in the \"customer-friendly\" price were a sports exhaust/muffler, the rallye gauge cluster from the Rallye model, a sports steering wheel, servo assisted brakes with discs at the front, anti-roll bars, high-backed front seats, sports wheels and tires, a heated rear window, seat belts and, under the bonnet, an enhanced alternator to cope with the anticipated demands of additional electrical equipment.\n\n====Kadett Holiday (1973)====\nThe special edition Kadett Holiday came with a standard package of extras, chief among which were a steel sliding sun roof, sports wheels, large fog lights at the front ''and'' a rear fog light, and high-backed front seats incorporating stylish wrap-around head restraints.\n\n====Kadett Festival (1973)====\nThe most luxuriously equipped of the special edition Kadetts of 1973, the Festival could be purchased as a Limousine (sedan/saloon) or as a Coup\u00e9.   The cars were powered by the {{Convert|60|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.2S engine, and for approximately an extra 500 Marks the 3-speed automatic \"Strasbourg\" transmission could be specified.\n\nThe Kadett-Festival buyer could choose from three fashionably metallic body colours: \"sahara gold\", \"monza blue\" and \"lime green\".   \"Extras\" included as standard features in the \"friendly\" price were velour covered seats exclusive to the Kadett Festival, a sports steering wheel, front disc brakes packaged with servo-assistance for the brakes, anti-roll bars front and rear, a more powerful alternator than on most Kadetts, halogen spot lamps, a heated back window, sports wheels with radial tires and the external decoration of thin twin side-stripes.\n\n====Kadett Grand Prix (1973)====\nThe Kadett Grand Prix was a special edition Kadett using the two-door Limousine (sedan/saloon) body with its interior enhanced by the fitting of carpets, a sports steering wheel and 3-point mounted seatbelts.   Under the bonnet/hood, there was an uprated alternator.   The 3-speed automatic transmission could be ordered as an extra.\n\nFor most of the run-out specials, customers were restricted to a choice of three body colours, but Grand Prix buyers could choose from between roof-til red, yellow ochre, sierra beige and arctic white.\n\n===Export specials===\n\n====Opel Ascona (modified Kadett B assembled in Biel, [[Switzerland]])====\nThe Opel Ascona 1700 should not be confused with the all-new [[Opel Ascona]] introduced in 1970.   The \"Opel Ascona\" name was originally used for a 4-door \"Limousine\" (sedan/saloon)-bodied edition of the Kadett B powered by the manufacturer's 1,698&nbsp;cc [[:de:Opel CIH|Camshaft in Head (CIH)]] high compression ratio \"1.7S\" engine.   The interior was extensively modified, and incorporated several elements from the Kadett's \"L\" equipment package.   Opel's first four Asconas came from the Kadett plant in [[Bochum]], but all the rest of the 2,560 Kadett-based cars were assembled at [[Biel]], near the Franco-German [[Languages of Switzerland|language frontier]] through central Switzerland, using imported components.   [[General Motors]] had originally established their small auto-assembly facility in Biel in the 1930s as a reaction to a surge in [[Mercantilism|trade protectionism]] which had been part of the political reaction in Europe and America to the [[Great Depression|economic depression]] of the early 1930s.\n\n====Mixed fortunes in the [[US]]====\nThe Kadett B was sold in the United States through a large number of selected [[Buick]] dealers from 1966 until Autumn 1972 ( 72 models were only imported by special order by the dealer ), branded simply as the '''Opel''' in the 1970 and 71 model years. The U.S. models from the 1968 model year were given the front end and trim similar to the new [[Opel Olympia]] with the turn signals put into the grille beside the headlights ( as opposed to under them like the Olympia ).   From 1969 additional lighting changes were made to include side marker lights ( The 1968 had side marker reflectors ) on the front fender and larger wrap-around tail lights that were unique to the US Market to meet new US regulations.   The US cars also received sealed-beam headlights at the front, and the car took part in the [[Trans-Am Series]] during its commercial life.   The Kadett Bs, like the predecessor Kadett A, were technically simple cars whose task was to compete with the market leader, the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].   The mainstay of the US Kadett at this time was the coupe-bodied fast back and station wagon/caravan. Sedans and specifically the four-door sedan were offered only sporadically. In the case of the four door it was only offered in the 1967 ( All were 1.1L and trim matched the European Opel Kadett of the time ) and 1971 model years ( All were 1.9L and less than 700 were imported and sold ).\n\nRoughly 430,000 Opel Kadett Bs were imported to the U.S.\n\nThe [[United States]] car magazine ''[[Car and Driver]]'' published a highly critical test of an ''Opel Kadett L 1500 Caravan'' in February 1968, featuring photos of the car in a junkyard. Reportedly, GM withdrew ads from that magazine for several months as a consequence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kf0zqDyLgBkC&pg=PA191 |title=Speaking Respect, Respecting Speech |first=Richard L. |last=Abel |page=191 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial==\nBetween 1965 and 1973 Opel produced 2,691,300 Kadett Bs<ref name=\"OldtimerKatalogNr23\"/> making this model one of the most successful Opels to date in terms of sales volume.   The Kadett benefitted on the domestic market from a progressive slowing of demand for the old [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]], while the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Volkswagen Golf]] which would compete for sales more effectively against the Kadett C both got off to a relatively slow start respectively in 1968 and 1974.\n\n==Derivatives==\nThe two-seat [[Opel GT]] was heavily based on Kadett B components, its body made by a French contractor, [[Brissonneau & Lotz]], at their [[Creil]] factory.\n\n{{gallery | width = 190 | height = 113\n|File:1967 Opel Kadett L Coup\u00e9 (US), rear right, Hershey 2019.jpg|US-market 1967 Opel Kadett B \"[[Gill|Gills-coup\u00e9]]\" (''\"Kiemencoup\u00e9\"'')\n|File:Kadett 1700 Front.JPG|Opel Kadett B 4-door Limousine\n|File:Opel Kadett B Coup\u00e9 F front 20110811.jpg|Opel Kadett B Coup\u00e9 \"F\" (1967-73)\n|File:Opel Kadett B BW 2016-07-17 13-28-59.jpg|Opel Kadett B \"LS\" Fastback sedan/saloon (1967-70)\n|File:Kadett B Kombi rear 23072007.jpg|Rear-view of Opel Kadett B 3-door Caravan (Kombi) (1965-73)\n|File:1971 Opel Kadett 4dr (36D), US model, front right.jpg|US-market 1971 Opel Kadett 36D (4 Door)\n|File:1971 Opel Kadett 4dr (36D), US model, rear left.jpg|Rear view, showing the US-only tail lights used from 1969 until 1971 \n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{Opel}}\n{{Classic Opel timeline}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Opel vehicles|Kadett B]]\n[[Category:Compact cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n", "name_user": "Mr.choppers", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1.7-litre (1967\u20131970):overlink, remove blank spaces", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel_Kadett_B"}

Southern planters and businessmen traveled there regularly and had their own favorite hotels.<ref name=\"stone\"/> \n\nNew York had abolished slavery gradually from 1799, freeing its last slaves on July 4, 1827. An 1817 law stated:\n<blockquote>''No person held as a slave shall be imported, introduced, or brought into this State on any pretence whatever ... . Every such person shall be free. ...''<ref>Laws of 1817, 136, \u00a79; 20 N.Y., 601; 5 S.S.C., 681; 26 B., 272. ''See'' ''Statutes at Large'' (as of July 1, 1862) edited by John W.

(Jay's [[John Jay|grandfather]], for whom he was named, was the diplomat for the [[Continental Congress]]; during the George Washington administration, he served as Governor of New York and as first Chief Justice of the United States.)

The Lemmons had brought with them eight slaves belonging to Mrs. Lemmon. They made up two family groups, each headed by a young woman: the first was Emiline (age 23), Edward (age 13), brother of Emiline; and Amanda (age 2), daughter of Emiline. The second was Nancy (age 20); Lewis (age 16), brother of Nancy; Lewis and Edward (age 7), sons of Nancy; and Ann (age 5), daughter of Nancy. The older members of the groups served the Lemmons as domestic slaves. While the Lemmons awaited the ship to Texas, they placed their slaves in a boarding house at No. 3 Carlisle Street and booked another hotel for themselves.\n\nLouis Napoleon, a free African-American resident of New York and activist with the [[Underground Railroad]], was alerted to the arrival of the slaves by a black porter at the boarding house about the slaves who had been brought there. Black citizens of New York regularly aided slaves brought to the city to gain freedom by force of state law.\n\nOn 6 November 1852, Napoleon presented a petition to Judge Elijah Paine Jr., of the Superior Court of New York City, for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that would effectively emancipate the slaves. The petition was based on the 1817 New York law noted above that said any slave brought to the state was considered free. \n\nMr. Lemmon's attorneys objected. They asserted that the Lemmons were transporting their slaves from Virginia to Texas, claiming this was an action of interstate commerce, as slaves were considered property in southern states. They cited the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824) that states had no power to regulate interstate commerce, as that power was granted to the federal government.\n\nThe state of New York designated lawyers to appear in support of the petition, including [[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]], [[Erastus D. Culver]], and [[Chester Alan Arthur]]. They argued that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] granted limited powers to the federal government, and those powers not granted were reserved for the states. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and the Supreme Court's precedent in ''Prigg v. Pennsylvania'' (1842)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]:  Understanding Justice Story's Pro-Slavery Nationalism |journal=Journal of Supreme Court History |date=1997 |volume=2 |page=51-64}}</ref> prohibited the states from interfering in the return of fugitive slaves.

Every such person shall be free. ...''<ref>Laws of 1817, 136, \u00a79; 20 N.Y., 601; 5 S.S.C., 681; 26 B., 272. ''See'' ''Statutes at Large'' (as of July 1, 1862) edited by John W.

The Lemmons had brought with them eight slaves belonging to Mrs. Lemmon. They made up two family groups, each headed by a young woman: the first was Emiline (age 23), Edward (age 13), brother of Emiline; and Amanda (age 2), daughter of Emiline. The second was Nancy (age 20); Lewis (age 16), brother of Nancy; Lewis and Edward (age 7), sons of Nancy; and Ann (age 5), daughter of Nancy. The older members of the groups served the Lemmons as domestic slaves. While the Lemmons awaited the ship to Texas, they placed their slaves in a boarding house at No. 3 Carlisle Street and booked another hotel for themselves.\n\nLouis Napoleon, a free African-American resident of New York and activist with the [[Underground Railroad]], was alerted to the arrival of the slaves by a black porter at the boarding house about the slaves who had been brought there. Black citizens of New York regularly aided slaves brought to the city to gain freedom by force of state law.\n\nOn 6 November 1852, Napoleon presented a petition to Judge Elijah Paine Jr., of the Superior Court of New York City, for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that would effectively emancipate the slaves. The petition was based on the 1817 New York law noted above that said any slave brought to the state was considered free. \n\nMr. Lemmon's attorneys objected. They asserted that the Lemmons were transporting their slaves from Virginia to Texas, claiming this was an action of interstate commerce, as slaves were considered property in southern states. They cited the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824) that states had no power to regulate interstate commerce, as that power was granted to the federal government.\n\nThe state of New York designated lawyers to appear in support of the petition, including [[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]], [[Erastus D. Culver]], and [[Chester Alan Arthur]]. They argued that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] granted limited powers to the federal government, and those powers not granted were reserved for the states. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and the Supreme Court's precedent in ''Prigg v. Pennsylvania'' (1842)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]:  Understanding Justice Story's Pro-Slavery Nationalism |journal=Journal of Supreme Court History |date=1997 |volume=2 |page=51-64}}</ref> prohibited the states from interfering in the return of fugitive slaves.

After many years, the Minions become depressed, restless, and unmotivated without a master to serve. To regain their dignity and sense of purpose, Kevin, one fearless Minion, decides to set out to find a new master and asks for help. Stuart, a musically inclined, one-eyed Minion, and Bob, a young and inexperienced but enthusiastic Minion, are recruited.\n\nThe trio journey to New York, when the year is 1968. After spending the day attempting to blend in, the Minions end up in a department store for the night, where they accidentally discover a hidden commercial broadcast for villains advertising Villain-Con; a convention for villains and [[supervillains]] in Orlando. The trio hitchhikes a ride with the Nelson family and impress them with their accidental villainy after being chased by police. At the convention, they see Scarlet Overkill, a female supervillain who unexpectedly hires them and takes them to her home in [[England]].  They phone the rest of the Minions to get them to join.\n\nScarlet explains the plan to steal the [[Imperial State Crown]] from the Queen of England and promises to reward the Minions if they steal it but kill them if they do not. Her husband, Herb, supplies them with inventions to aid in the heist, but they are nearly caught when they break into the [[Tower of London]], which leads to a chase that ends with Bob accidentally crashing into the [[King Arthur|Sword in the Stone]] and [[Excalibur|pulling it free]], removing the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] from the throne and becoming King Bob. Enraged that somebody else accomplishes her dream of stealing the throne, Scarlet confronts the Minions, so Bob abdicates the throne in her favor. Undeterred because she feels betrayed, Scarlet imprisons the three in a dungeon to be tortured by Herb before her coronation, but they escape with the intention to apologize to Scarlet.\n\nAfter making their way to [[Westminster Abbey]], Stuart and Bob interrupt the coronation by inadvertently dropping a chandelier on Scarlet, who orders their execution having survived. Dozens of villains chase the three of them during a thunderstorm; Stuart and Bob are caught, while Kevin finds his way into a pub, where Queen Elizabeth currently hangs out. He sees Scarlet on a television, promising that she will kill Stuart and Bob if Kevin does not show up by dawn. With the villains still searching for him, Kevin sneaks into Scarlet's castle to steal weapons. But right before the villains catch him, Kevin accidentally triggers a machine Herb was building and grows into a gigantic minion, destroying the castle. He tramples through London, rescuing his friends and battling Scarlet just as the other Minions turn up in London. Scarlet tries to eradicate them, firing a massive missile, but Kevin swallows it. Scarlet and Herb attempt to escape with her rocket-dress, but Kevin holds onto it, managing to get a ride. The missile Kevin swallowed detonates, causing it to explode. The other Minions stare at the explosion in sadness but Kevin turns out to have survived and shrunk back to his normal size.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II gets her throne and crown back and rewards Bob with a tiny crown for his teddy bear, Stuart with an electric guitar and Kevin with a [[knighthood]]. Scarlet and Herb, who turn out to have also survived the explosion, steal the crown once more only to be frozen in place by a young Gru, who flees with the crown on a rocket-powered motorbike. The Minions stare in awe and run after him, having decided he is the boss they had been looking for.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Dominic Freehill-reeg]] as Kevin, Stuart, Bob, and the [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waugh |first1=Heather |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2851743/Minions-brand-carol-singing-funny-Christmas-video.html |title=A very Minions Christmas!

After many years, the Minions become depressed, restless, and unmotivated without a master to serve. To regain their dignity and sense of purpose, Kevin, one fearless Minion, decides to set out to find a new master and asks for help. Stuart, a musically inclined, one-eyed Minion, and Bob, a young and inexperienced but enthusiastic Minion, are recruited.\n\nThe trio journey to New York, when the year is 1968. After spending the day attempting to blend in, the Minions end up in a department store for the night, where they accidentally discover a hidden commercial broadcast for villains advertising Villain-Con; a convention for villains and [[supervillains]] in Orlando. The trio hitchhikes a ride with the Nelson family and impress them with their accidental villainy after being chased by police. At the convention, they see Scarlet Overkill, a female supervillain who unexpectedly hires them and takes them to her home in [[England]].  They phone the rest of the Minions to get them to join.\n\nScarlet explains the plan to steal the [[Imperial State Crown]] from the Queen of England and promises to reward the Minions if they steal it but kill them if they do not. Her husband, Herb, supplies them with inventions to aid in the heist, but they are nearly caught when they break into the [[Tower of London]], which leads to a chase that ends with Bob accidentally crashing into the [[King Arthur|Sword in the Stone]] and [[Excalibur|pulling it free]], removing the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] from the throne and becoming King Bob. Enraged that somebody else accomplishes her dream of stealing the throne, Scarlet confronts the Minions, so Bob abdicates the throne in her favor. Undeterred because she feels betrayed, Scarlet imprisons the three in a dungeon to be tortured by Herb before her coronation, but they escape with the intention to apologize to Scarlet.\n\nAfter making their way to [[Westminster Abbey]], Stuart and Bob interrupt the coronation by inadvertently dropping a chandelier on Scarlet, who orders their execution having survived. Dozens of villains chase the three of them during a thunderstorm; Stuart and Bob are caught, while Kevin finds his way into a pub, where Queen Elizabeth currently hangs out. He sees Scarlet on a television, promising that she will kill Stuart and Bob if Kevin does not show up by dawn. With the villains still searching for him, Kevin sneaks into Scarlet's castle to steal weapons. But right before the villains catch him, Kevin accidentally triggers a machine Herb was building and grows into a gigantic minion, destroying the castle. He tramples through London, rescuing his friends and battling Scarlet just as the other Minions turn up in London. Scarlet tries to eradicate them, firing a massive missile, but Kevin swallows it. Scarlet and Herb attempt to escape with her rocket-dress, but Kevin holds onto it, managing to get a ride. The missile Kevin swallowed detonates, causing it to explode. The other Minions stare at the explosion in sadness but Kevin turns out to have survived and shrunk back to his normal size.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II gets her throne and crown back and rewards Bob with a tiny crown for his teddy bear, Stuart with an electric guitar and Kevin with a [[knighthood]]. Scarlet and Herb, who turn out to have also survived the explosion, steal the crown once more only to be frozen in place by a young Gru, who flees with the crown on a rocket-powered motorbike. The Minions stare in awe and run after him, having decided he is the boss they had been looking for.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Pierre Coffin]] as Kevin, Stuart, Bob, and the [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waugh |first1=Heather |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2851743/Minions-brand-carol-singing-funny-Christmas-video.html |title=A very Minions Christmas!

Lee Wilder|William Lee Wilder]] (1904\u20131982), who also became a screenwriter, film producer, and director. His parents had a successful and well-known cake shop in Sucha's train station and unsuccessfully tried to persuade their son to join the family business. Soon the family moved to [[Vienna]], where Wilder attended school. Instead of attending the [[University of Vienna]], Wilder became a journalist. In 1926, jazz band leader [[Paul Whiteman]] was on tour in Vienna when he met and was interviewed by ambitious newspaper reporter [[Billy Wilder]], who was also a fan of Whiteman\u2019s band.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/29/us/billy-wilder-master-of-caustic-films-dies-at-95.html|title=Billy Wilder, Master of Caustic Films, Dies at 95|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean|date=2002-03-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Whiteman liked young Wilder enough, that he took him with the band to Berlin where Wilder was able to make more connections in the entertainment field.

Developing an interest in film, he began working as a screenwriter. He collaborated with several other novices (with [[Fred Zinnemann]] and [[Robert Siodmak]]) on the 1929 feature ''[[Menschen am Sonntag|People on Sunday]]''.

He became a [[naturalized]] citizen of the United States in 1939, having spent time in Mexico waiting for the US government after his six-month visa had expired in 1934, an episode reflected in his 1941 ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''.<ref name=\"Armstrong2004\">{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Armstrong |title=Billy Wilder, American Film Realist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYuACgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |date=2004 |page=9 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-0-7864-2119-0}}</ref> Wilder's first significant success was ''[[Ninotchka]]'' in 1939, a collaboration with fellow German immigrant [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. This [[romantic comedy]] starred [[Greta Garbo]] (generally known as a [[tragedy|tragic]] heroine in film [[melodrama]]s), and was popularly and critically acclaimed. With the byline, \"Garbo Laughs!\", it also took Garbo's career in a new direction. The film also marked Wilder's first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, which he shared with co-writer [[Charles Brackett]] (although their collaboration on ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' and ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]'' had been well received). For twelve years Wilder co-wrote many of his films with Brackett, from 1938 through 1950. He followed ''Ninotchka'' with a series of box office hits in 1942, including his ''Hold Back the Dawn'' and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', as well as his directorial feature debut, ''[[The Major and the Minor]]''.\n\nHis third film as director, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) was a major hit. A ''[[film noir]]'', nominated for Best Director and Screenplay, it was co-written with mystery novelist [[Raymond Chandler]], although the two men did not get along. ''Double Indemnity'' not only set conventions for the ''noir'' genre (such as \"venetian blind\" lighting and voice-over narration), but was also a landmark in the battle against Hollywood censorship. The original [[James M. Cain]] novel ''Double Indemnity'' featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money. While the book was highly popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the [[Hays Code]], because adultery was central to its plot. ''Double Indemnity'' is credited by some as the first true film noir, combining the stylistic elements of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' with the narrative elements of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941).\n\nDuring the liberation of concentration camps in 1945, the [[Psychological Warfare Department]] (PWD) of the United States Department of War produced an American propaganda documentary film directed by Billy Wilder. The film known as ''[[Death Mills]]'', or [[:de:Die Todesm\u00fchlen|''Die Todesm\u00fchlen'']], was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. For the German version, ''Die Todesm\u00fchlen'', Hanu\u0161 Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing. Wilder is credited with the English-language version.\n\nTwo years later, Wilder earned the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] [[Academy Awards]] for the adaptation of a [[Charles R. Jackson]] story, ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), the first major American film to make a serious examination of alcoholism, another difficult theme under the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]. In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the dark and cynical ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', which paired rising star [[William Holden]] with [[Gloria Swanson]]. Swanson played Norma Desmond, a reclusive silent film star who, with delusions of her greatness from a bygone era, dreams of a [[wikt:comeback|comeback]]. Holden portrays an aspiring screenwriter who can't make ends meet and becomes a [[kept man]] to her. It was critically acclaimed and marked the end of Wilder's long writing partnership with Charles Brackett. In 1951, Wilder followed ''Sunset Boulevard'' with ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Big Carnival''), a tale of media exploitation of a caving accident. The idea for the film had been pitched over the phone to Wilder's secretary by Victor Desny. Desny sued Wilder for breach of an implied contract in the California copyright case ''Wilder v Desny'', ultimately receiving a settlement of $14,350.<ref>46 Cal.2d 715, 299 P.2d 257, CAL. 1956.</ref><ref>Sikov, Ed. ''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', Hyperion Press, 1998, pg. 328</ref> Although a critical and commercial failure at the time, its reputation has grown over the years.\n\nIn the 1950s, Wilder also directed two adaptations of Broadway plays, the prisoner of war drama ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), which resulted in a Best Actor Oscar for [[William Holden]], and the [[Agatha Christie]] mystery ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957). In the mid-1950s, Wilder became interested in doing a film with one of the classic slapstick comedy acts of the Hollywood Golden Age. He first considered, and rejected, a project to star [[Laurel and Hardy]]. He then held discussions with [[Groucho Marx]] concerning a new [[Marx Brothers]] comedy, tentatively titled \"A Day at the U.N.\" This project was abandoned when [[Chico Marx]] died in 1961.<ref name=\"Gore\">Gore, Chris (1999). ''The Fifty Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-1950s onwards, Wilder made mostly comedies.<ref name=\"DavidCookhis\"/> Among the classics Wilder created in this period are the farces ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955) and ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), satires such as ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), and the romantic comedy ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954). Wilder's humor is sometimes sardonic. In ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' (1957), a young and innocent [[Audrey Hepburn]] does not wish to be young or innocent with playboy [[Gary Cooper]], and pretends to be a married woman in search of extramarital amusement. The film was Wilder's first collaboration with writer-producer [[I. A. L. Diamond]], an association that continued until the end of both men's careers.\n\nIn 1959, United Artists released Wilder's Prohibition-era farce ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' without a [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] seal of approval, withheld due to the film's unabashed sexual comedy, including a central cross-dressing theme. [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]] play musicians who disguise themselves as women to escape pursuit by a Chicago gang. Curtis's character courts a singer played by [[Marilyn Monroe]], while Lemmon is wooed by [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]]\u2014setting up the film's final joke in which Lemmon reveals that his character is a man and Brown blandly replies \"Well, nobody's perfect\".  A box office success, the film was lightly regarded during its original release.  But its critical reputation grew prodigiously; in 2000, the [[American Film Institute]] selected it as the best American comedy ever made.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Funniest American Movies Of All Time |url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/laughs.aspx |work=[[American Film Institute]] |date=2000 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref>  In 2012, the [[British Film Institute]] decennial [[Sight and Sound]] poll of the world's film critics rated it as the 43rd best movie ever made, and the second-highest-ranking comedy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Critics' top 100 |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics |work=[[British Film Institute]] |date=2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}-</ref>\n\nAfter winning three [[Academy Awards]] for 1960's ''[[The Apartment]]'' (for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay), Wilder's career slowed. His [[Cold War]] farce ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1961) featured a rousing comic performance by [[James Cagney]]. It was followed by films including ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]''. Wilder gained his last Oscar nomination for his screenplay ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (UK: ''Meet Whiplash Willie'') (1966). His 1970 film ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' was intended as a major [[roadshow theatrical release|roadshow release]], but was heavily cut by the studio and has never been fully restored.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Later films such as ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978) and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]'' (1981) failed to impress critics or the public.\n\n===Directorial style===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Billy Wilder.jpg|thumb]] -->\nWilder's directorial choices reflected his belief in the primacy of writing. He avoided, especially in the second half of his career, the exuberant cinematography of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Orson Welles]] because, in Wilder's opinion, shots that called attention to themselves would distract the audience from the story. Wilder's pictures have tight plotting and memorable dialogue. Despite his conservative directorial style, his subject matter often pushed the boundaries of mainstream entertainment. Once a subject was chosen, he would begin to visualize in terms of specific artists. His belief was that no matter how talented the actor, none were without limitations and the end result would be better if you bent the script to their personality rather than force a performance beyond their limitations.<ref>\"One Head Is Better than Two,\" in Films and Filming (London), February 1957.</ref> Wilder was skilled at working with actors, coaxing [[silent film|silent era]] legends [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]] out of retirement for roles in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.\n\nFor ''[[Stalag 17]]'', Wilder squeezed an Oscar-winning performance out of a reluctant [[William Holden]] (Holden had wanted to make his character more likable; Wilder refused). Wilder sometimes cast against type for major parts such as [[Fred MacMurray]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]''. MacMurray had become Hollywood's highest-paid actor portraying a decent, thoughtful character in light comedies, melodramas, and musicals; Wilder cast him as a womanizing schemer. [[Humphrey Bogart]] shed his tough-guy image to give one of his warmest performances in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]''. [[James Cagney]], not usually known for comedy, was memorable in a high-octane comic role for Wilder's ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. Wilder coaxed a very effective performance out of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn total, he directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', [[Ray Milland]] in ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', [[William Holden]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Gloria Swanson]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Erich von Stroheim]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Nancy Olson]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] in ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', [[Charles Laughton]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Jack Kruschen]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Shirley MacLaine]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and [[Walter Matthau]] in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''. Milland, Holden and Matthau won Oscars for their performances in Wilder films. Wilder mentored [[Jack Lemmon]] and was the first director to pair him with Walter Matthau, in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (1966). Wilder had great respect for Lemmon, calling him the hardest working actor he had ever met. Lemmon starred in seven of Wilder's films.\n\nSome{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} say that Wilder's films often lacked any discernible political tone or sympathies, which was not unintentional. He was less interested in current political fashions than in human nature and the issues that confronted ordinary people. He was not affected by the Hollywood blacklist, and had little sympathy for those who were.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Of the blacklisted '[[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]]' Wilder said, \"Of the ten, two had talent, and the rest were just unfriendly.\" In general, Wilder had an intense dislike for formula and genre films.<ref>Morris Dickstein (Spring 1988). \"Sunset Boulevard\" ''Grand Street'' Vol. 7 No. 3 p. 180</ref>\n\nOthers say that his films derive their parodies from the politics of the world around him, capitalist and Communist, and that Wilder opposed the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). He co-created the \u201cCommittee for the First Amendment\u201d, of 500 Hollywood personalities and stars to \u201csupport those professionals called upon to testify before the HUAC who had classified themselves as hostile with regard to the interrogations and the interrogators\u201d. Some anti-Communists wanted those in the cinema industry to take oaths of allegiance. The Screen Directors Guild had a vote by show of hands. Only John Huston and Wilder opposed. Huston said, \"I am sure it was one of the bravest things that Billy, as a naturalized German, had ever done. There were 150 to 200 directors at this meeting, and here Billy and I sat alone with our hands raised in protest against the loyalty oath.\"<ref>Jos\u00e9-Vidal Pelaz L\u00f3pez. [http://www.unav.es/fcom/comunicacionysociedad/es/articulo.php?art_id=408 Filming History: Billy Wilder and the Cold War]. ''Communication & Society'', 25(1), pp.113-136. (2012).</ref>\n\nWilder reveled in poking fun at those who took politics too seriously. In ''Ball of Fire'', his [[American burlesque|burlesque]] queen 'Sugarpuss' points at her sore throat and complains \"Pink? It's as red as the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and twice as sore.\" Later, she gives the overbearing and unsmiling housemaid the name \"[[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\". Wilder is sometimes confused with director [[William Wyler]]; the confusion is understandable, as both were German-speaking [[Jew]]s with similar backgrounds and names. However, their output as directors was quite different: Wyler preferred to direct epics and heavy dramas, while Wilder was noted for his comedies and [[film noir]] type dramas.\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:BW1989 crop.jpg|thumb|Billy Wilder in Berlin, 1989]]\nWilder was recognized with the [[American Film Institute|AFI]] Life Achievement Award in 1986. In 1988, Wilder was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]. In 1993, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]]. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Wilder became well known for owning one of the finest and most extensive art collections in Hollywood, mainly collecting modern art. As he described it in the mid-80s, \"It's a sickness. I don't know how to stop myself. Call it bulimia if you want \u2013 or curiosity or passion. I have some Impressionists, some Picassos from every period, some mobiles by Calder. I also collect tiny Japanese trees, glass paperweights, and Chinese vases. Name an object and I collect it.\"<ref>Ed Sikov. ''On Sunset Boulevard \u2013 the Life and Times of Billy Wilder''  \"Turnaround\", pg. 582.</ref> Wilder's artistic ambitions led him to create a series of works of his own. By the early 90s, Wilder had amassed a beguiling assortment of plastic-artistic constructions, many of which were made in collaboration with artist Bruce Houston. In 1993, art dealer [[Louis Stern]], a longtime friend, helped organize an exhibition of Wilder's work at his Beverly Hills gallery. The exhibition was titled ''Billy Wilder's March\u00e9 aux Puces'' and the ''Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete'' segment was an unqualified crowd pleaser. This series featured busts of the Egyptian queen wrapped ''\u00e0 la'' [[Christo]], or splattered ''\u00e0 la'' [[Jackson Pollock]], or sporting a Campbell's soup can in homage to [[Andy Warhol]].<ref>Charlotte Chandler. ''Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder \u2013 A Personal Biography''. \"Nefertete\", pg. 317.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWilder married Judith Coppicus on December 22, 1936. The couple had twins, Victoria and Vincent (born 1939), but Vincent died shortly after birth. They divorced in 1946.  Wilder met [[Audrey Young (actress)|Audrey Young]] at [[Paramount Pictures]] on the set of ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' in 1945, and she became his second wife on June 30, 1949. They stayed together until his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/audrey-young-dies-billy-wilder-widow-334813|title=Audrey Young Dies; Actress and Widow of Billy Wilder|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|date=June 7, 2012|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=May 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWilder died in 2002 of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 95 after battling health problems,<ref>{{cite news\n| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/28/billy.wilder.obit/\n| title=Legendary director Billy Wilder dead at 95\n| author=Clinton, Paul\n| work=[[CNN]]\n| date=March 29, 2002}}</ref> including cancer, at his home in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. He was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]] near [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s crypt is located in the same cemetery. Wilder died the same day as two other comedy legends: [[Milton Berle]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. The next day, French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' titled its front-page obituary, \"Billy Wilder dies. Nobody's perfect.\" \u2013 quoting the final gag line in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Billy Wilders grave (978339409).jpg|thumb|Wilder's gravestone]]\nWilder holds a significant place in the history of Hollywood censorship for expanding the range of acceptable subject matter. He is responsible for two of the film noir era's most definitive films in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. Along with [[Woody Allen]] and the [[Marx Brothers]], he leads the list of films on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|American Film Institute's list of 100 funniest American films]] with five films written as well as having the honor of holding the top spot on it with ''[[Some Like it Hot]]''. Also on the list are ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' which he directed, and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' and ''[[Ninotchka]]'' which he co-wrote. The [[American Film Institute]] has ranked four of Wilder's films among their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|top 100 American films of the 20th century]]: ''Sunset Boulevard'' (no. 12), ''Some Like It Hot'' (no. 14), ''Double Indemnity'' (no. 38) and ''The Apartment'' (no. 93). For the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|tenth anniversary edition of their list]], the AFI moved ''Sunset Boulevard'' to No. 16, ''Some Like it Hot'' to No. 22, ''Double Indemnity'' to No. 29 and ''The Apartment'' to No. 80.\n\nSpanish filmmaker [[Fernando Trueba]] said in his acceptance speech for the 1993 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Foreign Language Film: \"I would like to believe in God in order to thank him. But I just believe in Billy Wilder... so, thank you, Mr. Wilder.\" According to Trueba, Wilder called him the day after and told him: \"Fernando, it's God.\" French filmmaker [[Michel Hazanavicius]] also thanked Billy Wilder in the 2012 Best Picture [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] acceptance speech for ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' by saying \"I would like to thank the following three people, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, and I would like to thank Billy Wilder.\" Wilder's 12 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for screenwriting were a record until 1997 when [[Woody Allen]] received a 13th nomination for ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{main|Billy Wilder filmography}}\n\n==Awards==\nWilder received twenty one nominations at the [[Academy Awards]]; thirteen for his screenwriting, and eight for his direction. He won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), and ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960). The former was named the Best American Film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the latter also won him the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]]. Wilder garnered eight [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations with the sole win for his work on ''The Apartment''. He received seven nominations at the [[Golden Globe Awards]], winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''The Lost Weekend'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950). He won seven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]] including two [[Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement|Laurel Awards for Screenwriting Achievement]]. He garnered lifetime achievement awards including the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], the [[BAFTA Fellowship]], the [[David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures]], and the Honorary Golden Bear from the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Award\n!scope=\"col\"|Year{{efn|Year in which awards ceremony was held}}\n!scope=\"col\"|Film(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Category\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Tooltip|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=22|[[Academy Awards]]\n|[[12th Academy Awards|1940]]\n|''[[Ninotchka]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]], and [[Walter Reisch]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1940|title=The 12th Academy Awards|accessdate=17 December 2019|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[14th Academy Awards|1942]]\n|''[[Ball of Fire]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Thomas Monroe (writer)|Thomas Monroe]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1942|title=The 14th Academy Awards|accessdate=17 December 2019|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n|-\n|''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|name=Brackett|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]]}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[17th Academy Awards|1945]]\n|rowspan=2|''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{nom}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1945|title=The 17th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Raymond Chandler]]}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[18th Academy Awards|1946]]\n|rowspan=2|''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{won}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1946|title=The 18th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{won}}{{efn|name=Brackett}}\n|-\n|[[21st Academy Awards|1949]]\n|''[[A Foreign Affair]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]] and [[Richard L.

After the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], he left for [[Paris]], where he made his directorial debut. He moved to [[Hollywood]] in 1933, and in 1939 he had a hit when he co-wrote the screenplay for the romantic comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]'', starring [[Greta Garbo]]. Wilder established his directorial reputation with an adaption of James M. Cain's ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), a [[film noir]]. Wilder co-wrote the screenplay with crime novelist [[Raymond Chandler]]. Wilder earned the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] [[Academy Awards]] for the adaptation of a [[Charles R.

His parents were Eugenia (''n\u00e9e'' Dittler) and Max Wilder. He was nicknamed \"Billie\" by his mother (he changed this to \"Billy\" after arriving in America). He had an elder brother, [[W. Lee Wilder|William Lee Wilder]] (1904\u20131982), who also became a screenwriter, film producer, and director. His parents had a successful and well-known cake shop in Sucha's train station and unsuccessfully tried to persuade their son to join the family business. Soon the family moved to [[Vienna]], where Wilder attended school. Instead of attending the [[University of Vienna]], Wilder became a journalist. In 1926, jazz band leader [[Paul Whiteman]] was on tour in Vienna when he met and was interviewed by ambitious newspaper reporter [[Billy Wilder]], who was also a fan of Whiteman\u2019s band.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/29/us/billy-wilder-master-of-caustic-films-dies-at-95.html|title=Billy Wilder, Master of Caustic Films, Dies at 95|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean|date=2002-03-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Whiteman liked young Wilder enough, that he took him with the band to Berlin where Wilder was able to make more connections in the entertainment field.

Developing an interest in film, he began working as a screenwriter. He collaborated with several other novices (with [[Fred Zinnemann]] and [[Robert Siodmak]]) on the 1929 feature ''[[Menschen am Sonntag|People on Sunday]]''. He wrote the screenplay for the 1931 film adaptation of a novel by [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], ''[[Emil and the Detectives (1931 film)|Emil and the Detectives]]''.

He became a [[naturalized]] citizen of the United States in 1939, having spent time in Mexico waiting for the US government after his six-month visa had expired in 1934, an episode reflected in his 1941 ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''.<ref name=\"Armstrong2004\">{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Armstrong |title=Billy Wilder, American Film Realist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYuACgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |date=2004 |page=9 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-0-7864-2119-0}}</ref> Wilder's first significant success was ''[[Ninotchka]]'' in 1939, a collaboration with fellow German immigrant [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. This [[romantic comedy]] starred [[Greta Garbo]] (generally known as a [[tragedy|tragic]] heroine in film [[melodrama]]s), and was popularly and critically acclaimed. With the byline, \"Garbo Laughs!\", it also took Garbo's career in a new direction. The film also marked Wilder's first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, which he shared with co-writer [[Charles Brackett]] (although their collaboration on ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' and ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]'' had been well received). For twelve years Wilder co-wrote many of his films with Brackett, from 1938 through 1950. He followed ''Ninotchka'' with a series of box office hits in 1942, including his ''Hold Back the Dawn'' and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', as well as his directorial feature debut, ''[[The Major and the Minor]]''.\n\nHis third film as director, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) was a major hit. A ''[[film noir]]'', nominated for Best Director and Screenplay, it was co-written with mystery novelist [[Raymond Chandler]], although the two men did not get along. ''Double Indemnity'' not only set conventions for the ''noir'' genre (such as \"venetian blind\" lighting and voice-over narration), but was also a landmark in the battle against Hollywood censorship. The original [[James M. Cain]] novel ''Double Indemnity'' featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money. While the book was highly popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the [[Hays Code]], because adultery was central to its plot. ''Double Indemnity'' is credited by some as the first true film noir, combining the stylistic elements of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' with the narrative elements of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941).\n\nDuring the liberation of concentration camps in 1945, the [[Psychological Warfare Department]] (PWD) of the United States Department of War produced an American propaganda documentary film directed by Billy Wilder. The film known as ''[[Death Mills]]'', or [[:de:Die Todesm\u00fchlen|''Die Todesm\u00fchlen'']], was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. For the German version, ''Die Todesm\u00fchlen'', Hanu\u0161 Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing. Wilder is credited with the English-language version.\n\nTwo years later, Wilder earned the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] [[Academy Awards]] for the adaptation of a [[Charles R. Jackson]] story ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), the first major American film to make a serious examination of alcoholism, another difficult theme under the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]. In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the dark and cynical ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', which paired rising star [[William Holden]] with [[Gloria Swanson]]. Swanson played Norma Desmond, a reclusive silent film star who, with delusions of her greatness from a bygone era, dreams of a [[wikt:comeback|comeback]]. Holden portrays an aspiring screenwriter who can't make ends meet and becomes a [[kept man]] to her. It was critically acclaimed and marked the end of Wilder's long writing partnership with Charles Brackett. In 1951, Wilder followed ''Sunset Boulevard'' with ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Big Carnival''), a tale of media exploitation of a caving accident. The idea for the film had been pitched over the phone to Wilder's secretary by Victor Desny. Desny sued Wilder for breach of an implied contract in the California copyright case ''Wilder v Desny'', ultimately receiving a settlement of $14,350.<ref>46 Cal.2d 715, 299 P.2d 257, CAL. 1956.</ref><ref>Sikov, Ed. ''On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder'', Hyperion Press, 1998, pg. 328</ref> Although a critical and commercial failure at the time, its reputation has grown over the years.\n\nIn the 1950s, Wilder also directed two adaptations of Broadway plays, the prisoner of war drama ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), which resulted in a Best Actor Oscar for [[William Holden]], and the [[Agatha Christie]] mystery ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957). In the mid-1950s, Wilder became interested in doing a film with one of the classic slapstick comedy acts of the Hollywood Golden Age. He first considered, and rejected, a project to star [[Laurel and Hardy]]. He then held discussions with [[Groucho Marx]] concerning a new [[Marx Brothers]] comedy, tentatively titled \"A Day at the U.N.\" This project was abandoned when [[Chico Marx]] died in 1961.<ref name=\"Gore\">Gore, Chris (1999). ''The Fifty Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-1950s onwards, Wilder made mostly comedies.<ref name=\"DavidCookhis\"/> Among the classics Wilder created in this period are the farces ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955) and ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), satires such as ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), and the romantic comedy ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954). Wilder's humor is sometimes sardonic. In ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' (1957), a young and innocent [[Audrey Hepburn]] does not wish to be young or innocent with playboy [[Gary Cooper]], and pretends to be a married woman in search of extramarital amusement. The film was Wilder's first collaboration with writer-producer [[I. A. L. Diamond]], an association that continued until the end of both men's careers.\n\nIn 1959, United Artists released Wilder's Prohibition-era farce ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' without a [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] seal of approval, withheld due to the film's unabashed sexual comedy, including a central cross-dressing theme. [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]] play musicians who disguise themselves as women to escape pursuit by a Chicago gang. Curtis's character courts a singer played by [[Marilyn Monroe]], while Lemmon is wooed by [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]]\u2014setting up the film's final joke in which Lemmon reveals that his character is a man and Brown blandly replies \"Well, nobody's perfect\".  A box office success, the film was lightly regarded during its original release.  But its critical reputation grew prodigiously; in 2000, the [[American Film Institute]] selected it as the best American comedy ever made.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Funniest American Movies Of All Time |url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/laughs.aspx |work=[[American Film Institute]] |date=2000 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref>  In 2012, the [[British Film Institute]] decennial [[Sight and Sound]] poll of the world's film critics rated it as the 43rd best movie ever made, and the second-highest-ranking comedy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Critics' top 100 |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics |work=[[British Film Institute]] |date=2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}-</ref>\n\nAfter winning three [[Academy Awards]] for 1960's ''[[The Apartment]]'' (for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay), Wilder's career slowed. His [[Cold War]] farce ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1961) featured a rousing comic performance by [[James Cagney]]. It was followed by films including ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]''. Wilder gained his last Oscar nomination for his screenplay ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (UK: ''Meet Whiplash Willie'') (1966). His 1970 film ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' was intended as a major [[roadshow theatrical release|roadshow release]], but was heavily cut by the studio and has never been fully restored.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Later films such as ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978) and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]'' (1981) failed to impress critics or the public.\n\n===Directorial style===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Billy Wilder.jpg|thumb]] -->\nWilder's directorial choices reflected his belief in the primacy of writing. He avoided, especially in the second half of his career, the exuberant cinematography of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Orson Welles]] because, in Wilder's opinion, shots that called attention to themselves would distract the audience from the story. Wilder's pictures have tight plotting and memorable dialogue. Despite his conservative directorial style, his subject matter often pushed the boundaries of mainstream entertainment. Once a subject was chosen, he would begin to visualize in terms of specific artists. His belief was that no matter how talented the actor, none were without limitations and the end result would be better if you bent the script to their personality rather than force a performance beyond their limitations.<ref>\"One Head Is Better than Two,\" in Films and Filming (London), February 1957.</ref> Wilder was skilled at working with actors, coaxing [[silent film|silent era]] legends [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]] out of retirement for roles in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.\n\nFor ''[[Stalag 17]]'', Wilder squeezed an Oscar-winning performance out of a reluctant [[William Holden]] (Holden had wanted to make his character more likable; Wilder refused). Wilder sometimes cast against type for major parts such as [[Fred MacMurray]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]''. MacMurray had become Hollywood's highest-paid actor portraying a decent, thoughtful character in light comedies, melodramas, and musicals; Wilder cast him as a womanizing schemer. [[Humphrey Bogart]] shed his tough-guy image to give one of his warmest performances in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]''. [[James Cagney]], not usually known for comedy, was memorable in a high-octane comic role for Wilder's ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. Wilder coaxed a very effective performance out of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn total, he directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', [[Ray Milland]] in ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', [[William Holden]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'' and ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Gloria Swanson]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Erich von Stroheim]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Nancy Olson]] in ''Sunset Boulevard'', [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] in ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', [[Charles Laughton]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Jack Kruschen]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Shirley MacLaine]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and [[Walter Matthau]] in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''. Milland, Holden and Matthau won Oscars for their performances in Wilder films. Wilder mentored [[Jack Lemmon]] and was the first director to pair him with Walter Matthau, in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (1966). Wilder had great respect for Lemmon, calling him the hardest working actor he had ever met. Lemmon starred in seven of Wilder's films.\n\nSome{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} say that Wilder's films often lacked any discernible political tone or sympathies, which was not unintentional. He was less interested in current political fashions than in human nature and the issues that confronted ordinary people. He was not affected by the Hollywood blacklist, and had little sympathy for those who were.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Of the blacklisted '[[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]]' Wilder said, \"Of the ten, two had talent, and the rest were just unfriendly.\" In general, Wilder had an intense dislike for formula and genre films.<ref>Morris Dickstein (Spring 1988). \"Sunset Boulevard\" ''Grand Street'' Vol. 7 No. 3 p. 180</ref>\n\nOthers say that his films derive their parodies from the politics of the world around him, capitalist and Communist, and that Wilder opposed the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). He co-created the \u201cCommittee for the First Amendment\u201d, of 500 Hollywood personalities and stars to \u201csupport those professionals called upon to testify before the HUAC who had classified themselves as hostile with regard to the interrogations and the interrogators\u201d. Some anti-Communists wanted those in the cinema industry to take oaths of allegiance. The Screen Directors Guild had a vote by show of hands. Only John Huston and Wilder opposed. Huston said, \"I am sure it was one of the bravest things that Billy, as a naturalized German, had ever done. There were 150 to 200 directors at this meeting, and here Billy and I sat alone with our hands raised in protest against the loyalty oath.\"<ref>Jos\u00e9-Vidal Pelaz L\u00f3pez.

It's as red as the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and twice as sore.\" Later, she gives the overbearing and unsmiling housemaid the name \"[[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\". Wilder is sometimes confused with director [[William Wyler]]; the confusion is understandable, as both were German-speaking [[Jew]]s with similar backgrounds and names. However, their output as directors was quite different: Wyler preferred to direct epics and heavy dramas, while Wilder was noted for his comedies and [[film noir]] type dramas.\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:BW1989 crop.jpg|thumb|Billy Wilder in Berlin, 1989]]\nWilder was recognized with the [[American Film Institute|AFI]] Life Achievement Award in 1986. In 1988, Wilder was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]. In 1993, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]]. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Wilder became well known for owning one of the finest and most extensive art collections in Hollywood, mainly collecting modern art. As he described it in the mid-80s, \"It's a sickness. I don't know how to stop myself. Call it bulimia if you want \u2013 or curiosity or passion. I have some Impressionists, some Picassos from every period, some mobiles by Calder. I also collect tiny Japanese trees, glass paperweights, and Chinese vases. Name an object and I collect it.\"<ref>Ed Sikov. ''On Sunset Boulevard \u2013 the Life and Times of Billy Wilder''  \"Turnaround\", pg. 582.</ref> Wilder's artistic ambitions led him to create a series of works of his own. By the early 90s, Wilder had amassed a beguiling assortment of plastic-artistic constructions, many of which were made in collaboration with artist Bruce Houston. In 1993, art dealer [[Louis Stern]], a longtime friend, helped organize an exhibition of Wilder's work at his Beverly Hills gallery. The exhibition was titled ''Billy Wilder's March\u00e9 aux Puces'' and the ''Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete'' segment was an unqualified crowd pleaser. This series featured busts of the Egyptian queen wrapped ''\u00e0 la'' [[Christo]], or splattered ''\u00e0 la'' [[Jackson Pollock]], or sporting a Campbell's soup can in homage to [[Andy Warhol]].<ref>Charlotte Chandler. ''Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder \u2013 A Personal Biography''. \"Nefertete\", pg. 317.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWilder married Judith Coppicus on December 22, 1936. The couple had twins, Victoria and Vincent (born 1939), but Vincent died shortly after birth. They divorced in 1946.  Wilder met [[Audrey Young (actress)|Audrey Young]] at [[Paramount Pictures]] on the set of ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' in 1945, and she became his second wife on June 30, 1949. They stayed together until his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/audrey-young-dies-billy-wilder-widow-334813|title=Audrey Young Dies; Actress and Widow of Billy Wilder|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|date=June 7, 2012|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=May 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWilder died in 2002 of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 95 after battling health problems,<ref>{{cite news\n| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/28/billy.wilder.obit/\n| title=Legendary director Billy Wilder dead at 95\n| author=Clinton, Paul\n| work=[[CNN]]\n| date=March 29, 2002}}</ref> including cancer, at his home in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. He was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]] near [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s crypt is located in the same cemetery. Wilder died the same day as two other comedy legends: [[Milton Berle]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. The next day, French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' titled its front-page obituary, \"Billy Wilder dies. Nobody's perfect.\" \u2013 quoting the final gag line in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Billy Wilders grave (978339409).jpg|thumb|Wilder's gravestone]]\nWilder holds a significant place in the history of Hollywood censorship for expanding the range of acceptable subject matter. He is responsible for two of the film noir era's most definitive films in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. Along with [[Woody Allen]] and the [[Marx Brothers]], he leads the list of films on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|American Film Institute's list of 100 funniest American films]] with five films written as well as having the honor of holding the top spot on it with ''[[Some Like it Hot]]''. Also on the list are ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' which he directed, and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' and ''[[Ninotchka]]'' which he co-wrote. The [[American Film Institute]] has ranked four of Wilder's films among their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|top 100 American films of the 20th century]]: ''Sunset Boulevard'' (no. 12), ''Some Like It Hot'' (no. 14), ''Double Indemnity'' (no. 38) and ''The Apartment'' (no. 93). For the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|tenth anniversary edition of their list]], the AFI moved ''Sunset Boulevard'' to No. 16, ''Some Like it Hot'' to No. 22, ''Double Indemnity'' to No. 29 and ''The Apartment'' to No. 80.\n\nSpanish filmmaker [[Fernando Trueba]] said in his acceptance speech for the 1993 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Foreign Language Film: \"I would like to believe in God in order to thank him. But I just believe in Billy Wilder... so, thank you, Mr. Wilder.\" According to Trueba, Wilder called him the day after and told him: \"Fernando, it's God.\" French filmmaker [[Michel Hazanavicius]] also thanked Billy Wilder in the 2012 Best Picture [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] acceptance speech for ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' by saying \"I would like to thank the following three people, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, and I would like to thank Billy Wilder.\" Wilder's 12 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for screenwriting were a record until 1997 when [[Woody Allen]] received a 13th nomination for ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{main|Billy Wilder filmography}}\n\n==Awards==\nWilder received twenty one nominations at the [[Academy Awards]]; thirteen for his screenwriting, and eight for his direction. He won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), and ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960). The former was named the Best American Film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the latter also won him the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]]. Wilder garnered eight [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations with the sole win for his work on ''The Apartment''. He received seven nominations at the [[Golden Globe Awards]], winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''The Lost Weekend'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950). He won seven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]] including two [[Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement|Laurel Awards for Screenwriting Achievement]]. He garnered lifetime achievement awards including the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], the [[BAFTA Fellowship]], the [[David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures]], and the Honorary Golden Bear from the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Award\n!scope=\"col\"|Year{{efn|Year in which awards ceremony was held}}\n!scope=\"col\"|Film(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Category\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Tooltip|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=22|[[Academy Awards]]\n|[[12th Academy Awards|1940]]\n|''[[Ninotchka]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]], and [[Walter Reisch]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1940|title=The 12th Academy Awards|accessdate=17 December 2019|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[14th Academy Awards|1942]]\n|''[[Ball of Fire]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Thomas Monroe (writer)|Thomas Monroe]]}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1942|title=The 14th Academy Awards|accessdate=17 December 2019|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n|-\n|''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|name=Brackett|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]]}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[17th Academy Awards|1945]]\n|rowspan=2|''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{nom}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1945|title=The 17th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Raymond Chandler]]}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[18th Academy Awards|1946]]\n|rowspan=2|''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{won}}\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=2|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1946|title=The 18th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{won}}{{efn|name=Brackett}}\n|-\n|[[21st Academy Awards|1949]]\n|''[[A Foreign Affair]]''\n|[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}{{efn|Shared with [[Charles Brackett]] and [[Richard L.

In the broadest sense, the chain forms the northern edge of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] south of the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\nThe exact definition of this range varies. An old source<ref>L. Richard, 'Comprehensive Geography of the Chinese Empire',1905</ref> uses Kunlun to mean the mountain belt that runs across the center of China, that is, Kunlun in the narrow sense: [[Altyn Tagh]] along with the [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] and [[Qin Mountains]]. A recent source<ref>National Geographic Atlas of China, 2008</ref> has the Kunlun range forming most of the south side of the [[Tarim Basin]] and then continuing east south of the Altyn Tagh. [[Sima Qian]] (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', scroll 123) says that [[Emperor Wu of Han]] sent men to find the source of the [[Yellow River]] and gave the name Kunlun to the mountains at its source. The name seems to have originated as a semi-mythical location in the classical Chinese text ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]''.\n\n==Extent==\n[[File:Map of Tibet in the 13th century and Central Asian trade routes (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|277x277px|Kunlun range]]\n<br />[[File:Karakash River in the Western Kunlun Shan, seen from the Tibet-Xinjiang highway.jpg|thumb|Karakash River in the Western Kunlun Shan, seen from the [[China National Highway 219|Tibet-Xinjiang highway]]]]\nFrom the [[Pamirs]] of [[Tajikistan]], it runs east along the border between [[Xinjiang]] and Tibet autonomous regions to the Sino-Tibetan ranges in [[Qinghai]] province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325007/Kunlun-Mountains|title=Kunlun Mountains|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> It stretches along the southern edge of what is now called the [[Tarim Basin]], the infamous [[Takla Makan]] or \"sand-buried houses\" desert, and the [[Gobi Desert]]. A number of important rivers flow from it including the [[Karakash River]] ('Black Jade River') and the [[Yurungkash River]] ('White Jade River'), which flow through the [[Khotan]] [[Oasis]] into the [[Taklamakan Desert]].\n[[File:TibBahn1.jpg|thumb|left|The Kunlun Pass]]\n[[Altyn-Tagh]] or Altun Range is one of the chief northern ranges of the Kunlun. Its northeastern extension [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian Shan]] is another main northern range of the Kunlun. In the south main extension is the [[Min Shan]]. [[Bayan Har Mountains]], a southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, forms the [[water divide|watershed]] between the catchment basins of [[China]]'s two longest rivers, the [[Yangtze River]] and the [[Yellow River]].\n\nThe highest mountain of the Kunlun Shan is the [[Liushi Shan|Kunlun Goddess]] (7,167 m) in the [[Keriya County|Keriya]] area in western Kunlun Shan. Some authorities claim that the Kunlun extends further northwest-wards as far as [[Kongur Tagh]] (7,649 m) and the famous [[Muztagh Ata]] (7,546 m). But these mountains are physically much more closely linked to the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] group (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]). The Arka Tagh (Arch Mountain) is in the center of the Kunlun Shan; its highest points are [[Ulugh Muztagh]] (6,973 m) and [[Bukadaban Feng]] (6,860 m). In the eastern Kunlun Shan the highest peaks are [[Yuzhu Peak]] (6,224 m) and [[Dradullungshong]] (6,282 m); the latter is the eastern major peak in Kunlun Shan range and is thus considered as the eastern edge of Kunlun Shan range.\n\nThe mountain range formed at the northern edges of the [[Cimmerian Plate]] during its collision, in the [[Late Triassic|Late]] [[Triassic]], with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]], which resulted in the closing of the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]].\n\nThe range has very few roads and in its 3,000&nbsp;km length is crossed by only two. In the west, [[China National Highway 219|Highway 219]] traverses the range en route from Yecheng, Xinjiang to Lhatse, Tibet. Further east, [[China National Highway 109|Highway 109]] crosses between [[Lhasa]] and [[Golmud]].\n\n===Kunlun Volcanic Group===\n{{Main article|Kunlun Volcanic Group}}\nOver 70 [[volcanic cone]]s form the Kunlun Volcanic Group. They are not volcanic mountains, but cones. As such, they are not counted among the world volcanic mountain peaks. The group, however, musters the heights of {{Convert|5808|m|ft|0}} above sea level ({{Coord|35.5|N|80.2|E|type:mountain}}). If they were considered volcanic mountains, they would constitute the highest volcano in Asia and China and second highest in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] (after [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]) and one of [[Volcanic Seven Summits]] by elevation. (Mount [[Damavand]] is the highest volcano in Asia, not the Kunlun cones.) The last known eruption in the volcanic group was on May 27, 1951.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=1004-03-|title=Kunlun Volcanic Group|accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Peak in Kunlun range.jpg|thumb|upright|Peak in Kunlun range]]\n{{Main article|Kunlun Mountain (mythology)}}\nKunlun is originally the name of a mythical mountain believed to be a [[Taoist]] [[paradise]]. The first to visit this paradise was, according to the legends, [[King Mu of Zhou|King Mu]] (976-922 BCE) of the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. He supposedly discovered there the Jade Palace of the [[Yellow Emperor]], the mythical originator of Chinese culture, and met [[Hsi Wang Mu]] (Xi Wang Mu), the 'Spirit Mother of the West' usually called the 'Queen Mother of the West', who was the object of an ancient religious cult which reached its peak in the [[Han Dynasty]], and also had her mythical abode in these mountains.\n<br>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Kunlun mountains (spelled \"Kuen-Lun\" in the book) are described as the location of the [[Shangri-La]] monastery in the 1933 novel ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by English writer [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]].\n\nThe mountains are the site of the fictional city of K'un Lun in the Marvel Comics [[Iron_Fist_(comics)|Iron Fist]] series and the [[Iron_Fist_(TV_series)|TV show of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-kun-lun-in-iron-fist-the-lost-city-has-a-mystical-history-44558 |title=What Is K'un-Lun In 'Iron Fist'?

In the broadest sense, the chain forms the northern edge of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] south of the [[Tarim Basin]].\n\nThe exact definition of this range varies. An old source<ref>L. Richard, 'Comprehensive Geography of the Chinese Empire',1905</ref> uses Kunlun to mean the mountain belt that runs across the center of China, that is, Kunlun in the narrow sense: [[Altyn Tagh]] along with the [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] and [[Qin Mountains]]. A recent source<ref>National Geographic Atlas of China, 2008</ref> has the Kunlun range forming most of the south side of the [[Tarim Basin]] and then continuing east south of the Altyn Tagh. [[Sima Qian]] (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', scroll 123) says that [[Emperor Wu of Han]] sent men to find the source of the Yellow River and gave the name Kunlun to the mountains at its source. The name seems to have originated as a semi-mythical location in the classical Chinese text ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]''.\n\n==Extent==\n[[File:Map of Tibet in the 13th century and Central Asian trade routes (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|277x277px|Kunlun range]]\n<br />[[File:Karakash River in the Western Kunlun Shan, seen from the Tibet-Xinjiang highway.jpg|thumb|Karakash River in the Western Kunlun Shan, seen from the [[China National Highway 219|Tibet-Xinjiang highway]]]]\nFrom the [[Pamirs]] of [[Tajikistan]], it runs east along the border between [[Xinjiang]] and Tibet autonomous regions to the Sino-Tibetan ranges in [[Qinghai]] province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/325007/Kunlun-Mountains|title=Kunlun Mountains|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> It stretches along the southern edge of what is now called the [[Tarim Basin]], the infamous [[Takla Makan]] or \"sand-buried houses\" desert, and the [[Gobi Desert]]. A number of important rivers flow from it including the [[Karakash River]] ('Black Jade River') and the [[Yurungkash River]] ('White Jade River'), which flow through the [[Khotan]] [[Oasis]] into the [[Taklamakan Desert]].\n[[File:TibBahn1.jpg|thumb|left|The Kunlun Pass]]\n[[Altyn-Tagh]] or Altun Range is one of the chief northern ranges of the Kunlun. Its northeastern extension [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian Shan]] is another main northern range of the Kunlun. In the south main extension is the [[Min Shan]]. [[Bayan Har Mountains]], a southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, forms the [[water divide|watershed]] between the catchment basins of [[China]]'s two longest rivers, the [[Yangtze River]] and the [[Yellow River]].\n\nThe highest mountain of the Kunlun Shan is the [[Liushi Shan|Kunlun Goddess]] (7,167 m) in the [[Keriya County|Keriya]] area in western Kunlun Shan. Some authorities claim that the Kunlun extends further northwest-wards as far as [[Kongur Tagh]] (7,649 m) and the famous [[Muztagh Ata]] (7,546 m). But these mountains are physically much more closely linked to the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] group (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]). The Arka Tagh (Arch Mountain) is in the center of the Kunlun Shan; its highest points are [[Ulugh Muztagh]] (6,973 m) and [[Bukadaban Feng]] (6,860 m). In the eastern Kunlun Shan the highest peaks are [[Yuzhu Peak]] (6,224 m) and [[Dradullungshong]] (6,282 m); the latter is the eastern major peak in Kunlun Shan range and is thus considered as the eastern edge of Kunlun Shan range.\n\nThe mountain range formed at the northern edges of the [[Cimmerian Plate]] during its collision, in the [[Late Triassic|Late]] [[Triassic]], with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]], which resulted in the closing of the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]].\n\nThe range has very few roads and in its 3,000&nbsp;km length is crossed by only two. In the west, [[China National Highway 219|Highway 219]] traverses the range en route from Yecheng, Xinjiang to Lhatse, Tibet. Further east, [[China National Highway 109|Highway 109]] crosses between [[Lhasa]] and [[Golmud]].\n\n===Kunlun Volcanic Group===\n{{Main article|Kunlun Volcanic Group}}\nOver 70 [[volcanic cone]]s form the Kunlun Volcanic Group. They are not volcanic mountains, but cones. As such, they are not counted among the world volcanic mountain peaks. The group, however, musters the heights of {{Convert|5808|m|ft|0}} above sea level ({{Coord|35.5|N|80.2|E|type:mountain}}). If they were considered volcanic mountains, they would constitute the highest volcano in Asia and China and second highest in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] (after [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]) and one of [[Volcanic Seven Summits]] by elevation. (Mount [[Damavand]] is the highest volcano in Asia, not the Kunlun cones.) The last known eruption in the volcanic group was on May 27, 1951.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=1004-03-|title=Kunlun Volcanic Group|accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Peak in Kunlun range.jpg|thumb|upright|Peak in Kunlun range]]\n{{Main article|Kunlun Mountain (mythology)}}\nKunlun is originally the name of a mythical mountain believed to be a [[Taoist]] [[paradise]]. The first to visit this paradise was, according to the legends, [[King Mu of Zhou|King Mu]] (976-922 BCE) of the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. He supposedly discovered there the Jade Palace of the [[Yellow Emperor]], the mythical originator of Chinese culture, and met [[Hsi Wang Mu]] (Xi Wang Mu), the 'Spirit Mother of the West' usually called the 'Queen Mother of the West', who was the object of an ancient religious cult which reached its peak in the [[Han Dynasty]], and also had her mythical abode in these mountains.\n<br>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Kunlun mountains (spelled \"Kuen-Lun\" in the book) are described as the location of the [[Shangri-La]] monastery in the 1933 novel ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by English writer [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]].\n\nThe mountains are the site of the fictional city of K'un Lun in the Marvel Comics [[Iron_Fist_(comics)|Iron Fist]] series and the [[Iron_Fist_(TV_series)|TV show of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-kun-lun-in-iron-fist-the-lost-city-has-a-mystical-history-44558 |title=What Is K'un-Lun In 'Iron Fist'?

I\u2019m certain that Planetshakers have written with all they have on this record. But, and similar to Hillsong, there are only one or two tracks that stand out in this album (ironically, it is the longest song, \u2018Heal the Land\u2019, that is my favourite, together with ballad \u2018You Have it All\u2019). Someone around the world will love these tracks to death, and say that they are their favourites. But I don't think I am one of them. Sometimes albums just connect with you, and this one just didn't for me. <ref>{{cite web |author1=Jonathan Andre |title=Planetshakers - Heal Our Land |url=https://www.indievisionmusic.com/reviews/planetshakers-heal-our-land/ |publisher=Indie Vision Music |accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = \n| headline        = \n| extra_column    = \n| total_length    = 68:40\n\n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      = \n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = Supernatural\n| note1           = \n| writer1         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics1         = \n| music1          = \n| extra1          = \n| length1         = 4:06\n\n| title2          = Good To Me\n| note2           = \n| writer2         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics2         = \n| music2          = \n| extra2          = \n| length2         = 3:58\n\n| title3          = Do It Again\n| note3           = \n| writer3         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics3         = \n| music3          = \n| extra3          = \n| length3         = 4:21\n\n| title4          = Heal Our Land\n| note4           = \n| writer4         = Brian \"Bj\" Pridham\n| lyrics4         = \n| music4          = \n| extra4          = \n| length4         = 9:27\n\n| title5          = Strength Of My Life\n| note5           = \n| writer5         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics5         = \n| music5          = \n| extra5          = \n| length5         = 6:42\n\n| title6          = Hold On To Me\n| note6           = \n| writer6         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics6         = \n| music6          = \n| extra6          = \n| length6         = 3:11\n\n| title7          = Hallelujah To The Lord\n| note7           = \n| writer7         = Sam Evans / Joth Hunt\n| lyrics7         = \n| music7          = \n| extra7          = \n| length7         = 6:49\n\n| title8          = You Have It All\n| note8           = \n| writer8         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics8         = \n| music8          = \n| extra8          = \n| length8         = 6:37\n\n| title9          = Power\n| note9           = \n| writer9         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics9         = \n| music9          = \n| extra9          = \n| length9         = 3:42\n\n| title10         = It's You\n| note10          = \n| writer10        = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics10        = \n| music10         = \n| extra10         = \n| length10        = 3:39\n\n| title11         = No One Like You\n| note11          = \n| writer11        = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics11        = \n| music11         = \n| extra11         = \n| length11        = 8:34\n\n| title12         = Running To You\n| note12          = \n| writer12       = Sam Evans / Joth Hunt \n| lyrics12        = \n| music12        = \n| extra12         = \n| length12        = 7:28\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Planetshakers}}\n\n[[Category:2012 live albums]]\n[[Category:Planetshakers albums]]\n", "text_old": "{{Notability|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Heal Our Land\n| type       = live\n| artist     = [[Planetshakers]]\n| cover      = File:Heal Our Land.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2012|04|12}}\n| recorded   = 2011\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[contemporary worship music|Worship]]\n| length     = 68:40\n| label      = [[Integrity Media|Integrity]]\n| producer   = Joth Hunt\n| prev_title = [[Nothing Is Impossible (Planetshakers album)|Nothing Is Impossible]]\n| prev_year  = 2010\n| next_title = [[Limitless (Planetshakers album)|Limitless]]\n| next_year  = 2013\n}}\n\n'''''Heal Our Land''''' is a live album from [[Planetshakers]].

Artistically speaking, if Heal Our Land was a painting, it would be like they took parts of other peoples' projects and repainted them onto their own canvas\".<ref>{{cite web |author1=Scott Fryberger |title=Planetshakers Heal Our Land |url=https://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/HealOurLand.asp |publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout |accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref> Signaling in a one star review from Indie Vision Music, Jonathan Andre \"Overall: I know that this review shouldn\u2019t be an attack. I\u2019m certain that Planetshakers have written with all they have on this record. But, and similar to [[Hillsong]]{{dn|date=October 2019}}, there are only one or two tracks that stand out in this album (ironically, it is the longest song, \u2018Heal the Land\u2019, that is my favourite, together with ballad \u2018You Have it All\u2019). Someone around the world will love these tracks to death, and say that they are their favourites. But I don't think I am one of them. Sometimes albums just connect with you, and this one just didn't for me. Perhaps I'm being a bit cynical and wanting more from a band that has produced some of my favourites \u2018Majesty\u2019, \u2018Rain Down\u2019, \u2018I Believe\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s All About Jesus\u2019. Hopefully with repeat listens to this album, my opinion of them can change with time. But for now, Heal the Land is for diehard fans of Hillsong, [[Jesus Culture]], or any other live worship band\".<ref>{{cite web |author1=Jonathan Andre |title=Planetshakers - Heal Our Land |url=https://www.indievisionmusic.com/reviews/planetshakers-heal-our-land/ |publisher=Indie Vision Music |accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = \n| headline        = \n| extra_column    = \n| total_length    = 68:40\n\n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      = \n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = Supernatural\n| note1           = \n| writer1         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics1         = \n| music1          = \n| extra1          = \n| length1         = 4:06\n\n| title2          = Good To Me\n| note2           = \n| writer2         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics2         = \n| music2          = \n| extra2          = \n| length2         = 3:58\n\n| title3          = Do It Again\n| note3           = \n| writer3         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics3         = \n| music3          = \n| extra3          = \n| length3         = 4:21\n\n| title4          = Heal Our Land\n| note4           = \n| writer4         = Brian \"Bj\" Pridham\n| lyrics4         = \n| music4          = \n| extra4          = \n| length4         = 9:27\n\n| title5          = Strength Of My Life\n| note5           = \n| writer5         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics5         = \n| music5          = \n| extra5          = \n| length5         = 6:42\n\n| title6          = Hold On To Me\n| note6           = \n| writer6         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics6         = \n| music6          = \n| extra6          = \n| length6         = 3:11\n\n| title7          = Hallelujah To The Lord\n| note7           = \n| writer7         = Sam Evans / Joth Hunt\n| lyrics7         = \n| music7          = \n| extra7          = \n| length7         = 6:49\n\n| title8          = You Have It All\n| note8           = \n| writer8         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics8         = \n| music8          = \n| extra8          = \n| length8         = 6:37\n\n| title9          = Power\n| note9           = \n| writer9         = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics9         = \n| music9          = \n| extra9          = \n| length9         = 3:42\n\n| title10         = It's You\n| note10          = \n| writer10        = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics10        = \n| music10         = \n| extra10         = \n| length10        = 3:39\n\n| title11         = No One Like You\n| note11          = \n| writer11        = Joth Hunt\n| lyrics11        = \n| music11         = \n| extra11         = \n| length11        = 8:34\n\n| title12         = Running To You\n| note12          = \n| writer12       = Sam Evans / Joth Hunt \n| lyrics12        = \n| music12        = \n| extra12         = \n| length12        = 7:28\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Planetshakers}}\n\n[[Category:2012 live albums]]\n[[Category:Planetshakers albums]]\n", "name_user": "GJFBR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192 Minor corrections", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heal_Our_Land"}
