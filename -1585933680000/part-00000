From 110 BCE, with the [[Seleucid Empire]] disintegrating, the dynasty became fully independent, expanded into the neighbouring regions of [[Samaria]], [[Galilee]], [[Iturea]], [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]], and [[Idumea]], and took the title \"[[basileus]]\".

However, the same power vacuum that enabled the Jewish state to be recognized by the [[Roman Senate]] {{circa|lk=no|139}} BCE was later exploited by the Romans themselves. [[Hyrcanus II]] and [[Aristobulus II]], Simon's great-grandsons, became pawns in a [[proxy war]] between [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey the Great]]. The deaths of Pompey (48 BCE) and Caesar (44 BCE), and the related [[Liberators' civil war|Roman civil wars]] temporarily relaxed Rome's grip on the Hasmonean kingdom, allowing a brief reassertion of autonomy backed by the Parthian Empire. This short independence was rapidly crushed by the Romans under [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavian]].\n\nThe dynasty had survived for 103 years before yielding to the [[Herodian dynasty]] in 37 BCE. The installation of [[Herod the Great]] (an [[Idumean]]) as king in 37 BCE made Judea a Roman client state and marked the end of the Hasmonean dynasty. Even then, Herod tried to bolster the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a Hasmonean princess, [[Mariamne (second wife of Herod)|Mariamne]], and planning to drown the last male Hasmonean heir at his [[Jericho]] palace. In 6 CE, Rome joined Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea (biblical [[Edom]]) into the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judaea]]. In 44 CE, Rome installed the rule of a [[procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]] side by side with the rule of the Herodian kings (specifically [[Agrippa I]] 41\u201344 and [[Agrippa II]] 50\u2013100).\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe family name of the Hasmonean dynasty originates with the ancestor of the house, called by the Hellenized form Asmoneus or Asamoneus ({{lang-gr|\u1f08\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2}}) by [[Josephus Flavius]],<ref>''Jewish Antiquities'' 12:263 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+12.265]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+14.468]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+16.179],</ref> who is said to have been the great-grandfather of [[Mattathias]], but about whom nothing more is known.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Asmoneus|volume=2|page=763|first=John Henry Arthur|last=Hart}}</ref> The name appears to come from the Hebrew name ''Hashmonay'' (\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b7\u05d0\u05d9).<ref name=\"Atkinson2016\">{{cite book|author=Kenneth Atkinson|title=A History of the Hasmonean State: Josephus and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrfMDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA23|date=22 September 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-66903-2|pages=23\u2013}}</ref> An alternative view posits that the Hebrew name ''Hashmona'i'' is linked with the village of [[Heshbon]], mentioned in {{bibleverse||Joshua|15:27|HE}}.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Gott and Licht attribute the name to \"Ha Simeon,\" a veiled reference to the Simeonite Tribe.<ref>P.J.

The entire region was heavily contested between the successor states of Alexander's empire, the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], during the six [[Syrian Wars]] of the 3rd\u20131st centuries BCE: \"After two centuries of peace under the Persians, the Hebrew state found itself once more caught in the middle of power struggles between two great empires: the Seleucid state with its [[Antioch|capital in Syria]] to the north and the Ptolemaic state, with its [[Alexandria|capital in Egypt]] to the south...Between 319 and 302 BC, Jerusalem changed hands seven times.\"<ref name=\n\"Hooker\">Hooker, Richard. {{cite web |title=Yavan in the House of Shem.

Seleucid rule over the Jewish parts of the region then resulted in the rise of Hellenistic cultural and religious practices:  \"In addition to the turmoil of war, there arose in the Jewish nation pro-Seleucid and pro-Ptolemaic parties; and the schism exercised great influence upon the Judaism of the time. It was in [[Antioch]] that the Jews first made the acquaintance of Hellenism and of the more corrupt sides of Greek culture; and it was from Antioch that [[Judea]] henceforth was ruled.\"<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. {{cite web|title=Antiochus III The Great|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1588&letter=A&search=Antiochus%20III|accessdate=2007-01-23}} ''Jewish Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\n==Historical sources==\n[[File:Stattler-Machabeusze.jpg|thumb|[[Wojciech Stattler]]'s ''Machabeusze'' (Maccabees), 1844]]\nThe origin of the Hasmonean dynasty is recorded in the books [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]], covering the period from 175 to 134 BCE during which time the Hasmonean dynasty became semi-independent from the [[Seleucid empire]] but had not yet expanded far outside of Judea. The books are considered part of the [[Biblical canon]] by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches and [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] by most Protestants, but are not a part of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. They are written from the point of view that the salvation of the Jewish people in a crisis came from God through the family of Mattathias, particularly his sons Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan Apphus, and Simon Thassi, and his grandson [[John Hyrcanus]]. The books include historical and religious material from the [[Septuagint]] that was codified by [[Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians.\n\nThe other primary source for the Hasmonean dynasty is the first book of ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], (37\u2013{{circa}} 100 CE).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Josephus' account is the only primary source covering the history of the Hasmonean dynasty during the period of its expansion and independence between 110 to 63 BCE. Notably, Josephus, a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]] and former general in the Galilee, who survived the [[Jewish\u2013Roman wars|Roman\u2013Jewish wars]] of the 1st century, was a Jew who was captured by and cooperated with the Romans, writing his books in Rome, which has caused some to question his impartiality and credibility as a historian.<ref>Bentwich, Norman.  {{cite web|title=''Josephus''|url=http://www.preteristarchive.com/Books/1914_bentwich_josephus.html|accessdate=2007-01-18}}  Philadelphia:Jewish Publication Society of America, 1914:  \"He was not a loyal general, and he was not a faithful chronicler of the struggle with Rome; but he had the merit of writing a number of books on the Jews and Judaism.\" Preface.</ref>\n\n==Seleucid rule over Judea==\n\n===Hellenization===\nThe [[Hellenization]] of the Jews in the pre-Hasmonean period was not universally resisted. Generally, the Jews accepted foreign rule when they were only required to pay tribute, and otherwise allowed to govern themselves internally. Nevertheless, Jews were divided between those favouring Hellenization and those opposing it, and were divided over allegiance to the Ptolemies or Seleucids. In 175 BCE, conflict broke out between  High Priest [[Onias III]] (who opposed Hellenization and favoured the [[Ptolemies]]) and his son [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] (who favoured Hellenization and the Seleucids). A period of political intrigue followed, with both Jason and [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]] bribing the king to win the High Priesthood, and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title. The result was a brief civil war. The [[Tobiads]], a philo-Hellenistic party, succeeded in placing Jason into the powerful position of High Priest. He established an arena for public games close by the Temple.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. {{cite web|title=The Tobiads and Oniads.|accessdate=2007-01-23|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1589&letter=A}} ''Jewish Encyclopedia.</ref>  Author Lee I. Levine notes, \"The 'piece de resistance' of Judaean Hellenization, and the most dramatic of all these developments, occurred in 175 BCE, when the high priest Jason converted Jerusalem into a Greek [[polis]] replete with [[Gymnasium (Ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and ephebeion (2 Maccabees 4). Whether this step represents the culmination of a 150-year process of Hellenization within Jerusalem in general, or whether it was only the initiative of a small coterie of Jerusalem priests with no wider ramifications, has been debated for decades.\"<ref>Levine, Lee I.

According to Josephus,<blockquote>\"Now Antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpected taking the city, or with its pillage, or with the great slaughter he had made there; but being overcome with his violent passions, and remembering what he had suffered during the siege, he compelled the Jews to dissolve the laws of their country, and to keep their infants uncircumcised, and to sacrifice swine's flesh upon the altar.\"<ref name=Whiston>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?layout=&doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148&query=whiston%20chapter%3D%232&loc=1.1 William Whiston translation of ''The Wars of the Jews'']</ref></blockquote>\nHe also outlawed observance of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and the offering of sacrifices at the Jerusalem Temple and required Jewish leaders to sacrifice to idols; punitive executions were also instituted.

Mattathias' sons [[Judas Maccabeus|Judas]] (Yehuda), [[Jonathan Apphus|Jonathan]] (Yonoson/Yonatan), and [[Simon Thassi|Simon]] (Shimon) began a military campaign, initially with disastrous results: one thousand Jewish men, women, and children were killed by Seleucid troops because they refused to fight, even in self-defence, on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. Other Jews then reasoned that they must fight when attacked, even on the Sabbath. The institution of [[guerrilla warfare]] practices by Judah over several years led to victory against the Seleucids: <blockquote>It was now, in the fall of 165, that Judah's successes began to disturb the central government. He appears to have controlled the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and thus to have cut off the royal party in Acra from direct communication with the sea and thus with the government.

Bacchides now established the Hellenes as rulers in Israel; and upon Judah's death, the persecuted patriots, under Jonathan, brother of Judah, fled beyond the Jordan River.(ib. 9:25&ndash;27)  They set camp near a morass by the name of Asphar, and remained, after several engagements with the Seleucids, in the [[swamp]] in the country east of the Jordan.\n\nFollowing the death of his [[Puppet state|puppet governor]] [[Alcimus]], High Priest of Jerusalem, Bacchides felt secure enough to leave the country, but two years after the departure of Bacchides from Israel, the [[City of Acre]] felt sufficiently threatened by Maccabee incursions to contact Demetrius and request the return of Bacchides to their territory.

[[Demetrius I Soter]]'s relations with [[Attalus II Philadelphus]] of [[Pergamon]] (reigned 159&ndash;138 BCE),  [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt]] (reigned 163&ndash;145 BCE), and Ptolemy's co-ruler [[Cleopatra II of Egypt]] were deteriorating, and they supported a rival claimant to the Seleucid throne: [[Alexander Balas]], who purported to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and a first cousin of Demetrius.  Demetrius was forced to recall the garrisons of Judea, except those in the City of Acre and at Beth-zur, to bolster his strength.  Furthermore, he made a bid for the loyalty of Jonathan, permitting him to recruit an army and to reclaim the hostages kept in the City of Acre.  Jonathan gladly accepted these terms, took up residence at Jerusalem in 153 BCE, and began fortifying the city.\n\nAlexander Balas offered Jonathan even more favourable terms, including official appointment as High Priest in Jerusalem, and despite a second letter from Demetrius promising prerogatives that were almost impossible to guarantee,<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|10:1\u201346|NRSV}}; Josephus, \"Ant.\" xiii. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1&ndash;4</ref> Jonathan declared allegiance to Balas.  Jonathan became the official leader of his people, and officiated at the [[Sukkot|Feast of Tabernacles]] of 153 BCE wearing the High Priest's garments.  The Hellenistic party could no longer attack him without severe consequences.\n\nSoon, Demetrius lost both his throne and his life, in 150 BCE.  The victorious Alexander Balas was given the further honour of marriage to [[Cleopatra Thea]], daughter of his allies Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II.  Jonathan was invited to Ptolemais for the ceremony, appearing with presents for both kings, and was permitted to sit between them as their equal; Balas even clothed him with his own royal garment and otherwise accorded him high honor. Balas appointed Jonathan as [[strategos]] and \"meridarch\" (i.e., civil governor of a province; details not found in Josephus), sent him back with honours to Jerusalem,<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|10:51\u201366|NRSV}}; Josephus, \"Ant.\" xiii. 4, \u00a7 1</ref> and refused to listen to the Hellenistic party's complaints against Jonathan.\n\n====Hasmoneans under Balas and Demetrius II====\nIn 147 BCE, [[Demetrius II Nicator]], a son of Demetrius I Soter, claimed Balas' throne.  The governor of [[Coele-Syria]], Apollonius Taos, used the opportunity to challenge Jonathan to battle, saying that the Jews might for once leave the [[mountain]]s and venture out into the [[plain]].<ref>Gottheil, Richard.

Apollonius received reinforcements from [[Azotus]] and appeared in the plain in charge of 3,000 men including superior cavalry forces.  Jonathan assaulted, captured and burned Azotus along with the resident temple of [[Dagon]] and the surrounding villages.\n\nAlexander Balas honoured the victorious High Priest by giving him the city of [[Ekron]] along with its outlying territory. The people of Azotus complained to King Ptolemy VI, who had come to make war upon his son-in-law, but Jonathan met Ptolemy at Jaffa in peace and accompanied him as far as the River Eleutherus. Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem, maintaining peace with the King of Egypt despite their support for different contenders for the Seleucid throne.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|10:67\u201389|NRSV}}, 10:1&ndash;7; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 3&ndash;5</ref>\n\n====Hasmoneans under Demetrius and Diodotus====\nIn 145 BCE, the [[Battle of Antioch (145 BC)|Battle of Antioch]] resulted in the final defeat of Alexander Balas by the forces of his father-in-law Ptolemy VI. Ptolemy himself, however, was among the casualties of the battle. Demetrius II Nicator remained sole ruler of the Seleucid Empire and became the second husband of [[Cleopatra Thea]].\n\nJonathan owed no allegiance to the new King and took this opportunity to lay siege to the [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]], the Seleucid fortress in Jerusalem and the symbol of Seleucid control over Judea. It was heavily garrisoned by a Seleucid force and offered asylum to Jewish Hellenists.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|9:20|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, \u00a7 9</ref> Demetrius was greatly incensed; he appeared with an army at Ptolemais and ordered Jonathan to come before him. Without raising the siege, Jonathan, accompanied by the elders and priests, went to the king and pacified him with presents, so that the king not only confirmed him in his office of high priest, but gave to him the three [[Samaritan]] [[toparchies]] of [[Mount Ephraim]], [[Lod]], and [[Ramathaim-Zophim]]. In consideration of a present of 300 [[Talent (weight)|talent]]s the entire country was exempted from [[tax]]es, the exemption being confirmed in writing. Jonathan in return lifted the siege of the Acra and left it in Seleucid hands.\n\nSoon, however, a new claimant to the Seleucid throne appeared in the person of the young [[Antiochus VI Dionysus]], son of Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea. He was three years old at most, but general [[Diodotus Tryphon]] used him to advance his own designs on the throne. In the face of this new enemy, Demetrius not only promised to withdraw the garrison from the City of Acre, but also called Jonathan his ally and requested him to send troops. The 3,000 men of Jonathan protected Demetrius in his capital, [[Antioch]], against his own subjects.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|9:21\u201352|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, \u00a7 9; 5, \u00a7\u00a7 2&ndash;3; \"R. E.

Jonathan vanquished even the strategoi of Demetrius II far to the north, in the plain of Hazar, while Simon at the same time took the strong fortress of Beth-zur on the pretext that it harboured supporters of Demetrius.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|9:53\u201374|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 3&ndash;7</ref>\n\nLike Judah in former years, Jonathan sought alliances with foreign peoples. He renewed the treaty with the Roman Republic and exchanged friendly messages with [[Sparta]] and other places. However, the documents referring to those diplomatic events are of questionable authenticity.\n\nDiodotus Tryphon went with an army to Judea and invited Jonathan to [[Bet She'an|Scythopolis]] for a friendly conference, where he persuaded him to dismiss his army of 40,000 men, promising to give him Ptolemais and other fortresses. Jonathan fell into the trap; he took with him to Ptolemais 1,000 men, all of whom were slain; he himself was taken prisoner.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|12:33\u201348|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 5, \u00a7 10; 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1&ndash;3</ref>\n\n===Simon assumes leadership===\nWhen Diodotus Tryphon was about to enter Judea at Hadid, he was confronted by the new Jewish leader, Simon, ready for battle. Tryphon, avoiding an engagement, demanded one hundred talents and Jonathan's two sons as hostages, in return for which he promised to liberate Jonathan. Although Simon did not trust Diodotus Tryphon, he complied with the request so that he might not be accused of the death of his brother. But Diodotus Tryphon did not liberate his prisoner; angry that Simon blocked his way everywhere and that he could accomplish nothing, he executed Jonathan at Baskama, in the country east of the Jordan.<ref>143 BCE; {{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|13:12-30|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 6, \u00a7 5</ref> Jonathan was buried by Simeon at Modin.

She was the only ''[[regnant]]'' Jewish Queen.  During her reign, her son [[Hyrcanus II]] held the office of High Priest and was named her successor.\n\n===Pharisee and Sadducee factions===\n[[Image:1stMithritadicwar89BC.svg|thumb|Kingdom at its greatest extent under [[Salome Alexandra]]]]\nIt is difficult to state at what time the [[Pharisees]], as a party, arose. Josephus first mentions them in connection with Jonathan, the successor of Judas Maccabeus (\"Ant.\" xiii. 5, \u00a7 9). One of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) outside the Temple. The major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation. As Josephus noted, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.\n\nDuring the Hasmonean period, the [[Sadducees]] and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties. Although the Pharisees had opposed the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the Idumeans, the political rift between them became wider when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king [[Alexander Jannaeus]] choose between being king and being High Priest. In response, the king openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple. His actions caused a riot in the Temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees, although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties. Alexander was succeeded by his widow, [[Salome Alexandra]], whose brother was [[Shimon ben Shetach]], a leading Pharisee. Upon her death her elder son, Hyrcanus, sought Pharisee support, and her younger son, Aristobulus, sought the support of the Sadducees. The conflict between Hyrcanus and Aristobulus culminated in a civil war that ended when the Roman general Pompey captured Jerusalem in 63 BCE and inaugurated the Roman period of Jewish history.\n\nJosephus attests that Salome Alexandra was very favourably inclined toward the Pharisees and that their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the institution known as the [[Sanhedrin]]. Later texts such as the Mishnah and the Talmud record a host of rulings ascribed to the Pharisees concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance. The influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people remained strong, and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many. Although these texts were written long after these periods, many scholars believe that they are a fairly reliable account of history during the Second Temple era.\n\n===Civil war===\nAlexander Jannaeus' son, Hyrcanus II, had scarcely reigned three months when his younger brother, [[Aristobulus II]], rose in rebellion, whereupon Hyrcanus advanced against him at the head of an army of [[mercenaries]] and his Pharisee followers:  \"Now Hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom, and to him did his mother commit it before she died; but Aristobulus was superior to him in power and magnanimity; and when there was a battle between them, to decide the dispute about the kingdom, near Jericho, the greatest part deserted Hyrcanus, and went over to Aristobulus.\"<ref name=\"earlyjewishwritings.com\">{{cite web|url=http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html|title=Josephus, Wars Book I|first=George|last=Lyons|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of Jerusalem, but the capture of the Temple by Aristobulus II compelled Hyrcanus to surrender. A peace was then concluded, according to the terms of which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest (comp. [[Emil Sch\u00fcrer]], \"Gesch.\" i. 291, note 2), but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office: \"but Hyrcanus, with those of his party who stayed with him, fled to Antonia, and got into his power the hostages (which were Aristobulus's wife, with her children) that he might persevere; but the parties came to an agreement before things should come to extremes, that Aristobulus should be king, and Hyrcanus should resign, but retain all the rest of his dignities, as being the king's brother. Hereupon they were reconciled to each other in the Temple, and embraced one another in a very kind manner, while the people stood round about them; they also changed their houses, while Aristobulus went to the royal palace, and Hyrcanus retired to the house of Aristobulus.\"<ref name=\"earlyjewishwritings.com\"/> Aristobulus ruled from 67&ndash;63 BCE).\n\nFrom 63&ndash;40 BCE, the government was in the hands of Hyrcanus II as High Priest and [[Ethnarch]], although effective power was in the hands of his adviser [[Antipater the Idumaean]].\n\n===Intrigues of Antipater===\nThe struggle would have ended here but for Antipater the Idumean. Antipater saw clearly that it would be easier to reach the object of his ambition, the control of Judea, under the government of the weak Hyrcanus than under the warlike and energetic Aristobulus. He accordingly began to impress upon Hyrcanus' mind that Aristobulus was planning his death, finally persuading him to take refuge with [[Aretas III|Aretas]], king of the [[Nabat\u00e6ans]]. Aretas, bribed by Antipater, who also promised him the restitution of the Arabian towns taken by the Hasmoneans, readily espoused the cause of Hyrcanus and advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of fifty thousand. During the siege, which lasted several months, the adherents of Hyrcanus were guilty of two acts that greatly incensed the majority of the Jews: they stoned the pious Onias (see [[Honi ha-Magel]]) and, instead of a lamb which the besieged had bought of the besiegers for the purpose of the paschal sacrifice, sent a pig. Honi, ordered to curse the besieged, prayed: \"Lord of the universe, as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to Thy people, I beseech Thee not to answer the evil prayers of either.\" The pig incident is derived from rabbinical sources. According to Josephus, the besiegers kept the enormous price of one thousand [[drachma]]s they had asked for the lamb.\n\n==Roman intervention==\n\n===Pompey the Great===\n[[File:Pomp\u00e9e dans le Temple de J\u00e9rusalem.jpg|thumb|''Pompey in the Temple of Jerusalem'', by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]\n\nWhile this civil war was going on the Roman general [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] went to Syria to take possession, in the name of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]], of the kingdom of the [[Seleucids]]. The brothers appealed to him, each endeavouring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side. At first Scaurus, moved by a gift of four hundred talents, decided in favour of Aristobulus. Aretas was ordered to withdraw his army from Judea, and while retreating suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus. But when Pompey came to Syria (63 BCE), a different situation arose. Pompey, who had just been awarded the title \"Conqueror of Asia\" due to his decisive victories  in Asia Minor over [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and the Seleucid Empire, had decided to bring Judea under the rule of the Romans. He took the same view of Hyrcanus' ability, and was moved by much the same motives as Antipater: as a ward of Rome, Hyrcanus would be more acceptable than Aristobulus. When, therefore, the brothers, as well as delegates of the people's party, which, weary of Hasmonean quarrels, desired the extinction of the dynasty, presented themselves before Pompey, he delayed the decision, in spite of Aristobulus' gift of a golden vine valued at five hundred talents. The latter, however, fathomed the designs of Pompey, and assembled his armies. Pompey defeated him multiple times however and captured his cities. Aristobulus II entrenched himself in the fortress of [[Alexandrium]]; but, soon realizing the uselessness of resistance, surrendered at the first summons of the Romans, and undertook to deliver Jerusalem to them. The patriots, however, were not willing to open their gates to the Romans, and a [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|siege]] ensued which ended with the capture of the city.  Pompey entered the [[Holy of Holies]]; this was only the second time that someone had dared to penetrate into this sacred spot. [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] had to pay tribute to Rome and was placed under the supervision of the Roman governor of Syria: <blockquote>In 63 BC, Judaea became a protectorate of Rome. Coming under the administration of a governor, Judaea was allowed a king; the governor's business was to regulate trade and maximize tax revenue.<ref>Hooker, Richard. {{cite web |title=The Hebrews: The Diaspora|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8000/~dee/HEBREWS/HEBREWS.HTM|accessdate=2006-01-08}}  World Civilizations Learning Modules.  Washington State University, 1999.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 57&ndash;55 BCE, [[Aulus Gabinius]], proconsul of [[Roman Syria#Provincia Syria|Syria]], split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into Galilee, Samaria, and Judea, with five districts of legal and religious councils known as ''sanhedrin'' (Greek: \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \"synedrion\"):  \"And when he had ordained five councils (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts.

Between the weakness of Hyrcanus and the ambition of Aristobulus, Judea lost its independence.  Aristobulus was taken to Rome a prisoner, and Hyrcanus was reappointed High Priest, but without political authority.  When, in 50 BCE, it appeared that Julius Caesar was interested in using Aristobulus and his family as his clients to take control of Judea from Hyrcanus and Antipater, who were beholden to Pompey, supporters of Pompey had Aristobulus poisoned in Rome and executed Alexander in [[Antioch]].\n\nHowever, Pompey's pawns soon had occasion to turn to the other side: <blockquote>At the beginning of the civil war between [Caesar] and Pompey, Hyrcanus, at the instance of Antipater, prepared to support the man to whom he owed his position; but when Pompey was murdered, Antipater led the Jewish forces to the help of Caesar, who was hard pressed at Alexandria. His timely help and his influence over the Egyptian Jews recommended him to Caesar's favour, and secured for him an extension of his authority in Palestine, and for Hyrcanus the confirmation of his ethnarchy. Joppa was restored to the Hasmonean domain, Judea was granted freedom from all tribute and taxes to Rome, and the independence of the internal administration was guaranteed.\"<ref>Bentwich, ''Josephus'', Chapter I, \"The Jews and the Romans.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe timely aid from Antipater and Hyrcanus led the triumphant Caesar to ignore the claims of Aristobulus's younger son, [[Antigonus the Hasmonean]], and to confirm Hyrcanus and Antipater in their authority, despite their previous allegiance to Pompey. Josephus noted, <blockquote>Antigonus... came to Caesar... and accused Hyrcanus and Antipater, how they had driven him and his brethren entirely out of their native country... and that as to the assistance they had sent [to Caesar] into Egypt, it was not done out of good-will to him, but out of the fear they were in from former quarrels, and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to [his enemy] Pompey.<ref>http://www.interhack.net/projects/library/wars-jews/b1c10.htmlM{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\nHyrcanus' restoration as [[ethnarch]] in 47 BCE coincided with Caesar's appointment of Antipater as the first [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Procurator]], allowing Antipater to promote the interests of his own house: \"Caesar appointed Hyrcanus to be high priest, and gave Antipater what principality he himself should choose, leaving the determination to himself; so he made him procurator of Judea.\"<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', [[William Whiston]] translation, xiv 140; at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146&layout=&loc=14.140]</ref>\n\nAntipater appointed his sons to positions of influence: Phasael became Governor of Jerusalem, and Herod Governor of Galilee.  This led to increasing tension between Hyrcanus and the family of Antipater, culminating in a trial of Herod for supposed abuses in his governorship, which resulted in Herod's flight into exile in 46 BCE.  Herod soon returned, however, and the honours to Antipater's family continued.  Hyrcanus' incapacity and weakness were so manifest that, when he defended Herod against the Sanhedrin and before [[Mark Antony]], the latter stripped Hyrcanus of his nominal political authority and his title, bestowing them both upon the accused.\n\n[[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was assassinated]] in 44 BCE and unrest and confusion spread throughout the Roman world, including Judaea.  Antipater the Idumean was assassinated in 43 BCE by the Nabatean king, [[Malichus I]], who had bribed one of Hyrcanus\u2019 cup-bearers to poison and kill Antipater.\u00a0 However, Antipater's sons managed to maintain their control over Judea and their father's puppet Hasmonean, Hyrcanus.\n\n===Parthian invasion, Antony, Augustus===\n[[File:Prise de J\u00e9rusalem par H\u00e9rode le Grand.jpg|thumb|''The taking of Jerusalem by [[Herod the Great]], 36 BCE (sic)'']]\n[[File:Parthian_Empire_at_it's_greatest_extent.png|thumb|Parthian Empire at its greatest extent, {{circa|lk=no|60}} BCE]]\n\nAfter Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BCE, [[Quintus Labienus]], a Roman republican general and ambassador to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], sided with Brutus and Cassius in the [[Liberators' civil war]]; after their defeat Labienus joined the Parthians and assisted them in invading Roman territories in 40 BCE.  The Parthian army crossed the Euphrates and Labienus was able to entice Mark Antony's Roman garrisons around Syria to rally to his cause.  The Parthians split their army, and under [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus]] conquered the [[Levant]] from the Phoenician coast through the Land of Israel:  <blockquote>Antigonus... roused the Parthians to invade Syria and Palestine, [and] the Jews eagerly rose in support of the scion of the Maccabean house, and drove out the hated Idumeans with their puppet Jewish king. The struggle between the people and the Romans had begun in earnest, and though Antigonus, when placed on the throne by the Parthians, proceeded to spoil and harry the Jews, rejoicing at the restoration of the Hasmonean line, thought a new era of independence had come.<ref>Bentwich, Chapter I.</ref></blockquote>  When Phasael and [[Hyrcanus II]] set out on an embassy to the Parthians, the Parthians instead captured them.  Antigonus, who was present, cut off Hyrcanus's ears to make him unsuitable for the High Priesthood, while Phasael was put to death.\nAntigonus, whose Hebrew name was Mattathias, bore the double title of king and High Priest for only three years, as he had not disposed of Herod, the most dangerous of his enemies.  Herod fled into exile and sought the support of Mark Antony.  Herod was designated \"King of the Jews\" by the [[Roman Senate]] in 40 BCE:  Antony <blockquote>then resolved to get [Herod] made king of the Jews...[and] told [the Senate] that it was for their advantage in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] war that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate was separated, Antony and [[Augustus|Caesar]] [Augustus] went out, with Herod between them; while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in order to offer sacrifices [to the Roman gods], and to lay the decree in the Capitol. Antony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.<ref>[http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html Josephus, ''Wars of the Jews'', 14.4, via]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe struggle thereafter lasted for some years, as the main Roman forces were occupied with defeating the Parthians and had few additional resources to use to support Herod. After the Parthians' defeat, Herod was victorious over his rival in 37 BCE.  Antigonus was delivered to Antony and executed shortly thereafter. The Romans assented to Herod's proclamation as King of the Jews, bringing about the end of the Hasmonean rule over Judea.\n\n===Herod and the end of the dynasty===\nAntigonus was not, however, the last Hasmonean. The fate of the remaining male members of the family under Herod was not a happy one. [[Aristobulus III]], grandson of Aristobulus II through his elder son Alexander, was briefly made high priest, but was soon executed (36 BCE) due to Herod's jealousy. His sister Mariamne was married to Herod, but fell victim to his notorious jealousy. Her sons by Herod, [[Aristobulus IV]] and Alexander, were in their adulthood also executed by their father.\n\n[[Hyrcanus II]] had been held by the Parthians since 40 BCE. For four years, until 36 BCE, he lived amid the [[Babylonian Jews]], who paid him every mark of respect. In that year Herod, who feared that Hyrcanus might induce the Parthians to help him regain the throne, invited him to return to Jerusalem. The Babylonian Jews warned him in vain. Herod received him with every mark of respect, assigning him the first place at his table and the presidency of the state council, while awaiting an opportunity to get rid of him. As the last remaining Hasmonean, Hyrcanus was too dangerous a rival for Herod.  In the year 30 BCE, charged with plotting with the King of Arabia, Hyrcanus was condemned and executed.\n\nThe later Herodian rulers [[Agrippa I]] and [[Agrippa II]] both had Hasmonean blood, as Agrippa I's father was [[Aristobulus IV]], son of Herod by Mariamne I, but they were not direct male descendants, unless Herod was understood as a Hasmonean as per the following synthesis:\n\nAccording to Josephus, Herod was also of Maccabean descent:\n*[[Eleazar Maccabeus]] called Auran brother of [[Judas Maccabeus]] (Josephus Antiquity of the Jews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/JOSEPHUS.HTM|title=The Works of Flavius Josephus|publisher=}}</ref> Book XII/Chapter 9/Section 4)\n*Jason son of Eleazar (Ditto: Book XII/Chapter 10/Section 6)\n*Antipater I son of Jason (Ditto: Book XIII/Chapter 5/Section 8)\n*Antipater II Antipas son of Antipater I (Ditto: Book XIV/Chapter 1/Section 3)\n*Herod\n\n==Legacy and scholarship==\nWhile the Hasmonean dynasty managed to create an independent Jewish kingdom, its successes were rather short-lived, and the dynasty by and large failed to live up to the nationalistic momentum the Maccabee brothers had gained.\n\n===Jewish nationalism===\nThe fall of the Hasmonean Kingdom marked an end to a century of Jewish self-governance, but Jewish nationalism and desire for independence continued under Roman rule, beginning with the [[Census of Quirinius]] in 6 and leading to a series of [[Jewish-Roman wars]] in the 1st&ndash;2nd centuries, including the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Great Revolt]] (AD 66&ndash;73), the [[Kitos War]] (115&ndash;117), and [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] (132&ndash;135).\n\nDuring the wars, temporary commonwealths were established, but they ultimately fell to the sustained might of Rome. [[Roman legion]]s under [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]] [[Destruction of Jerusalem|besieged and destroyed Jerusalem]], looted and burned [[Herod's Temple]] (in the year 70) and Jewish strongholds (notably Gamla in 67 and [[Masada]] in 73), and [[Slavery|enslaved]] or [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacred]] a large part of the Jewish population. The defeat of the Jewish revolts against the Roman Empire notably contributed to the numbers and geography of the [[Jewish Diaspora]], as many Jews were scattered after losing their state or were sold into [[slavery]] throughout the empire.\n\n===Jewish religious scholarship===\nJewish tradition holds that the claiming of kingship by the later Hasmoneans led to their eventual downfall, since that title was only to be held by descendants of the line of [[David|King David]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Catherwood |first=Christopher |title=A Brief History of the Middle East |url=https://books.google.com/?id=krKeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&lpg=PT34&dq=The+Hasmoneans+were+not+descendants+of+King+David,+however,+and+so+lacked+religious+legitimacy+in+the+eyes+of+many+strict+Jews.#v=onepage&q=The%20Hasmoneans%20were%20not%20descendants%20of%20King%20David%2C%20however%2C%20and%20so%20lacked%20religious%20legitimacy%20in%20the%20eyes%20of%20many%20strict%20Jews.&f=false |publisher=Hachette Book Group |year=2011 |page= |isbn=9780762441020}}</ref> The Hasmonean bureaucracy was filled with men with Greek names, and the dynasty eventually became very [[Hellenization|Hellenized]], to the annoyance of many of its more traditionally-minded Jewish subjects.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eyal |first=Regev |title=The Hasmoneans: Ideology, Archaeology, Identity |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BeE9AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=the+Hasmoneans+themselves+became+hellenized#v=onepage&q=the%20Hasmoneans%20themselves%20became%20hellenized&f=false |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |year=2013 |page=18 |isbn=9783647550435}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Elon Gilad |date=23 December 2014 |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/1.633308|title=Meet the Hasmoneans: A Brief History of a Violent Epoch|work=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref> Frequent dynastic quarrels also contributed to the view among Jews of later generations that the latter Hasmoneans were degenerate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Harkabi |first=Yehoshafat |title=The Bar Kokhba Syndrome: Risk and Realism in International Politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rb00WGipKCIC&pg=RA1-PA72&dq=THough+they+enlarged+the+borders+and+established+the+country+as+a+Jewish+entity,+their+dominion+degenerated,+and+they+themselves+deteriorated#v=onepage&q=THough%20they%20enlarged%20the%20borders%20and%20established%20the%20country%20as%20a%20Jewish%20entity%2C%20their%20dominion%20degenerated%2C%20and%20they%20themselves%20deteriorated&f=false |publisher=Rossel Books |year=1983 |page=72 |isbn=978-0940646018}}</ref> One member of this school was Josephus, whose accounts are in many cases our sole source of information about the Hasmoneans.\n\n==Historiography==\n\nThe books of Maccabees use the names \"Judea\" and \"Israel\" (or cognates) as geographical descriptors throughout for both the land and people over whom the Hasmoneans would rule. The [[Talmud]] includes one of the Hasmonean kings under the description \"Kings of Israel\". Scholars refer to the state as the Hasmonean Kingdom to distinguish it from the previous kingdoms of Israel. The name \"Judaea\" has also been used to describe the Hasmonean Kingdom although this name reflects the later designation of the region under the Romans at the time of Josephus' writings in the late 1st century.\n\n==Numismatics==\nHasmonean coins usually featured the [[Paleo-Hebrew]] script, an older [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] script that was used to write [[Hebrew]]. The coins are struck only in [[bronze]]. The symbols include a [[cornucopia]], palm-branch, [[lily]], an anchor, star, [[pomegranate]] and (rarely) a helmet. Despite the apparent [[Seleucid]] influences of most of the symbols, the origin of the star is more obscure.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Louis |title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=32-28}}</ref>\n\n==Hasmonean leaders==\n[[File:Maccabean dynasty.PNG|center|800px|The descendants of Mattathias]]\n{|  class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|-\n| <strong>Family tree (Hasmonean-Herodian)</strong>\n|-\n| {{chart/start}}\n{{chart|Ph|Ph=[[Phinehas]]}}\n{{chart|D|~|~|~|~|~|7}}\n{{chart|Ha||||:|Ha=Hashmonai (Hasmonaeus)}}\n{{chart|!||||||:}}\n{{chart|Sh||||:|Sh=Shimon ben Hashmonai}}\n{{chart|!||||||:}}\n{{chart|Yo||||:|Yo=Yochanan ben Shimon}}\n{{chart|!||||||:}}\n{{chart|Mat|~|y|~|Sim|Mat=[[Mattathias|Mattathias ben Yochanan]]|Sim=Simona bat [[Onias III]]}}\n{{chart|,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart| Jon | | Simo | | Jud | | El | | Jona |Jon=[[John Gaddi]]|Simo=[[Simon Thassi]]<br>'''[[Hasmonean|Prince of Judaea]]''' r. 141 - 135 BCE|Jud=[[Judas Maccabeus]]|El=[[Eleazar Avaran]]|Jona=[[Jonathan Apphus]]\n|boxstyle_ Simo =background-color: yellow;}}\n{{chart||||||!}}\n{{chart||||||Hyr|Hyr=[[John Hyrcanus|John Hyrcanus I]]<br>'''[[Hasmonean|Prince of Judaea]]''' r. 134 - 104 BCE\n|boxstyle_Hyr=background-color: yellow;}}\n{{chart||,|-|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart|Aris|||Alex|~|y|~|Sal|||Ab|Aris=[[Aristobulus I]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 104 - 103 BCE|Alex=[[Alexander Jannaeus]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 103 - 76 BCE|Sal=[[Salome Alexandra]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|Queen of Judaea]]''' r. 76 - 67 BCE|Ab=Absalom ben Yochanan\n|boxstyle_Aris=background-color: yellow;\n|boxstyle_Alex=background-color: yellow;\n|boxstyle_Sal=background-color: yellow;}}\n{{chart||||,|-|-|-|-|-|^|.||||||!}}\n{{chart||||Hyr2|||Aris2|~|y|~|Sal2|Hyr2=[[Hyrcanus II|John Hyrcanus II]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 67 - 66 BCE|Aris2=[[Aristobulus II]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 66 - 63 BCE|Sal2=Salome bat Absalom\n|boxstyle_Hyr2=background-color: yellow;\n|boxstyle_Aris2=background-color: yellow;}}\n{{chart|||||!||||||||)|-|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart|||Alexa|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|Alex2||Anti|Alexa=[[Alexandra the Maccabee|Alexandra II bat Hyrcanus II]]|Alex2=[[Alexander of Judaea|Alexander II]]|Anti=[[Antigonus II Mattathias]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 40 - 37 BCE\n|boxstyle_Anti=background-color: yellow;}}\n| {{chart/end}}\n|}\n===Maccabees (rebel leaders)===\n#[[Mattathias]], 170&ndash;167 BCE\n#[[Judas Maccabeus]], 167&ndash;160 BCE\n#[[Jonathan Apphus]], 160&ndash;143 BCE (High Priest after 152 BCE)\n\n=== Monarchs (Ethnarchs and Kings) and High Priests===\n#[[Simon Thassi]], 142&ndash;135 BCE (Ethnarch and High Priest)\n#[[John Hyrcanus|John Hyrcanus I]], 134&ndash;104 BCE  (Ethnarch and High Priest)\n#[[Aristobulus I]], 104&ndash;103 BCE (King and High Priest)\n#[[Alexander Jannaeus]], 103&ndash;76 BCE (King and High Priest)\n#[[Salome Alexandra]], 76&ndash;67 BCE (only Queen)\n#[[Hyrcanus II]], 67&ndash;66 BCE (King from 67 BCE; High Priest from 76 BCE)\n#[[Aristobulus II]], 66&ndash;63 BCE (King and High Priest)\n#[[Hyrcanus II]] (restored), 63&ndash;40 BCE (High Priest from 63 BCE; Ethnarch from 47 BCE)\n#[[Antigonus the Hasmonean|Antigonus]], 40&ndash;37 BCE (King and High Priest)\n#[[Aristobulus III of Israel|Aristobulus III]], 36 BCE (only High Priest)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hasmonean coinage]]\n* [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n* [[Hasmonean royal winter palaces]]\n* [[List of Jewish states and dynasties]]\n* [[Siege of Jerusalem (37 BC)]]\n* [[Temple in Jerusalem]]\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Judea Judas Makk.PNG|Judea under [[Judas Maccabeus]]\nFile:Judea Jonathan Makk.PNG|Judea under [[Jonathan Apphus]]\nFile:Judea Simon Makk.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[Simon Thassi]]\nFile:Judea Johannes Hyrcanus.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[John Hyrcanus]]\nFile:Judea Aristobulus I.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[Aristobulus I|Aristobulus]]\nFile:Judea Alexander Janne\u00fcs.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[Alexander Jannaeus]]\nFile:Hasmoneese rijk.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[Salome Alexandra]]\nFile:Judea na Pompeius.PNG|Roman Judea under [[Hyrcanus II]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{notelist}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|title=''Josephus''|url=https://archive.org/details/josephus00bentgoog|publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America|year=1914|location=Philadelphia|last=Bentwich|first=Norman}}\n*[[Josephus]].

However, the same power vacuum that enabled the Jewish state to be recognized by the [[Roman Senate]] {{circa|lk=no|139}} BCE was later exploited by the Romans themselves. [[Hyrcanus II]] and [[Aristobulus II]], Simon's great-grandsons, became pawns in a [[proxy war]] between [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey the Great]]. The deaths of Pompey (48 BCE) and Caesar (44 BCE), and the related [[Liberators' civil war|Roman civil wars]] temporarily relaxed Rome's grip on the Hasmonean kingdom, allowing a brief reassertion of autonomy backed by the Parthian Empire. This short independence was rapidly crushed by the Romans under [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavian]].\n\nThe dynasty had survived for 103 years before yielding to the [[Herodian dynasty]] in 37 BCE. The installation of [[Herod the Great]] (an [[Idumean]]) as king in 37 BCE made Judea a Roman client state and marked the end of the Hasmonean dynasty. Even then, Herod tried to bolster the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a Hasmonean princess, [[Mariamne (second wife of Herod)|Mariamne]], and planning to drown the last male Hasmonean heir at his [[Jericho]] palace. In 6 CE, Rome joined Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea (biblical [[Edom]]) into the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judaea]]. In 44 CE, Rome installed the rule of a [[procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]] side by side with the rule of the Herodian kings (specifically [[Agrippa I]] 41\u201344 and [[Agrippa II]] 50\u2013100).\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe family name of the Hasmonean dynasty originates with the ancestor of the house, called by the Hellenized form Asmoneus or Asamoneus ({{lang-gr|\u1f08\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2}}) by [[Josephus Flavius]],<ref>''Jewish Antiquities'' 12:263 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+12.265]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+14.468]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+16.179],</ref> who is said to have been the great-grandfather of [[Mattathias]], but about whom nothing more is known.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Asmoneus|volume=2|page=763|first=John Henry Arthur|last=Hart}}</ref> The name appears to come from the Hebrew name ''Hashmonay'' (\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b7\u05d0\u05d9).<ref name=\"Atkinson2016\">{{cite book|author=Kenneth Atkinson|title=A History of the Hasmonean State: Josephus and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrfMDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA23|date=22 September 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-66903-2|pages=23\u2013}}</ref> An alternative view posits that the Hebrew name ''Hashmona'i'' is linked with the village of [[Heshbon]], mentioned in {{bibleverse||Joshua|15:27|HE}}.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Gott and Licht attribute the name to \"Ha Simeon,\" a veiled reference to the Simeonite Tribe.<ref>P.J.

The entire region was heavily contested between the successor states of Alexander's empire, the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], during the six [[Syrian Wars]] of the 3rd\u20131st centuries BCE: \"After two centuries of peace under the Persians, the Hebrew state found itself once more caught in the middle of power struggles between two great empires: the Seleucid state with its [[Antioch|capital in Syria]] to the north and the Ptolemaic state, with its [[Alexandria|capital in Egypt]] to the south...Between 319 and 302 BC, Jerusalem changed hands seven times.\"<ref name=\n\"Hooker\">Hooker, Richard. {{cite web |title=Yavan in the House of Shem.

Seleucid rule over the Jewish parts of the region then resulted in the rise of Hellenistic cultural and religious practices:  \"In addition to the turmoil of war, there arose in the Jewish nation pro-Seleucid and pro-Ptolemaic parties; and the schism exercised great influence upon the Judaism of the time.

The books are considered part of the [[Biblical canon]] by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches and [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] by most Protestants, but are not a part of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. They are written from the point of view that the salvation of the Jewish people in a crisis came from God through the family of Mattathias, particularly his sons Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan Apphus, and Simon Thassi, and his grandson [[John Hyrcanus]]. The books include historical and religious material from the [[Septuagint]] that was codified by [[Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians.\n\nThe other primary source for the Hasmonean dynasty is the first book of ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'' by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], (37\u2013{{circa}} 100 CE).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Josephus' account is the only primary source covering the history of the Hasmonean dynasty during the period of its expansion and independence between 110 to 63 BCE. Notably, Josephus, a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]] and former general in the Galilee, who survived the [[Jewish\u2013Roman wars|Roman\u2013Jewish wars]] of the 1st century, was a Jew who was captured by and cooperated with the Romans, writing his books in Rome, which has caused some to question his impartiality and credibility as a historian.<ref>Bentwich, Norman.  {{cite web|title=''Josephus''|url=http://www.preteristarchive.com/Books/1914_bentwich_josephus.html|accessdate=2007-01-18}}  Philadelphia:Jewish Publication Society of America, 1914:  \"He was not a loyal general, and he was not a faithful chronicler of the struggle with Rome; but he had the merit of writing a number of books on the Jews and Judaism.\" Preface.</ref>\n\n==Seleucid rule over Judea==\n\n===Hellenization===\nThe [[Hellenization]] of the Jews in the pre-Hasmonean period was not universally resisted. Generally, the Jews accepted foreign rule when they were only required to pay tribute, and otherwise allowed to govern themselves internally. Nevertheless, Jews were divided between those favouring Hellenization and those opposing it, and were divided over allegiance to the Ptolemies or Seleucids. In 175 BCE, conflict broke out between  High Priest [[Onias III]] (who opposed Hellenization and favoured the [[Ptolemies]]) and his son [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] (who favoured Hellenization and the Seleucids). A period of political intrigue followed, with both Jason and [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]] bribing the king to win the High Priesthood, and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title. The result was a brief civil war. The [[Tobiads]], a philo-Hellenistic party, succeeded in placing Jason into the powerful position of High Priest. He established an arena for public games close by the Temple.<ref>Ginzberg, Lewis. {{cite web|title=The Tobiads and Oniads.|accessdate=2007-01-23|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1589&letter=A}} ''Jewish Encyclopedia.</ref>  Author Lee I.

[[Demetrius I Soter]]'s relations with [[Attalus II Philadelphus]] of [[Pergamon]] (reigned 159&ndash;138 BCE),  [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt]] (reigned 163&ndash;145 BCE), and Ptolemy's co-ruler [[Cleopatra II of Egypt]] were deteriorating, and they supported a rival claimant to the Seleucid throne: [[Alexander Balas]], who purported to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and a first cousin of Demetrius.  Demetrius was forced to recall the garrisons of Judea, except those in the City of Acre and at Beth-zur, to bolster his strength.  Furthermore, he made a bid for the loyalty of Jonathan, permitting him to recruit an army and to reclaim the hostages kept in the City of Acre.  Jonathan gladly accepted these terms, took up residence at Jerusalem in 153 BCE, and began fortifying the city.\n\nAlexander Balas offered Jonathan even more favourable terms, including official appointment as High Priest in Jerusalem, and despite a second letter from Demetrius promising prerogatives that were almost impossible to guarantee,<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|10:1\u201346|NRSV}}; Josephus, \"Ant.\" xiii. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1&ndash;4</ref> Jonathan declared allegiance to Balas.  Jonathan became the official leader of his people, and officiated at the [[Sukkot|Feast of Tabernacles]] of 153 BCE wearing the High Priest's garments.  The Hellenistic party could no longer attack him without severe consequences.\n\nSoon, Demetrius lost both his throne and his life, in 150 BCE.  The victorious Alexander Balas was given the further honour of marriage to [[Cleopatra Thea]], daughter of his allies Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II.  Jonathan was invited to Ptolemais for the ceremony, appearing with presents for both kings, and was permitted to sit between them as their equal; Balas even clothed him with his own royal garment and otherwise accorded him high honor. Balas appointed Jonathan as [[strategos]] and \"meridarch\" (i.e., civil governor of a province; details not found in Josephus), sent him back with honours to Jerusalem,<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|10:51\u201366|NRSV}}; Josephus, \"Ant.\" xiii. 4, \u00a7 1</ref> and refused to listen to the Hellenistic party's complaints against Jonathan.\n\n====Hasmoneans under Balas and Demetrius II====\nIn 147 BCE, [[Demetrius II Nicator]], a son of Demetrius I Soter, claimed Balas' throne.  The governor of [[Coele-Syria]], Apollonius Taos, used the opportunity to challenge Jonathan to battle, saying that the Jews might for once leave the [[mountain]]s and venture out into the [[plain]].<ref>Gottheil, Richard. Krauss, Samuel. {{cite web|title=Jonathan Apphus|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8773-jonathan-maccabeus|accessdate=2017-03-03}} ''Jewish Encyclopedia''.</ref> Jonathan and Simeon led a force of 10,000 men against Apollonius' forces in [[Jaffa]], which was unprepared for the rapid attack and opened the gates in surrender to the Jewish forces.  Apollonius received reinforcements from [[Azotus]] and appeared in the plain in charge of 3,000 men including superior cavalry forces.  Jonathan assaulted, captured and burned Azotus along with the resident temple of [[Dagon]] and the surrounding villages.\n\nAlexander Balas honoured the victorious High Priest by giving him the city of [[Ekron]] along with its outlying territory. The people of Azotus complained to King Ptolemy VI, who had come to make war upon his son-in-law, but Jonathan met Ptolemy at Jaffa in peace and accompanied him as far as the River Eleutherus. Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem, maintaining peace with the King of Egypt despite their support for different contenders for the Seleucid throne.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|10:67\u201389|NRSV}}, 10:1&ndash;7; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 3&ndash;5</ref>\n\n====Hasmoneans under Demetrius and Diodotus====\nIn 145 BCE, the [[Battle of Antioch (145 BC)|Battle of Antioch]] resulted in the final defeat of Alexander Balas by the forces of his father-in-law Ptolemy VI. Ptolemy himself, however, was among the casualties of the battle. Demetrius II Nicator remained sole ruler of the Seleucid Empire and became the second husband of [[Cleopatra Thea]].\n\nJonathan owed no allegiance to the new King and took this opportunity to lay siege to the [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]], the Seleucid fortress in Jerusalem and the symbol of Seleucid control over Judea. It was heavily garrisoned by a Seleucid force and offered asylum to Jewish Hellenists.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|9:20|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, \u00a7 9</ref> Demetrius was greatly incensed; he appeared with an army at Ptolemais and ordered Jonathan to come before him. Without raising the siege, Jonathan, accompanied by the elders and priests, went to the king and pacified him with presents, so that the king not only confirmed him in his office of high priest, but gave to him the three [[Samaritan]] [[toparchies]] of [[Mount Ephraim]], [[Lod]], and [[Ramathaim-Zophim]]. In consideration of a present of 300 [[Talent (weight)|talent]]s the entire country was exempted from [[tax]]es, the exemption being confirmed in writing. Jonathan in return lifted the siege of the Acra and left it in Seleucid hands.\n\nSoon, however, a new claimant to the Seleucid throne appeared in the person of the young [[Antiochus VI Dionysus]], son of Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea. He was three years old at most, but general [[Diodotus Tryphon]] used him to advance his own designs on the throne. In the face of this new enemy, Demetrius not only promised to withdraw the garrison from the City of Acre, but also called Jonathan his ally and requested him to send troops. The 3,000 men of Jonathan protected Demetrius in his capital, [[Antioch]], against his own subjects.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|9:21\u201352|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 4, \u00a7 9; 5, \u00a7\u00a7 2&ndash;3; \"R. E. J.\" xlv. 34</ref>\n\nAs Demetrius II did not keep his promise, Jonathan thought it better to support the new king when Diodotus Tryphon and Antiochus VI seized the capital, especially as the latter confirmed all his rights and appointed his brother Simon (Simeon) [[strategos]] of the [[Paralia (Palestine)|Paralia]] (the sea coast), from the \"Ladder of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]\" to the frontier of [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]].<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|11:52\u201359|NRSV}}</ref>\n\nJonathan and Simon were now entitled to make conquests; [[Ashkelon]] submitted voluntarily while Gaza was forcibly taken. Jonathan vanquished even the strategoi of Demetrius II far to the north, in the plain of Hazar, while Simon at the same time took the strong fortress of Beth-zur on the pretext that it harboured supporters of Demetrius.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|9:53\u201374|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 3&ndash;7</ref>\n\nLike Judah in former years, Jonathan sought alliances with foreign peoples. He renewed the treaty with the Roman Republic and exchanged friendly messages with [[Sparta]] and other places. However, the documents referring to those diplomatic events are of questionable authenticity.\n\nDiodotus Tryphon went with an army to Judea and invited Jonathan to [[Bet She'an|Scythopolis]] for a friendly conference, where he persuaded him to dismiss his army of 40,000 men, promising to give him Ptolemais and other fortresses. Jonathan fell into the trap; he took with him to Ptolemais 1,000 men, all of whom were slain; he himself was taken prisoner.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|12:33\u201348|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 5, \u00a7 10; 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1&ndash;3</ref>\n\n===Simon assumes leadership===\nWhen Diodotus Tryphon was about to enter Judea at Hadid, he was confronted by the new Jewish leader, Simon, ready for battle. Tryphon, avoiding an engagement, demanded one hundred talents and Jonathan's two sons as hostages, in return for which he promised to liberate Jonathan. Although Simon did not trust Diodotus Tryphon, he complied with the request so that he might not be accused of the death of his brother. But Diodotus Tryphon did not liberate his prisoner; angry that Simon blocked his way everywhere and that he could accomplish nothing, he executed Jonathan at Baskama, in the country east of the Jordan.<ref>143 BCE; {{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|13:12-30|NRSV}}; Josephus, ''l.c.'' xiii. 6, \u00a7 5</ref> Jonathan was buried by Simeon at Modin.

The leadership of the Hasmoneans was established by a resolution, adopted in 141 BCE, at a large assembly \"of the priests and the people and of the elders of the land, to the effect that Simon should be their leader and High Priest forever, until there should arise a [[messiah|faithful prophet]]\" (1 Macc. 14:41). Ironically, the election was performed in Hellenistic fashion.\n\nSimon, having made the Jewish people semi-independent of the Seleucid Greeks, reigned from 142 to 135 BCE and formed the Hasmonean dynasty, finally capturing the citadel [Acra] in 141 BCE.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|14:36|NRSV}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mazar |first=Benjamin |title=The Mountain of the Lord |url= |publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc |year=1975 |pages=70\u201371, 216 |isbn=978-0-385-04843-9}}</ref> The Roman Senate accorded the new dynasty recognition {{circa|lk=no|139}} BCE, when the delegation of Simon was in Rome.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|8:17-20|NRSV}}</ref>\n\nSimon led the people in peace and prosperity, until in February 135 BCE, he was [[assassination|assassinated]] at the instigation of his son-in-law [[Ptolemy (son of Abubus)|Ptolemy]], son of [[Abubus]] (also spelled Abobus or Abobi), who had been named governor of the region by the Seleucids.

She was the only ''[[regnant]]'' Jewish Queen.  During her reign, her son [[Hyrcanus II]] held the office of High Priest and was named her successor.\n\n===Pharisee and Sadducee factions===\n[[Image:1stMithritadicwar89BC.svg|thumb|Kingdom at its greatest extent under [[Salome Alexandra]]]]\nIt is difficult to state at what time the [[Pharisees]], as a party, arose. Josephus first mentions them in connection with Jonathan, the successor of Judas Maccabeus (\"Ant.\" xiii. 5, \u00a7 9). One of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) outside the Temple. The major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation. As Josephus noted, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.\n\nDuring the Hasmonean period, the [[Sadducees]] and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties. Although the Pharisees had opposed the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the Idumeans, the political rift between them became wider when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king [[Alexander Jannaeus]] choose between being king and being High Priest. In response, the king openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple. His actions caused a riot in the Temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees, although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties. Alexander was succeeded by his widow, [[Salome Alexandra]], whose brother was [[Shimon ben Shetach]], a leading Pharisee. Upon her death her elder son, Hyrcanus, sought Pharisee support, and her younger son, Aristobulus, sought the support of the Sadducees. The conflict between Hyrcanus and Aristobulus culminated in a civil war that ended when the Roman general Pompey captured Jerusalem in 63 BCE and inaugurated the Roman period of Jewish history.\n\nJosephus attests that Salome Alexandra was very favourably inclined toward the Pharisees and that their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the institution known as the [[Sanhedrin]]. Later texts such as the Mishnah and the Talmud record a host of rulings ascribed to the Pharisees concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance. The influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people remained strong, and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many. Although these texts were written long after these periods, many scholars believe that they are a fairly reliable account of history during the Second Temple era.\n\n===Civil war===\nAlexander Jannaeus' son, Hyrcanus II, had scarcely reigned three months when his younger brother, [[Aristobulus II]], rose in rebellion, whereupon Hyrcanus advanced against him at the head of an army of [[mercenaries]] and his Pharisee followers:  \"Now Hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom, and to him did his mother commit it before she died; but Aristobulus was superior to him in power and magnanimity; and when there was a battle between them, to decide the dispute about the kingdom, near Jericho, the greatest part deserted Hyrcanus, and went over to Aristobulus.\"<ref name=\"earlyjewishwritings.com\">{{cite web|url=http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html|title=Josephus, Wars Book I|first=George|last=Lyons|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of Jerusalem, but the capture of the Temple by Aristobulus II compelled Hyrcanus to surrender. A peace was then concluded, according to the terms of which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest (comp. [[Emil Sch\u00fcrer]], \"Gesch.\" i. 291, note 2), but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office: \"but Hyrcanus, with those of his party who stayed with him, fled to Antonia, and got into his power the hostages (which were Aristobulus's wife, with her children) that he might persevere; but the parties came to an agreement before things should come to extremes, that Aristobulus should be king, and Hyrcanus should resign, but retain all the rest of his dignities, as being the king's brother. Hereupon they were reconciled to each other in the Temple, and embraced one another in a very kind manner, while the people stood round about them; they also changed their houses, while Aristobulus went to the royal palace, and Hyrcanus retired to the house of Aristobulus.\"<ref name=\"earlyjewishwritings.com\"/> Aristobulus ruled from 67&ndash;63 BCE).\n\nFrom 63&ndash;40 BCE, the government was in the hands of Hyrcanus II as High Priest and [[Ethnarch]], although effective power was in the hands of his adviser [[Antipater the Idumaean]].\n\n===Intrigues of Antipater===\nThe struggle would have ended here but for Antipater the Idumean. Antipater saw clearly that it would be easier to reach the object of his ambition, the control of Judea, under the government of the weak Hyrcanus than under the warlike and energetic Aristobulus. He accordingly began to impress upon Hyrcanus' mind that Aristobulus was planning his death, finally persuading him to take refuge with [[Aretas III|Aretas]], king of the [[Nabat\u00e6ans]]. Aretas, bribed by Antipater, who also promised him the restitution of the Arabian towns taken by the Hasmoneans, readily espoused the cause of Hyrcanus and advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of fifty thousand. During the siege, which lasted several months, the adherents of Hyrcanus were guilty of two acts that greatly incensed the majority of the Jews: they stoned the pious Onias (see [[Honi ha-Magel]]) and, instead of a lamb which the besieged had bought of the besiegers for the purpose of the paschal sacrifice, sent a pig. Honi, ordered to curse the besieged, prayed: \"Lord of the universe, as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to Thy people, I beseech Thee not to answer the evil prayers of either.\" The pig incident is derived from rabbinical sources. According to Josephus, the besiegers kept the enormous price of one thousand [[drachma]]s they had asked for the lamb.\n\n==Roman intervention==\n\n===Pompey the Great===\n[[File:Pomp\u00e9e dans le Temple de J\u00e9rusalem.jpg|thumb|''Pompey in the Temple of Jerusalem'', by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]\n\nWhile this civil war was going on the Roman general [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] went to Syria to take possession, in the name of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]], of the kingdom of the [[Seleucids]]. The brothers appealed to him, each endeavouring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side. At first Scaurus, moved by a gift of four hundred talents, decided in favour of Aristobulus. Aretas was ordered to withdraw his army from Judea, and while retreating suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus. But when Pompey came to Syria (63 BCE), a different situation arose. Pompey, who had just been awarded the title \"Conqueror of Asia\" due to his decisive victories  in Asia Minor over [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and the Seleucid Empire, had decided to bring Judea under the rule of the Romans. He took the same view of Hyrcanus' ability, and was moved by much the same motives as Antipater: as a ward of Rome, Hyrcanus would be more acceptable than Aristobulus. When, therefore, the brothers, as well as delegates of the people's party, which, weary of Hasmonean quarrels, desired the extinction of the dynasty, presented themselves before Pompey, he delayed the decision, in spite of Aristobulus' gift of a golden vine valued at five hundred talents. The latter, however, fathomed the designs of Pompey, and assembled his armies. Pompey defeated him multiple times however and captured his cities. Aristobulus II entrenched himself in the fortress of [[Alexandrium]]; but, soon realizing the uselessness of resistance, surrendered at the first summons of the Romans, and undertook to deliver Jerusalem to them. The patriots, however, were not willing to open their gates to the Romans, and a [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|siege]] ensued which ended with the capture of the city.  Pompey entered the [[Holy of Holies]]; this was only the second time that someone had dared to penetrate into this sacred spot. [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] had to pay tribute to Rome and was placed under the supervision of the Roman governor of Syria: <blockquote>In 63 BC, Judaea became a protectorate of Rome. Coming under the administration of a governor, Judaea was allowed a king; the governor's business was to regulate trade and maximize tax revenue.<ref>Hooker, Richard. {{cite web |title=The Hebrews: The Diaspora|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8000/~dee/HEBREWS/HEBREWS.HTM|accessdate=2006-01-08}}  World Civilizations Learning Modules.  Washington State University, 1999.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 57&ndash;55 BCE, [[Aulus Gabinius]], proconsul of [[Roman Syria#Provincia Syria|Syria]], split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into Galilee, Samaria, and Judea, with five districts of legal and religious councils known as ''sanhedrin'' (Greek: \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \"synedrion\"):  \"And when he had ordained five councils (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts. So these councils governed the people; the first was at Jerusalem, the second at [[Umm Qais|Gadara]], the third at Amathus, the fourth at [[Jericho]], and the fifth at [[Sepphoris]] in Galilee.\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146;query=whiston%20chapter%3D%23182;layout=;loc=14.54 Josephus, ''Ant.'' xiv 54, via]</ref><ref>\"Josephus uses \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd for the first time in connection with the decree of the Roman governor of Syria, Gabinius (57 BCE), who abolished the constitution and the then existing form of government of Palestine and divided the country into five provinces, at the head of each of which a sanhedrin was placed (\"Ant.\" xiv 5, \u00a7 4).\" via [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=229&letter=S&search=Gabinius Jewish Encyclopedia: Sanhedrin]</ref>\n\n===Pompey and Caesar===\n[[Image:Mattathias Antigonos.jpg|thumb|Coin of Antigonus, BCE 40\u201337]]\n[[Julius Caesar]] initially supported Aristobulus against Hyrcanus and Antipater. Between the weakness of Hyrcanus and the ambition of Aristobulus, Judea lost its independence.  Aristobulus was taken to Rome a prisoner, and Hyrcanus was reappointed High Priest, but without political authority.  When, in 50 BCE, it appeared that Julius Caesar was interested in using Aristobulus and his family as his clients to take control of Judea from Hyrcanus and Antipater, who were beholden to Pompey, supporters of Pompey had Aristobulus poisoned in Rome and executed Alexander in [[Antioch]].\n\nHowever, Pompey's pawns soon had occasion to turn to the other side: <blockquote>At the beginning of the civil war between [Caesar] and Pompey, Hyrcanus, at the instance of Antipater, prepared to support the man to whom he owed his position; but when Pompey was murdered, Antipater led the Jewish forces to the help of Caesar, who was hard pressed at Alexandria. His timely help and his influence over the Egyptian Jews recommended him to Caesar's favour, and secured for him an extension of his authority in Palestine, and for Hyrcanus the confirmation of his ethnarchy. Joppa was restored to the Hasmonean domain, Judea was granted freedom from all tribute and taxes to Rome, and the independence of the internal administration was guaranteed.\"<ref>Bentwich, ''Josephus'', Chapter I, \"The Jews and the Romans.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe timely aid from Antipater and Hyrcanus led the triumphant Caesar to ignore the claims of Aristobulus's younger son, [[Antigonus the Hasmonean]], and to confirm Hyrcanus and Antipater in their authority, despite their previous allegiance to Pompey. Josephus noted, <blockquote>Antigonus... came to Caesar... and accused Hyrcanus and Antipater, how they had driven him and his brethren entirely out of their native country... and that as to the assistance they had sent [to Caesar] into Egypt, it was not done out of good-will to him, but out of the fear they were in from former quarrels, and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to [his enemy] Pompey.<ref>http://www.interhack.net/projects/library/wars-jews/b1c10.htmlM{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\nHyrcanus' restoration as [[ethnarch]] in 47 BCE coincided with Caesar's appointment of Antipater as the first [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Procurator]], allowing Antipater to promote the interests of his own house: \"Caesar appointed Hyrcanus to be high priest, and gave Antipater what principality he himself should choose, leaving the determination to himself; so he made him procurator of Judea.\"<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', [[William Whiston]] translation, xiv 140; at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146&layout=&loc=14.140]</ref>\n\nAntipater appointed his sons to positions of influence: Phasael became Governor of Jerusalem, and Herod Governor of Galilee.  This led to increasing tension between Hyrcanus and the family of Antipater, culminating in a trial of Herod for supposed abuses in his governorship, which resulted in Herod's flight into exile in 46 BCE.  Herod soon returned, however, and the honours to Antipater's family continued.  Hyrcanus' incapacity and weakness were so manifest that, when he defended Herod against the Sanhedrin and before [[Mark Antony]], the latter stripped Hyrcanus of his nominal political authority and his title, bestowing them both upon the accused.\n\n[[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was assassinated]] in 44 BCE and unrest and confusion spread throughout the Roman world, including Judaea.  Antipater the Idumean was assassinated in 43 BCE by the Nabatean king, [[Malichus I]], who had bribed one of Hyrcanus\u2019 cup-bearers to poison and kill Antipater.\u00a0 However, Antipater's sons managed to maintain their control over Judea and their father's puppet Hasmonean, Hyrcanus.\n\n===Parthian invasion, Antony, Augustus===\n[[File:Prise de J\u00e9rusalem par H\u00e9rode le Grand.jpg|thumb|''The taking of Jerusalem by [[Herod the Great]], 36 BCE (sic)'']]\n[[File:Parthian_Empire_at_it's_greatest_extent.png|thumb|Parthian Empire at its greatest extent, {{circa|lk=no|60}} BCE]]\n\nAfter Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BCE, [[Quintus Labienus]], a Roman republican general and ambassador to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], sided with Brutus and Cassius in the [[Liberators' civil war]]; after their defeat Labienus joined the Parthians and assisted them in invading Roman territories in 40 BCE.  The Parthian army crossed the Euphrates and Labienus was able to entice Mark Antony's Roman garrisons around Syria to rally to his cause.  The Parthians split their army, and under [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus]] conquered the [[Levant]] from the Phoenician coast through the Land of Israel:  <blockquote>Antigonus... roused the Parthians to invade Syria and Palestine, [and] the Jews eagerly rose in support of the scion of the Maccabean house, and drove out the hated Idumeans with their puppet Jewish king. The struggle between the people and the Romans had begun in earnest, and though Antigonus, when placed on the throne by the Parthians, proceeded to spoil and harry the Jews, rejoicing at the restoration of the Hasmonean line, thought a new era of independence had come.<ref>Bentwich, Chapter I.</ref></blockquote>  When Phasael and [[Hyrcanus II]] set out on an embassy to the Parthians, the Parthians instead captured them.  Antigonus, who was present, cut off Hyrcanus's ears to make him unsuitable for the High Priesthood, while Phasael was put to death.\nAntigonus, whose Hebrew name was Mattathias, bore the double title of king and High Priest for only three years, as he had not disposed of Herod, the most dangerous of his enemies.  Herod fled into exile and sought the support of Mark Antony.  Herod was designated \"King of the Jews\" by the [[Roman Senate]] in 40 BCE:  Antony <blockquote>then resolved to get [Herod] made king of the Jews...[and] told [the Senate] that it was for their advantage in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] war that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate was separated, Antony and [[Augustus|Caesar]] [Augustus] went out, with Herod between them; while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in order to offer sacrifices [to the Roman gods], and to lay the decree in the Capitol. Antony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.<ref>[http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html Josephus, ''Wars of the Jews'', 14.4, via]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe struggle thereafter lasted for some years, as the main Roman forces were occupied with defeating the Parthians and had few additional resources to use to support Herod. After the Parthians' defeat, Herod was victorious over his rival in 37 BCE.  Antigonus was delivered to Antony and executed shortly thereafter. The Romans assented to Herod's proclamation as King of the Jews, bringing about the end of the Hasmonean rule over Judea.\n\n===Herod and the end of the dynasty===\nAntigonus was not, however, the last Hasmonean. The fate of the remaining male members of the family under Herod was not a happy one. [[Aristobulus III]], grandson of Aristobulus II through his elder son Alexander, was briefly made high priest, but was soon executed (36 BCE) due to Herod's jealousy. His sister Mariamne was married to Herod, but fell victim to his notorious jealousy. Her sons by Herod, [[Aristobulus IV]] and Alexander, were in their adulthood also executed by their father.\n\n[[Hyrcanus II]] had been held by the Parthians since 40 BCE. For four years, until 36 BCE, he lived amid the [[Babylonian Jews]], who paid him every mark of respect. In that year Herod, who feared that Hyrcanus might induce the Parthians to help him regain the throne, invited him to return to Jerusalem. The Babylonian Jews warned him in vain. Herod received him with every mark of respect, assigning him the first place at his table and the presidency of the state council, while awaiting an opportunity to get rid of him. As the last remaining Hasmonean, Hyrcanus was too dangerous a rival for Herod.  In the year 30 BCE, charged with plotting with the King of Arabia, Hyrcanus was condemned and executed.\n\nThe later Herodian rulers [[Agrippa I]] and [[Agrippa II]] both had Hasmonean blood, as Agrippa I's father was [[Aristobulus IV]], son of Herod by Mariamne I, but they were not direct male descendants, unless Herod was understood as a Hasmonean as per the following synthesis:\n\nAccording to Josephus, Herod was also of Maccabean descent:\n*[[Eleazar Maccabeus]] called Auran brother of [[Judas Maccabeus]] (Josephus Antiquity of the Jews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/JOSEPHUS.HTM|title=The Works of Flavius Josephus|publisher=}}</ref> Book XII/Chapter 9/Section 4)\n*Jason son of Eleazar (Ditto: Book XII/Chapter 10/Section 6)\n*Antipater I son of Jason (Ditto: Book XIII/Chapter 5/Section 8)\n*Antipater II Antipas son of Antipater I (Ditto: Book XIV/Chapter 1/Section 3)\n*Herod\n\n==Legacy and scholarship==\nWhile the Hasmonean dynasty managed to create an independent Jewish kingdom, its successes were rather short-lived, and the dynasty by and large failed to live up to the nationalistic momentum the Maccabee brothers had gained.\n\n===Jewish nationalism===\nThe fall of the Hasmonean Kingdom marked an end to a century of Jewish self-governance, but Jewish nationalism and desire for independence continued under Roman rule, beginning with the [[Census of Quirinius]] in 6 and leading to a series of [[Jewish-Roman wars]] in the 1st&ndash;2nd centuries, including the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Great Revolt]] (AD 66&ndash;73), the [[Kitos War]] (115&ndash;117), and [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] (132&ndash;135).\n\nDuring the wars, temporary commonwealths were established, but they ultimately fell to the sustained might of Rome. [[Roman legion]]s under [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]] [[Destruction of Jerusalem|besieged and destroyed Jerusalem]], looted and burned [[Herod's Temple]] (in the year 70) and Jewish strongholds (notably Gamla in 67 and [[Masada]] in 73), and [[Slavery|enslaved]] or [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacred]] a large part of the Jewish population. The defeat of the Jewish revolts against the Roman Empire notably contributed to the numbers and geography of the [[Jewish Diaspora]], as many Jews were scattered after losing their state or were sold into [[slavery]] throughout the empire.\n\n===Jewish religious scholarship===\nJewish tradition holds that the claiming of kingship by the later Hasmoneans led to their eventual downfall, since that title was only to be held by descendants of the line of [[David|King David]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Catherwood |first=Christopher |title=A Brief History of the Middle East |url=https://books.google.com/?id=krKeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&lpg=PT34&dq=The+Hasmoneans+were+not+descendants+of+King+David,+however,+and+so+lacked+religious+legitimacy+in+the+eyes+of+many+strict+Jews.#v=onepage&q=The%20Hasmoneans%20were%20not%20descendants%20of%20King%20David%2C%20however%2C%20and%20so%20lacked%20religious%20legitimacy%20in%20the%20eyes%20of%20many%20strict%20Jews.&f=false |publisher=Hachette Book Group |year=2011 |page= |isbn=9780762441020}}</ref> The Hasmonean bureaucracy was filled with men with Greek names, and the dynasty eventually became very [[Hellenization|Hellenized]], to the annoyance of many of its more traditionally-minded Jewish subjects.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eyal |first=Regev |title=The Hasmoneans: Ideology, Archaeology, Identity |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BeE9AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=the+Hasmoneans+themselves+became+hellenized#v=onepage&q=the%20Hasmoneans%20themselves%20became%20hellenized&f=false |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |year=2013 |page=18 |isbn=9783647550435}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Elon Gilad |date=23 December 2014 |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/1.633308|title=Meet the Hasmoneans: A Brief History of a Violent Epoch|work=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref> Frequent dynastic quarrels also contributed to the view among Jews of later generations that the latter Hasmoneans were degenerate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Harkabi |first=Yehoshafat |title=The Bar Kokhba Syndrome: Risk and Realism in International Politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rb00WGipKCIC&pg=RA1-PA72&dq=THough+they+enlarged+the+borders+and+established+the+country+as+a+Jewish+entity,+their+dominion+degenerated,+and+they+themselves+deteriorated#v=onepage&q=THough%20they%20enlarged%20the%20borders%20and%20established%20the%20country%20as%20a%20Jewish%20entity%2C%20their%20dominion%20degenerated%2C%20and%20they%20themselves%20deteriorated&f=false |publisher=Rossel Books |year=1983 |page=72 |isbn=978-0940646018}}</ref> One member of this school was Josephus, whose accounts are in many cases our sole source of information about the Hasmoneans.\n\n==Historiography==\n\nThe books of Maccabees use the names \"Judea\" and \"Israel\" (or cognates) as geographical descriptors throughout for both the land and people over whom the Hasmoneans would rule. The [[Talmud]] includes one of the Hasmonean kings under the description \"Kings of Israel\". Scholars refer to the state as the Hasmonean Kingdom to distinguish it from the previous kingdoms of Israel. The name \"Judaea\" has also been used to describe the Hasmonean Kingdom although this name reflects the later designation of the region under the Romans at the time of Josephus' writings in the late 1st century.\n\n==Numismatics==\nHasmonean coins usually featured the [[Paleo-Hebrew]] script, an older [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] script that was used to write [[Hebrew]]. The coins are struck only in [[bronze]]. The symbols include a [[cornucopia]], palm-branch, [[lily]], an anchor, star, [[pomegranate]] and (rarely) a helmet. Despite the apparent [[Seleucid]] influences of most of the symbols, the origin of the star is more obscure.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Louis |title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=32-28}}</ref>\n\n==Hasmonean leaders==\n[[File:Maccabean dynasty.PNG|center|800px|The descendants of Mattathias]]\n{|  class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|-\n| <strong>Family tree (Hasmonean-Herodian)</strong>\n|-\n| {{chart/start}}\n{{chart|Ph|Ph=[[Phinehas]]}}\n{{chart|D|~|~|~|~|~|7}}\n{{chart|Ha||||:|Ha=Hashmonai (Hasmonaeus)}}\n{{chart|!||||||:}}\n{{chart|Sh||||:|Sh=Shimon ben Hashmonai}}\n{{chart|!||||||:}}\n{{chart|Yo||||:|Yo=Yochanan ben Shimon}}\n{{chart|!||||||:}}\n{{chart|Mat|~|y|~|Sim|Mat=[[Mattathias|Mattathias ben Yochanan]]|Sim=Simona bat [[Onias III]]}}\n{{chart|,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart| Jon | | Simo | | Jud | | El | | Jona |Jon=[[John Gaddi]]|Simo=[[Simon Thassi]]<br>'''[[Hasmonean|Prince of Judaea]]''' r. 141 - 135 BCE|Jud=[[Judas Maccabeus]]|El=[[Eleazar Avaran]]|Jona=[[Jonathan Apphus]]\n|boxstyle_ Simo =background-color: yellow;}}\n{{chart||||||!}}\n{{chart||||||Hyr|Hyr=[[John Hyrcanus|John Hyrcanus I]]<br>'''[[Hasmonean|Prince of Judaea]]''' r. 134 - 104 BCE\n|boxstyle_Hyr=background-color: yellow;}}\n{{chart||,|-|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart|Aris|||Alex|~|y|~|Sal|||Ab|Aris=[[Aristobulus I]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 104 - 103 BCE|Alex=[[Alexander Jannaeus]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 103 - 76 BCE|Sal=[[Salome Alexandra]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|Queen of Judaea]]''' r. 76 - 67 BCE|Ab=Absalom ben Yochanan\n|boxstyle_Aris=background-color: yellow;\n|boxstyle_Alex=background-color: yellow;\n|boxstyle_Sal=background-color: yellow;}}\n{{chart||||,|-|-|-|-|-|^|.||||||!}}\n{{chart||||Hyr2|||Aris2|~|y|~|Sal2|Hyr2=[[Hyrcanus II|John Hyrcanus II]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 67 - 66 BCE|Aris2=[[Aristobulus II]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 66 - 63 BCE|Sal2=Salome bat Absalom\n|boxstyle_Hyr2=background-color: yellow;\n|boxstyle_Aris2=background-color: yellow;}}\n{{chart|||||!||||||||)|-|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart|||Alexa|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|Alex2||Anti|Alexa=[[Alexandra the Maccabee|Alexandra II bat Hyrcanus II]]|Alex2=[[Alexander of Judaea|Alexander II]]|Anti=[[Antigonus II Mattathias]]<br>'''[[List of Judean rulers|King of Judaea]]''' r. 40 - 37 BCE\n|boxstyle_Anti=background-color: yellow;}}\n| {{chart/end}}\n|}\n===Maccabees (rebel leaders)===\n#[[Mattathias]], 170&ndash;167 BCE\n#[[Judas Maccabeus]], 167&ndash;160 BCE\n#[[Jonathan Apphus]], 160&ndash;143 BCE (High Priest after 152 BCE)\n\n=== Monarchs (Ethnarchs and Kings) and High Priests===\n#[[Simon Thassi]], 142&ndash;135 BCE (Ethnarch and High Priest)\n#[[John Hyrcanus|John Hyrcanus I]], 134&ndash;104 BCE  (Ethnarch and High Priest)\n#[[Aristobulus I]], 104&ndash;103 BCE (King and High Priest)\n#[[Alexander Jannaeus]], 103&ndash;76 BCE (King and High Priest)\n#[[Salome Alexandra]], 76&ndash;67 BCE (only Queen)\n#[[Hyrcanus II]], 67&ndash;66 BCE (King from 67 BCE; High Priest from 76 BCE)\n#[[Aristobulus II]], 66&ndash;63 BCE (King and High Priest)\n#[[Hyrcanus II]] (restored), 63&ndash;40 BCE (High Priest from 63 BCE; Ethnarch from 47 BCE)\n#[[Antigonus the Hasmonean|Antigonus]], 40&ndash;37 BCE (King and High Priest)\n#[[Aristobulus III of Israel|Aristobulus III]], 36 BCE (only High Priest)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hasmonean coinage]]\n* [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n* [[Hasmonean royal winter palaces]]\n* [[List of Jewish states and dynasties]]\n* [[Siege of Jerusalem (37 BC)]]\n* [[Temple in Jerusalem]]\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Judea Judas Makk.PNG|Judea under [[Judas Maccabeus]]\nFile:Judea Jonathan Makk.PNG|Judea under [[Jonathan Apphus]]\nFile:Judea Simon Makk.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[Simon Thassi]]\nFile:Judea Johannes Hyrcanus.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[John Hyrcanus]]\nFile:Judea Aristobulus I.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[Aristobulus I|Aristobulus]]\nFile:Judea Alexander Janne\u00fcs.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[Alexander Jannaeus]]\nFile:Hasmoneese rijk.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom under [[Salome Alexandra]]\nFile:Judea na Pompeius.PNG|Roman Judea under [[Hyrcanus II]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{notelist}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|title=''Josephus''|url=https://archive.org/details/josephus00bentgoog|publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America|year=1914|location=Philadelphia|last=Bentwich|first=Norman}}\n*[[Josephus]].

The [[hydroxyl group]] (OH) bonds to the carbon that has the greater number of carbon\u2013carbon bonds, while the hydrogen bonds to the carbon on the other end of the double bond, that has more carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds.\n\nThe chemical basis for Markovnikov's Rule is the formation of the most stable [[carbocation]] during the addition process. The addition of the hydrogen ion to one carbon atom in the alkene creates a positive charge on the other carbon, forming a carbocation intermediate. The more substituted the carbocation, the more stable it is, due to [[inductive effects|induction]] and [[hyperconjugation]]. The major product of the addition reaction will be the one formed from the more stable intermediate. Therefore, the major product of the addition of HX (where X is some atom more electronegative than H) to an alkene has the hydrogen atom in the less substituted position and X in the more substituted position\n\n==Anti-Markovnikov reactions==\nMechanisms that do not involve a [[carbocation]] intermediate may react through other mechanisms that have other [[regioselectivity|regioselectivities]] not dictated by Markovnikov's rule, such as [[free radical addition]]. Such reactions are said to be '''anti-Markovnikov''', since the halogen adds to the less substituted carbon, the opposite of a Markovnikov reaction. Similar to a positive charged species, the radical species is most stable when the unpaired electron is in the more substituted position. The anti-Markovnikov rule can be illustrated using the addition of hydrogen bromide to propene in the presence of benzoyl peroxide. The reaction of HBr with substituted alkenes was prototypical in the study of free-radical additions. Early chemists discovered that the reason for the variability in the ratio of Markovnikov to anti-Markovnikov reaction products was due to the unexpected presence of free radical ionizing substances such as peroxides. The explanation is that HBr produces a Br radical, which then reacts with the double bond. Since the bromine atom is relatively large, it is more likely to encounter and react with the least substituted carbon since this interaction procedure less static interactions between the carbon and the bromine radical. In this case, the terminal carbon is a reactant that produces a primary addition product instead of a secondary addition product, in the case of propene.\n\nA new method of anti-Markovnikov addition has been described by Hamilton and Nicewicz, who utilize aromatic molecules and light energy from a low-energy diode to turn the alkene into a cation radical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i15/Light-Driven-Reaction-Modifies-Double.html|title=Light-Driven Reaction Modifies Double Bonds With Unconventional Selectivity - April 15, 2013 Issue - Vol. 91 Issue 15 - Chemical & Engineering News|first=Carmen|last=Drahl|website=cen.acs.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja309635w | pmid=23113557 | volume=134 | issue=45 | title=Direct Catalytic Anti-Markovnikov Hydroetherification of Alkenols | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | pages=18577\u201318580 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = David S. |first2= David A. |last2= Nicewicz|pmc=3513336 | year=2012 }}</ref>\n\nAnti-Markovnikov behaviour extends to more chemical reactions than additions to alkenes.
