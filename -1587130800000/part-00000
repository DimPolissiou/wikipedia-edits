Workers rarely had ready access to a doctor in 19th century workplaces, and since accidents were frequent, death or disability from injuries was common. The St John Ambulance Association set up training sessions across the country, particularly in workplaces in areas of heavy industry, but also in villages, seaside towns and suburban areas.\n\nIn 1887, trained volunteers were organised into a uniformed Brigade to provide a first aid and ambulance service at public events. In many parts of England (and in parts of Scotland, until 1908), St John Ambulance was the first and only provider of an ambulance service right up to the middle of the 20th century, when the National Health Service was founded. When there were far fewer doctors and hospital beds than today, St John Ambulance nurses looked after the sick and injured in their own homes.\n\nThe St John Ambulance Brigade and St John Ambulance Association merged in 1968<ref name=\"jerseyhistory\"/> to form St John Ambulance, a single organisation providing both training and first aid cover. A significant restructure in 2012 further consolidated 43 counties into eight large regions based on the eight regions of the United Kingdom; these regions were then further merged during 2016 into four regions. {{Citation needed|reason=Citation needed to http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/pdf/SJA%20Annual%20Report%20and%20Accounts%202018%20web.pdf|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring 2013, St John Ambulance trained approximately 278,000 adults through its workplace and community first aid programmes, and directly trained 91,000 schoolchildren. St John Ambulance personnel attended 45,000 public events, treating approximately 102,000 individuals.

However, Student Volunteering units have become integral parts of the student community and the 90% of their members are new to St John Ambulance at the point of joining, as students that are new to university look for societies to join.<ref>{{cite web |title=University student volunteering |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/volunteer/first-aid/students-in-higher-education.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Campaigning and awareness-raising==\nSt John Ambulance campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of first aid, and equip more people with life-saving skills.

Where a profit is made, surplus from sales are diverted into supporting the charitable work of the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]] and the St John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem.\n\nSJS opened its doors at St John's Gate in Clerkenwell on 12 February 1879 and was originally known as The Stores Depot. It is now a major commercial operation supplying to the public, private and voluntary sector. The store is now only available online.\n\n==Vehicles==\n[[File:saint.john.ambulance.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|St John Ambulance Crusader ambulance in a London street.]]\nOriginally, individual divisions of St John Ambulance were responsible for providing their own vehicles. These have taken many and varied forms, beginning with horse-drawn ambulances. Even into the late twentieth century, with some centralisation of control and classification of vehicle types such as Motor Ambulance Units (the title arising historically as a distinction from horse-drawn units), First Aid Posts and Rapid Deployment Vehicles, there remained within the organisation an enormous range of deployed vehicles of different types and even assorted local vehicle liveries. Some ambulances were donated second-hand from industrial plants, some were purchased (from different suppliers) and some were local conversions of commercial vehicles. At the start of the twenty-first century, new legislation regarding emergency ambulances effectively rendered a significant proportion of the then current St John Ambulance fleet redundant. The solution was the development of a specialist St John Ambulance vehicle, which was designed jointly by the organisation and vehicle manufacturer [[Renault]]. The result was the Crusader 900 ambulance.\n\nAn early assessment suggested that 100 of the Crusader ambulances (costing, at that time, \u00a340,000 each) would be required immediately, representing an investment of \u00a34&nbsp;million. In 2000, St John Ambulance committed itself to raising \u00a32&nbsp;million by public subscription, whilst English and Welsh [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] committed a further \u00a32&nbsp;million, supplying 50 Crusader ambulances which were handed over in local ceremonies across the country during 2000 and 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhmark.org/PublicPages/StJohnsAmbulance.aspx |title=Mark Masonry and Charitable Giving |website=Mark Lodges Gloucestershire & Herefordshire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726072949/http://www.gandhmark.org/PublicPages/StJohnsAmbulance.aspx |archivedate=26 July 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.durhamfreemasons.org/Mark/Charity.html |title=Mark Benevolent Fund |website=Mark Master Masons of County Durham |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162528/http://durhamfreemasons.org/mark/charity.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref> This very large donation allowed the rapid transformation of the national St John Ambulance fleet of front-line ambulances within a much shorter time-scale than could otherwise have been possible. Subsequently, many local Provinces of Freemasons have maintained relations with their local St John Ambulance County units and supported the running costs of these vehicles or even donated further (additional) Crusader ambulances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hertsmark.org/mainpages/newssum2005.htm |title=The New Mark Ambulance |website=Provincial Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of Hertfordshire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021162653/http://www.hertsmark.org/mainpages/newssum2005.htm |archivedate=21 October 2007 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 2004, the national St John Ambulance emergency vehicle fleet was in a standard corporate livery, with standard vehicle types:<ref>{{Cite book |title=The New Driving Force |author=St John Ambulance Supplies Department |date=June 2004 |publisher=SJS |location=London, UK}}</ref>\n[[File:SJAVehicles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Image showing the various vehicles St John Use (Left to Right: 2 Crusaders, a Challenger, a Companion Plus and 2 further Crusaders)]]\n* '''Crusader''' \u2013 a front-line emergency ambulance, based on the [[Renault Master]] (or similar);\n* '''4x4 Ambulance''' \u2013 a 4-wheel drive emergency ambulance, based on the [[Nissan Patrol]] (or similar), but with additional headroom, for rural and off-road deployment;\n* '''Support Vehicle''' \u2013 either based on a van, car or a 4x4 vehicle, Support Units can be used for a variety of purposes. For instance, a Support Car may be used to carry members to and from duties, in a logistical capacity, or even as a response vehicle on larger duties. Support Vans are normally used only for logistical purposes. Mini-buses are also available, and can be used for logistics or the transport of members.\n\n===Specialist vehicles===\nSt John Ambulance also maintains specialist response options in particular locations, such as Cycle Response Units, control and command units, as well as larger vehicles or trailers used as static first aid posts.\n\n==Volunteers==\nThe majority of St John Ambulance's volunteers deliver first aid at events and as Community First Responders or work with young people as youth leaders. Other specialist roles are available for healthcare professionals, volunteer managers and in safeguarding, human resources, quality and assurance and health and safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/volunteer.aspx |title=Volunteer with St John Ambulance |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Training and skills ===\nVolunteers receive training according to the role they fulfill. Those volunteering to provide Event First Aid services first attend a four-day Operational First Aid (FA) course, a four-day course covering common injuries and illnesses, basic life support, major trauma and serious illnesses, in addition to organisation specific elements such as safe discharge, patient recording and the use of SJA Medicines packs, alongside practical work and scenario training.\n\nFurther progression is to the Advanced First Aider (AFA) course, a four-day course covering oxygen therapy, intermediate airway management, the use of entonox, splints, resuscitation, manual handling with equipment, enhanced patient assessment and extensive scenario training. Advanced First Aider is the standard required for entry to the Cycle Response Unit, Medical Response Team (a specialist resource for working in dense crowds) and Ambulance Training. \n\nAmbulance training, open only to pre-selected Advanced First Aiders, is based on the competencies of [[National Health Service]] Ambulance Technicians. Currently based on an internal Emergency Medical Technician course qualifying volunteers to practice as an Emergency Transport Attendant (ETA), the organisation is currently in the process of redesigning the ambulance training pathway to better align with the NHS, and provide externally recognised qualifications.  An internal driving school, based in Milton Keynes, further supports the development of volunteer ambulance crew by offering a modular 20-day Level 3 Certificate in Emergency Response Ambulance Driving (L3CERAD), the same qualification in blue light driving used by the NHS. {{Citation needed|reason=Citation required|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe training for those delivering Youth Services comprises emergency life support training, coupled with training from the organisation's own youth leader training suite including Essential skills in youth work and Leadership skills in youth work, depending on the volunteer's role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://member.sja.org.uk/ylt/Default.asp |title=St John Ambulance Youth leader training suite |website=St John Ambulance| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025604/http://member.sja.org.uk/ylt/Default.asp |archivedate=3 December 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to medical training offered, members have the opportunity to carry out other operational roles. These include event planning, event management, radio communications/control, plus other support roles.\n\n=== Healthcare professionals ===\nQualified healthcare professionals may also volunteer their time in St John Ambulance including nurses, paramedics, physiotherapists and doctors. All healthcare professionals have their qualifications and professional status checked with the appropriate regulatory body before practising in St John Ambulance. Professionals can carry out any skill appropriate to their type, level of training, competence and when relevant to the situation or patient. Healthcare professionals wear [[St John Ambulance Ranks and Insignia|coloured rank slides]] to distinguish them from internally trained first aiders and ambulance personnel.\n\nStudent HCPs who are attending an event alongside an HCP (nurse, doctor, physiotherapist or paramedic) may be mentored/supervised by that Event HCP to provide out of hospital care when directly supervised and where resources permit. Whenever unsupervised (for example if their HCP is called away to see another patient), they revert strictly to the level of their SJA training, and can not practice as a Student HCP.\n\n==Structure==\nIn 2012, St John Ambulance was reorganised into a regional structure, with the goal of increasing accountability and maximising charitable outputs.<ref name=\"sja.org.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/pdf/Order-of-St-John-Annual-report-2012.pdf |title=Order of St John Annual report 2012 |website=St John Ambulance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193333/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/pdf/Order-of-St-John-Annual-report-2012.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref> Up until that point the organisation had been divided into 42 semi-autonomous county organisations.\n\nAs part of the reorganisation, a more streamlined structure was introduced, with fewer layers of management between the front-line and the St John Ambulance Board.\n\n===St John Ambulance regions===\nThe current 4 regions are:\n* '''East''', made up of the [[East of England|East]] and [[East Midlands]]\n* '''London & South''', made up of London and the [[South East England|South East]]\n* '''North''', made up of the [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]\n* '''West''', made up of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and [[South West England|South West]]\n\nEach region is managed by a paid regional director, and is responsible for the delivery of programmes developed and overseen by National Headquarters. All regions are accountable to the [[Care Quality Commission]] and are independently inspected by the CQC against 14 different outcomes, such as care and welfare of people who use the services, cleanliness and infection control and supporting workers.<ref name=\"annualreports\"/>\n\nDuring regionalisation in 2012, St John Ambulance in [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] became separate from England.<ref name=\"Ainsworth\"/>\n\n===District===\nThe region is divided into a number of districts. A district may contain one or more former \"counties\" from the previous structure and may only have part of a county in. Each district is managed by a district manager (volunteer), and area managers report to them. District managers are in overall charge of all activities in their district, assisted by the area managers. They have a support team of district specialists in place coordinating functions such as event cover and youth provision, but they have no line management responsibility and report to their respective regional departmental manager. Each district usually contains 3\u20136 areas.\n\n===Area===\nDistricts are further divided into geographic areas, led by an area manager (volunteer). Unit managers report to the area manager, and the area manager is in overall charge of the activities of the units in their area, within the boundaries of policies etc. set by Regional Headquarters (RHQ) and NHQ. They are assisted/advised by district specialists to provide the day-to-day functions of the organisation, such as member training and event cover. Each area contains about 8\u201315 units.\n\n===Unit===\nA unit (formerly a division) is the smallest administrative division of St John Ambulance. Most volunteers are managed within a unit by another volunteer. An adult unit is led by a unit manager, who may have one or more assistant unit managers to assist them. The unit usually has a weekly meeting where members train, practice their skills, and occasionally have visits from guest speakers. Units plan and execute the cover of most of the events requested of the organisation, supported by their area and district managers, district specialists and regional events team. Units are where most people start their time in the organisation. There are two types of youth units: Badger Setts (for ages 7\u201310) and [[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK|cadets]] (for ages 10\u201318). They are typically based on the same site as an adult unit are supervised by adult volunteers.\n\nOther types of units exist, such as Student Volunteering units within universities, cycle response units, other specialised units, and sometimes informal social groups, each with a distinctive command, management or leadership structure. Specialised units are sometimes \"virtual units\" meaning the unit doesn't physically meet on a regular basis, but works over the internet etc. Historically, there were ambulance divisions (for men), nursing divisions (for women), ambulance cadet divisions (for boys) and nursing cadet divisions (for girls). In modern times, no single-sex divisions remain.\n\n== Uniform and ranks ==\n{{main|St John Ambulance Ranks and Insignia}}[[File:London Marathon 2014 - First aiders (04).jpg|thumb|Personnel in the current uniform (centre and right) and the old uniform (left).]]\nSt John Ambulance first aid personnel wear a service delivery uniform consisting of a green shirt; black combat trousers; and either a green and black Parka Jacket, a reversible fleece, or green and black softshell jacket with appropriate black footwear. [[Epaulette]]s on the shirts vary in colour dependent on the profession of the volunteer: Black for first aid personnel, green for registered paramedics, grey for registered nurses, and red for registered doctors. Healthcare professionals' (HCPs) epaulettes don't show specialism such as midwives. Student HCPs wear black epaulettes until they're qualified in their respective profession.\n\nOn the service delivery uniform, a role bar is worn to denote the wearer's role on that event.  High-visibility two-tone yellow-and-green tabards (accepted to denote medical personnel) are only worn when the risk assessment of the event calls for it.\n\nBadgers wear a branded black polo-shirt and a branded black jumper, where they can wear the badges they earn through the Super Badger programme.\n\nCadets wear the same uniform as their adult counterparts, though are permitted to wear a brassard on their left arm (during ceremonial processions only; not whilst performing clinical duties) where they're able to show their current/highest Grand Prior Award badge at the top-centre; up to three badges, including duty hours, Duke of Edinburgh Award, Sovereign's Award, national competitions winners badge, Amalfi Challenge (discontinued) or Diana Award (if won for services to St John Ambulance); and the Super Badger award (if achieved) at the bottom of the brassard.\n\nA ceremonial uniform still exists for adult volunteers, consisting of a peaked cap, tailored jacket, white shirt, black trousers, black shoes and clip-on tie. All rank insignia are worn on the outer layer of the jacket.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sja.org.uk/shop/pdf/Looking%20the%20part%20catalogue%202013.pdf |title=St John Ambulance uniform catalogue |year=2013 |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== St John Ambulance in the British armed forces ==\nA section of St John Ambulance, St John Ambulance British Forces Overseas (SJABFO), has British units running where there are a large amount of British servicemen and women with their families overseas. These are namely in Cyprus, with units in Germany beginning to close in preparation for the British withdrawal from Germany in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/deployments/germany/|title=Germany|website=army.mod.uk|access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref> The divisions are directly linked to the UK and national headquarters so that members can transfer to another unit or region/district/area as they would be able to do at home. Cyprus and Germany are a part of St John Ambulance as two districts, unattached to any region, within the organisational structure. The uniform reflects the current service delivery uniform in England.\n\nVolunteers can receive training in the full range of St John Ambulance qualifications.\n\nThe overseas forces units (then \"divisions\") were founded in 1980. They remained very strong for several years, however, as the forces in Germany were reduced many divisions closed. Since the final withdrawal of forces in Germany is expected in the next few years, the role for St John Ambulance will end. However the two units in Cyprus founded in 1991 will continue to provide a service to the community there.\n\nAs well as providing medical cover at events, St John Ambulance British Forces provides first-aid training for people of all ages.\n\nSt John Ambulance British Forces Overseas works closely with the German Ambulance Services, particularly the sister organisation, [[Die Johanniter]], in providing first aid and ambulance cover German public events where many British or English Speakers are expected to attend. Members can occasionally be seen on their non-emergency ''and'' emergency vehicles responding to public calls. St John Ambulance can also be seen working with [[Order of Malta|Malteser]], the [[German Red Cross]] and local fire brigades which provide ambulance services. The German Emergency Services also assist St John Ambulance at British events on military areas where many German civilians are expected to attend. With the planned withdrawal of British forces from Germany in 2019, this partnership, in this aspect at least, will be discontinued.\n\n== Relations with the Order of St John and other organisations ==\nAlthough the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]] is largely seen as a Christian organisation for historical reasons, St John Ambulance does not restrict membership to nor promote any particular religion or denomination. Technically, it falls under the sovereignty of [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]], and thus is linked to the [[Church of England]]; however, this relationship is more tradition than authority, and adult members are not required to pledge allegiance to or support either the monarchy or the Christian faith. Historically, Cadet members made a pledge upon joining to the monarch and to God, though was reviewed and no longer a requirement.\n\nSt John Ambulance personnel serve alongside the [[British Red Cross]], whose members also undergo advanced training in [[first aid]] and event cover. Both organisations' work supports the statutory services in times of civil emergency or crisis. In peacetime, St John Ambulance is senior to the Red Cross however during wartime, the Red Cross would become senior due to an agreement with the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].\n\nSt John Ambulance, [[St. Andrew's First Aid]] of Scotland and the [[British Red Cross]] co-author and authorise the official First Aid Manual,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dk.com/uk/9781409342007-first-aid-manual |title=First Aid Manual |website=[[Dorling Kindersley]] Books |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref> the ''de facto'' UK guide for emergency first aid.\n\n==See also==\n*[[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK]]\n*[[St John Ambulance Ireland]]\n*[[Service Medal of the Order of St John]]\n*[[Insignia of the Venerable Order of St John]]\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sja.org.uk/ St John Ambulance \u2013 The Priory of England and the Islands]\n*[http://www.caringonthehomefront.org.uk/ Caring on the Home Front] A website dedicated to the memories of St John Ambulance and British Red Cross volunteers during World War II.\n\n{{St John Ambulance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint John Ambulance In England}}\n[[Category:St. John Ambulance|England]]\n[[Category:Medical and health organisations based in England]]\n[[Category:Charities based in London]]\n[[Category:Youth organisations based in England]]\n[[Category:1877 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1877]]\n[[Category:Ambulance services in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox organization\n| name = St John Ambulance<br/>England\n| image = File:St John Ambulance UK Logo 2019.svg\n| caption = Logo of St John Ambulance\n| formation = 1877\n| type = Charitable organisation<br/>[[Limited company]]\n| headquarters = 27 St John's Lane, [[Clerkenwell]], London EC1M 4BU\n| region = Nationwide (England)\n| volunteers = 18,000\n| staff = <!-- provide a reliable source when updating this number -->\n| leader_title = Sovereign Head\n| leader_name = [[Elizabeth II]]\n| leader_title2 = Prior and Chair of St John Ambulance\n| leader_name2 = Lionel Jarvis CBE KStJ<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/what-we-do/who-we-are/current-trustees.aspx|title=Current trustees \u2013 St John Ambulance|website=sja.org.uk}}</ref>\n| leader_title3 = Chief Executive<br>\n| leader_name3 = Martin Houghton-Brown<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-people/our-leadership-team.aspx|title=Our leadership team \u2013 St John Ambulance|website=sja.org.uk}}</ref>\n| leader_title4 = Chief Volunteer\n| leader_name4 = Ann Cable\n| affiliations = [[St John Ambulance]]<br/>[[Johanniter International]]\n| income = \u00a391.4m per annum<ref name=\"annualreports\" />\n| website = {{URL|www.sja.org.uk}}\n| footnotes = Updated: 29 November 2018\n| motto = Be The Difference\n| youth_membership = 25,000+\n}}\n\n'''St John Ambulance''' is a volunteer-led, [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|charitable]] non-governmental organisation dedicated to the teaching and practice of [[first aid]] in England.

Workers rarely had ready access to a doctor in 19th century workplaces, and since accidents were frequent, death or disability from injuries were common. The St John Ambulance Association set up training sessions across the country, particularly in workplaces in areas of heavy industry, but also in villages, seaside towns and suburban areas.\n\nIn 1887, trained volunteers were organised into a uniformed Brigade to provide a first aid and ambulance service at public events. In many parts of England (and in parts of Scotland, until 1908), St John Ambulance was the first and only provider of an ambulance service right up to the middle of the 20th century, when the National Health Service was founded. When there were far fewer doctors and hospital beds than today, St John Ambulance nurses looked after the sick and injured in their own homes.\n\nThe St John Ambulance Brigade and St John Ambulance Association merged in 1968<ref name=\"jerseyhistory\"/> to form St John Ambulance, a single organisation providing both training and first aid cover. A significant restructure in 2012 further consolidated 43 counties into eight large regions based on the eight regions of the United Kingdom; these regions were then further merged during 2016 into four regions. {{Citation needed|reason=Citation needed to http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/pdf/SJA%20Annual%20Report%20and%20Accounts%202018%20web.pdf|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring 2013, St John Ambulance trained approximately 278,000 adults through its workplace and community first aid programmes, and directly trained 91,000 schoolchildren. St John Ambulance personnel attended 45,000 public events, treating approximately 102,000 individuals.

Where a profit is made, surplus from sales are diverted into supporting the charitable work of the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]] and the St John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem.\n\nSJS opened its doors at St John's Gate in Clerkenwell on 12 February 1879 and was originally known as The Stores Depot. It is now a major commercial operation supplying to the public, private and voluntary sector. The store is now only available online.\n\n==Vehicles==\n[[File:saint.john.ambulance.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|St John Ambulance Crusader ambulance in a London street.]]\nOriginally, individual divisions of St John Ambulance were responsible for providing their own vehicles. These have taken many and varied forms, beginning with horse-drawn ambulances. Even into the late twentieth century, with some centralisation of control and classification of vehicle types such as Motor Ambulance Units (the title arising historically as a distinction from horse-drawn units), First Aid Posts and Rapid Deployment Vehicles, there remained within the organisation an enormous range of deployed vehicles of different types and even assorted local vehicle liveries. Some ambulances were donated second-hand from industrial plants, some were purchased (from different suppliers) and some were local conversions of commercial vehicles. At the start of the twenty-first century, new legislation regarding emergency ambulances effectively rendered a significant proportion of the then current St John Ambulance fleet redundant. The solution was the development of a specialist St John Ambulance vehicle, which was designed jointly by the organisation and vehicle manufacturer [[Renault]]. The result was the Crusader 900 ambulance.\n\nAn early assessment suggested that 100 of the Crusader ambulances (costing, at that time, \u00a340,000 each) would be required immediately, representing an investment of \u00a34&nbsp;million. In 2000, St John Ambulance committed itself to raising \u00a32&nbsp;million by public subscription, whilst English and Welsh [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] committed a further \u00a32&nbsp;million, supplying 50 Crusader ambulances which were handed over in local ceremonies across the country during 2000 and 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhmark.org/PublicPages/StJohnsAmbulance.aspx |title=Mark Masonry and Charitable Giving |website=Mark Lodges Gloucestershire & Herefordshire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726072949/http://www.gandhmark.org/PublicPages/StJohnsAmbulance.aspx |archivedate=26 July 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.durhamfreemasons.org/Mark/Charity.html |title=Mark Benevolent Fund |website=Mark Master Masons of County Durham |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162528/http://durhamfreemasons.org/mark/charity.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref> This very large donation allowed the rapid transformation of the national St John Ambulance fleet of front-line ambulances within a much shorter time-scale than could otherwise have been possible. Subsequently, many local Provinces of Freemasons have maintained relations with their local St John Ambulance County units and supported the running costs of these vehicles or even donated further (additional) Crusader ambulances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hertsmark.org/mainpages/newssum2005.htm |title=The New Mark Ambulance |website=Provincial Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of Hertfordshire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021162653/http://www.hertsmark.org/mainpages/newssum2005.htm |archivedate=21 October 2007 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 2004, the national St John Ambulance emergency vehicle fleet was in a standard corporate livery, with standard vehicle types:<ref>{{Cite book |title=The New Driving Force |author=St John Ambulance Supplies Department |date=June 2004 |publisher=SJS |location=London, UK}}</ref>\n[[File:SJAVehicles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Image showing the various vehicles St John Use (Left to Right: 2 Crusaders, a Challenger, a Companion Plus and 2 further Crusaders)]]\n* '''Crusader''' \u2013 a front-line emergency ambulance, based on the [[Renault Master]] (or similar);\n* '''4x4 Ambulance''' \u2013 a 4-wheel drive emergency ambulance, based on the [[Nissan Patrol]] (or similar), but with additional headroom, for rural and off-road deployment;\n* '''Support Vehicle''' \u2013 either based on a van, car or a 4x4 vehicle, Support Units can be used for a variety of purposes. For instance, a Support Car may be used to carry members to and from duties, in a logistical capacity, or even as a response vehicle on larger duties. Support Vans are normally used only for logistical purposes. Mini-buses are also available, and can be used for logistics or the transport of members.\n\n===Specialist vehicles===\nSt John Ambulance also maintains specialist response options in particular locations, such as Cycle Response Units, control and command units, as well as larger vehicles or trailers used as static first aid posts.\n\n==Volunteers==\nThe majority of St John Ambulance's volunteers deliver first aid at events and as Community First Responders or work with young people as youth leaders. Other specialist roles are available for healthcare professionals, volunteer managers and in safeguarding, human resources, quality and assurance and health and safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/volunteer.aspx |title=Volunteer with St John Ambulance |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Training and skills ===\nVolunteers receive training according to the role they fulfill. Those volunteering to provide Event First Aid services first attend a four-day Operational First Aid (FA) course, a four-day course covering common injuries and illnesses, basic life support, major trauma and serious illnesses, in addition to organisation specific elements such as safe discharge, patient recording and the use of SJA Medicines packs, alongside practical work and scenario training.\n\nFurther progression is to the Advanced First Aider (AFA) course, a four-day course covering oxygen therapy, intermediate airway management, the use of entonox, splints, resuscitation, manual handling with equipment, enhanced patient assessment and extensive scenario training. Advanced First Aider is the standard required for entry to the Cycle Response Unit, Medical Response Team (a specialist resource for working in dense crowds) and Ambulance Training. \n\nAmbulance training, open only to pre-selected Advanced First Aiders, is based on the competencies of [[National Health Service]] Ambulance Technicians. Currently based on an internal Emergency Medical Technician course qualifying volunteers to practice as an Emergency Transport Attendant (ETA), the organisation is currently in the process of redesigning the ambulance training pathway to better align with the NHS, and provide externally recognised qualifications.  An internal driving school, based in Milton Keynes, further supports the development of volunteer ambulance crew by offering a modular 20-day Level 3 Certificate in Emergency Response Ambulance Driving (L3CERAD), the same qualification in blue light driving used by the NHS. {{Citation needed|reason=Citation required|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe training for those delivering Youth Services comprises emergency life support training, coupled with training from the organisation's own youth leader training suite including Essential skills in youth work and Leadership skills in youth work, depending on the volunteer's role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://member.sja.org.uk/ylt/Default.asp |title=St John Ambulance Youth leader training suite |website=St John Ambulance| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025604/http://member.sja.org.uk/ylt/Default.asp |archivedate=3 December 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to medical training offered, members have the opportunity to carry out other operational roles. These include event planning, event management, radio communications/control, plus other support roles.\n\n=== Healthcare professionals ===\nQualified healthcare professionals may also volunteer their time in St John Ambulance including nurses, paramedics, physiotherapists and doctors. All healthcare professionals have their qualifications and professional status checked with the appropriate regulatory body before practising in St John Ambulance. Professionals can carry out any skill appropriate to their type, level of training, competence and when relevant to the situation or patient. Healthcare professionals wear [[St John Ambulance Ranks and Insignia|coloured rank slides]] to distinguish them from internally trained first aiders and ambulance personnel.\n\nStudent HCPs who are attending an event alongside an HCP (nurse, doctor, physiotherapist or paramedic) may be mentored/supervised by that Event HCP to provide out of hospital care when directly supervised and where resources permit. Whenever unsupervised (for example if their HCP is called away to see another patient), they revert strictly to the level of their SJA training, and can not practice as a Student HCP.\n\n==Structure==\nIn 2012, St John Ambulance was reorganised into a regional structure, with the goal of increasing accountability and maximising charitable outputs.<ref name=\"sja.org.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/pdf/Order-of-St-John-Annual-report-2012.pdf |title=Order of St John Annual report 2012 |website=St John Ambulance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193333/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/pdf/Order-of-St-John-Annual-report-2012.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref> Up until that point the organisation had been divided into 42 semi-autonomous county organisations.\n\nAs part of the reorganisation, a more streamlined structure was introduced, with fewer layers of management between the front-line and the St John Ambulance Board.\n\n===St John Ambulance regions===\nThe current 4 regions are:\n* '''East''', made up of the [[East of England|East]] and [[East Midlands]]\n* '''London & South''', made up of London and the [[South East England|South East]]\n* '''North''', made up of the [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]\n* '''West''', made up of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and [[South West England|South West]]\n\nEach region is managed by a paid regional director, and is responsible for the delivery of programmes developed and overseen by National Headquarters. All regions are accountable to the [[Care Quality Commission]] and are independently inspected by the CQC against 14 different outcomes, such as care and welfare of people who use the services, cleanliness and infection control and supporting workers.<ref name=\"annualreports\"/>\n\nDuring regionalisation in 2012, St John Ambulance in [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] became separate from England.<ref name=\"Ainsworth\"/>\n\n===District===\nThe region is divided into a number of districts. A district may contain one or more former \"counties\" from the previous structure and may only have part of a county in. Each district is managed by a district manager (volunteer), and area managers report to them. District managers are in overall charge of all activities in their district, assisted by the area managers. They have a support team of district specialists in place coordinating functions such as event cover and youth provision, but they have no line management responsibility and report to their respective regional departmental manager. Each district usually contains 3\u20136 areas.\n\n===Area===\nDistricts are further divided into geographic areas, led by an area manager (volunteer). Unit managers report to the area manager, and the area manager is in overall charge of the activities of the units in their area, within the boundaries of policies etc. set by Regional Headquarters (RHQ) and NHQ. They are assisted/advised by district specialists to provide the day-to-day functions of the organisation, such as member training and event cover. Each area contains about 8\u201315 units.\n\n===Unit===\nA unit (formerly a division) is the smallest administrative division of St John Ambulance. Most volunteers are managed within a unit by another volunteer. An adult unit is led by a unit manager, who may have one or more assistant unit managers to assist them. The unit usually has a weekly meeting where members train, practice their skills, and occasionally have visits from guest speakers. Units plan and execute the cover of most of the events requested of the organisation, supported by their area and district managers, district specialists and regional events team. Units are where most people start their time in the organisation. There are two types of youth units: Badger Setts (for ages 7\u201310) and [[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK|cadets]] (for ages 10\u201318). They are typically based on the same site as an adult unit are supervised by adult volunteers.\n\nOther types of units exist, such as Student Volunteering units within universities, cycle response units, other specialised units, and sometimes informal social groups, each with a distinctive command, management or leadership structure. Specialised units are sometimes \"virtual units\" meaning the unit doesn't physically meet on a regular basis, but works over the internet etc. Historically, there were ambulance divisions (for men), nursing divisions (for women), ambulance cadet divisions (for boys) and nursing cadet divisions (for girls). In modern times, no single-sex divisions remain.\n\n== Uniform and ranks ==\n{{main|St John Ambulance Ranks and Insignia}}[[File:London Marathon 2014 - First aiders (04).jpg|thumb|Personnel in the current uniform (centre and right) and the old uniform (left).]]\nSt John Ambulance first aid personnel wear a service delivery uniform consisting of a green shirt; black combat trousers; and either a green and black Parka Jacket, a reversible fleece, or green and black softshell jacket with appropriate black footwear. [[Epaulette]]s on the shirts vary in colour dependent on the profession of the volunteer: Black for first aid personnel, green for registered paramedics, grey for registered nurses, and red for registered doctors. Healthcare professionals' (HCPs) epaulettes don't show specialism such as midwives. Student HCPs wear black epaulettes until they're qualified in their respective profession.\n\nOn the service delivery uniform, a role bar is worn to denote the wearer's role on that event.  High-visibility two-tone yellow-and-green tabards (accepted to denote medical personnel) are only worn when the risk assessment of the event calls for it.\n\nBadgers wear a branded black polo-shirt and a branded black jumper, where they can wear the badges they earn through the Super Badger programme.\n\nCadets wear the same uniform as their adult counterparts, though are permitted to wear a brassard on their left arm (during ceremonial processions only; not whilst performing clinical duties) where they're able to show their current/highest Grand Prior Award badge at the top-centre; up to three badges, including duty hours, Duke of Edinburgh Award, Sovereign's Award, national competitions winners badge, Amalfi Challenge (discontinued) or Diana Award (if won for services to St John Ambulance); and the Super Badger award (if achieved) at the bottom of the brassard.\n\nA ceremonial uniform still exists for adult volunteers, consisting of a peaked cap, tailored jacket, white shirt, black trousers, black shoes and clip-on tie. All rank insignia are worn on the outer layer of the jacket.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sja.org.uk/shop/pdf/Looking%20the%20part%20catalogue%202013.pdf |title=St John Ambulance uniform catalogue |year=2013 |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== St John Ambulance in the British armed forces ==\nA section of St John Ambulance, St John Ambulance British Forces Overseas (SJABFO), has British units running where there are a large amount of British servicemen and women with their families overseas. These are namely in Cyprus, with units in Germany beginning to close in preparation for the British withdrawal from Germany in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/deployments/germany/|title=Germany|website=army.mod.uk|access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref> The divisions are directly linked to the UK and national headquarters so that members can transfer to another unit or region/district/area as they would be able to do at home. Cyprus and Germany are a part of St John Ambulance as two districts, unattached to any region, within the organisational structure. The uniform reflects the current service delivery uniform in England.\n\nVolunteers can receive training in the full range of St John Ambulance qualifications.\n\nThe overseas forces units (then \"divisions\") were founded in 1980. They remained very strong for several years, however, as the forces in Germany were reduced many divisions closed. Since the final withdrawal of forces in Germany is expected in the next few years, the role for St John Ambulance will end. However the two units in Cyprus founded in 1991 will continue to provide a service to the community there.\n\nAs well as providing medical cover at events, St John Ambulance British Forces provides first-aid training for people of all ages.\n\nSt John Ambulance British Forces Overseas works closely with the German Ambulance Services, particularly the sister organisation, [[Die Johanniter]], in providing first aid and ambulance cover German public events where many British or English Speakers are expected to attend. Members can occasionally be seen on their non-emergency ''and'' emergency vehicles responding to public calls. St John Ambulance can also be seen working with [[Order of Malta|Malteser]], the [[German Red Cross]] and local fire brigades which provide ambulance services. The German Emergency Services also assist St John Ambulance at British events on military areas where many German civilians are expected to attend. With the planned withdrawal of British forces from Germany in 2019, this partnership, in this aspect at least, will be discontinued.\n\n== Relations with the Order of St John and other organisations ==\nAlthough the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]] is largely seen as a Christian organisation for historical reasons, St John Ambulance does not restrict membership to nor promote any particular religion or denomination. Technically, it falls under the sovereignty of [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]], and thus is linked to the [[Church of England]]; however, this relationship is more tradition than authority, and adult members are not required to pledge allegiance to or support either the monarchy or the Christian faith. Historically, Cadet members made a pledge upon joining to the monarch and to God, though was reviewed and no longer a requirement.\n\nSt John Ambulance personnel serve alongside the [[British Red Cross]], whose members also undergo advanced training in [[first aid]] and event cover. Both organisations' work supports the statutory services in times of civil emergency or crisis. In peacetime, St John Ambulance is senior to the Red Cross however during wartime, the Red Cross would become senior due to an agreement with the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].\n\nSt John Ambulance, [[St. Andrew's First Aid]] of Scotland and the [[British Red Cross]] co-author and authorise the official First Aid Manual,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dk.com/uk/9781409342007-first-aid-manual |title=First Aid Manual |website=[[Dorling Kindersley]] Books |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref> the ''de facto'' UK guide for emergency first aid.\n\n==See also==\n*[[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK]]\n*[[St John Ambulance Ireland]]\n*[[Service Medal of the Order of St John]]\n*[[Insignia of the Venerable Order of St John]]\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sja.org.uk/ St John Ambulance \u2013 The Priory of England and the Islands]\n*[http://www.caringonthehomefront.org.uk/ Caring on the Home Front] A website dedicated to the memories of St John Ambulance and British Red Cross volunteers during World War II.\n\n{{St John Ambulance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint John Ambulance In England}}\n[[Category:St. John Ambulance|England]]\n[[Category:Medical and health organisations based in England]]\n[[Category:Charities based in London]]\n[[Category:Youth organisations based in England]]\n[[Category:1877 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1877]]\n[[Category:Ambulance services in England]]\n", "name_user": "Jamietw", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:grammar fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Ambulance_in_England"}

Although the Montenegrins were not recognized by the Albanian authorities as a distinct national minority, the Association claimed to have over 1,000 members representing the interests of a 2,500-strong minority residing mainly in the around Shkod\u00ebr. The AM challenged the official statistics issued by Tirana in the early 1990s, in which the number of Montenegrins and Serbs was placed at only 100. Some Albanian officials contended that several hundred Slavs had left the country since the onset of the democratic changes, including both Serbs and Montenegrins, that the numbers were accurate. Members of the Association advocated promoting the culture and customs of Montenegrins and urged the recognition of Montenegrin and Serbian minorities in Albania and the return of original Slavic names to members of these minorities. The AM planned to reopen elementary schools in the mother language and to form a Montenegrin-Serbian club.</ref> In 1999 the Helsinki Committee for Human rights in Albania conducted surveys of the Shkod\u00ebr region and estimated that there were some 1800-2000 Serbian-speakers in the area.<ref name=\"Steinke19\">{{harvnb|Steinke|Ylli|2013|p=19}} \"Ohne genaue Quellenangabe bringt \u0160\u0106EPANOVI\u0106 (1991: 716-717) folgende ,,aktuelle\" Zahlen: Omara 79 Haushalte, davon 68 crnogorski, 11 albanische; Grilj 85 Haushalte, davon 76 crnogorski, 9 albanische; Stari (Mali) Bori\u0107 75 Haushalte, davon 67 crnogorski, 8 albanische, Veliki (Mladi) Bori\u0107 112 Familien, davon 86 podgori\u010danski, 6 crnogorski und 20 albanische Familien.

Although the Montenegrins were not recognized by the Albanian authorities as a distinct national minority, the Association claimed to have over 1,000 members representing the interests of a 2,500-strong minority residing mainly in the around Shkod\u00ebr. The AM challenged the official statistics issued by Tirana in the early 1990s, in which the number of Montenegrins and Serbs was placed at only 100. Some Albanian officials contended that several hundred Slavs had left the country since the onset of the democratic changes, including both Serbs and Montenegrins, that the numbers were accurate.

The abnormalities in gene structures and expressions reported in the Pathophysiology section, particularly rearrangement and/or over expression of the ''MYC'' proto-oncogene, may also be apparent in these cells. The presence of HIV/AIDS or other causes of immuno-incompetence (see previous section), a history of having a low-grade lymphoma, and/or the presence of EVB+ plasmablasts in the disease's lesions would support the diagnosis of PBL.<ref name=\"pmid31725418\"/>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\nVarious lymphomas can exhibit the microscopic appearance, including plasmablastic cells, and presentation of PBL. These lymphomas can usually be differentiated from PBL by further examinations of the plasmablasts for various marker proteins and determining other factors that favor the diagnosis of these lymphomas rather than PBL, as indicated in the following descriptions.   \n\n==== Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma ====\nUnlike PBL, the plasmablastic cells in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma strongly express products of the ''[[ACVRL1]]'' gene, i.e. activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and are not infected with EBV and therefore do not express this virus's EBER or BART RNAs.<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/>\n\n==== Human herpesvirus 8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified ====\nUnlike PBL, the plasmablastic cells in human herpesvirus 8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified express products of herpesvirus 8 (also termed Karposi sarcoma virus) such as [[LANA]]-1 protein. Also unlike PBL, these plasmablastic cells do not express CD30, CD138, CD79a,<ref name=\"pmid31725418\"/> or a clonal [[IgM]] antibody and usually are not EBV-infected and therefore usually do not express this virus's EBER or BART RNAs.<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/>\n\n==== Primary effusion lymphoma ====\nIn contrast to PBL, the plasmablastic cells in primary effusion lymphomas, whether HHV8-positive or HHV8-negative, usually strongly express [[CD45]]<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/> and in HHV8 cases express HHV8 proteins such as the LANA-1 protein. Primary effusion lymphoma, HH8-negative also differs from PBL in that its plasmablastic cells frequently express certain B-cell marker proteins such as CD20 and CD79a.<ref name=\"pmid31725418\"/> \n\n==== Plasmablastic plasma cell lymphoma ====\nVarious factors distinguish plasmablastic plasma cell lymphoma from PBL. Prior diagnosis of plasma cell lymphoma (i.e. [[multiple myeloma]] or [[plasmacytoma]]), the presence of [[Osteolytic lesion|lytic bone lesions]],<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/> increased levels of serum calcium, renal insufficiency, and anemia, and the presence of a [[myeloma protein]] in the serum and/or urine favor the diagnosis of plasmablastic plasma cell lymphoma rather than plasmablastic myeloma. Ultimately however, the marker proteins expressed by the plasmablastic cells in the two diseases are almost identical and a diagnosis of \"plasmablastic neoplasm, consistent with PBL or multiple myeloma\" may be acceptable according to the current World Health Organization classification.<ref name=\"pmid31725418\"/>       \n\n==== Other B-cell lymphomas ====        \nThe plasmablastic cells in B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse B-cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma generally express CD20 and often express [[CD45]] marker proteins. While PBL plasmablastic cells weakly express CD20 in 10% of cases, the strong expression of CD20 and the expression of CD45 virtually rules out PBL.<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/>\n\n== Treatment and prognosis ==\nThe treatments for PBL have ranged from [[radiotherapy]] for localized disease to various chemotherapy regimens for extensive disease. The chemotherapy regimens have included [[CHOP]] (i.e. [[cyclophosphamide]], [[hydroxydoxorubicin]] (or [[doxorubicin]]), [[vincristine]], and either [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]; CHOP-like regimens (e.g. CHOP plus [[etoposide]]); hyper-CVAD-MA (i.e. cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin,  [[dexamethasone]] and high dose [[methotrexate]] and [[cytarabine]]); CODOX-M/IVAC (i.e. cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate and [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], and high-dose cytarabine); COMB (i.e. cyclophosphamide, [[oncovin]], [[methyl-CCNU]], and [[bleomycin]]); and infusional EPOCH (i.e. etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin). While the experience treating PBL with radiation alone has been limited, patients with localized disease have been treated with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy regimens plus radiotherapy. Overall, patients receiving one of the cited chemotherapy regimens have achieved [[disease-free survival]] and [[overall survival]] rates of 22 and 32 months, respectively. The [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] recommends the more intensive regimens (e.g. hyper-CVAD-MA or infusional EPOCH) to treat the disease. These regimens have attained 5 year overall and disease-free survivals of 38% and 40%, respectively. Too few patients have been treated with [[Hematopoietic stem cell#Autologous|autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant]] in addition to chemotherapy for conclusions to be made.

The abnormalities in gene structures and expressions reported in the Pathophysiology section, particularly rearrangement and/or over expression of the ''MYC'' proto-oncogene, may also be apparent in these cells. The presence of HIV/AIDS or other causes of immuno-incompetence (see previous section), a history of having a low-grade lymphoma, and/or the presence of EVB+ plasmablasts in the disease's lesions would support the diagnosis of PBL.<ref name=\"pmid31725418\"/>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\nVarious lymphomas can exhibit the microscopic appearance, including plasmablastic cells, and presentation of PBL. These lymphomas can usually be differentiated from PBL by further examinations of the plasmablasts for various marker proteins and determining other factors that favor the diagnosis of these lymphomas rather than PBL, as indicated in the following descriptions.   \n\n==== Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma ====\nUnlike PBL, the plasmablastic cells in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma strongly express products of the ''[[ACVRL1]]'' gene, i.e. activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and are not infected with EBV and therefore do not express this virus's EBER or BART RNAs.<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/>\n\n==== Human herpesvirus 8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified ====\nUnlike PBL, the plasmablastic cells in human herpesvirus 8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified express products of herpesvirus 8 (also termed Karposi sarcoma virus) such as [[LANA]]-1 protein. Also unlike PBL, these plasmablastic cells do not express CD30, CD138, CD79a,<ref name=\"pmid31725418\"/> or a clonal [[IgM]] antibody and usually are not EBV-infected and therefore usually do not express this virus's EBER or BART RNAs.<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/>\n\n==== Primary effusion lymphoma ====\nIn contrast to PBL, the plasmablastic cells in primary effusion lymphomas, whether HHV8-positive or HHV8-negative, usually strongly express [[CD45]]<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/> and in HHV8 cases express HHV8 proteins such as the LANA-1 protein. Primary effusion lymphoma, HH8-negative also differs from PBL in that its plasmablastic cells frequently express certain B-cell marker proteins such as CD20 and CD79a.<ref name=\"pmid31725418\"/> \n\n==== Plasmablastic plasma cell lymphoma ====\nVarious factors distinguish plasmablastic plasma cell lymphoma from PBL. Prior diagnosis of plasma cell lymphoma (i.e. [[multiple myeloma]] or [[plasmacytoma]]), the presence of [[Osteolytic lesion|lytic bone lesions]],<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/> increased levels of serum calcium, renal insufficiency, and anemia, and the presence of a [[myeloma protein]] in the serum and/or urine favor the diagnosis of plasmablastic plasma cell lymphoma rather than plasmablastic myeloma. Ultimately however, the marker proteins expressed by the plasmablastic cells in the two diseases are almost identical and a diagnosis of \"plasmablastic neoplasm, consistent with PBL or multiple myeloma\" may be acceptable according to the current World Health Organization classification.<ref name=\"pmid31725418\"/>       \n\n==== Other B-cell lymphomas ====        \nThe plasmablastic cells in B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse B-cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma generally express CD20 and often express [[CD45]] marker proteins. While PBL plasmablastic cells weakly express CD20 in 10% of cases, the strong expression of CD20 and the expression of CD45 virtually rules out PBL.<ref name=\"pmid31494113\"/>\n\n== Treatment and prognosis ==\nThe treatments for PBL have ranged from [[radiotherapy]] for localized disease to various chemotherapy regimens for extensive disease. The chemotherapy regimens have included [[CHOP]] (i.e. [[cyclophosphamide]], [[hydroxydoxorubicin]] (or [[doxorubicin]]), [[vincristine]], and either [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]; CHOP-like regimens (e.g. CHOP plus [[etoposide]]); hyper-CVAD-MA (i.e. cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin,  [[dexamethasone]] and high dose [[methotrexate]] and [[cytarabine]]); CODOX-M/IVAC (i.e. cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate and [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], and high-dose cytarabine), COMB (i.e. cyclophosphamide, [[oncovin]], [[methyl-CCNU]], and [[bleomycin]]); and infusional EPOCH (i.e. etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin). While the experience treating PBL with radiation alone has been limited, patients with localized disease have been treated with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy regimens plus radiotherapy. Overall, patients receiving one of the cited chemotherapy regimens have achieved [[disease-free survival]] and [[overall survival]] rates of 22 and 32 months, respectively. The [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] recommends the more intensive regimens (e.g. hyper-CVAD-MA or infusional EPOCH) to treat the disease. These regimens have attained 5 year overall and disease-free survivals of 38% and 40%, respectively. Too few patients have been treated with [[Hematopoietic stem cell#Autologous|autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant]] in addition to chemotherapy for conclusions to be made. A few patients with HIV/AIDS-related PBL disease who were treated with [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)]] directed against the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (i.e. HIV) have had remissions in their PDL lesions.<ref name=\"pmid31360094\"/>\n\n=== Experimental treatments ===\nGiven the unsatisfactory results of standard chemotherapy regimens, new treatments are being explored for use in PBL.
