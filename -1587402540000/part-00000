For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.\n\nThere is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources. Those requiring metrics associated with OER are often those with economic investment in the technologies needed to access or provide electronic OER, those with economic interests potentially threatened by OER,<ref>{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (Policy implications and recommendations)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=15|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}</ref> or those requiring justification for the costs of implementing and maintaining the infrastructure or access to the freely available OER.

Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).

Few studies have investigated the usage of OER, so it is still not very clear how faculty and student use of OER (enabled by the permission given by an open license) would contribute to student learning.<ref name=\"openedgroup.org\"/> For example, research from the Czech Republic has proved most students said they use OER as often as or more often than classical materials.

Currently, more than 60 students are listed as its members.\n\n== Open Educational Practices ==\nOER have been used in educational contexts in a variety of ways, and researchers and practitioners have proposed different names for such practices. According to Wiley & Hilton (2018),<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> the two popular terms used are \"open pedagogy\" and \"open educational practices\". What these two terms refer to is closely related to each other, often indistinguishable. For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012). ''Exploring the business case for Open Educational Resources''. Vancouver: Commonwealth of Learning. Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies. However, to date there has been limited presentation of concrete data to back up this assertion, which reduces the effectiveness of such arguments and opens the OER movement to justified academic criticism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Institutional support==\nA large part of the early work on open educational resources was funded by universities and foundations such as the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]],<ref name=\"guttenplan\" /> which was the main financial supporter of open educational resources in the early years and has spent more than $110 million in the 2002 to 2010 period, of which more than $14 million went to [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT]].<ref name=\"hafner\" /> The [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], which focuses on projects concerning collaborative content creation, has contributed as well.

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]]. For more, see [[#Licensing and Types of OER|Licensing and Types of OER]] later in this article.\n\nThere is also a tension between entities which find value in quantifying usage of OER and those which see such [[Performance metric|metrics]] as themselves being irrelevant to free and open resources. Those requiring metrics associated with OER are often those with economic investment in the technologies needed to access or provide electronic OER, those with economic interests potentially threatened by OER,<ref>{{cite book|last=(CERI)|first=Center for Educational Research and Innovation|title=Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|year=2007|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)|location=Executive Summary (Policy implications and recommendations)|isbn=978-92-64-03174-6|page=15|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/ceri/38654317.pdf}}</ref> or those requiring justification for the costs of implementing and maintaining the infrastructure or access to the freely available OER.

Many educational resources made available on the Internet are geared to allowing online access to digitised educational content, but the materials themselves are restrictively licensed.  Thus, they are not OER.  Often, this is not intentional.  Most educators are not familiar with copyright law in their own jurisdictions, never mind internationally.  International law and national laws of nearly all nations, and certainly of those who have signed onto the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), restrict all content under strict copyright (unless the copyright owner specifically releases it under an open license).

Few studies have investigated the usage of OER, so it is still not very clear how faculty and student use of OER (enabled by the permission given by an open license) would contribute to student learning.<ref name=\"openedgroup.org\"/> For example, research from the Czech Republic has proved most students said they use OER as often as or more often than classical materials.

Currently, more than 60 students are listed as its members.\n\n== Open Educational Practices ==\nOER have been used in educational contexts in a variety of ways, and researchers and practitioners have proposed different names for such practices. According to Wiley & Hilton (2018),<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> the two popular terms used are \"open pedagogy\" and \"open educational practices\". What these two terms refer to is closely related to each other, often indistinguishable. For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies.

She was the mother of ten children who survived to adulthood, including two kings, [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]].\n\nIn 1031, Matilda was born into the royal family of Flanders. the second daughter of Baldwin V, Sovereign Count of Flanders and Adele of France. The Sovereign Counts of Flanders were a small hereditary monarchy of the independent o sovereign county named Flanders.

Her descent from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] royal [[House of Wessex]] was also to become a useful card. Like many royal marriages of the period, it breached the rules of [[consanguinity]], then at their most restrictive (to seven generations or degrees of relatedness); Matilda and William were third-cousins, once removed. She was about 20 when they married in 1051/2; William was some four years older, and had been [[Duke of Normandy]] since he was about eight (in 1035).  \n\nThe marriage appears to have been successful, and William is not recorded to have had any bastards. Matilda was about 35, and had already borne most of her children, when William embarked on the [[Norman conquest of England]], sailing in his flagship ''[[Mora (ship)|Mora]]'', which Matilda had given him.  She governed the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in his absence, joining him in England only after more than a year, and subsequently returning to Normandy, where she spent most of the remainder of her life, while William was mostly in his new kingdom.  She was about 52 when she died in Normandy in 1083.\n\nApart from governing Normandy and supporting her brother's interests in Flanders, Matilda took a close interest in the education of her children, who were unusually well educated for contemporary royalty. The boys were tutored by the Italian [[Lanfranc]], who was made [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1070, while the girls learned Latin in [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 Abbey]] in [[Caen]], founded by William and Matilda as part of the papal [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] allowing their marriage.\n\n==Marriage==\nMatilda, or Maud, was the daughter of [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders]], and [[Adela of France, Countess of Flanders|Adela]], herself daughter of King [[Robert II of France]].{{sfn|Schwennicke|1984|loc=Tafeln 5, 11, 81}}\n\nAccording to legend, when the Norman duke [[William the Bastard]] (later called ''the Conqueror'') sent his representative to ask for Matilda's hand in marriage, she told the representative that she was far too high-born to consider marrying a [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Matilda's principal attribute was her descent from [[Charlemagne]] and her many royal ancestors, her closest being her grandfather Robert II of France. She was the niece of King [[Henry I of France]], William's suzerain, and at his death in 1060, first cousin to his successor King [[Philip I of France]]. A member of the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] she was closely related to most of the royal families of Europe. A marriage to a member of the (Carolingian) royal family was a means of upward mobility for a soldier or [[Nobility|nobleman]] like William. Her descent from [[Alfred the Great]] (whose daughter [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] was the mother of [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders]], and great-great-great-great-grandmother of Matilda) also proved a legitimizing factor as queen of England.

Naturally, Baldwin took offence at this; but, before they could [[Duel|draw swords]], Matilda settled the matter{{sfn|Hilliam|2004|p=20}} by refusing to marry anyone but William;{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=17}} even a papal ban by [[Pope Leo IX]] at the [[Council of Reims]] on the grounds of [[consanguinity]] did not dissuade her.

Whatever the truth of the matter, years later when she was acting as [[regent]] for her husband William in England, she is said to have used her authority to confiscate Brictric's lands and throw him into prison, where he died.{{sfn|Freeman|1871|pp=761-764}}\n\n==Duchess of Normandy==\nWhen William was preparing to invade England, Matilda outfitted a ship, the ''[[Mora (ship)|Mora]]'', out of her own funds and gave it to him.{{sfn|van Houts|1988|p=166}} Additionally, William gave [[Normandy]] to his wife during his absence. Matilda successfully guided the duchy through this period in the name of her fourteen-year-old son; no major uprisings or unrest occurred.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|pp= 31\u201332}}\n\nEven after William conquered England and became its king, it took her more than a year to visit the kingdom.{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=50}} Despite having been crowned queen, she spent most of her time in Normandy, governing the duchy, supporting her brother's interests in Flanders, and sponsoring ecclesiastic houses there.

Three new phrases were incorporated to cement the importance of queens, stating that they were divinely placed by God, shared in royal power, and blessed her people by her power and virtue.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p= 33}}{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=51}}\n\nFor many years it was thought that she had some involvement in the creation of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (commonly called ''La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde'' in French), but historians no longer believe that; it seems to have been commissioned by William's half-brother [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], and made by English artists in [[Kent]].{{sfn|Norton|2001|p=3}}\n\nMatilda bore William nine or ten children. He was believed to have been faithful to her and never produced a child outside their marriage. Despite her royal duties, Matilda was deeply invested in her children's well-being. All were known for being remarkably educated. Her daughters were educated and taught to read Latin at [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|Sainte-Trinit\u00e9]] in [[Caen]] founded by Matilda and William in response to the recognition of their marriage.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=29}} For her sons, she secured [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] of whom she was an ardent supporter. Both she and William approved of the Archbishop's desire to revitalise the Church.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=37}}\n\nShe stood as godmother for [[Matilda of Scotland]], who would become Queen of England after marrying Matilda's son [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. During the christening, the baby pulled Queen Matilda's headdress down on top of herself, which was seen as an omen that the younger Matilda would be queen some day as well.{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=10}}\n\nMatilda fell ill during the summer of 1083 and died in November 1083. Her husband was present for her final confession.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=39}} William died four years later in 1087.\n\nContrary to the common belief that she was buried at St. Stephen's, also called l'[[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]] in [[Caen]], Normandy, where William was eventually buried, she is entombed in Caen at l'[[Abbaye aux Dames]], which is the community of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9. Of particular interest is the 11th-century slab, a sleek black stone decorated with her epitaph, marking her grave at the rear of the church. In contrast, the grave marker for William's tomb was replaced as recently as the beginning of the 19th century.\n\n==Height==\n\nOver time Matilda's tomb was desecrated and her original coffin destroyed. Her remains were placed in a sealed box and reburied under the original black slab.{{sfn|Dewhurst|1981|pp=271\u2013272}} In 1959 Matilda's incomplete skeleton was examined and her femur and tibia were measured to determine her height using anthropometric methods. Her height was {{convert|5|ft|cm|0}}, a normal female height for the time.{{sfn|Dewhurst|1981|pp=271\u2013272}} However, as a result of this examination she was misreported as being {{convert|4|ft|2|in|cm}}{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=370}} leading to the [[myth]] that she was extremely small.\n\n==Family and children==\nMatilda and William had four sons and at least five daughters.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=393}} The birth order of the boys is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=393}}\n\n# [[Robert Curthose|Robert]], born between 1051 and 1054, died 10 February 1134.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} Duke of Normandy, married [[Sybil of Conversano]], daughter of [[Geoffrey of Conversano]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004}}\n# [[Richard, Duke of Bernay|Richard]], born c. 1054, died around 1075.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}}\n# [[William II of England|William Rufus]], born between 1056 and 1060, died 2 August 1100.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} King of England, killed in the New Forest.\n# [[Henry I of England|Henry]], born late 1068, died 1 December 1135.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} King of England, married [[Edith of Scotland]], daughter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]].

She was the mother of ten children who survived to adulthood, including two kings, [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]].\n\nAs a niece and granddaughter of kings of France, Matilda was of grander birth than William, who was illegitimate, and, according to some suspiciously romantic tales, she initially refused his proposal on this account. Her descent from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] royal [[House of Wessex]] was also to become a useful card. Like many royal marriages of the period, it breached the rules of [[consanguinity]], then at their most restrictive (to seven generations or degrees of relatedness); Matilda and William were third-cousins, once removed. She was about 20 when they married in 1051/2; William was some four years older, and had been [[Duke of Normandy]] since he was about eight (in 1035).  \n\nThe marriage appears to have been successful, and William is not recorded to have had any bastards. Matilda was about 35, and had already borne most of her children, when William embarked on the [[Norman conquest of England]], sailing in his flagship ''[[Mora (ship)|Mora]]'', which Matilda had given him.  She governed the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in his absence, joining him in England only after more than a year, and subsequently returning to Normandy, where she spent most of the remainder of her life, while William was mostly in his new kingdom.  She was about 52 when she died in Normandy in 1083.\n\nApart from governing Normandy and supporting her brother's interests in Flanders, Matilda took a close interest in the education of her children, who were unusually well educated for contemporary royalty. The boys were tutored by the Italian [[Lanfranc]], who was made [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1070, while the girls learned Latin in [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 Abbey]] in [[Caen]], founded by William and Matilda as part of the papal [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] allowing their marriage.\n\n==Marriage==\nMatilda, or Maud, was the daughter of [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders]], and [[Adela of France, Countess of Flanders|Adela]], herself daughter of King [[Robert II of France]].{{sfn|Schwennicke|1984|loc=Tafeln 5, 11, 81}}\n\nAccording to legend, when the Norman duke [[William the Bastard]] (later called ''the Conqueror'') sent his representative to ask for Matilda's hand in marriage, she told the representative that she was far too high-born to consider marrying a [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Matilda's principal attribute was her descent from [[Charlemagne]] and her many royal ancestors, her closest being her grandfather Robert II of France. She was the niece of King [[Henry I of France]], William's suzerain, and at his death in 1060, first cousin to his successor King [[Philip I of France]]. A member of the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] she was closely related to most of the royal families of Europe. A marriage to a member of the (Carolingian) royal family was a means of upward mobility for a soldier or [[Nobility|nobleman]] like William. Her descent from [[Alfred the Great]] (whose daughter [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] was the mother of [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders]], and great-great-great-great-grandmother of Matilda) also proved a legitimizing factor as queen of England. See {{harvnb|Hilton|2010|p=17}}, {{harvnb|Le Jan|2000|p=56|loc=Notes 14, 57}}, {{harvnb|Wareham|2005|p=3}}</ref> After hearing this response, William rode from Normandy to [[Bruges]], found Matilda on her way to church, dragged her off her horse by her long [[braid]]s, threw her down in the street in front of her flabbergasted attendants and rode off.\n\nAnother version of the story states that William rode to Matilda's father's house in [[Lille]], threw her to the ground in her room (again, by her braids) and hit her (or violently battered her) before leaving. Naturally, Baldwin took offence at this; but, before they could [[Duel|draw swords]], Matilda settled the matter{{sfn|Hilliam|2004|p=20}} by refusing to marry anyone but William;{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=17}} even a papal ban by [[Pope Leo IX]] at the [[Council of Reims]] on the grounds of [[consanguinity]] did not dissuade her. William and Matilda were married after a delay in {{circa|1051\u20132}}.{{sfn|Keats-Rohan|1999|p=495}} A papal [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] was finally awarded in 1059 by [[Pope Nicholas II]].{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p= 18}} Lanfranc, at the time prior of [[Bec Abbey]], negotiated the arrangement in Rome and it came only after William and Matilda agreed to found two churches as penance.{{sfn|Bates|1982|p=199}}\n\n==Rumored romances==\nThere were rumours that Matilda had been in love variously with the English ambassador to [[Flanders]] and with the great [[Saxon]] [[thegn]] [[Brictric son of Algar|Brictric, son of Algar]], who (according to the account by the ''Continuator of [[Wace]]'' and others{{sfn|Thorn|Thorn|Morris|1985|loc=Part 2 (notes), 24,21, quoting {{harvnb|Freeman|1871|loc=Appendix, note 0}} }}) in his youth declined her advances.  Whatever the truth of the matter, years later when she was acting as [[regent]] for her husband William in England, she is said to have used her authority to confiscate Brictric's lands and throw him into prison, where he died.{{sfn|Freeman|1871|pp=761-764}}\n\n==Duchess of Normandy==\nWhen William was preparing to invade England, Matilda outfitted a ship, the ''[[Mora (ship)|Mora]]'', out of her own funds and gave it to him.{{sfn|van Houts|1988|p=166}} Additionally, William gave [[Normandy]] to his wife during his absence. Matilda successfully guided the duchy through this period in the name of her fourteen-year-old son; no major uprisings or unrest occurred.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|pp= 31\u201332}}\n\nEven after William conquered England and became its king, it took her more than a year to visit the kingdom.{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=50}} Despite having been crowned queen, she spent most of her time in Normandy, governing the duchy, supporting her brother's interests in Flanders, and sponsoring ecclesiastic houses there. Only one of her children was born in England; [[Henry I of England|Henry]] was born in Yorkshire when Matilda accompanied her husband in the [[Harrying of the North]].{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=35}}\n\n==Queen==\n[[File:Luxembourg - La Reine Mathilde.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{Center|Statue of Matilda of Flanders, one of the twenty [[Reines de France et Femmes illustres]] in the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], Paris, by Carle Elshoecht (1850)}}]]\n[[File:Queen Matilda's grave in the Women's Abbey at Caen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tomb of Matilda of Flanders at [[Abbaye aux Dames]], Caen]]\n[[File:Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne interior (2).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tomb of William of Normandy at [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]], Caen]]\nMatilda was crowned queen on 11 May 1068 in [[Westminster]] during the feast of [[Pentecost]], in a ceremony presided over by the [[Ealdred (bishop)|archbishop of York]]. Three new phrases were incorporated to cement the importance of queens, stating that they were divinely placed by God, shared in royal power, and blessed her people by her power and virtue.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p= 33}}{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=51}}\n\nFor many years it was thought that she had some involvement in the creation of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (commonly called ''La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde'' in French), but historians no longer believe that; it seems to have been commissioned by William's half-brother [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], and made by English artists in [[Kent]].{{sfn|Norton|2001|p=3}}\n\nMatilda bore William nine or ten children. He was believed to have been faithful to her and never produced a child outside their marriage. Despite her royal duties, Matilda was deeply invested in her children's well-being. All were known for being remarkably educated. Her daughters were educated and taught to read Latin at [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|Sainte-Trinit\u00e9]] in [[Caen]] founded by Matilda and William in response to the recognition of their marriage.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=29}} For her sons, she secured [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] of whom she was an ardent supporter. Both she and William approved of the Archbishop's desire to revitalise the Church.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=37}}\n\nShe stood as godmother for [[Matilda of Scotland]], who would become Queen of England after marrying Matilda's son [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. During the christening, the baby pulled Queen Matilda's headdress down on top of herself, which was seen as an omen that the younger Matilda would be queen some day as well.{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=10}}\n\nMatilda fell ill during the summer of 1083 and died in November 1083. Her husband was present for her final confession.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=39}} William died four years later in 1087.\n\nContrary to the common belief that she was buried at St. Stephen's, also called l'[[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]] in [[Caen]], Normandy, where William was eventually buried, she is entombed in Caen at l'[[Abbaye aux Dames]], which is the community of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9. Of particular interest is the 11th-century slab, a sleek black stone decorated with her epitaph, marking her grave at the rear of the church. In contrast, the grave marker for William's tomb was replaced as recently as the beginning of the 19th century.\n\n==Height==\n\nOver time Matilda's tomb was desecrated and her original coffin destroyed. Her remains were placed in a sealed box and reburied under the original black slab.{{sfn|Dewhurst|1981|pp=271\u2013272}} In 1959 Matilda's incomplete skeleton was examined and her femur and tibia were measured to determine her height using anthropometric methods. Her height was {{convert|5|ft|cm|0}}, a normal female height for the time.{{sfn|Dewhurst|1981|pp=271\u2013272}} However, as a result of this examination she was misreported as being {{convert|4|ft|2|in|cm}}{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=370}} leading to the [[myth]] that she was extremely small.\n\n==Family and children==\nMatilda and William had four sons and at least five daughters.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=393}} The birth order of the boys is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=393}}\n\n# [[Robert Curthose|Robert]], born between 1051 and 1054, died 10 February 1134.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} Duke of Normandy, married [[Sybil of Conversano]], daughter of [[Geoffrey of Conversano]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004}}\n# [[Richard, Duke of Bernay|Richard]], born c. 1054, died around 1075.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}}\n# [[William II of England|William Rufus]], born between 1056 and 1060, died 2 August 1100.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} King of England, killed in the New Forest.\n# [[Henry I of England|Henry]], born late 1068, died 1 December 1135.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} King of England, married [[Edith of Scotland]], daughter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]].
