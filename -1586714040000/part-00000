It was released on June 20, 2003 through [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]]. During the recording of [[Destiny's Child]]'s third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001), the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released. Recording sessions for the album took place from March 2002 to March 2003 at several studios, during the hiatus of her then-group Destiny's Child. As executive producer of the album, Beyonc\u00e9 took a wider role in its production, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks.\n\nThe tracks in the album are a mixture of uptempo songs and [[ballad]]s, which are basically [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] songs; it also features elements of [[soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Arabic music]]. Although Beyonc\u00e9 remained discreet about her interpretation of the songs, its underlying meanings were attributed by music writers as an allusion to her intimate relationship with then-boyfriend and well-known rapper [[Jay-Z]]. ''Dangerously in Love'' received positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]] upon its release, with critics praising Knowles' \"artistic leap\". The album also received numerous accolades, earning Beyonc\u00e9 five [[Grammy Award]]s at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] on February 8, 2004.\n\n''Dangerously in Love'' reached international commercial success, earning [[music recording sales certification|multi-platinum certifications]] in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 317,000 copies in its first week, earning Beyonc\u00e9 the highest debut sales among Destiny's Child members' solo albums. ''Dangerously in Love'' has sold over 11 million copies worldwide<ref name=\"rapfix\" /> and produced two US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles\u2013\"[[Crazy in Love]]\" and \"[[Baby Boy (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Baby Boy]]\", as well as two top five singles\u2013\"[[Me, Myself and I (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Me, Myself and I]]\" and \"[[Naughty Girl (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Naughty Girl]]\".\n\n==Background==\nBeyonc\u00e9 launched her career as lead singer to [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] group [[Destiny's Child]] in the late 1990s. According to Corey Moss of [[MTV News]], \"fans are eager to see\" how Beyonc\u00e9, after years with the group, performs solo.<ref name=\"1Corey\">{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Beyonc\u00e9: Genuinely In Love \u2013 Part 1 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/news_feature_062703/ |publisher=[[MTV News]].

In addition, Beyonc\u00e9 admitted that there are songs about love-making.<ref name=\"1Tyrangiel\" /> The personal content of the album, however, was not generally attributed to Beyonc\u00e9's own experiences\u2014although some were based from hers\u2014instead, the theme kept recurring in her mind. Beyonc\u00e9 later explained: \"I wanted to have an album that everyone could relate to and would listen to as long as I'm alive and even after... Love is something that never goes out of style. It's something everybody experiences, and if they are not in love, people usually want to feel that...\"<ref name=\"1Corey\" /> While some songs merely focus on the \"beauty of love\", the album also explores another side of love, with songs that \"celebrate breakup\" and songs that narrate a woman's desire to have a degree of control in a relationship.<ref name=\"1Corey\" /> The album's hidden track, \"Daddy\", is a tribute to Beyonc\u00e9's father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who fronted Destiny's Child as their manager. The song is an account of Beyonc\u00e9 wanting her future husband and child to possess qualities similar to her father's.<ref name=\"2Corey\" /> Originally, Beyonc\u00e9 did not intend to include the track in the album, having thought its lyrics would make her appear immature.

It was released on June 20, 2003 through [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]]. During the recording of [[Destiny's Child]]'s third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001), the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released. Recording sessions for the album took place from March 2002 to March 2003 at several studios, during the hiatus of her then-group Destiny's Child. As executive producer of the album, Beyonc\u00e9 took a wider role in its production, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks.\n\nThe tracks in the album are a mixture of uptempo songs and [[ballad]]s, which are basically [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] songs; it also features elements of [[soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Arabic music]]. Although Beyonc\u00e9 remained discreet about her interpretation of the songs, its underlying meanings were attributed by music writers as an allusion to her intimate relationship with then-boyfriend and well-known rapper [[Jay-Z]]. ''Dangerously in Love'' received positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]] upon its release, with critics praising Knowles' \"artistic leap\". The album also received numerous accolades, earning Beyonc\u00e9 five [[Grammy Award]]s at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] on February 8, 2004.\n\n''Dangerously in Love'' reached international commercial success, earning [[music recording sales certification|multi-platinum certifications]] in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 317,000 copies in its first week, earning Beyonc\u00e9 the highest debut sales among Destiny's Child members' solo albums.

It's something everybody experiences, and if they are not in love, people usually want to feel that...\"<ref name=\"1Corey\" /> While some songs merely focus on the \"beauty of love\", the album also explores another side of love, with songs that \"celebrate breakup\" and songs that narrate a woman's desire to have a degree of control in a relationship.<ref name=\"1Corey\" /> The album's hidden track, \"Daddy\", is a tribute to Beyonc\u00e9's father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who fronted Destiny's Child as their manager.

Patrons protected individual clients from the tax collector and other public obligations. In return, clients gave them money or services. Some clients even surrendered ownership of their land to their patron. The emperors were unable to prevent this type of patronage effectively.<ref>Oxford Classical Dictionary \"patronus\"</ref>\n\n==''Patronus'' and ''libertus''==\nWhen a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] was [[manumission|manumitted]], the former owner became their patron. The [[freedman]] ''(libertus)'' had social obligations to their patron, which might involve campaigning on their behalf if the patron ran for election, doing requested jobs or errands, or continuing a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|sexual relationship that began in servitude]]. In return, the patron was expected to ensure a certain degree of material security for their client. Allowing one's clients to become [[destitute]] or entangled in unjust legal proceedings would reflect poorly on the patron and diminish their prestige.\n\n==Organizations and communities==\nIn the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133\u201349 BC)|late Republic]], patronage served as a model<ref>Cicero, ''De officiis'' 1.35.</ref> when conquerors or [[Roman governor|governors]] abroad established personal ties as patron to whole communities, ties which then might be perpetuated as a family obligation.<ref>[[Erich S.

The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]].

The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]]. Therefore, there were previously unsuccessful attempts to propose an extension to Changi Airport.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT Link to Airport: Not in next 10 years|date=17 May 1991|work=The Straits Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=No MRT Line to Changi yet|date=20 March 1992|work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of extending the Mass Rapid Transit system to Changi Airport was reconsidered when Terminal 3 was being built.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT extension to airport reconsidered.|date=2 August 1994|work=The Straits Times}}</ref> The earlier plans had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing [[East West MRT line|East West line]] at [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]],<ref>{{Cite news|title=Next Stop:Changi Airport?|date=2 August 1994|work=The New Paper}}</ref> with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment up to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back towards the city along the east coast of the island.

The final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely [[Expo MRT station|Expo]], and the Changi Airport station, the underground station built between Terminal 2 and [[Changi Airport Terminal 3|Terminal 3]].

King Ferdinand called for the mobilization of the Romanian army and ordered it to attack by crossing the [[Carpathian Mountains]] into [[Transylvania]]. The end of World War I that soon followed did not bring an end to  fighting for the Romanian army. Its action continued into 1918 and 1919 in the Hungarian\u2013Romanian war.\n\n== November 1918 \u2013 March 1919 ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nFollowing the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest, the bulk of the Romanian Army was demobilized. Only the 9th and 10th infantry divisions and the 1st and 2nd [[cavalry]] divisions were at full strength. However, those units were engaged in the protection of [[Bessarabia]] against the Bolshevik Soviet Russians. The 1st, 7th and 8th [[Huntsmen (military)|V\u00e2n\u0103tori]] divisions, stationed in [[Moldavia]], were the first units to be mobilized. The 8th was sent to [[Bukovina]] and the other two were sent to Transylvania. On 13 November, the 7th entered Transylvania at the [[Pris\u0103cani River]] in the eastern Carpathians. The 1st then entered Transylvania at [[Palanca, Bac\u0103u]].<ref>Mardarescu G.D.

This was a demarcation line agreed upon by the representatives of the Allied powers and Hungary at the Armistice of Belgrade. At the same time units of the German army, under the command of Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], retreated to the west.\n\nFollowing a request from Romania, the Allied Command in the east under the leadership of French Genenral [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]] allowed the Romanian army to advance to the line of the western Carpathians. The 7th V\u00e2n\u0103tori division advanced in the direction of [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsv\u00e1r]]. The 1st division advanced in the direction of [[Alba-Iulia|Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]. On 24 December, units of the Romanian Army entered Kolozsv\u00e1r. By 22 January 1919, the Romanian army controlled all the territory to the Maros River. The 7th and 1st divisions were spread thin, so the 2nd Division was sent to [[Sibiu|Nagyszeben]] and the 6th Division to Brass\u00f3 ([[Bra\u015fov]]). Two new infantry divisions, the 16th and 18th, were formed from Romanian soldiers previously mobilized in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. A unified command of the Romanian army in Transylvania was established. Its headquarters were at Nagyszeben, with Gen. [[Traian Mo\u015foiu]] in command. Although Romania controlled new territories, it did not encompass all the ethnic Romanian population in the region.\n\nOn 28 February 1919, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the council of the Allied nations notified Hungary of a new demarcation line to which the Romanian army would advance. This line coincided with railways connecting [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. However, the Romanian army was not to enter these cities. A demilitarized zone was to be created, extending from the new demarcation line to {{convert|5|km}} beyond the line. The demilitarized zone represented the extent of Romanian territorial requests on Hungary. The retreat of the Hungarian army behind the western border of the demilitarized zone was to begin on 22 March.\n\nOn 19 March, Hungary received notification of the new demarcation line and demilitarized zone from French Lieutenant Colonel Fernand Vix (the \"Vix note\"). The K\u00e1rolyi government would not accept the terms and this was a trigger for the coup d'\u00e9tat by [[B\u00e9la Kun]], who formed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. Around this time limited skirmishes took place between Romanian and Hungarian troops. Some Hungarian elements engaged in the harassment of the Romanian population outside the area controlled by the Romanian Army.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\">Kiritescu C.

The Romanian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference asked that the Romanian army be allowed to oust Kun's communist government in Hungary. The Allied council was aware of the communist danger to Romania. However, there was a climate of dissension in the council among U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] about guarantees required by [[France]] on its borders with Germany. In particular, the American delegation was convinced that French hardliners around Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] were trying to initiate a new conflict with Germany and the Soviet Union. The Allied council did try to defuse the situation between Romania and Hungary.\n\nOn 4 April, South African General [[Jan Smuts]] was sent to Hungary. He carried the proposition that the Hungarian communist government under Kun abide by the conditions previously presented to K\u00e1rolyi in the Vix note. Smuts' mission also represented official recognition of the Kun communist government by the Allied council. He may have asked if Kun would act as a conduit for communication between the Allied council and the Bolshevik Soviet Russians.<ref>Read A.

Kun refused the terms, demanding that  Romanian forces return to the line of the Maros River. Smuts' negotiations ceased.\n\nKun stalled for time{{how|date=July 2017}} in order to build a force capable of fighting Romania and Czechoslovakia. Hungary had 20,000 troops facing the Romanian army and mobilized a further 60,000. There were recruitment centers in towns such as [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]], [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], [[Debrecen]], and [[Szolnok]]. There were some elite units and officers from the former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], but there were also volunteers with little training. The Hungarian troops were equipped with 137 cannons and five armored trains. They were motivated by [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments rather than communist ideals. Kun hoped that the Soviet Union would attack Romania from the east.\n\nWhen Kun declined the terms of the Vix note, Romania acted to enforce the new railway demarcation line.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\"/>{{rp|p. 550.}} The Romanian army in Transylvania included 64 infantry battalions, 28 cavalry squadrons, 160 cannons, 32 howitzers, one armored train, two air squadrons and two pioneer battalions, one north and one south. General [[Gheorghe M\u0103rd\u0103rescu]] commanded the Romanian army in Transylvania. The commander of the north battalion was General Mo\u015foiu. Romania planned to take an offensive action on 16 April 1919. The north battalion was to take [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]] and [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]]. This would separate the elite Hungarian [[Sz\u00e9kely]] division from the rest of the Hungarian army. The north battalion would then outflank the Hungarian Army. Simultaneously, the south battalion would advance to [[Lipova, Arad|M\u00e1riaradna]] and [[Beiu\u015f|Bel\u00e9nyes]].\n\n== Hostilities begin ==\n\n=== Foreign policy scandal: the establishment of Slovak Soviet Republic ===\n\nIn late May, after the Entente military representative demanded more territorial concessions from Hungary, Kun attempted to \"fulfill\" his promise to adhere to Hungary's historical borders.

The Hungarian Red Army achieved some military success early on: under the leadership of Colonel Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld, it ousted Czech troops from the north, and planned to march against the Romanian army in the east.\n\nKun ordered the preparation of an [[Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak War|offensive against Czechoslovakia]], which would increase his domestic support by making good on his promise to restore Hungary's borders. The Hungarian Army recruited men between 19\u201325 years of age. Industrial workers from Budapest volunteered. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers re-enlisted for patriotic reasons. The Hungarian army moved its 1st and 5th artillery divisions\u201440 battalions\u2014to [[Upper Hungary]].\n\nOn 20 May 1919, a force under Colonel [[Aur\u00e9l Stromfeld]] attacked and routed Czech troops from [[Miskolc]]. The Romanian Army attacked the Hungarian flank with troops from the 16th Infantry Division and the Second V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division, aiming to maintain contact with the Czech army. Hungarian troops prevailed and the Romanian army retreated to its bridgehead at [[Tokaj]]. There, between 25\u201330 May, Romanian forces were required to defend their position against Hungarian attacks.\n\nOn 3 June, Romania was forced into further retreat but extended its line of defence along the Tisza River and reinforced its position with the 8th Division, which had been moving forward from [[Bukovina]] since 22 May. Hungary then controlled the territory to its [[Kingdom of Hungary|old borders]]; regained control of industrial areas around [[Miskolc]], [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]], [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica|Selmecb\u00e1nya]], [[Ko\u0161ice|Kassa]].\n\n===Demoralization of the Red Army===\nDespite promises for the restoration of the former borders of Hungary, the communists declared the establishment of the [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] in [[Pre\u0161ov]] (Eperjes) on 16 June 1919.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jack A.

They established two concentric defense lines extending from the Tisza River around Szolnok. Between 29 April and 1 May, the Romanian Army broke through these lines. On the evening of 1 May the entire east bank of the Tisza River was under the control of the Romanian army.\n\nOn 30 April, French Foreign Minister [[St\u00e9phen Pichon]] summoned [[Ion I.C.

The unification act that brought these lands within the modern Romanian state was not recognized by Bolshevik Soviet Russia, but it was occupied with fighting the [[White movement]], [[Poland]] and the Ukraine in [[Ukrainian War of Independence|its war for independence]], and resources were not available to challenge Romania. The Bolshevik Soviet Russians might have used Ukrainian paramilitary leader [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] to challenge Romania, but circumstances for this plan did not prove favorable.\n\nPrior to communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia had engaged [[Odessa Soviet Republic]] to invade Romania. Odessa made sporadic attacks across the [[Dniester]] River in order to reclaim territory from the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. The [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was also used in this way. Romania successfully repelled these incursions. After the commencement of communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia pressured Romania with ultimatums and threats of war. Although a Romanian army division and some other newly formed units were moved from the Hungarian front to Bessarabia, these threats did not deter Romania's actions in Hungary.\n\nOn 9 February 1918, the Central Powers and Ukraine signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which recognised Ukraine as a neutral and independent state. Incursions into Romanian territory ceased. From January\u2013May 1919, there were some further limited actions by the Bolshevik Soviet Russians against Romania. In late January the Ukrainian army under Bolshevik Soviet Russian command moved towards [[Zbruch]]. Ukrainian forces took [[Khotyn]], a town that had been occupied by Romania since 10 November 1918. Ukrainian forces held Khotyn for a few days before being routed by the Romanian army.\n\nAt the time Bolshevik Soviet Russia was fending off attacks by the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] led by [[Anton Denikin]]. Three French and two Greek army divisions under General d'Anselme, with support from Polish, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, attacked Bolshevik Soviet Russia near [[Odessa]]. On 21 March 1919, in support of the allied attack, Romanian troops of the 39th Regiment occupied [[Tiraspol]].\n\nIn April, at Berzov, the Bolshevik Soviet Russian 3rd Army defeated d'Anselme's forces, which retreated towards Odessa. In late April a change in government in France led to withdrawal of the Allied forces from Odessa. The troops left by ship, abandoning some heavy equipment. Some troops, with Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, retreated through southern Bessarabia. At the same time the Romanian army fortified its positions in Bessarabia.\n\nOn 1 May, Bolshevik Soviet Russian Foreign Minister [[Georgy Chicherin]] issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government. Romania was ordered to leave Bessarabia. Under the command of [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], Bolshevik Soviet Russian troops gathered along the Dniester River in preparation for a large attack on Bessarabia on 10 May. Bolshevik Soviet Russian attacks in Bessarabia intensified, peaking on 27\u201328 May with an action at [[Tighina]]. In preparation for this attack, the Bolshevik Soviet Russians threw manifestos from a plane, inviting Allied troops to fraternize with them. Sixty French soldiers crossed the Dniester River to support the Russians. The Bolshevik Soviet Russian forces entered Tighina and held the town for a number of hours.\n\nThe Romanian Army's 4th and 5th infantry divisions were moved to Bessarabia. In southern Bessarabia a territorial command unit formed by the Romanian Army's 15th Infantry Division was established. By the end of June tensions in the area had eased.\n\n== July 1919 \u2013 August 1919 ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Allied council was deeply displeased by the Romanian advance to the Tisza River. Some {{who|date=July 2017}} blamed Romania for the loss of Hungary to communist rule. The Allied council asked Romania to retreat to the first railway demarcation line and commence negotiations with the Kun government. Romania persisted at the Tisza line. The Allied council pressured Hungary to stop its incursions into Czechoslovakia, threatening a coordinated action against Hungary by French, Serb and Romanian forces from the south and the east. However, the Allied council also promised favor to Hungary in subsequent peace negotiations in delineating Hungary's new borders. On 12 June, the Allied council discussed Hungary's proposed new borders with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.\n\nOn 23 June, Hungary signed an armistice with Czechoslovakia. By 4 July, the Hungarian Army had retreated 15&nbsp;km south of the Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak demarcation line. The Allied council demanded that Romania leave [[Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal]] and respect the new borders. Romania said it would only do so after the Hungarian Army demobilized. Kun said he would continue to depend on the might of his army. On 11 July, the Allied council ordered Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] to prepare a coordinated attack against Hungary using Serb, French and Romanian forces. Hungary, in turn, prepared for action along the Tisza River.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA563 ''World War I: A\u2013D.''] ABC-CLIO 2005. vol&nbsp;1. p.&nbsp;563.</ref>\n\nThe Romanian army faced the Hungarian army along the Tisza River front line over a distance of {{convert|250|km}}.

Commanders of small units were experienced soldiers. The Hungarian Army mustered 100 infantry battalions (50,000 men), ten cavalry squadrons (1365 men), 69 artillery batteries of calibers up to 305&nbsp;mm and nine armored trains. The troops were organized into three groups: north, central and south. The central group was the strongest.\n\nHungary planned to cross the Tisza River with all three groups. The north group would advance towards [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], the central group to [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and the south group to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. The aim was to ignite a communist uprising in Romania and incite [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Soviet Russia]] to attack Bessarabia.\n\n=== Romanian Army in July 1919 ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Romanian Army was composed of 92 battalions (48,000 men), 58 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men), 80 artillery batteries of calibers up to 155&nbsp;mm, two armored trains and some support units. They were positioned along three lines. The first line was manned by the 16th Division in the north and the 18th Division in the south. More powerful units manned the second line: the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the north, concentrated in and around Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, and the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the south, concentrated in and around B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba.\n\nThe third line was manned by Romania's strongest units: the 1st and 6th infantry divisions, the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and support units. The third line lay on the railway from [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]], through [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and north of Arad. The 20th and 21st infantry divisions were tasked with maintaining public order behind the third line. The first line was thin, as it was supposed to fight delaying actions until the true intentions of the attacking Hungarian army were revealed. After that, together with troops in the second line, the first line was to be held until troops in the third line could mount a counterattack. The Romanian command planned to use the railways under its control to move troops. The Romanian soldier was usually a World War I veteran.\n\n=== Hungarian offensive ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919, battle of Tisza - English.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Operations of the Hungarian and Romanian armies during the battle of the Tisza River in July 1919.]]\nFrom 17\u201320 July, the Hungarian army bombarded the Romanian positions and conducted reconnaissance operations. On 20 July, at about 3&nbsp;a.m., after a fierce bombardment, Hungarian infantry including all three groups crossed the Tisza River and attacked Romanian positions. On 20 July, in the northern arena, the Hungarians army [[Rakamaz]] and some nearby villages. Troops of the Romanian 16th and 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori divisions took back the villages shortly and regained Rakamaz the next day. The Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by artillery fire, retook Rakamaz and two nearby villages but could not break out of the Rakamaz bridgehead.\n\nHungarian forces attempted to outflank the Romanian positions by crossing the Tisza River at [[Tiszaf\u00fcred]] with troops of the 80th International Brigade. There they were halted by troops of the Romanian 16th Division. On 24 July, the Romanian 20th Infantry Division, brought in as reinforcements, cleared the bridgehead at Tiszaf\u00fcred. Not being able to break out of Rakamaz, Hungarian forces fortified their positions and redeployed some troops. There was a lull in fighting in the north, as the Romanian troops did the same. On 26 July, the Romanians attacked, and by 10&nbsp;p.m. had cleared the Rakamaz bridgehead. This left the Romanian army in control of the northern part of the Tisza's eastern bank.\n\nIn the southern area, during a two-day battle, the Hungarian 2nd Division took Szentes from the 89th and 90th regiments of the Romanian 18th Division. On 21\u201322 July, [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] changed hands several times between Hungarian and Romanian troops of the 90th Infantry Regiment supported by the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Romanian forces reoccupied H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, [[Szentes]] and [[Mindszent]]. The Romanians controlled the eastern bank of the Tisza River in this sector, which allowed the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade to move to the center. On 20 July, Hungarian forces established a solid bridgehead on the east bank of the Tisza at [[Szolnok]], opposed by the Romanian 91st Regiment of the 18th Infantry Division. The Hungarian army moved the 6th and 7th divisions across the Tisza River, formed up within the bridgehead, then attacked the Romanians in the first line of defense. The Hungarian 6th Infantry Division took [[T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s]]; the 7th Division advanced towards [[Mez\u0151t\u00far]] and the 5th Division advanced towards [[T\u00farkeve]].\n\nOn 22 July, Hungarian forces crossed the Tisza River at a point {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Szolnok and took [[Kunhegyes]] from the Romanian 18th V\u00e2n\u0103tori Regiment. The Romanian 18th Division was reinforced with units from the second line, including some troops from the 1st Cavalry Division and the entire 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Hungarian forces took T\u00farkeve and Mez\u0151t\u00far. The Hungarian army controlled an area {{convert|80|km|mi}} in length along the bank of the Tisza River and {{convert|60|km|mi}} in depth to the east of the Tisza River at Szolnok. The Romanian army undertook manoeuvres to the north of this Hungarian territory. Gen. Davidoglu,  commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division, formed closest to the river. Gen. Obogeanu, commanding the 1st Infantry Division, formed in the center and Gen. Olteanu, commanding the 6th Infantry Division, formed furthest to the east.\n\n=== Romanian counterattack ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nOn 24 July, the Romanian Army's northern maneuver group attacked. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry Division, supported by troops of the 18th Infantry Division, took [[Kunhegyes]]. The Romanian 1st Infantry Division attacked the Hungarian 6th Infantry Division and took [[Fegyvernek]]. The Romanian 6th Ddivision was less successful, being counterattacked on the left flank by the Hungarian reserve formations. Altogether, the attack pushed back the Hungarian army {{convert|20|km|mi}}. Romanian forces were supported by the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division and some cavalry units when they became available.\n\nOn 25 July, fighting continued. Hungarian forces counterattacked at Fegyvernek, engaging the Romanian 1st Infantry Division. With their lines breaking, Hungarian troops began a retreat towards the Tisza River bridge at Szolnok. On 26 July, Hungarian forces destroyed the bridge. By the end of that day the east bank of the Tisza River was once again under Romanian control.\n\n=== Romanian forces cross the Tisza River ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 32.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Troops from the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division crossing the Tisza River in the presence of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie.]]\n[[File:Tropas-rumanas-ocupan-budapest-1919--outlawsdiary02tormuoft.png|250px|thumb|right|Romanian troops entering Budapest.]]\nAfter repelling the Hungarian attack, the Romanian army prepared to cross the Tisza River. The 7th Infantry Division returned from Bessarabia. The 2nd Infantry Division and some smaller infantry and artillery units also returned. The Romanian army massed 119 battalions (84,000 men), 99 artillery batteries with 392 guns and 60 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men). Hungarian forces continued an artillery bombardment.\n\nFrom 27\u201329 July, the Romanian Army tested the strength of the Hungarian defense with small attacks. A plan was made to cross the Tisza River near Fegyvernek, where it makes a turn. On the night of 29\u201330 July, the Romanian Army crossed the Tisza River. Decoy operations were mounted at other points along the river, bringing intense artillery duels. Romanian forces held the element of surprise.

On 3 August, under the command of Gen. Rusescu, three squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Brigade entered Budapest. Until midday on 4 August, 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns held Budapest. Then the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the city and a parade was held through the city center in front of the commander, General Mo\u015foiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary and stopped at [[Gy\u0151r]].\n\nThe incursion of Romania into Hungary caused the heaviest fighting of the war. The Romanian army casualties were 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers&nbsp;\u2013 39 officers and 1,730 soldiers killed, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded, and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing in action. As of 8 August, the Romanians had captured 1,235 Hungarian officers and 40,000 soldiers, seized 350 guns\u2014including two with a caliber of 305&nbsp;mm\u2014332 machine guns, 52,000 rifles and 87 airplanes.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianSoldiersFeedingCiviliansInBudapest.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian soldiers feeding the civilian population in Hungary.]]\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 36.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian infantry patrol in Budapest.]]\nOn 2 August, Kun fled Hungary towards the Austrian border and eventually reached the Soviet Union.

Two new infantry divisions, the 16th and 18th, were formed from Romanian soldiers previously mobilized in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. A unified command of the Romanian army in Transylvania was established. Its headquarters were at Nagyszeben, with Gen. [[Traian Mo\u015foiu]] in command. Although Romania controlled new territories, it did not encompass all the ethnic Romanian population in the region.\n\nOn 28 February 1919, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the council of the Allied nations notified Hungary of a new demarcation line to which the Romanian army would advance.

A demilitarized zone was to be created, extending from the new demarcation line to {{convert|5|km}} beyond the line.

The retreat of the Hungarian army behind the western border of the demilitarized zone was to begin on 22 March.\n\nOn 19 March, Hungary received notification of the new demarcation line and demilitarized zone from French Lieutenant Colonel Fernand Vix (the \"Vix note\").

The Allied council was aware of the communist danger to Romania. However, there was a climate of dissension in the council among U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] about guarantees required by [[France]] on its borders with Germany. In particular, the American delegation was convinced that French hardliners around Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] were trying to initiate a new conflict with Germany and the Soviet Union.

He carried the proposition that the Hungarian communist government under Kun abide by the conditions previously presented to K\u00e1rolyi in the Vix note.

There were some elite units and officers from the former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], but there were also volunteers with little training. The Hungarian troops were equipped with 137 cannons and five armored trains. They were motivated by [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments rather than communist ideals. Kun hoped that the Soviet Union would attack Romania from the east.\n\nWhen Kun declined the terms of the Vix note, Romania acted to enforce the new railway demarcation line.<ref name=\"Kiritescu 1923\"/>{{rp|p. 550.}} The Romanian army in Transylvania included 64 infantry battalions, 28 cavalry squadrons, 160 cannons, 32 howitzers, one armored train, two air squadrons and two pioneer battalions, one north and one south.

Romania planned to take an offensive action on 16 April 1919. The north battalion was to take [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]] and [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]].

On 25\u201326 April, after some heavy fighting, B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba fell to Romanian forces. The Hungarians retreated to [[Szolnok]] and from there across the Tisza River. They established two concentric defense lines extending from the Tisza River around Szolnok. Between 29 April and 1 May, the Romanian Army broke through these lines. On the evening of 1 May the entire east bank of the Tisza River was under the control of the Romanian army.\n\nOn 30 April, French Foreign Minister [[St\u00e9phen Pichon]] summoned [[Ion I.C. Br\u0103tianu]], the Romanian representative to the Paris Peace Conference. Romania was told to cease its advance at the Tisza River and retreat to the first demarcation line imposed by the Allied council. Br\u0103tianu promised that Romanian troops would not cross the Tisza River. On 2 May, Hungary [[suing for peace|sued for peace]] via a request delivered by his representative, Lieutenant Colonel [[Henrik Werth]]. Kun was prepared to recognize all of Romania's territorial demands; requested the cessation of hostilities; and asked for ongoing control of Hungarian internal affairs.\n\nRomania offered an armistice but this was given only under pressure from the Allied council. Gen. Mo\u015foiu became the governor of the military district between the Romanian border and the Tisza River. Gen.  Mih\u0103escu became commander of the north battalion. The 7th Division was moved to the Russian front in Moldavia.\n\n\n[[Image:Nepkoztarsasag.png|thumb|upright=1.4|{{legend-line|black solid 4px|Borders in 1918}}{{legend-line|black solid 2px|Borders in 1919, 1920}}{{legend|#996600|Occupied by Romania in April 1919}}{{legend|#D00000|Controlled by the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]}}{{legend|#FF9999|Recovered by the Hungarian Soviet Republic}}{{legend|#009999|Under French and Yugoslav control}}]]\n\n=== Incursions by Bolshevik Soviet Russia ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nThe [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania]] was signed on 9 April 1918. The unification act that brought these lands within the modern Romanian state was not recognized by Bolshevik Soviet Russia, but it was occupied with fighting the [[White movement]], [[Poland]] and the Ukraine in [[Ukrainian War of Independence|its war for independence]], and resources were not available to challenge Romania. The Bolshevik Soviet Russians might have used Ukrainian paramilitary leader [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] to challenge Romania, but circumstances for this plan did not prove favorable.\n\nPrior to communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia had engaged [[Odessa Soviet Republic]] to invade Romania. Odessa made sporadic attacks across the [[Dniester]] River in order to reclaim territory from the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. The [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was also used in this way. Romania successfully repelled these incursions. After the commencement of communist rule in Hungary, Bolshevik Soviet Russia pressured Romania with ultimatums and threats of war. Although a Romanian army division and some other newly formed units were moved from the Hungarian front to Bessarabia, these threats did not deter Romania's actions in Hungary.\n\nOn 9 February 1918, the Central Powers and Ukraine signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which recognised Ukraine as a neutral and independent state. Incursions into Romanian territory ceased. From January\u2013May 1919, there were some further limited actions by the Bolshevik Soviet Russians against Romania. In late January the Ukrainian army under Bolshevik Soviet Russian command moved towards [[Zbruch]]. Ukrainian forces took [[Khotyn]], a town that had been occupied by Romania since 10 November 1918. Ukrainian forces held Khotyn for a few days before being routed by the Romanian army.\n\nAt the time Bolshevik Soviet Russia was fending off attacks by the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] led by [[Anton Denikin]]. Three French and two Greek army divisions under General d'Anselme, with support from Polish, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, attacked Bolshevik Soviet Russia near [[Odessa]]. On 21 March 1919, in support of the allied attack, Romanian troops of the 39th Regiment occupied [[Tiraspol]].\n\nIn April, at Berzov, the Bolshevik Soviet Russian 3rd Army defeated d'Anselme's forces, which retreated towards Odessa. In late April a change in government in France led to withdrawal of the Allied forces from Odessa. The troops left by ship, abandoning some heavy equipment. Some troops, with Ukrainian and Russian volunteers, retreated through southern Bessarabia. At the same time the Romanian army fortified its positions in Bessarabia.\n\nOn 1 May, Bolshevik Soviet Russian Foreign Minister [[Georgy Chicherin]] issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government. Romania was ordered to leave Bessarabia. Under the command of [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], Bolshevik Soviet Russian troops gathered along the Dniester River in preparation for a large attack on Bessarabia on 10 May. Bolshevik Soviet Russian attacks in Bessarabia intensified, peaking on 27\u201328 May with an action at [[Tighina]]. In preparation for this attack, the Bolshevik Soviet Russians threw manifestos from a plane, inviting Allied troops to fraternize with them. Sixty French soldiers crossed the Dniester River to support the Russians. The Bolshevik Soviet Russian forces entered Tighina and held the town for a number of hours.\n\nThe Romanian Army's 4th and 5th infantry divisions were moved to Bessarabia. In southern Bessarabia a territorial command unit formed by the Romanian Army's 15th Infantry Division was established. By the end of June tensions in the area had eased.\n\n== July 1919 \u2013 August 1919 ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Allied council was deeply displeased by the Romanian advance to the Tisza River. Some {{who|date=July 2017}} blamed Romania for the loss of Hungary to communist rule. The Allied council asked Romania to retreat to the first railway demarcation line and commence negotiations with the Kun government. Romania persisted at the Tisza line. The Allied council pressured Hungary to stop its incursions into Czechoslovakia, threatening a coordinated action against Hungary by French, Serb and Romanian forces from the south and the east. However, the Allied council also promised favor to Hungary in subsequent peace negotiations in delineating Hungary's new borders. On 12 June, the Allied council discussed Hungary's proposed new borders with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.\n\nOn 23 June, Hungary signed an armistice with Czechoslovakia. By 4 July, the Hungarian Army had retreated 15&nbsp;km south of the Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak demarcation line. The Allied council demanded that Romania leave [[Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal]] and respect the new borders. Romania said it would only do so after the Hungarian Army demobilized. Kun said he would continue to depend on the might of his army. On 11 July, the Allied council ordered Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] to prepare a coordinated attack against Hungary using Serb, French and Romanian forces. Hungary, in turn, prepared for action along the Tisza River.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA563 ''World War I: A\u2013D.''] ABC-CLIO 2005. vol&nbsp;1. p.&nbsp;563.</ref>\n\nThe Romanian army faced the Hungarian army along the Tisza River front line over a distance of {{convert|250|km}}. The front extended from beyond [[Szeged]] in the south\u2014adjacent to French and Serb troops\u2014to [[Tokaj]] in the north\u2014adjacent to Czechoslovak troops. On 17 July, Hungary attacked.\n\n=== Hungarian Army in July 1919 ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nKun's [[political commissar]]s directed the Hungarian Army, supported by experienced professional military officers. Commanders of small units were experienced soldiers. The Hungarian Army mustered 100 infantry battalions (50,000 men), ten cavalry squadrons (1365 men), 69 artillery batteries of calibers up to 305&nbsp;mm and nine armored trains. The troops were organized into three groups: north, central and south. The central group was the strongest.\n\nHungary planned to cross the Tisza River with all three groups. The north group would advance towards [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]], the central group to [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and the south group to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]. The aim was to ignite a communist uprising in Romania and incite [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Soviet Russia]] to attack Bessarabia.\n\n=== Romanian Army in July 1919 ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Romanian Army was composed of 92 battalions (48,000 men), 58 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men), 80 artillery batteries of calibers up to 155&nbsp;mm, two armored trains and some support units. They were positioned along three lines. The first line was manned by the 16th Division in the north and the 18th Division in the south. More powerful units manned the second line: the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the north, concentrated in and around Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, and the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division in the south, concentrated in and around B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba.\n\nThe third line was manned by Romania's strongest units: the 1st and 6th infantry divisions, the 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions and support units. The third line lay on the railway from [[Carei|Nagyk\u00e1roly]], through [[Oradea|Nagyv\u00e1rad]] and north of Arad. The 20th and 21st infantry divisions were tasked with maintaining public order behind the third line. The first line was thin, as it was supposed to fight delaying actions until the true intentions of the attacking Hungarian army were revealed. After that, together with troops in the second line, the first line was to be held until troops in the third line could mount a counterattack. The Romanian command planned to use the railways under its control to move troops. The Romanian soldier was usually a World War I veteran.\n\n=== Hungarian offensive ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919, battle of Tisza - English.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Operations of the Hungarian and Romanian armies during the battle of the Tisza River in July 1919.]]\nFrom 17\u201320 July, the Hungarian army bombarded the Romanian positions and conducted reconnaissance operations. On 20 July, at about 3&nbsp;a.m., after a fierce bombardment, Hungarian infantry including all three groups crossed the Tisza River and attacked Romanian positions. On 20 July, in the northern arena, the Hungarians army [[Rakamaz]] and some nearby villages. Troops of the Romanian 16th and 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori divisions took back the villages shortly and regained Rakamaz the next day. The Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by artillery fire, retook Rakamaz and two nearby villages but could not break out of the Rakamaz bridgehead.\n\nHungarian forces attempted to outflank the Romanian positions by crossing the Tisza River at [[Tiszaf\u00fcred]] with troops of the 80th International Brigade. There they were halted by troops of the Romanian 16th Division. On 24 July, the Romanian 20th Infantry Division, brought in as reinforcements, cleared the bridgehead at Tiszaf\u00fcred. Not being able to break out of Rakamaz, Hungarian forces fortified their positions and redeployed some troops. There was a lull in fighting in the north, as the Romanian troops did the same. On 26 July, the Romanians attacked, and by 10&nbsp;p.m. had cleared the Rakamaz bridgehead. This left the Romanian army in control of the northern part of the Tisza's eastern bank.\n\nIn the southern area, during a two-day battle, the Hungarian 2nd Division took Szentes from the 89th and 90th regiments of the Romanian 18th Division. On 21\u201322 July, [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] changed hands several times between Hungarian and Romanian troops of the 90th Infantry Regiment supported by the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Romanian forces reoccupied H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, [[Szentes]] and [[Mindszent]]. The Romanians controlled the eastern bank of the Tisza River in this sector, which allowed the 1st V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade to move to the center. On 20 July, Hungarian forces established a solid bridgehead on the east bank of the Tisza at [[Szolnok]], opposed by the Romanian 91st Regiment of the 18th Infantry Division. The Hungarian army moved the 6th and 7th divisions across the Tisza River, formed up within the bridgehead, then attacked the Romanians in the first line of defense. The Hungarian 6th Infantry Division took [[T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s]]; the 7th Division advanced towards [[Mez\u0151t\u00far]] and the 5th Division advanced towards [[T\u00farkeve]].\n\nOn 22 July, Hungarian forces crossed the Tisza River at a point {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Szolnok and took [[Kunhegyes]] from the Romanian 18th V\u00e2n\u0103tori Regiment. The Romanian 18th Division was reinforced with units from the second line, including some troops from the 1st Cavalry Division and the entire 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Brigade. On 23 July, Hungarian forces took T\u00farkeve and Mez\u0151t\u00far. The Hungarian army controlled an area {{convert|80|km|mi}} in length along the bank of the Tisza River and {{convert|60|km|mi}} in depth to the east of the Tisza River at Szolnok. The Romanian army undertook manoeuvres to the north of this Hungarian territory. Gen. Davidoglu,  commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division, formed closest to the river. Gen. Obogeanu, commanding the 1st Infantry Division, formed in the center and Gen. Olteanu, commanding the 6th Infantry Division, formed furthest to the east.\n\n=== Romanian counterattack ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\nOn 24 July, the Romanian Army's northern maneuver group attacked. Elements of the 2nd Cavalry Division, supported by troops of the 18th Infantry Division, took [[Kunhegyes]]. The Romanian 1st Infantry Division attacked the Hungarian 6th Infantry Division and took [[Fegyvernek]]. The Romanian 6th Ddivision was less successful, being counterattacked on the left flank by the Hungarian reserve formations. Altogether, the attack pushed back the Hungarian army {{convert|20|km|mi}}. Romanian forces were supported by the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division and some cavalry units when they became available.\n\nOn 25 July, fighting continued. Hungarian forces counterattacked at Fegyvernek, engaging the Romanian 1st Infantry Division. With their lines breaking, Hungarian troops began a retreat towards the Tisza River bridge at Szolnok. On 26 July, Hungarian forces destroyed the bridge. By the end of that day the east bank of the Tisza River was once again under Romanian control.\n\n=== Romanian forces cross the Tisza River ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 32.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Troops from the 2nd V\u00e2n\u0103tori Division crossing the Tisza River in the presence of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie.]]\n[[File:Tropas-rumanas-ocupan-budapest-1919--outlawsdiary02tormuoft.png|250px|thumb|right|Romanian troops entering Budapest.]]\nAfter repelling the Hungarian attack, the Romanian army prepared to cross the Tisza River. The 7th Infantry Division returned from Bessarabia. The 2nd Infantry Division and some smaller infantry and artillery units also returned. The Romanian army massed 119 battalions (84,000 men), 99 artillery batteries with 392 guns and 60 cavalry squadrons (12,000 men). Hungarian forces continued an artillery bombardment.\n\nFrom 27\u201329 July, the Romanian Army tested the strength of the Hungarian defense with small attacks. A plan was made to cross the Tisza River near Fegyvernek, where it makes a turn. On the night of 29\u201330 July, the Romanian Army crossed the Tisza River. Decoy operations were mounted at other points along the river, bringing intense artillery duels. Romanian forces held the element of surprise. On 31 July the Hungarian army retreated towards Budapest.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Budapest ===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianArmyInFrontOfBudapestParliament.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian army in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]], Budapest, 1919.]]\n[[File:Romanian troops in Budapest 1919.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Romanian troops in Budapest, 1919.]]\nRomanian forces continued their advance towards Budapest. On 3 August, under the command of Gen. Rusescu, three squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Brigade entered Budapest. Until midday on 4 August, 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns held Budapest. Then the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the city and a parade was held through the city center in front of the commander, General Mo\u015foiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary and stopped at [[Gy\u0151r]].\n\nThe incursion of Romania into Hungary caused the heaviest fighting of the war. The Romanian army casualties were 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers&nbsp;\u2013 39 officers and 1,730 soldiers killed, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded, and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing in action. As of 8 August, the Romanians had captured 1,235 Hungarian officers and 40,000 soldiers, seized 350 guns\u2014including two with a caliber of 305&nbsp;mm\u2014332 machine guns, 52,000 rifles and 87 airplanes.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{uncited section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:RomanianSoldiersFeedingCiviliansInBudapest.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian soldiers feeding the civilian population in Hungary.]]\n[[File:Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919 (National Military Museum Collection) 36.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Romanian infantry patrol in Budapest.]]\nOn 2 August, Kun fled Hungary towards the Austrian border and eventually reached the Soviet Union. A socialist government under the leadership of [[Gyula Peidl]] was installed in Budapest with the assistance of the Allied council, but its tenure was short-lived.\n\nThe counter-revolutionary White House Fraternal Association attempted to install [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria]] as Hungary's head of state and [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]] as prime minister. However, the Allied council would not accept a [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] as head of state in Hungary, and a new government was needed.\n\n=== Romanian occupation of Hungary ===\nRomania occupied all of Hungary with the exception of an area around [[Lake Balaton]].
