The Faroe Islands and Greenland have been under the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Crown of Denmark]] since 1397 (''[[de facto]]'') when the [[Kalmar Union]] was ratified, and part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1814 (''[[de jure]]''). However, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm now have an [[Autonomous administrative division|extensive degree of self-government]] and have assumed [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|administrative]] responsibility in a substantial number of fields.<ref name=\"denmark.dk\">{{cite web|title=Greenland and the Faroe Islands|url=http://denmark.dk/en/society/greenland-and-the-faroes/|work=Denmark.dk|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=19 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521224520/http://denmark.dk/en/society/greenland-and-the-faroes|archivedate=21 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLegal matters in the Realm are subject to the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]].<ref>See ''\"Danmarks Riges Grundlov\"'' (\u00a7 1).</ref> Beginning in 1948, The Home Rule Arrangements transfer political competence and responsibility from the Danish political authorities to the Faroese and later the Greenlandic political authorities. In 1978, the unity of the Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as ''rigsf\u00e6llesskabet''. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both the unity of the Realm and the Danish Realm itself have increasingly been referred to as simply ''rigsf\u00e6llesskabet'' ({{lang-fo|r\u00edkisfelagsskapurin}}; {{lang-kl|naalagaaffeqatigiit}})<!--Sourced, do not remove--> in daily parlance.<ref name=Adriansen/>\n\nThe Danish constitution<ref name=\"constitution\" /> stipulates that it applies for all parts of the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]] and that legislative, executive and judicial powers are the responsibility of the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]], the [[Cabinet of Denmark|Danish Government]] and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Danish Supreme Court]]. The Faroe Islands received [[home rule]] in 1948 and Greenland did so in 1979. In 2005, the Faroes received a self-government arrangement, and in 2009 Greenland received \"[[#Terminology|self rule]]\", thus leaving the Danish state government with virtually no influence over internal affairs devolved to the home governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\n\n==Constitutionality==\nThe Danish Realm's unique state of [[State (polity)|internal affairs]] is acted out in the principle of the \"unity of the Realm\".<ref name=\"unity of the realm\"/> This principle is derived from Article 1 of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] which specifies that constitutional law applies equally to all areas of the Danish Realm.<ref name=\"constitution\">[http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/upload/application/pdf/0172b719/Constitution%20of%20Denmark.pdf%3Fdownload%3D1 Constitutional Act of Denmark].

The Kingdom of Denmark's parliament, with its 179 members, is located in the capital, [[Copenhagen]].

The Faroese and Greenlandic authorities administer the tasks taken over from the state, enact legislation in these specific fields and have the economic responsibility for solving these tasks.

Representatives for both have joined Danish delegations in discussions on some international matters, such as fishing rights. Greenlandic representatives were included in the process of a new treaty between Denmark and the US regarding the [[Thule Air Base]] in northwest Greenland.\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[OECD]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated members of the [[Nordic Council]] in their own right as part of the wider membership of the Kingdom. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is a member of the [[European Union]], both areas have special dispensation and remain outside the EU.

In this arrangement, the Danish government deals with external matters such as defence and foreign affairs. Greenland and the Faroe Islands maintain their own elected assemblies and administrations, headed by a premier who appoints a cabinet. This is synonymous with \"self-governing\".\n\n; ''Selvstyre'': Following [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|a referendum]] on 25 November 2008 (the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule in Greenland), the relationship between the Danish and Greenlandic governments changed, with Greenland gaining greater autonomy. Further powers were granted to the Greenlandic government on 21 June 2009, including control of the police force, coastguard, and courts. Additionally, Greenland now receives fewer Danish subsidies, becoming more self-sufficient.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7749427.stm Greenland votes for more autonomy] BBC News, 26 November 2008</ref> As a result of these changes, Greenland was then said to have ''self rule'' with minimal support from Denmark, as opposed to \"home rule\".\n\n; ''Rigsombudsmand'': [[High Commissioners]] represent the interests of Denmark in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. There is one Danish High Commissioner in each territory.

In 1978, the unity of the Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as ''rigsf\u00e6llesskabet''. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both the unity of the Realm and the Danish Realm itself have increasingly been referred to as simply ''rigsf\u00e6llesskabet'' ({{lang-fo|r\u00edkisfelagsskapurin}}; {{lang-kl|naalagaaffeqatigiit}})<!--Sourced, do not remove--> in daily parlance.<ref name=Adriansen/>\n\nThe Danish constitution<ref name=\"constitution\" /> stipulates that it applies for all parts of the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]] and that legislative, executive and judicial powers are the responsibility of the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]], the [[Cabinet of Denmark|Danish Government]] and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Danish Supreme Court]]. The Faroe Islands received [[home rule]] in 1948 and Greenland did so in 1979.

Danish currency is also legal tender in Greenland and the Faroes, and Denmark is responsible for military defense.<ref>Danish Department of Justice PDF (2005), issues 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 to 3.4.5 at [www.logting.fo/files/casestate/4609/092.04%20Bilag%201.pdf]</ref> Further, for rare treatments and certain surgery, Greenlanders and Faroese are often directed to Copenhagen's National Hospital ([[Rigshospitalet]]).<!-- this latter point has no constitutional relevance, surely? -->\n\n=== International community ===\n{{See also|Foreign relations of Denmark}}\n\n{{Hatnote|Also related: [[Foreign relations of the Faroe Islands]] and [[Foreign relations of Greenland]]}}\nPreviously, most [[Foreign relations of Denmark|foreign relations]] were undertaken exclusively by the Government of Denmark on behalf of the entire realm, but more recently the Faroe Islands and Greenland have increased their role in foreign policy. Representatives for both have joined Danish delegations in discussions on some international matters, such as fishing rights. Greenlandic representatives were included in the process of a new treaty between Denmark and the US regarding the [[Thule Air Base]] in northwest Greenland.\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[OECD]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated members of the [[Nordic Council]] in their own right as part of the wider membership of the Kingdom. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is a member of the [[European Union]], both areas have special dispensation and remain outside the EU. Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark in 1973, but [[1982 Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum|opted to leave]] in 1985 after Greenlandic home rule was introduced in 1979.\n\nThe \"Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands\" specifies that a 'Faroese' shall be understood to mean a person who is a \"''national'' of Denmark and a ''resident'' of the Faroe Islands\".<ref name=\"Faroese home rule\" /> The Government of Denmark issues special passports for its citizens living in the Faroe Islands and Greenland with the right to choose a regular [[Danish passport]] as well. The Faroese Home Rule Act states that, in [[Faroese passport]]s, ''F\u00f8royingur'' (Faroese) and ''F\u00f8royar'' (Faroe Islands) shall be inserted after the words ''Dansk'' (Danish) and ''Danmark'' (Denmark).<ref name=\"Faroese home rule\" />\n\n== Population and area ==\n{{Further|Geography of Denmark|Geography of Greenland|Geography of the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Kingdom of Denmark, administrative divisions - en - colored (zoom).svg|thumb|300px|right|Comparison map: Greenland, the Faroe Islands (enlarged) and Denmark differ significantly in size. The Danish Realm is spread far apart, across the North Atlantic Ocean and [[North Sea]].]]\n\nThe size of the Danish population is far greater than the population size of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark proper has a population of about 5.6 million\npeople, while the populations of the Faroe Islands and Greenland are 48,000 and 56,000 people, respectively. A medium-sized Danish provincial town has,\nfor comparison, a population of about 50,000. With an area of over two million km\u00b2 (836,109 square miles), Greenland is the [[list of countries and territories by population density|most sparsely populated territory]] in the world.\n\nThe disparity between the small population of the former colonies and the greater population of Denmark proper has helped to enforce the dominant position that Denmark proper holds in the Realm. When the areas of the three territories are combined (853,509 sq mi), the Kingdom of Denmark ranks as the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|twelfth largest]] country in the world, the same rank held by Greenland alone.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Country / territory\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Legislature\n!colspan=\"2\"| Area\n!colspan=\"3\"| Population\n|- \n! km\u00b2\n!

In this arrangement, the Danish government deals with external matters such as defence and foreign affairs. Greenland and the Faroe Islands maintain their own elected assemblies and administrations, headed by a premier who appoints a cabinet. This is synonymous with \"self-governing\".\n\n; ''Selvstyre'': Following [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|a referendum]] on 25 November 2008 (the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule in Greenland), the relationship between the Danish and Greenlandic governments changed, with Greenland gaining greater autonomy. Further powers were granted to the Greenlandic government on 21 June 2009, including control of the police force, coastguard, and courts. Additionally, Greenland now receives fewer Danish subsidies, becoming more self-sufficient.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7749427.stm Greenland votes for more autonomy] BBC News, 26 November 2008</ref> As a result of these changes, Greenland was then said to have ''self rule'' with minimal support from Denmark, as opposed to \"home rule\".\n\n; ''Rigsombudsmand'': [[High Commissioners]] represent the interests of Denmark in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. There is one Danish High Commissioner in each territory. He or she can attend the meetings at the L\u00f8gting in the Faroes and at the Inatsisartut in Greenland, but can't vote.\n\n; ''Folketingsmedlemmer fra F\u00e6r\u00f8erne og Gr\u00f8nland'': Members of the Folketing from the Faroe Islands and Greenland: Greenland and the Faroe Islands and their self-rule administrations take part in consultations on policies and decisions affecting their region, including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the [[Folketing|Danish parliament (''folketing'')]]. Greenland and the Faroe Islands  have two members of the Danish ''folketing'' each, with full voting privileges.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Denmark|Faroe Islands|Geography}}\n* [[List of Danish High Commissioners in Greenland]]\n* [[List of Danish High Commissioners in the Faroe Islands]]\n* [[Kingdom of Iceland]]\n* [[Constitution of Denmark]]\n* [[Norwegian Realm]]\n* [[Faroese independence]]\n* [[Greenlandic independence]]\n* [[Icelandic independence movement]]\n* [[Norwegian independence movement]]\n\n== Literature ==\n* Adriansen, Inge (2003): ''[https://www.mtp.dk/details.asp?eln=200080 Nationale symboler i Det Danske Rige 1830-2000]'', Vol I (Fra fyrstestat til nationalstater), [[Museum Tusculanum Press]], University of Copenhagen. {{in lang|da}}\n* Adriansen, Inge (2003): ''[https://www.mtp.dk/details.asp?eln=200080 Nationale symboler i Det Danske Rige 1830-2000]'', Vol II (Fra unders\u00e5tter til nation), [[Museum Tusculanum Press]], University of Copenhagen. {{in lang|da}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|refs=\n{{efn|name=commonwealth|Literally translated as \"the Commonwealth of the Realm\"<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{cite book |title=Denmark Regulations Handbook |date=3 March 2008 |publisher=Int'l Business Publications |isbn=9781433069710 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dB7O2CPq8qcC&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19 |accessdate=1 September 2015 |quote=\"...a relationship known in Danish as ''Rigsf\u00e6llesskabet'' (Commonwealth of the Realm)}}</ref>}}\n{{efn|name=currency|In the Faroe Islands the currency has a separate design and is known as the [[Faroese kr\u00f3na]], but is not a separate currency.}}\n{{efn|name=time|See [[time in Denmark]] for details about laws governing time zones in the unity of the Realm.}}\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* The [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] for the Danish Realm: [http://www.grundloven.dk/ Danmarks Riges Grundlov], no. 169 of 5 June 1953. {{in lang|da}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|Denmark|voy=Denmark|wikt=Rigsf\u00e6llesskabet}}\n* [http://www.stm.dk/_p_10988.html ''The unity of the Realm''; the status the Faroe Islands and Greenland] (Prime Minister's Office)\n* [http://www.visitdenmark.com/ Tourism portal] at ''VisitDenmark''.\n* [http://www.visitgreenland.com/ Tourism portal] at ''VisitGreenland''.\n* [http://www.visitfaroeislands.com/ Tourism portal] at ''VisitFaroeIslands''.\n\n;Government\n''Denmark:''\n* [http://www.stm.dk/_a_2818.html Stm.dk] \u2013 official Danish government website\n* [http://www.um.dk/en um.dk] \u2013 official Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark website\n* [https://www.dst.dk/en/ Statistics Denmark (DST)] \u2013 Key figures from the Danish bureau of statistics\n* {{Statoids|id=udk|title=Regions of Denmark}}\n\n''Greenland:''\n* [https://www.naalakkersuisut.gl/en Naalakkersuisut.gl] \u2013 official Greenlandic government website\n* [https://naalakkersuisut.gl/en/Naalakkersuisut/Departments/Udenrigsanliggende Naalakkersuisut.gl] \u2013 official Ministry of Foreign Relations of Greenland website\n* [http://www.stat.gl/default.asp?lang=en Statistics Greenland (GST)] \u2013 Key figures from the Greenlandic bureau of statistics\n* {{Statoids|id=ugl|title=Administrative divisions of Greenland}}\n\n''Faroe Islands:''\n* [https://www.government.fo/ Government.fo] \u2013 official Faroese government website\n* [https://www.government.fo/en/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/ Government.fo] \u2013 official Ministry of Foreign Relations of the Faroe Islands website\n* [http://www.hagstova.fo/en Statistics Faroe Islands (FST)] \u2013 Key figures from the Faroese bureau of statistics\n* {{Statoids|id=ufo|title=Regions of the Faroe Islands}}\n\n; News and media\n* [https://news.google.com/news?ned=us&q=The_unity_of_the_Realm%2F&btnG=Search Google news The unity of the Realm]\n* [https://news.google.com/news?ned=us&q=Kingdom_of_Denmark%2F&btnG=Search Google news Kingdom of Denmark - term used to include Greenland and the Faroe Islands]\n* [https://news.google.com/news?ned=us&q=Danish_Realm%2F&btnG=Search Google news Danish Realm]\n\n{{Denmark topics}}\n{{Faroe Islands topics}}\n{{Greenland topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rigsfaellesskabet}}\n\n[[Category:Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Government of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Government of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:Government of Greenland]]\n", "name_user": "Kenwick", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_of_the_Realm"}
