UV radiation is present in [[sunlight]], and constitutes about 10% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. It is also produced by [[electric arc]]s and specialized lights, such as [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, [[tanning lamp]]s, and [[black light]]s. Although long-wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an [[ionizing radiation]] because its [[photon]]s lack the energy to [[ionization|ionize]] [[atom]]s, it can cause [[chemical reaction]]s and causes many substances to glow or [[fluorescence|fluoresce]]. Consequently, the chemical and biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules.\n\nShort-wave ultraviolet light damages [[DNA]] and sterilizes surfaces with which it comes into contact. For humans, [[Sun tanning|suntan]] and [[sunburn]] are familiar effects of exposure of the skin to UV light, along with an increased risk of [[skin cancer]]. The amount of UV light produced by the Sun means that the Earth would not be able to sustain life on dry land if most of that light were not filtered out by the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=2009-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127004149/http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html |archivedate=27 January 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> More energetic, shorter-wavelength \"extreme\" UV below 121&nbsp;nm ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haigh |first=Joanna D. |date=2007 |title=The Sun and the Earth's Climate: Absorption of solar spectral radiation by the atmosphere |journal=Living Reviews in Solar Physics |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=2 |url=http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrsp-2007-2&amp;page=articlesu8.html |accessdate=July 12, 2014 |doi=10.12942/lrsp-2007-2 |bibcode=2007LRSP....4....2H |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050402/http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrsp-2007-2&page=articlesu8.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, ultraviolet light (specifically, UVB) is also responsible for the formation of bone-strengthening [[vitamin D]] in most land vertebrates, including humans.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wacker |first=Matthias |last2=Holick |first2=Michael F. |date=2013-01-01 |title=Sunlight and Vitamin D|journal=Dermato-endocrinology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=51\u2013108 |doi=10.4161/derm.24494 |issn=1938-1972 |pmc=3897598 |pmid=24494042}}</ref> The UV spectrum thus has effects both beneficial and harmful to life.\n\nThe lower wavelength limit of human vision is conventionally taken as 400&nbsp;nm, so ultraviolet rays are invisible to humans, although some people can perceive light at slightly shorter wavelengths than this.

Ultraviolet has a higher frequency (and thus a shorter wavelength) than violet light.\n\nUV radiation was discovered in 1801 when the German physicist [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] observed that invisible rays just beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum darkened [[silver chloride]]-soaked paper more quickly than violet light itself. He called them \"(de-)oxidizing rays\" ({{lang-de|de-oxidierende Strahlen}}) to emphasize [[Reactivity (chemistry)|chemical reactivity]] and to distinguish them from \"heat rays\", [[Infrared#History of infrared science|discovered the previous year]] at the other end of the visible spectrum. The simpler term \"chemical rays\" was adopted soon afterwards, and remained popular throughout the 19th century, although some said that this radiation was entirely different from light (notably [[John William Draper]], who named them \"tithonic rays\"<ref>\"On a new Imponderable Substance and on a Class of Chemical Rays analogous to the rays of Dark Heat\", J.W.

Many approaches seek to adapt visible light-sensing devices, but these can suffer from unwanted response to visible light and various instabilities. Ultraviolet can be detected by suitable [[photodiode]]s and [[photocathode]]s, which can be tailored to be sensitive to different parts of the UV spectrum. Sensitive ultraviolet [[photomultiplier]]s are available. [[Spectrometer]]s and [[radiometer]]s are made for measurement of UV radiation. Silicon detectors are used across the spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ts.nist.gov/MeasurementServices/Calibrations/upload/JES-80.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109215922/http://ts.nist.gov/MeasurementServices/Calibrations/upload/JES-80.PDF|archivedate=2009-01-09 |title=Gullikson, Korde, Canfield, Vest, \" Stable Silicon Photodiodes for absolute intensity measurements in the VU V and soft x-ray regions\", |journal=Jrnl of Elec.

Scientific instruments can therefore utilize this spectral range by operating in an oxygen-free atmosphere (commonly pure nitrogen), without the need for costly vacuum chambers. Significant examples include 193&nbsp;nm [[photolithography]] equipment (for [[semiconductor manufacturing]]) and [[circular dichroism]] spectrometers.\n\nTechnology for VUV instrumentation was largely driven by solar astronomy for many decades. While optics can be used to remove unwanted visible light that contaminates the VUV, in general, detectors can be limited by their response to non-VUV radiation, and the development of \"solar-blind\" devices has been an important area of research. Wide-gap solid-state devices or vacuum devices with high-cutoff photocathodes can be attractive compared to silicon diodes.\n\nExtreme UV (EUV or sometimes XUV) is characterized by a transition in the physics of interaction with matter. Wavelengths longer than about 30&nbsp;nm interact mainly with the outer [[valence electron]]s of atoms, while wavelengths shorter than that interact mainly with inner-shell electrons and nuclei. The long end of the EUV spectrum is set by a prominent He<sup>+</sup> spectral line at 30.4&nbsp;nm. EUV is strongly absorbed by most known materials, but it is possible to synthesize [[multilayer optics]] that reflect up to about 50 percent of EUV radiation at [[normal incidence]]. This technology was pioneered by the [[NIXT]] and [[MSSTA]] sounding rockets in the 1990s, and it has been used to make telescopes for solar imaging. See also the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer]] (EUVE) [[satellite]].\n\n[[File:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Levels of ozone at various altitudes ([[w:Dobson unit|DU/km]]) and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation.

Meanwhile, UVA is hardly affected by ozone, and most of it reaches the ground.

[[mercury vapor lamp|Mercury-vapor]] black lights in ratings up to 1&nbsp;kW with UV-emitting phosphor and an envelope of Wood's glass are used for theatrical and concert displays.

These lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the UVC band at 253.7&nbsp;nm and 185&nbsp;nm due to the [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] within the lamp, as well as some visible light. From 85% to 90% of the UV produced by these lamps is at 253.7&nbsp;nm, whereas only 5\u201310% is at 185&nbsp;nm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} The fused quartz tube passes the 253.7&nbsp;nm radiation but blocks the 185&nbsp;nm wavelength. Such tubes have two or three times the UVC power of a regular fluorescent lamp tube. These low-pressure lamps have a typical efficiency of approximately 30\u201340%, meaning that for every 100 watts of electricity consumed by the lamp, they will produce approximately 30\u201340 watts of total UV output.  They also emit bluish-white visible light, due to mercury's other spectral lines.  These \"germicidal\" lamps are used extensively for disinfection of surfaces in laboratories and food-processing industries, and for disinfecting water supplies.\n\n===Incandescent lamps===\n'Black light' [[incandescent lamp]]s are also made, from an incandescent light bulb with a filter coating  which absorbs most visible light.

By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified.

UVA can generate highly reactive chemical intermediates, such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals, which in turn can damage DNA. The DNA damage caused indirectly to skin by UVA consists mostly of single-strand breaks in DNA, while the damage caused by UVB includes direct formation of [[thymine dimer]]s or [[cytosine dimer]]s and double-strand DNA breakage.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22271212 | doi=10.1007/s00403-012-1212-x | title=DNA damage after acute exposure of mice skin to physiological doses of UVB and UVA light |date=January 2012 | journal=Arch Dermatol Res |vauthors=Svobodov\u00e1 AR, Galand\u00e1kov\u00e1 A, Siansk\u00e1 J |display-authors=etal | volume=304 | issue=5 | pages=407\u2013412| url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/293c53cde0110f934299f53da3be1db00e6b352d }}</ref> UVA is immunosuppressive for the entire body (accounting for a large part of the immunosuppressive effects of sunlight exposure), and is mutagenic for basal cell keratinocytes in skin.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22123419 | doi=10.1016/j.sder.2011.08.002 | volume=30 | issue=4 | title=Ultraviolet A radiation: its role in immunosuppression and carcinogenesis |date=December 2011 | journal=Semin Cutan Med Surg | pages=214\u201321 |vauthors=Halliday GM, Byrne SN, Damian DL }}</ref>\n\nUVB photons can cause direct DNA damage. UVB radiation [[excited state|excites]] DNA molecules in skin cells, causing aberrant [[covalent bond]]s to form between adjacent [[pyrimidine]] bases, producing a [[pyrimidine dimers|dimer]]. Most UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA are removed by the process known as [[nucleotide excision repair]] that employs about 30 different proteins.<ref name=\"autogenerated145\"/> Those pyrimidine dimers that escape this repair process can induce a form of programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) or can cause DNA replication errors leading to [[mutation]].\n\nAs a defense against UV radiation, the amount of the brown pigment [[melanin]] in the skin increases when exposed to moderate (depending on [[human skin color|skin type]]) levels of radiation; this is commonly known as a [[sun tan]]. The purpose of melanin is to absorb UV radiation and dissipate the energy as harmless heat, protecting the skin against both [[direct DNA damage|direct]] and [[indirect DNA damage]] from the UV. UVA gives a quick tan that lasts for days by oxidizing melanin that was already present and triggers the release of the [[melanin]] from melanocytes. UVB yields a tan that takes roughly 2 days to develop because it stimulates the body to produce more melanin.\n\n===== Sunscreen safety debate =====\n{{Main|Sunscreen}}\n\n[[File:UV and Vis Sunscreen.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration of the effect of sunscreen.

Slightly yellow UV-blocking filters are often used for outdoor photography to prevent unwanted bluing and overexposure by UV rays. For photography in the near UV, special filters may be used. Photography with wavelengths shorter than 350&nbsp;nm requires special quartz lenses which do not absorb the radiation.\nDigital cameras sensors may have internal filters that block UV to improve color rendition accuracy. Sometimes these internal filters can be removed, or they may be absent, and an external visible-light filter prepares the camera for near-UV photography. A few cameras are designed for use in the UV.\n\nPhotography by reflected ultraviolet radiation is useful for medical, scientific, and forensic investigations, in applications as widespread as detecting bruising of skin, alterations of documents, or restoration work on paintings. Photography of the fluorescence produced by ultraviolet illumination uses visible wavelengths of light.\n\n[[File:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|thumb|right|Aurora (phenomenon)|Aurora at [[Jupiter]]'s north pole as seen in ultraviolet light by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\nIn [[ultraviolet astronomy]], measurements are used to discern the chemical composition of the interstellar medium, and the temperature and composition of stars.

The blue light emitted by these agents counteracts yellow tints that may be present and causes the colors and whites to appear whiter or more brightly colored.\n\nUV fluorescent dyes that glow in the primary colors are used in paints, papers, and textiles either to enhance color under daylight illumination or to provide special effects when lit with UV lamps. [[Blacklight paint]]s that contain dyes that glow under UV are used in a number of art and aesthetic applications.\n\nAmusement parks often use UV lighting to fluoresce ride artwork and backdrops. This often has the side effect of causing rider's white clothing to glow light-purple.\n\n[[File:RBC Visa UV.jpg|right|thumb|A bird appears on many Visa credit cards when they are held under a UV light source]]\nTo help prevent [[counterfeiting]] of currency, or forgery of important documents such as driver's licenses and [[passports]], the paper may include a UV [[watermark]] or fluorescent multicolor fibers that are visible under ultraviolet light. Postage stamps are [[Phosphor banded stamp|tagged]] with a phosphor that glows under UV rays to permit automatic detection of the stamp and facing of the letter.\n\nUV fluorescent [[dye]]s are used in many applications (for example, [[biochemistry]] and [[Forensic science|forensics]]). Some brands of [[pepper spray]] will leave an invisible chemical (UV dye) that is not easily washed off on a pepper-sprayed attacker, which would help police identify the attacker later.\n\nIn some types of [[nondestructive testing]] UV stimulates fluorescent dyes to highlight defects in a broad range of materials. These dyes may be carried into surface-breaking defects by capillary action ([[liquid penetrant|liquid penetrant inspection]]) or they may be bound to ferrite particles caught in magnetic leakage fields in ferrous materials ([[magnetic-particle inspection|magnetic particle inspection]]).\n\n===Analytic uses===\n\n====Forensics====\nUV is an investigative tool at the crime scene helpful in locating and identifying bodily fluids such as semen, blood, and saliva.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Springer |first1=E |last2=Almog |first2=J |last3=Frank |first3=A |last4=Ziv |first4=Z |last5=Bergman |first5=P |last6=Gui Quang |first6=W |year=1994 |title=Detection of dry bodily fluids by inherent short wavelength UV luminescence: Preliminary results |journal=Forensic Sci Int |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=89\u201394 |doi=10.1016/0379-0738(94)90332-8 |pmid=8063277 |url= }}</ref> For example, ejaculated fluids or saliva can be detected by high-power UV sources, irrespective of the structure or colour of the surface the fluid is deposited upon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toforsj/articles/V001/12TOFORSJ.pdf |title=Detection of Semen (Human and Boar) and Saliva on Fabrics by a Very High Powered UV-/VIS-Light Source |author1=Anja Fiedler |author2=Mark Benecke |accessdate=2009-12-10 |display-authors=etal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130113644/http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toforsj/articles/V001/12TOFORSJ.pdf |archivedate=30 November 2012 }}</ref>\n[[UV/VIS spectroscopy|UV-Vis microspectroscopy]] is also used to analyze trace evidence, such as textile fibers and paint chips, as well as questioned documents.\n\nOther applications include the authentication of various collectibles and art, and detecting counterfeit currency.

The technique involves taking pictures of the illegible document using different filters in the infrared or ultraviolet range, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light.

UV radiation is often used to excite a given sample where the fluorescent emission is measured with a [[spectrofluorometer]]. In biological research, UV radiation is used for [[quantification of nucleic acids]] or [[protein]]s.\n[[File:Fluorescent minerals hg.jpg|thumb|right|A collection of mineral samples brilliantly fluorescing at various wavelengths as seen while being irradiated by UV light.]]\n\nUltraviolet lamps are also used in analyzing [[mineral]]s and [[gemstone|gems]].\n\nIn pollution control applications, ultraviolet analyzers are used to detect emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur compounds, mercury, and ammonia, for example in the flue gas of fossil-fired power plants.<ref>N. E. Battikha (ed), ''The Condensed Handbook of Measurement and Control 3rd Ed.'' ISA 2007 {{ISBN|1-55617-995-2}}, pp. 65\u201366</ref> Ultraviolet radiation can detect thin sheens of [[oil spill|spilled oil]] on water, either by the high reflectivity of oil films at UV wavelengths, fluorescence of compounds in oil or by absorbing of UV created by [[Raman scattering]] in water.<ref>Mervin Fingas (ed.) ''Oil Spill Science and Technology'' Elsevier, 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-85617-943-0}} pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\n===Material science uses===\n\n====Fire detection====\n{{see also|Flame detector}}\nIn general, ultraviolet detectors use either a solid-state device, such as one based on [[silicon carbide]] or [[aluminium nitride]], or a gas-filled tube as the sensing element. UV detectors that are sensitive to UV in any part of the spectrum respond to irradiation by [[sunlight]] and [[artificial light]]. A burning hydrogen flame, for instance, radiates strongly in the 185- to 260-nanometer range and only very weakly in the [[Infrared|IR]] region, whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the UV band yet very strongly at IR wavelengths; thus, a fire detector that operates using both UV and IR detectors is more reliable than one with a UV detector alone. Virtually all fires emit some [[thermal radiation|radiation]] in the UVC band, whereas the [[Sun]]'s radiation at this band is absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The result is that the UV detector is \"solar blind\", meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the Sun, so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors.\n\nUV detectors are sensitive to most fires, including [[hydrocarbon]]s, metals, [[sulfur]], [[hydrogen]], [[hydrazine]], and [[ammonia]]. [[Arc welding]], electrical arcs, [[lightning]], [[X-ray]]s used in nondestructive metal testing equipment (though this is highly unlikely), and radioactive materials can produce levels that will activate a UV detection system. The presence of UV-absorbing gases and vapors will attenuate the UV radiation from a fire, adversely affecting the ability of the detector to detect flames. Likewise, the presence of an oil mist in the air or an oil film on the detector window will have the same effect.\n\n==== Photolithography ====\nUltraviolet radiation is used for very fine resolution [[photolithography]], a procedure wherein a chemical called a photoresist is exposed to UV radiation that has passed through a mask. The exposure causes chemical reactions to occur in the photoresist. After removal of unwanted photoresist, a pattern determined by the mask remains on the sample. Steps may then be taken to \"etch\" away, deposit on or otherwise modify areas of the sample where no photoresist remains.\n\nPhotolithography is used in the manufacture of [[semiconductor]]s, [[integrated circuit]] components,<ref>{{cite web | title = Deep UV Photoresists | url = http://www.almaden.ibm.com/st/chemistry/lithography/deep_uv/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060312012823/http://www.almaden.ibm.com/st/chemistry/lithography/deep_uv/ | archivedate = 2006-03-12}}</ref> and [[printed circuit board]]s. Photolithography processes used to fabricate electronic integrated circuits presently use 193&nbsp;nm UV and are experimentally using 13.5&nbsp;nm UV for [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]].\n\n====Polymers====\nElectronic components that require clear transparency for light to exit or enter (photovoltaic panels and sensors) can be potted using acrylic resins that are cured using UV energy. The advantages are low VOC emissions and rapid curing.\n\n[[File:UV effect on finished wood.jpg|thumb|Effects of UV on finished surfaces in 0, 20 and 43 hours.]]\nCertain inks, coatings, and [[adhesive]]s are formulated with photoinitiators and resins. When exposed to UV light, [[polymerization]] occurs, and so the adhesives harden or cure, usually within a few seconds. Applications include glass and plastic bonding, [[optical fiber]] coatings, the coating of flooring, [[UV coating]] and paper finishes in offset [[printing]], dental fillings, and decorative fingernail \"gels\".\n\nUV sources for UV curing applications include [[UV lamps]], UV [[LED]]s, and [[Excimer]] flash lamps. Fast processes such as flexo or offset printing require high-intensity light focused via reflectors onto a moving substrate and medium so high-pressure [[Mercury (element)|Hg]] (mercury) or [[Iron|Fe]] (iron, doped)-based bulbs are used, energized with electric arcs or microwaves. Lower-power fluorescent lamps and LEDs can be used for static applications. Small high-pressure lamps can have light focused and transmitted to the work area via liquid-filled or fiber-optic light guides.\n\nThe impact of UV on polymers is used for modification of the ([[surface roughness|roughness]] and [[hydrophobicity]]) of polymer surfaces. For example, a [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]] surface can be smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=R. V. Lapshin|author2=A. P. Alekhin|author3=A. G. Kirilenko|author4=S. L.

Polymers exposed to UV will oxidize, thus raising the [[surface energy]] of the polymer. Once the surface energy of the polymer has been raised, the bond between the adhesive and the polymer is stronger.\n\n===Biology-related uses===\n\n====Air purification====\nUsing a [[Photocatalysis|catalytic chemical reaction]] from [[titanium dioxide]] and UVC exposure, [[oxidation]] of organic matter converts [[pathogens]], [[pollens]], and [[mold]] [[spores]] into harmless inert byproducts. However, the reaction of titanium dioxide and UVC is not a straight path.  Several hundreds of reactions occur prior to the inert byproducts stage and can hinder the resulting reaction creating formaldehyde, aldehyde, and other VOC's en route to a final stage.  Thus, the use of Titanium Dioxide and UVC requires very specific parameters for a successful outcome. The cleansing mechanism of UV is a photochemical process. Contaminants in the indoor environment are almost entirely organic carbon-based compounds, which break down when exposed to high-intensity UV at 240 to 280&nbsp;nm. Short-wave ultraviolet radiation can destroy DNA in living microorganisms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bestledgrowlightsinfo.com/the-importance-of-uv-light-for-plants-cultivated-indoors/|title=The Importance of UV Light for Plants Cultivated Indoors|date=2017-06-11|work=Best LED Grow Lights Info|access-date=2017-06-24|language=en-US}}</ref> UVC's effectiveness is directly related to intensity and exposure time.\n\nUV has also been shown to reduce gaseous contaminants such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scott|first1=K.J. |last2=Wills|first2=R.R.H. |last3=Patterson|first3=B.D. |year=1971 |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740220916 |title= Removal by ultra-violet lamp of ethylene and other hydrocarbons produced by bananas |volume=22|pages=496\u20137|issue=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scott|first1=KJ |last2=Wills|first2=RBH |title=Atmospheric pollutants destroyed in an ultra violet scrubber |year=1973 |journal=Laboratory Practice|volume=22 |issue=2|pages=103\u20136 |pmid=4688707}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shorter|first1=AJ |last2=Scott|first2=KJ |year=1986|title=Removal of ethylene from air and low oxygen atmospheres with ultra violet radiation|journal=Lebensm-Wiss U Technology |volume=19|pages=176\u20139}}</ref> UV lamps radiating at 184 and 254&nbsp;nm can remove low concentrations of [[hydrocarbons]] and [[carbon monoxide]] if the air is recycled between the room and the lamp chamber.

Commercially available low-pressure [[mercury-vapor lamps]] emit about 86% of their radiation at 254 nanometers (nm), with 265&nbsp;nm being the peak germicidal effectiveness curve. UV at these germicidal wavelengths damage a microorganism's DNA so that it cannot reproduce, making it harmless, (even though the organism may not be killed). Since microorganisms can be shielded from ultraviolet rays in small cracks and other shaded areas, these lamps are used only as a supplement to other sterilization techniques.\n\nUV-C LEDs are relatively new to the commercial market and are gaining in popularity.{{Not in citation given|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Welch, David |display-authors=et al |title=Far-UVC light: A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=8|issue=1|pages=2752|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-21058-w|pmid=29426899|pmc=5807439|issn=2045-2322|date=January 2018|accessdate=|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.2752W}}</ref> Due to their monochromatic nature (\u00b1 5&nbsp;nm){{Not in citation given|date=April 2020}} these LEDs can target a specific wavelength needed for disinfection.

Many fruits, flowers, and seeds stand out more strongly from the background in ultraviolet wavelengths as compared to human color vision. Scorpions glow or take on a yellow to green color under UV illumination, thus assisting in the control of these arachnids. Many birds have patterns in their plumage that are invisible at usual wavelengths but observable in ultraviolet, and the urine and other secretions of some animals, including dogs, cats, and human beings, are much easier to spot with ultraviolet. Urine trails of rodents can be detected by pest control technicians for proper treatment of infested dwellings.\n\nButterflies use ultraviolet as a [[Ultraviolet communication in butterflies|communication system]] for sex recognition and mating behavior. For example, in the ''[[Colias eurytheme]]'' butterfly, males rely on visual cues to locate and identify females. Instead of using chemical stimuli to find mates, males are attracted to the ultraviolet-reflecting color of female hind wings.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silberglied | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Orley R. | year = 1978 | title = Ultraviolet Reflection and Its Behavioral Role in the Courtship of the Sulfur Butterflies Colias eurytheme and C. philodice (Lepidoptera, Pieridae) | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 203\u201343 | doi=10.1007/bf00296311}}</ref>  In ''[[Pieris napi]]'' butterflies it was shown that females in northern Finland with less UV-radiation present in the environment possessed stronger UV signals to attract their males than those occurring further south.

UV-capable spectrophotometers are common in such laboratories.\n\nUltraviolet traps called [[bug zapper]]s are used to eliminate various small flying insects. They are attracted to the UV and are killed using an electric shock, or trapped once they come into contact with the device. Different designs of ultraviolet radiation traps are also used by [[entomologists]] for [[collecting]] [[nocturnal]] insects during [[fauna|faunistic]] survey studies.\n\n====Therapy====\n{{main|Ultraviolet light therapy}}\nUltraviolet radiation is helpful in the treatment of [[skin conditions]] such as [[psoriasis]] and [[vitiligo]]. Exposure to UVA, while the skin is hyper-photosensitive, by taking [[psoralen]]s is an effective treatment for [[psoriasis]]. Due to the potential of [[psoralens]] to cause damage to the [[liver]], [[PUVA therapy]] may be used only a limited number of times over a patient's lifetime.\n\nUVB phototherapy does not require additional medications or topical preparations for the therapeutic benefit; only the exposure is needed. However, phototherapy can be effective when used in conjunction with certain topical treatments such as anthralin, coal tar, and vitamin A and D derivatives, or systemic treatments such as methotrexate and Soriatane.<ref>\n{{cite web |title = UVB Phototherapy |url = http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/phototherapy/uvb.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622180124/http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/phototherapy/uvb.php |archivedate=22 June 2007 |format=php |accessdate=2007-09-23 |publisher=National Psoriasis Foundation, USA}}</ref>\n\n====Herpetology====\n[[Reptile]]s need UVB for biosynthesis of vitamin D, and other metabolic processes.  Specifically [[cholecalciferol]] (vitamin D3),  which is needed to for basic cellular / neural functioning as well as the utilization calcium for bone and egg production. The UVA wavelength is also visible to many reptiles and might play a significant role in their ability survive in the wild as well as visual communication between individuals.  Therefore, in a typical reptile enclosure, a fluorescent UV a/b source (at the proper strength / spectrum for the species),  must be available for many captive species to survive.  Simple supplementation with [[cholecalciferol]]  (Vitamin D3) will not be enough as there's a complete biosynthetic pathway that is \"leapfrogged\"  (risks of possible overdoses), the intermediate molecules and metabolites also play important functions in the animals health.  Natural sunlight in the right levels is always going to be superior to artificial sources, but this might not be possible for keepers in different parts of the world.\n\nIt is a known problem that high levels of output of the UVa part of the spectrum can both cause cellular and DNA damage to sensitive parts of their bodies - especially the eyes were blindness is the result from an improper UVa/b source use and placement [[photokeratitis]].   For many keepers there must also be a provision for an adequate heat source this has resulted in the marketing of heat and light \"combination\" products.   Keepers should be careful of these \"combination' light/ heat and UVa/b generators, they typically emit high levels of UVa with lower levels of UVb that are set and difficult to control so that animals can have their needs met.   A better strategy is to use individual sources of these elements and so they can be placed and controlled by the keepers for the max benefit of the animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uvguide.co.uk/vitdpathway.htm|title=Vitamin D and Ultraviolet Light \u2013 a remarkable process|last=|first=|date=|website=UV Guide UK|access-date=2017-01-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531172209/http://www.uvguide.co.uk/vitdpathway.htm|archivedate=31 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Evolutionary significance==\nThe evolution of early reproductive [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]] is attributed in modern models of [[evolutionary theory]] to ultraviolet radiation. UVB causes [[thymine]] base pairs next to each other in genetic sequences to bond together into [[thymine dimers]], a disruption in the strand that reproductive enzymes cannot copy. This leads to [[frameshifting]] during genetic replication and [[protein synthesis]], usually killing the cell. Before formation of the UV-blocking ozone layer, when early prokaryotes approached the surface of the ocean, they almost invariably died out. The few that survived had developed enzymes that monitored the genetic material and removed [[thymine dimer]]s by [[nucleotide excision repair]] enzymes. Many enzymes and proteins involved in modern [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are similar to repair enzymes, and are believed to be evolved modifications of the enzymes originally used to overcome DNA damages caused by UV.<ref>{{Cite book\n |author1=Margulis, Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion\n |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Origins of Sex: Three Billion Years of Genetic Recombination\n | version = 1\n | publisher = Yale University Press\n |year=1986\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=3hDVTEk3ioIC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&dq=origins+of+sex:+three\n | isbn = 978-0-300-04619-9\n | format = book\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[High-energy visible light]]\n* [[Ultraviolet catastrophe]]\n* [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]\n* [[Ultraviolet index]]\n* [[UV stabilizers in plastics]]\n* [[Weather testing of polymers]]\n* [[Germicidal Lamp]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite journal\n | last = Hu\n | first = S\n | last2 = Ma\n | first2 = F\n | last3 = Collado-Mesa\n | first3 = F\n | last4 = Kirsner\n | first4 = R.

UV radiation is present in [[sunlight]], and constitutes about 10% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. It is also produced by [[electric arc]]s and specialized lights, such as [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, [[tanning lamp]]s, and [[black light]]s. Although long-wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an [[ionizing radiation]] because its [[photon]]s lack the energy to [[ionization|ionize]] [[atom]]s, it can cause [[chemical reaction]]s and causes many substances to glow or [[fluorescence|fluoresce]]. Consequently, the chemical and biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules.\n\nShort-wave ultraviolet light damages [[DNA]] and sterilizes surfaces with which it comes into contact. For humans, [[Sun tanning|suntan]] and [[sunburn]] are familiar effects of exposure of the skin to UV light, along with an increased risk of [[skin cancer]]. The amount of UV light produced by the Sun means that the Earth would not be able to sustain life on dry land if most of that light were not filtered out by the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=2009-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127004149/http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html |archivedate=27 January 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> More energetic, shorter-wavelength \"extreme\" UV below 121&nbsp;nm ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haigh |first=Joanna D. |date=2007 |title=The Sun and the Earth's Climate: Absorption of solar spectral radiation by the atmosphere |journal=Living Reviews in Solar Physics |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=2 |url=http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrsp-2007-2&amp;page=articlesu8.html |accessdate=July 12, 2014 |doi=10.12942/lrsp-2007-2 |bibcode=2007LRSP....4....2H |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050402/http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrsp-2007-2&page=articlesu8.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, ultraviolet light (specifically, UVB) is also responsible for the formation of bone-strengthening [[vitamin D]] in most land vertebrates, including humans.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wacker |first=Matthias |last2=Holick |first2=Michael F. |date=2013-01-01 |title=Sunlight and Vitamin D|journal=Dermato-endocrinology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=51\u2013108 |doi=10.4161/derm.24494 |issn=1938-1972 |pmc=3897598 |pmid=24494042}}</ref> The UV spectrum thus has effects both beneficial and harmful to life.\n\nThe lower wavelength limit of human vision is conventionally taken as 400&nbsp;nm, so ultraviolet rays are invisible to humans, although some people can perceive light at slightly shorter wavelengths than this.

He called them \"(de-)oxidizing rays\" ({{lang-de|de-oxidierende Strahlen}}) to emphasize [[Reactivity (chemistry)|chemical reactivity]] and to distinguish them from \"heat rays\", [[Infrared#History of infrared science|discovered the previous year]] at the other end of the visible spectrum. The simpler term \"chemical rays\" was adopted soon afterwards, and remained popular throughout the 19th century, although some said that this radiation was entirely different from light (notably [[John William Draper]], who named them \"tithonic rays\"<ref>\"On a new Imponderable Substance and on a Class of Chemical Rays analogous to the rays of Dark Heat\", J.W.

Many approaches seek to adapt visible light-sensing devices, but these can suffer from unwanted response to visible light and various instabilities. Ultraviolet can be detected by suitable [[photodiode]]s and [[photocathode]]s, which can be tailored to be sensitive to different parts of the UV spectrum. Sensitive ultraviolet [[photomultiplier]]s are available. [[Spectrometer]]s and [[radiometer]]s are made for measurement of UV radiation. Silicon detectors are used across the spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ts.nist.gov/MeasurementServices/Calibrations/upload/JES-80.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109215922/http://ts.nist.gov/MeasurementServices/Calibrations/upload/JES-80.PDF|archivedate=2009-01-09 |title=Gullikson, Korde, Canfield, Vest, \" Stable Silicon Photodiodes for absolute intensity measurements in the VU V and soft x-ray regions\", |journal=Jrnl of Elec.

Scientific instruments can therefore utilize this spectral range by operating in an oxygen-free atmosphere (commonly pure nitrogen), without the need for costly vacuum chambers. Significant examples include 193&nbsp;nm [[photolithography]] equipment (for [[semiconductor manufacturing]]) and [[circular dichroism]] spectrometers.\n\nTechnology for VUV instrumentation was largely driven by solar astronomy for many decades. While optics can be used to remove unwanted visible light that contaminates the VUV, in general, detectors can be limited by their response to non-VUV radiation, and the development of \"solar-blind\" devices has been an important area of research. Wide-gap solid-state devices or vacuum devices with high-cutoff photocathodes can be attractive compared to silicon diodes.\n\nExtreme UV (EUV or sometimes XUV) is characterized by a transition in the physics of interaction with matter. Wavelengths longer than about 30&nbsp;nm interact mainly with the outer [[valence electron]]s of atoms, while wavelengths shorter than that interact mainly with inner-shell electrons and nuclei. The long end of the EUV spectrum is set by a prominent He<sup>+</sup> spectral line at 30.4&nbsp;nm. EUV is strongly absorbed by most known materials, but it is possible to synthesize [[multilayer optics]] that reflect up to about 50 percent of EUV radiation at [[normal incidence]]. This technology was pioneered by the [[NIXT]] and [[MSSTA]] sounding rockets in the 1990s, and it has been used to make telescopes for solar imaging.

UVA can generate highly reactive chemical intermediates, such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals, which in turn can damage DNA. The DNA damage caused indirectly to skin by UVA consists mostly of single-strand breaks in DNA, while the damage caused by UVB includes direct formation of [[thymine dimer]]s or [[cytosine dimer]]s and double-strand DNA breakage.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22271212 | doi=10.1007/s00403-012-1212-x | title=DNA damage after acute exposure of mice skin to physiological doses of UVB and UVA light |date=January 2012 | journal=Arch Dermatol Res |vauthors=Svobodov\u00e1 AR, Galand\u00e1kov\u00e1 A, Siansk\u00e1 J |display-authors=etal | volume=304 | issue=5 | pages=407\u2013412| url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/293c53cde0110f934299f53da3be1db00e6b352d }}</ref> UVA is immunosuppressive for the entire body (accounting for a large part of the immunosuppressive effects of sunlight exposure), and is mutagenic for basal cell keratinocytes in skin.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22123419 | doi=10.1016/j.sder.2011.08.002 | volume=30 | issue=4 | title=Ultraviolet A radiation: its role in immunosuppression and carcinogenesis |date=December 2011 | journal=Semin Cutan Med Surg | pages=214\u201321 |vauthors=Halliday GM, Byrne SN, Damian DL }}</ref>\n\nUVB photons can cause direct DNA damage. UVB radiation [[excited state|excites]] DNA molecules in skin cells, causing aberrant [[covalent bond]]s to form between adjacent [[pyrimidine]] bases, producing a [[pyrimidine dimers|dimer]]. Most UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA are removed by the process known as [[nucleotide excision repair]] that employs about 30 different proteins.<ref name=\"autogenerated145\"/> Those pyrimidine dimers that escape this repair process can induce a form of programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) or can cause DNA replication errors leading to [[mutation]].\n\nAs a defense against UV radiation, the amount of the brown pigment [[melanin]] in the skin increases when exposed to moderate (depending on [[human skin color|skin type]]) levels of radiation; this is commonly known as a [[sun tan]]. The purpose of melanin is to absorb UV radiation and dissipate the energy as harmless heat, protecting the skin against both [[direct DNA damage|direct]] and [[indirect DNA damage]] from the UV. UVA gives a quick tan that lasts for days by oxidizing melanin that was already present and triggers the release of the [[melanin]] from melanocytes. UVB yields a tan that takes roughly 2 days to develop because it stimulates the body to produce more melanin.\n\n===== Sunscreen safety debate =====\n{{Main|Sunscreen}}\n\n[[File:UV and Vis Sunscreen.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration of the effect of sunscreen.

The addition of UV absorbers inhibits the effect.\n[[File:Irspec2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|IR spectrum showing carbonyl absorption due to UV degradation of [[polyethylene]]]]\n\nSensitive polymers include [[thermoplastic]]s and speciality fibers like [[aramid]]s. UV absorption leads to chain degradation and loss of strength at sensitive points in the chain structure. Aramid rope must be shielded with a sheath of thermoplastic if it is to retain its strength.\n\nMany [[pigments]] and [[dyes]] absorb UV and change colour, so [[paintings]] and textiles may need extra protection both from sunlight and fluorescent bulbs, two common sources of UV radiation. Window glass absorbs some harmful UV, but valuable artifacts need extra shielding. Many museums place black curtains over [[watercolour painting]]s and ancient textiles, for example. Since watercolours can have very low pigment levels, they need extra protection from UV. Various forms of [[picture framing glass]], including acrylics (plexiglass), laminates, and coatings, offer different degrees of UV (and visible light) protection.\n\n==Applications==\nBecause of its ability to cause chemical reactions and excite [[fluorescence]] in materials, ultraviolet radiation has a number of applications.

Slightly yellow UV-blocking filters are often used for outdoor photography to prevent unwanted bluing and overexposure by UV rays. For photography in the near UV, special filters may be used. Photography with wavelengths shorter than 350&nbsp;nm requires special quartz lenses which do not absorb the radiation.\nDigital cameras sensors may have internal filters that block UV to improve color rendition accuracy. Sometimes these internal filters can be removed, or they may be absent, and an external visible-light filter prepares the camera for near-UV photography. A few cameras are designed for use in the UV.\n\nPhotography by reflected ultraviolet radiation is useful for medical, scientific, and forensic investigations, in applications as widespread as detecting bruising of skin, alterations of documents, or restoration work on paintings. Photography of the fluorescence produced by ultraviolet illumination uses visible wavelengths of light.\n\n[[File:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|thumb|right|Aurora (phenomenon)|Aurora at [[Jupiter]]'s north pole as seen in ultraviolet light by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\nIn [[ultraviolet astronomy]], measurements are used to discern the chemical composition of the interstellar medium, and the temperature and composition of stars.

The blue light emitted by these agents counteracts yellow tints that may be present and causes the colors and whites to appear whiter or more brightly colored.\n\nUV fluorescent dyes that glow in the primary colors are used in paints, papers, and textiles either to enhance color under daylight illumination or to provide special effects when lit with UV lamps. [[Blacklight paint]]s that contain dyes that glow under UV are used in a number of art and aesthetic applications.\n\nAmusement parks often use UV lighting to fluoresce ride artwork and backdrops. This often has the side effect of causing rider's white clothing to glow light-purple.\n\n[[File:RBC Visa UV.jpg|right|thumb|A bird appears on many Visa credit cards when they are held under a UV light source]]\nTo help prevent [[counterfeiting]] of currency, or forgery of important documents such as driver's licenses and [[passports]], the paper may include a UV [[watermark]] or fluorescent multicolor fibers that are visible under ultraviolet light. Postage stamps are [[Phosphor banded stamp|tagged]] with a phosphor that glows under UV rays to permit automatic detection of the stamp and facing of the letter.\n\nUV fluorescent [[dye]]s are used in many applications (for example, [[biochemistry]] and [[Forensic science|forensics]]). Some brands of [[pepper spray]] will leave an invisible chemical (UV dye) that is not easily washed off on a pepper-sprayed attacker, which would help police identify the attacker later.\n\nIn some types of [[nondestructive testing]] UV stimulates fluorescent dyes to highlight defects in a broad range of materials.

UV radiation is often used to excite a given sample where the fluorescent emission is measured with a [[spectrofluorometer]]. In biological research, UV radiation is used for [[quantification of nucleic acids]] or [[protein]]s.\n[[File:Fluorescent minerals hg.jpg|thumb|right|A collection of mineral samples brilliantly fluorescing at various wavelengths as seen while being irradiated by UV light.]]\n\nUltraviolet lamps are also used in analyzing [[mineral]]s and [[gemstone|gems]].\n\nIn pollution control applications, ultraviolet analyzers are used to detect emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur compounds, mercury, and ammonia, for example in the flue gas of fossil-fired power plants.<ref>N. E. Battikha (ed), ''The Condensed Handbook of Measurement and Control 3rd Ed.'' ISA 2007 {{ISBN|1-55617-995-2}}, pp. 65\u201366</ref> Ultraviolet radiation can detect thin sheens of [[oil spill|spilled oil]] on water, either by the high reflectivity of oil films at UV wavelengths, fluorescence of compounds in oil or by absorbing of UV created by [[Raman scattering]] in water.<ref>Mervin Fingas (ed.) ''Oil Spill Science and Technology'' Elsevier, 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-85617-943-0}} pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\n===Material science uses===\n\n====Fire detection====\n{{see also|Flame detector}}\nIn general, ultraviolet detectors use either a solid-state device, such as one based on [[silicon carbide]] or [[aluminium nitride]], or a gas-filled tube as the sensing element. UV detectors that are sensitive to UV in any part of the spectrum respond to irradiation by [[sunlight]] and [[artificial light]]. A burning hydrogen flame, for instance, radiates strongly in the 185- to 260-nanometer range and only very weakly in the [[Infrared|IR]] region, whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the UV band yet very strongly at IR wavelengths; thus, a fire detector that operates using both UV and IR detectors is more reliable than one with a UV detector alone. Virtually all fires emit some [[thermal radiation|radiation]] in the UVC band, whereas the [[Sun]]'s radiation at this band is absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The result is that the UV detector is \"solar blind\", meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the Sun, so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors.\n\nUV detectors are sensitive to most fires, including [[hydrocarbon]]s, metals, [[sulfur]], [[hydrogen]], [[hydrazine]], and [[ammonia]]. [[Arc welding]], electrical arcs, [[lightning]], [[X-ray]]s used in nondestructive metal testing equipment (though this is highly unlikely), and radioactive materials can produce levels that will activate a UV detection system. The presence of UV-absorbing gases and vapors will attenuate the UV radiation from a fire, adversely affecting the ability of the detector to detect flames. Likewise, the presence of an oil mist in the air or an oil film on the detector window will have the same effect.\n\n==== Photolithography ====\nUltraviolet radiation is used for very fine resolution [[photolithography]], a procedure wherein a chemical called a photoresist is exposed to UV radiation that has passed through a mask. The exposure causes chemical reactions to occur in the photoresist. After removal of unwanted photoresist, a pattern determined by the mask remains on the sample. Steps may then be taken to \"etch\" away, deposit on or otherwise modify areas of the sample where no photoresist remains.\n\nPhotolithography is used in the manufacture of [[semiconductor]]s, [[integrated circuit]] components,<ref>{{cite web | title = Deep UV Photoresists | url = http://www.almaden.ibm.com/st/chemistry/lithography/deep_uv/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060312012823/http://www.almaden.ibm.com/st/chemistry/lithography/deep_uv/ | archivedate = 2006-03-12}}</ref> and [[printed circuit board]]s. Photolithography processes used to fabricate electronic integrated circuits presently use 193&nbsp;nm UV and are experimentally using 13.5&nbsp;nm UV for [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]].\n\n====Polymers====\nElectronic components that require clear transparency for light to exit or enter (photovoltaic panels and sensors) can be potted using acrylic resins that are cured using UV energy. The advantages are low VOC emissions and rapid curing.\n\n[[File:UV effect on finished wood.jpg|thumb|Effects of UV on finished surfaces in 0, 20 and 43 hours.]]\nCertain inks, coatings, and [[adhesive]]s are formulated with photoinitiators and resins. When exposed to UV light, [[polymerization]] occurs, and so the adhesives harden or cure, usually within a few seconds. Applications include glass and plastic bonding, [[optical fiber]] coatings, the coating of flooring, [[UV coating]] and paper finishes in offset [[printing]], dental fillings, and decorative fingernail \"gels\".\n\nUV sources for UV curing applications include [[UV lamps]], UV [[LED]]s, and [[Excimer]] flash lamps. Fast processes such as flexo or offset printing require high-intensity light focused via reflectors onto a moving substrate and medium so high-pressure [[Mercury (element)|Hg]] (mercury) or [[Iron|Fe]] (iron, doped)-based bulbs are used, energized with electric arcs or microwaves. Lower-power fluorescent lamps and LEDs can be used for static applications. Small high-pressure lamps can have light focused and transmitted to the work area via liquid-filled or fiber-optic light guides.\n\nThe impact of UV on polymers is used for modification of the ([[surface roughness|roughness]] and [[hydrophobicity]]) of polymer surfaces. For example, a [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]] surface can be smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=R. V. Lapshin|author2=A. P. Alekhin|author3=A. G. Kirilenko|author4=S. L.

Polymers exposed to UV will oxidize, thus raising the [[surface energy]] of the polymer. Once the surface energy of the polymer has been raised, the bond between the adhesive and the polymer is stronger.\n\n===Biology-related uses===\n\n====Air purification====\nUsing a [[Photocatalysis|catalytic chemical reaction]] from [[titanium dioxide]] and UVC exposure, [[oxidation]] of organic matter converts [[pathogens]], [[pollens]], and [[mold]] [[spores]] into harmless inert byproducts. However, the reaction of titanium dioxide and UVC is not a straight path.  Several hundreds of reactions occur prior to the inert byproducts stage and can hinder the resulting reaction creating formaldehyde, aldehyde, and other VOC's en route to a final stage.  Thus, the use of Titanium Dioxide and UVC requires very specific parameters for a successful outcome. The cleansing mechanism of UV is a photochemical process. Contaminants in the indoor environment are almost entirely organic carbon-based compounds, which break down when exposed to high-intensity UV at 240 to 280&nbsp;nm. Short-wave ultraviolet radiation can destroy DNA in living microorganisms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bestledgrowlightsinfo.com/the-importance-of-uv-light-for-plants-cultivated-indoors/|title=The Importance of UV Light for Plants Cultivated Indoors|date=2017-06-11|work=Best LED Grow Lights Info|access-date=2017-06-24|language=en-US}}</ref> UVC's effectiveness is directly related to intensity and exposure time.\n\nUV has also been shown to reduce gaseous contaminants such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scott|first1=K.J. |last2=Wills|first2=R.R.H. |last3=Patterson|first3=B.D. |year=1971 |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740220916 |title= Removal by ultra-violet lamp of ethylene and other hydrocarbons produced by bananas |volume=22|pages=496\u20137|issue=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scott|first1=KJ |last2=Wills|first2=RBH |title=Atmospheric pollutants destroyed in an ultra violet scrubber |year=1973 |journal=Laboratory Practice|volume=22 |issue=2|pages=103\u20136 |pmid=4688707}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shorter|first1=AJ |last2=Scott|first2=KJ |year=1986|title=Removal of ethylene from air and low oxygen atmospheres with ultra violet radiation|journal=Lebensm-Wiss U Technology |volume=19|pages=176\u20139}}</ref> UV lamps radiating at 184 and 254&nbsp;nm can remove low concentrations of [[hydrocarbons]] and [[carbon monoxide]] if the air is recycled between the room and the lamp chamber.

Commercially available low-pressure [[mercury-vapor lamps]] emit about 86% of their radiation at 254 nanometers (nm), with 265&nbsp;nm being the peak germicidal effectiveness curve. UV at these germicidal wavelengths damage a microorganism's DNA so that it cannot reproduce, making it harmless, (even though the organism may not be killed). Since microorganisms can be shielded from ultraviolet rays in small cracks and other shaded areas, these lamps are used only as a supplement to other sterilization techniques.\n\nUV-C LEDs are relatively new to the commercial market and are gaining in popularity.{{Not in citation given|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Welch, David |display-authors=et al |title=Far-UVC light: A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=8|issue=1|pages=2752|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-21058-w|pmid=29426899|pmc=5807439|issn=2045-2322|date=January 2018|accessdate=|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.2752W}}</ref> Due to their monochromatic nature (\u00b1 5&nbsp;nm){{Not in citation given|date=April 2020}} these LEDs can target a specific wavelength needed for disinfection.

Many fruits, flowers, and seeds stand out more strongly from the background in ultraviolet wavelengths as compared to human color vision. Scorpions glow or take on a yellow to green color under UV illumination, thus assisting in the control of these arachnids. Many birds have patterns in their plumage that are invisible at usual wavelengths but observable in ultraviolet, and the urine and other secretions of some animals, including dogs, cats, and human beings, are much easier to spot with ultraviolet. Urine trails of rodents can be detected by pest control technicians for proper treatment of infested dwellings.\n\nButterflies use ultraviolet as a [[Ultraviolet communication in butterflies|communication system]] for sex recognition and mating behavior. For example, in the ''[[Colias eurytheme]]'' butterfly, males rely on visual cues to locate and identify females. Instead of using chemical stimuli to find mates, males are attracted to the ultraviolet-reflecting color of female hind wings.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silberglied | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Orley R. | year = 1978 | title = Ultraviolet Reflection and Its Behavioral Role in the Courtship of the Sulfur Butterflies Colias eurytheme and C. philodice (Lepidoptera, Pieridae) | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 203\u201343 | doi=10.1007/bf00296311}}</ref>  In ''[[Pieris napi]]'' butterflies it was shown that females in northern Finland with less UV-radiation present in the environment possessed stronger UV signals to attract their males than those occurring further south.

UV-capable spectrophotometers are common in such laboratories.\n\nUltraviolet traps called [[bug zapper]]s are used to eliminate various small flying insects. They are attracted to the UV and are killed using an electric shock, or trapped once they come into contact with the device. Different designs of ultraviolet radiation traps are also used by [[entomologists]] for [[collecting]] [[nocturnal]] insects during [[fauna|faunistic]] survey studies.\n\n====Therapy====\n{{main|Ultraviolet light therapy}}\nUltraviolet radiation is helpful in the treatment of [[skin conditions]] such as [[psoriasis]] and [[vitiligo]]. Exposure to UVA, while the skin is hyper-photosensitive, by taking [[psoralen]]s is an effective treatment for [[psoriasis]]. Due to the potential of [[psoralens]] to cause damage to the [[liver]], [[PUVA therapy]] may be used only a limited number of times over a patient's lifetime.\n\nUVB phototherapy does not require additional medications or topical preparations for the therapeutic benefit; only the exposure is needed. However, phototherapy can be effective when used in conjunction with certain topical treatments such as anthralin, coal tar, and vitamin A and D derivatives, or systemic treatments such as methotrexate and Soriatane.<ref>\n{{cite web |title = UVB Phototherapy |url = http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/phototherapy/uvb.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622180124/http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/phototherapy/uvb.php |archivedate=22 June 2007 |format=php |accessdate=2007-09-23 |publisher=National Psoriasis Foundation, USA}}</ref>\n\n====Herpetology====\n[[Reptile]]s need UVB for biosynthesis of vitamin D, and other metabolic processes.  Specifically [[cholecalciferol]] (vitamin D3),  which is needed to for basic cellular / neural functioning as well as the utilization calcium for bone and egg production. The UVA wavelength is also visible to many reptiles and might play a significant role in their ability survive in the wild as well as visual communication between individuals.  Therefore, in a typical reptile enclosure, a fluorescent UV a/b source (at the proper strength / spectrum for the species),  must be available for many captive species to survive.  Simple supplementation with [[cholecalciferol]]  (Vitamin D3) will not be enough as there's a complete biosynthetic pathway that is \"leapfrogged\"  (risks of possible overdoses), the intermediate molecules and metabolites also play important functions in the animals health.  Natural sunlight in the right levels is always going to be superior to artificial sources, but this might not be possible for keepers in different parts of the world.\n\nIt is a known problem that high levels of output of the UVa part of the spectrum can both cause cellular and DNA damage to sensitive parts of their bodies - especially the eyes were blindness is the result from an improper UVa/b source use and placement [[photokeratitis]].   For many keepers there must also be a provision for an adequate heat source this has resulted in the marketing of heat and light \"combination\" products.   Keepers should be careful of these \"combination' light/ heat and UVa/b generators, they typically emit high levels of UVa with lower levels of UVb that are set and difficult to control so that animals can have their needs met.   A better strategy is to use individual sources of these elements and so they can be placed and controlled by the keepers for the max benefit of the animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uvguide.co.uk/vitdpathway.htm|title=Vitamin D and Ultraviolet Light \u2013 a remarkable process|last=|first=|date=|website=UV Guide UK|access-date=2017-01-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531172209/http://www.uvguide.co.uk/vitdpathway.htm|archivedate=31 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Evolutionary significance==\nThe evolution of early reproductive [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]] is attributed in modern models of [[evolutionary theory]] to ultraviolet radiation. UVB causes [[thymine]] base pairs next to each other in genetic sequences to bond together into [[thymine dimers]], a disruption in the strand that reproductive enzymes cannot copy. This leads to [[frameshifting]] during genetic replication and [[protein synthesis]], usually killing the cell. Before formation of the UV-blocking ozone layer, when early prokaryotes approached the surface of the ocean, they almost invariably died out. The few that survived had developed enzymes that monitored the genetic material and removed [[thymine dimer]]s by [[nucleotide excision repair]] enzymes. Many enzymes and proteins involved in modern [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are similar to repair enzymes, and are believed to be evolved modifications of the enzymes originally used to overcome DNA damages caused by UV.<ref>{{Cite book\n |author1=Margulis, Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion\n |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Origins of Sex: Three Billion Years of Genetic Recombination\n | version = 1\n | publisher = Yale University Press\n |year=1986\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=3hDVTEk3ioIC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&dq=origins+of+sex:+three\n | isbn = 978-0-300-04619-9\n | format = book\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[High-energy visible light]]\n* [[Ultraviolet catastrophe]]\n* [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]\n* [[Ultraviolet index]]\n* [[UV stabilizers in plastics]]\n* [[Weather testing of polymers]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite journal\n | last = Hu\n | first = S\n | last2 = Ma\n | first2 = F\n | last3 = Collado-Mesa\n | first3 = F\n | last4 = Kirsner\n | first4 = R.

It was originally broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 4 November 2009. The episode was written by [[Ben Richards (writer)|Ben Richards]] and directed by Alrick Riley. It continues from the seventh series finale, where [[Harry Pearce|Sir Harry Pearce]] ([[Peter Firth]]) is willingly captured by Viktor Sarkisiian ([[Peter Sullivan (actor)|Peter Sullivan]]). In this episode, Harry is taken by Amish Mani ([[Ace Bhatti]]), a former Indian intelligence officer, who wants Harry to reveal the location of a secret [[uranium]] shipment he knows the location of, in order to build [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nThe episode marks the return of [[Nicola Walker]] as [[Ruth Evershed]], who departed in the fifth series. Although there was media coverage on her return months before the broadcast of the episode, the producers were confident that only the \"die hard\" fans would be aware of this. It also marked the last regular appearance of [[Hugh Simon]] as [[Malcolm Wynn-Jones]]. The episode was filmed in April 2009 and was partially shot on location in [[Dei\u00e0]], [[Majorca]]. The episode was seen by over six million viewers in the United Kingdom, a quarter of the television audience during its time slot. Critics praised Ruth's return, though reactions towards the overall episode were mixed.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing his abduction, Viktor Sarkisiian sells Harry to Amish Mani in order to start a new life outside the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]]. However, Mani does not hold his end of the deal and kills Sarkisiian and his team. His men then pose as members of extremist group, the Sacred Army for Righteous Vengeance, and supposedly execute him. When [[MI5]] later intercepts the footage of his execution from the [[Internet]], the team are divided between those who believe it is genuine, and those who believe it is faked. Malcolm later discovers that one of the \"terrorists\" said a curse word in [[Malayalam]], the language of the [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]]. Because there is no history with SARV from that particular region, the team question whether or not the terrorists are from SARV. Furthermore, when they find the house where the execution was filmed, forensics find several traces of [[blood]], none of which match Harry's DNA, indicating he is still alive.\n\nMeanwhile in [[Polis, Cyprus]], Ruth is living at peace with husband George (Daniel Rabib) and stepson Nico (Luke Tzortzis). When she notices men are out to capture her, she and her family flee to [[London]]. Upon returning to the Grid, Ruth believes Harry was kidnapped because of a secret operation in which he, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] officer Stephen Hillier (Andrew Scarborough), former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] liaison Libby McCall ([[Paul Birchard]]) and Mani intend to vindicate the [[Iraq War]] by planting weapons-grade [[uranium]] in [[Baghdad]] and later \"discover\" it, though Harry would later pull the operation and safeguard the shipment at a secret location only he and Ruth know; those who kidnapped Harry wish to acquire the uranium to create [[nuclear weapon]]s. Soon, while being transferred to a [[safe house]], Ruth is captured and brought to Harry, while George and Nico are taken to the safe house unaware of what is happening. To save them, Ruth reveals the uranium is at a base in [[Norfolk]], however Mani reveals he searched the base and it is no longer there, and hence orders George's execution.\n\n[[Ros Myers]] ([[Hermione Norris]]) confronts Hillier, but the latter is assassinated by McCall before he can divulge the location of the safe house. Malcolm finds the safe house and arrives there, offering himself in exchange for Nico. Meanwhile, [[Lucas North]] ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]) persuaded McCall's replacement, Sarah Caufield ([[Genevieve O'Reilly]]), to have a tracker implanted on McCall. The team follow him to the warehouse and arrest him. Witnessing this, Mani tells his man to kill Nico, though Malcolm is able to talk him out of it. As Mani prepares to kill Ruth, Lucas arrives in time to kill him. In the end, Malcolm wishes to [[retirement|retire]], telling Harry he is \"dog tired\"; Harry allows it.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and casting===\n{{rquote|right|''I walked through the doors onto the grid and thought it would be exactly the same, but of course everything has changed, I kept walking into rooms thinking they were cupboards or toilets but they've become other rooms since I left.''|[[Nicola Walker]] on her return to ''Spooks''<ref name=nwreturn/>}}\n\nThe episode marks the return of Ruth Evershed since her departure halfway through series five. Actress Nicola Walker left the series to raise her baby. When Walker was asked to return, she took \"about half a second to say yes.\" Upon returning, she noticed that the Grid set changed since her initial departure.<ref name=nwreturn>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/television-in-wales/2009/11/01/spooks-reunited-91466-25059924/ |title=Spooks reunited |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2010 |work=WalesOnline |publisher=[[Media Wales]]}}</ref> Because there was media coverage reporting Walker's return, the producers believed that the shock of her return would be hindered somewhat, but also believed only the \"die hard\" fans of the series would be aware of it. [[Ace Bhatti]], who portrayed the episode's primary antagonist Amish Mani, was cast because the producers were impressed by his highly convincing and relaxed acting style, which they felt would establish his role in the episode.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\nPaul Birchard was cast as Libby McCall because the producers believed he acted like a \"dinosaur\" from the former [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. Child actor Luke Tzortzis was cast as Nico since they were impressed with his intelligence and the fact he is a \"strong\" actor; children are often hard to work with in the series, but in Tzortzis' case, he would ask the production crew several questions between takes in order to do understand what he is to do in the episode. It was also Tzortzis' first performance as an actor, having no past experiences.<ref name=\"ac_801\">{{cite video |people=Fry, Chris; Riley, Alrick |date=2010 |title=Audio Commentary for \"Episode 1\" |medium=Spooks: Series 8 DVD, Disc 1 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Ben Richards (writer)|Ben Richards]] wrote the episode. The main focus for the first ten minutes of the episode was the debate of whether Harry would be dead or alive. The producers decided to tease the audience by showing Harry alive, but then show him apparently executed before the main title sequence, which would make them question whether or not he survived. The producers also wanted to reflect this to the characters, and divide them between if the execution was real or fake. This development was not originally included in the script, and filming was already completed at the time. However, according to director Alrick Riley, Richards was quickly able to write those new scenes \"seamlessly\" into the rest of the episode, which is usually a difficult task to perform. Richards also added hints in the script that Malcolm would be leaving by the end. The primary plot of the episode were hard to do, but producer Chris Fry noted that Richards was able to execute the plot very well. Elsewhere, the episode would show Ruth living happily in Cyprus and then be quickly drawn back into the world of MI5 back at a \"dark\" and \"grim\" London. The conversations between Malcolm and Ruth were all [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|automated dialogue replacement]]. Following the writing, Walker and Peter Firth were highly looking forward to play their scenes together again.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[File:Alconasser 1.jpg|thumb|A few scenes were shot on location in [[Dei\u00e0]], [[Majorca]], which the producers believed was a suitable surrogate for [[Cyprus]].]]\nFilming took place throughout April 2009. Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set to give it more of a [[concrete]], underground [[bunker]], feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting [[High-definition television|high-definition]] cameras, the ''Spooks'' producers decided to continue using hand held [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] ones, which were more compact and flexible; the producers felt that using high-definition cameras would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow the crew to film one long take following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London [[apartment|flat]]. High-definition cameras would lose that ability.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\nTwo days were dedicated towards shooting the pre-title sequence. It was filmed on location at [[Hedsor House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. The helicopter scenes took place inside an actual helicopter taking flight with some cast members on board, which would make the sequence more genuine as opposed to having the cast members sitting inside next to a [[chroma key|green screen]]. The fight sequences between Sarkisiian's and Mani's men were orchestrated and performed by stunt coordinator Chrispin Leyfield and his stunt team, as there was very little time to train conventional actors. Director Alrick Riley wanted the fight sequences to be performed in the same style as in the [[Jason Bourne]] [[Bourne (film series)|films]]. The abandoned warehouse used to hold Harry and Ruth were filmed in an abandoned leather factory near [[London Bridge]]. One of the meetings between Lucas and Sarah Caufield were originally intended to be shot on the [[London Eye]], a location the producers had never used before. However, due to restrictions the filming crew felt they could not follow, it was shot in [[South Bank]], opposite the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]], instead.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\nThe scenes set in Cyprus were filmed on location in [[Dei\u00e0]], a coastal village in the island of [[Majorca]]. Previously working on a film using the same location, producer Chris Fry chose the village because he felt it was the closest to the UK the crew can get to mimic the hot, [[Mediterranean]] feel of Cyprus. Because filming abroad tend to be costly for a BBC budget, the producers kept costs down as much as possible by using a limited crew with some local help. Much of the original script was to take place inside a house, but because there were no [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffers]] responsible for lighting, and that the weather was decent, filming took place primarily outside because of the natural sunlight. The filming crew spent four days at the end of April shooting in Majorca.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\nJamie Pearson was responsible for editing the episode. The sequence where Lucas rescues Harry and Ruth near the end were made in [[slow motion]], because the producers felt it would add to the tension. The [[incidental music]] was composed by [[Paul Leonard-Morgan]]. The computer graphics on the episode were designed by Mark Doman. The producers ended up being receptive of both Morgan and Doman's work, because of their ability to help interpret the story via the music, and computers, respectively.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\n===Broadcast and ratings===\nThe episode was originally broadcast on [[BBC One]], during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot on Wednesday, 4 November 2009, and later repeated on [[BBC Three]] at 12:15 am on 5 November.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mf4b/episodes/2009 |title=BBC \u2013 BBC One Programmes \u2013 Spooks \u2013 Episodes from 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Online]]}}</ref> Upon its original broadcast, the episode received unofficial overnight viewing figures of 6 million and an audience share of 25 per cent.

Critics praised Ruth's return, though reactions towards the overall episode were mixed.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing his abduction, Viktor Sarkisiian sells Harry to Amish Mani in order to start a new life outside the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]]. However, Mani does not hold his end of the deal and kills Sarkisiian and his team. His men then pose as members of extremist group, the Sacred Army for Righteous Vengeance, and supposedly execute him. When [[MI5]] later intercepts the footage of his execution from the [[Internet]], the team are divided between those who believe it is genuine, and those who believe it is faked. Malcolm later discovers that one of the \"terrorists\" said a curse word in [[Malayalam]], the language of the [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]]. Because there is no history with SARV from that particular region, the team question whether or not the terrorists are from SARV. Furthermore, when they find the house where the execution was filmed, forensics find several traces of [[blood]], none of which match Harry's DNA, indicating he is still alive.\n\nMeanwhile in [[Polis, Cyprus]], Ruth is living at peace with husband George (Daniel Rabib) and stepson Nico (Luke Tzortzis). When she notices men are out to capture her, she and her family flee to [[London]]. Upon returning to the Grid, Ruth believes Harry was kidnapped because of a secret operation in which he, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] officer Stephen Hillier (Andrew Scarborough), former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] liaison Libby McCall ([[Paul Birchard]]) and Mani intend to vindicate the [[Iraq War]] by planting weapons-grade [[uranium]] in [[Baghdad]] and later \"discover\" it, though Harry would later pull the operation and safeguard the shipment at a secret location only he and Ruth know; those who kidnapped Harry wish to acquire the uranium to create [[nuclear weapon]]s. Soon, while being transferred to a [[safe house]], Ruth is captured and brought to Harry, while George and Nico are taken to the safe house unaware of what is happening. To save them, Ruth reveals the uranium is at a base in [[Norfolk]], however Mani reveals he searched the base and it is no longer there, and hence orders George's execution.\n\n[[Ros Myers]] ([[Hermione Norris]]) confronts Hillier, but the latter is assassinated by McCall before he can divulge the location of the safe house. Malcolm finds the safe house and arrives there, offering himself in exchange for Nico. Meanwhile, [[Lucas North]] ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]) persuaded McCall's replacement, Sarah Caufield ([[Genevieve O'Reilly]]), to have a tracker implanted on McCall. The team follow him to the warehouse and arrest him. Witnessing this, Mani tells his man to kill Nico, though Malcolm is able to talk him out of it. As Mani prepares to kill Ruth, Lucas arrives in time to kill him. In the end, Malcolm wishes to [[retirement|retire]], telling Harry he is \"dog tired\"; Harry allows it.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and casting===\n{{rquote|right|''I walked through the doors onto the grid and thought it would be exactly the same, but of course everything has changed, I kept walking into rooms thinking they were cupboards or toilets but they've become other rooms since I left.''|[[Nicola Walker]] on her return to ''Spooks''<ref name=nwreturn/>}}\n\nThe episode marks the return of Ruth Evershed since her departure halfway through series five. Actress Nicola Walker left the series to raise her baby. When Walker was asked to return, she took \"about half a second to say yes.\" Upon returning, she noticed that the Grid set changed since her initial departure.<ref name=nwreturn>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/television-in-wales/2009/11/01/spooks-reunited-91466-25059924/ |title=Spooks reunited |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2010 |work=WalesOnline |publisher=[[Media Wales]]}}</ref> Because there was media coverage reporting Walker's return, the producers believed that the shock of her return would be hindered somewhat, but also believed only the \"die hard\" fans of the series would be aware of it. [[Ace Bhatti]], who portrayed the episode's primary antagonist Amish Mani, was cast because the producers were impressed by his highly convincing and relaxed acting style, which they felt would establish his role in the episode.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\nPaul Birchard was cast as Libby McCall because the producers believed he acted like a \"dinosaur\" from the former [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. Child actor Luke Tzortzis was cast as Nico since they were impressed with his intelligence and the fact he is a \"strong\" actor; children are often hard to work with in the series, but in Tzortzis' case, he would ask the production crew several questions between takes in order to do understand what he is to do in the episode. It was also Tzortzis' first performance as an actor, having no past experiences.<ref name=\"ac_801\">{{cite video |people=Fry, Chris; Riley, Alrick |date=2010 |title=Audio Commentary for \"Episode 1\" |medium=Spooks: Series 8 DVD, Disc 1 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Ben Richards (writer)|Ben Richards]] wrote the episode. The main focus for the first ten minutes of the episode was the debate of whether Harry would be dead or alive. The producers decided to tease the audience by showing Harry alive, but then show him apparently executed before the main title sequence, which would make them question whether or not he survived. The producers also wanted to reflect this to the characters, and divide them between if the execution was real or fake. This development was not originally included in the script, and filming was already completed at the time. However, according to director Alrick Riley, Richards was quickly able to write those new scenes \"seamlessly\" into the rest of the episode, which is usually a difficult task to perform. Richards also added hints in the script that Malcolm would be leaving by the end. The primary plot of the episode were hard to do, but producer Chris Fry noted that Richards was able to execute the plot very well. Elsewhere, the episode would show Ruth living happily in Cyprus and then be quickly drawn back into the world of MI5 back at a \"dark\" and \"grim\" London. The conversations between Malcolm and Ruth were all [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|automated dialogue replacement]]. Following the writing, Walker and Peter Firth were highly looking forward to play their scenes together again.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n[[File:Alconasser 1.jpg|thumb|A few scenes were shot on location in [[Dei\u00e0]], [[Majorca]], which the producers believed was a suitable surrogate for [[Cyprus]].]]\nFilming took place throughout April 2009. Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set to give it more of a [[concrete]], underground [[bunker]], feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting [[High-definition television|high-definition]] cameras, the ''Spooks'' producers decided to continue using hand held [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] ones, which were more compact and flexible; the producers felt that using high-definition cameras would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow the crew to film one long take following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London [[apartment|flat]]. High-definition cameras would lose that ability.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\nTwo days were dedicated towards shooting the pre-title sequence. It was filmed on location at [[Hedsor House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. The helicopter scenes took place inside an actual helicopter taking flight with some cast members on board, which would make the sequence more genuine as opposed to having the cast members sitting inside next to a [[chroma key|green screen]]. The fight sequences between Sarkisiian's and Mani's men were orchestrated and performed by stunt coordinator Chrispin Leyfield and his stunt team, as there was very little time to train conventional actors. Director Alrick Riley wanted the fight sequences to be performed in the same style as in the [[Jason Bourne]] [[Bourne (film series)|films]]. The abandoned warehouse used to hold Harry and Ruth were filmed in an abandoned leather factory near [[London Bridge]]. One of the meetings between Lucas and Sarah Caufield were originally intended to be shot on the [[London Eye]], a location the producers had never used before. However, due to restrictions the filming crew felt they could not follow, it was shot in [[South Bank]], opposite the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]], instead.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\nThe scenes set in Cyprus were filmed on location in [[Dei\u00e0]], a coastal village in the island of [[Majorca]]. Previously working on a film using the same location, producer Chris Fry chose the village because he felt it was the closest to the UK the crew can get to mimic the hot, [[Mediterranean]] feel of Cyprus. Because filming abroad tend to be costly for a BBC budget, the producers kept costs down as much as possible by using a limited crew with some local help. Much of the original script was to take place inside a house, but because there were no [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffers]] responsible for lighting, and that the weather was decent, filming took place primarily outside because of the natural sunlight. The filming crew spent four days at the end of April shooting in Majorca.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\nJamie Pearson was responsible for editing the episode. The sequence where Lucas rescues Harry and Ruth near the end were made in [[slow motion]], because the producers felt it would add to the tension. The [[incidental music]] was composed by [[Paul Leonard-Morgan]]. The computer graphics on the episode were designed by Mark Doman. The producers ended up being receptive of both Morgan and Doman's work, because of their ability to help interpret the story via the music, and computers, respectively.<ref name=\"ac_801\"/>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\n===Broadcast and ratings===\nThe episode was originally broadcast on [[BBC One]], during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot on Wednesday, 4 November 2009, and later repeated on [[BBC Three]] at 12:15 am on 5 November.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mf4b/episodes/2009 |title=BBC \u2013 BBC One Programmes \u2013 Spooks \u2013 Episodes from 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Online]]}}</ref> Upon its original broadcast, the episode received unofficial overnight viewing figures of 6 million and an audience share of 25 per cent.

The film was produced by [[Bill Barretta]] and written by Debra Frank, Steve L. Hayes, [[Tom Martin (writer)|Tom Martin]], and [[Adam F. Goldberg]] based on a story by Frank and Hayes.\n\nA modernized adaptation of [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the story follows young [[Dorothy Gale]], who works in her Aunt Em's diner, but dreams of becoming a singer somewhere beyond her small Kansas town. Swept up by a tornado, in her [[trailer home]] with pet prawn Toto, she lands in Oz and embarks on a journey to meet the Wizard who can help make her dreams come true.\n\nThe film was co-produced by [[The Muppets Studio]], [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]], and [[Fox 21 Television Studios|Fox Television Studios]], in association with [[The Jim Henson Company]]. Right after Disney bought the rights to The Muppets in 2004, pre-production on ''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'' took place throughout February 2004, and [[Principal photography|filming]] occurred during September 2004. ABC made several changes to the film after the initial script was written, ultimately deciding to adapt plot elements from Baum's original novel rather than the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] musical film, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. As with the preceding [[The Muppets|Muppet]] films, ''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'' became a musical, and included five new songs written and composed by [[Michael Giacchino]]. The special is the first Muppets special without the involvement of veteran performer [[Jerry Nelson]] following his 2004 retirement from physical performing. His characters of [[List of Muppets#Lew Zealand|Lew Zealand]] and [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Sgt. Floyd Pepper|Floyd Pepper]], were respectively performed by [[Bill Barretta]] and [[John Kennedy (puppeteer)|John Kennedy]]. Barretta also debuts as the new permanent performer of [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Dr. Teeth|Dr. Teeth]] due to Kennedy now performing Floyd. The production also marked the feature film debut of [[Eric Jacobson]] as the performer of [[Sam Eagle]], a character originally performed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'' premiered on April 27, 2005 at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. The film's television premiere was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on May 20, 2005, as the final ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]''. The film received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics, who felt that the film was too mature for young audiences and that the cameo scenes and popular culture references were unnecessary.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=September 2018}}\n[[Dorothy Gale]] ([[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]]) is an orphaned teenage girl living in a trailer park in [[Kansas]]. Her [[Aunt Em]] ([[Queen Latifah]]) and [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]] ([[David Alan Grier]]) own a diner, to which Dorothy works for [[room and board]]. Her dream of becoming a singer is slim, but when waiting on some [[Truck driver|trucker]]s Dorothy overhears that the Muppets are conducting a cross-country show called \"Star Hunt\" and are looking for a backup singer. Aunt Em disapproves, but with Uncle Henry's best wishes, she goes to the audition. However, the Muppets are about to end the audition, and Dorothy only manages to give them a demo CD that she created beforehand. In returning home, the [[civil defense siren]]s sound as a [[tornado]] is headed for Dorothy's trailer park. When Aunt Em and Uncle Henry run into the county storm shelter for safety, Dorothy hurries back to her family's mobile home to get [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]], her pet [[prawn]]. She does not make it out in time, and the two are swept by the tornado across the vast fields of Kansas. When Dorothy climbs out of the wreckage, she finds that Toto ([[Pep\u00e9 the King Prawn]]) can talk and that she is no longer in Kansas.\n\nDorothy and Toto discover that they are in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], a small town part of the vast [[Land of Oz]]. After discussing her situation with the town's people, the Munchkins (played by [[Rizzo the Rat]] and the other rats), she learns that the land's ruler the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]], has the power to grant her wish of becoming a famous singer. She meets the [[Good Witch of the North]] ([[Miss Piggy]]), and receives a pair of magic [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]] from the [[Wicked Witch of the East]] (Miss Piggy), the Witch of the North's sister who was killed when Dorothy's trailer fell on her. Soon after, she embarks on a journey with Toto on the [[yellow brick road]] to meet the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the [[Emerald City]], the capital of Oz. On her journey, she meets three creatures: a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] ([[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]]), a [[Tin Woodman|Tin Thing]] ([[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]]), and a [[Cowardly Lion]] ([[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]]). They are also seeking the Wizard of Oz to give them a brain, heart, and courage, respectively. The group meets various obstacles involving a deep gorge where the Kalidah Critics ([[Statler and Waldorf]]) are heckling them and a Poppy Field Club run by [[List of Muppets#Clifford|Clifford]] which nearly puts them to sleep. After arriving at the Emerald City and meeting the Wizard, Dorothy and her friends are sent to retrieve the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]'s magic eye, a tool she uses to see anything she desires in the Land of Oz.\n\nThe group assumes that completing this task will result in the granting of their wishes. The Wicked Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet [[List of Muppets#Additional characters|Foo-Foo]] and her henchman [[List of Muppets#Johnny Fiama and Sal Minella|Johnny Fiama]]. When the Wicked Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 [[American crow|crow]]s of despair, a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that the animals that work for her are unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other [[Winged monkeys|Flying Monkeys]] (played by [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]], [[List of Muppets#Crazy Harry|Crazy Harry]], Black Dog, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'') to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy, Toto and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.\n\nAfter being threatened to be killed by her, Toto calls the Munchkins, who set him and Dorothy free and hold up the witch. During the final battle, it cuts away to a scene where [[Quentin Tarantino]] is having a meeting with Kermit, discussing ideas for how Dorothy can defeat the Wicked Witch of the West. Tarantino's ideas are deemed too expensive and too violent for a Muppet movie, so they agree for Dorothy to do a powerful kick on the witch. Cutting back to the action, Dorothy kicks the witch into her own \"bottled water bath\" which contains tap water (to which she is severely allergic). Angel Marie admitted that he filled the water bottles with tap water to restock them. This action causes the Wicked Witch of the West to melt as Johnny averts Foo-Foo's eyes. With the Wicked Witch of the West dead, Dorothy finds the magic eye floating in the tub unharmed and grabs it.\n\nDorothy gains control of the Flying Monkeys by giving back the group's Magic Biker Cap to Sal Minella. She has Scarecrow and Tin Thing rebuilt by the Flying Monkeys. Then she and her friends travel back to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. When they all storm into the Wizard's room, they discover it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) is just an ordinary man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that she could not see him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really wanted was to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the South]] (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City. She does so, saying \"take me home to Aunt Em\".\n\nShe is then spun by the slippers' charm into Kansas, and, much to her surprise, she finds out that Kermit was looking for her, saying that she had the best voice they heard on the whole search, and that she has been chosen to go on the Star Hunt. Dorothy, having been reunited with her aunt and uncle, and feeling that she is not ready to leave Kansas to become a real star, rejects, but Aunt Em says that she wants her to go with the Muppets on their Star Hunt, much to her even bigger surprise. She then sings \"Good Life\" on television with them at the Muppet Theater as the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]: A [[Kansas]] teen dreaming of leaving her home and becoming a singer.\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as [[Aunt Em]]: Dorothy's aunt and co-owner of the family diner in Kansas.\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]: Dorothy's uncle and co-owner of the family diner.\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as The [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]]: The legendary Wizard of Oz.

The film was produced by [[Bill Barretta]] and written by Debra Frank, Steve L. Hayes, [[Tom Martin (writer)|Tom Martin]], and [[Adam F. Goldberg]] based on a story by Frank and Hayes.\n\nA modernized adaptation of [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the story follows young [[Dorothy Gale]], who works in her Aunt Em's diner, but dreams of becoming a singer somewhere beyond her small Kansas town. Swept up by a tornado, in her [[trailer home]] with pet prawn Toto, she lands in Oz and embarks on a journey to meet the Wizard who can help make her dreams come true.\n\nThe film was co-produced by [[The Muppets Studio]], [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]], and [[Fox 21 Television Studios|Fox Television Studios]], in association with [[The Jim Henson Company]]. Right after Disney bought the rights to The Muppets in 2004, pre-production on ''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'' took place throughout February 2004, and [[Principal photography|filming]] occurred during September 2004. ABC made several changes to the film after the initial script was written, ultimately deciding to adapt plot elements from Baum's original novel rather than the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] musical film, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. As with the preceding [[The Muppets|Muppet]] films, ''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'' became a musical, and included five new songs written and composed by [[Michael Giacchino]]. The special is the first Muppets special without the involvement of veteran performer [[Jerry Nelson]] following his 2004 retirement from physical performing. His characters of [[List of Muppets#Lew Zealand|Lew Zealand]] and [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Sgt. Floyd Pepper|Floyd Pepper]], were respectively performed by [[Bill Barretta]] and [[John Kennedy (puppeteer)|John Kennedy]]. Barretta also debuts as the new permanent performer of [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Dr. Teeth|Dr. Teeth]] due to Kennedy now performing Floyd. The production also marked the feature film debut of [[Eric Jacobson]] as the performer of [[Sam Eagle]], a character originally performed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n''The Muppets' Wizard of Oz'' premiered on April 27, 2005 at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. The film's television premiere was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on May 20, 2005, as the final ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]''. The film received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics, who felt that the film was too mature for young audiences and that the cameo scenes and popular culture references were unnecessary.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=September 2018}}\n[[Dorothy Gale]] ([[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]]) is an orphaned teenage girl living in a trailer park in [[Kansas]]. Her [[Aunt Em]] ([[Queen Latifah]]) and [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]] ([[David Alan Grier]]) own a diner, to which Dorothy works for [[room and board]]. Her dream of becoming a singer is slim, but when waiting on some [[Truck driver|trucker]]s Dorothy overhears that the Muppets are conducting a cross-country show called \"Star Hunt\" and are looking for a backup singer. Aunt Em disapproves, but with Uncle Henry's best wishes, she goes to the audition. However, the Muppets are about to end the audition, and Dorothy only manages to give them a demo CD that she created beforehand. In returning home, the [[civil defense siren]]s sound as a [[tornado]] is headed for Dorothy's trailer park. When Aunt Em and Uncle Henry run into the county storm shelter for safety, Dorothy hurries back to her family's mobile home to get [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]], her pet [[prawn]]. She does not make it out in time, and the two are swept by the tornado across the vast fields of Kansas. When Dorothy climbs out of the wreckage, she finds that Toto ([[Pep\u00e9 the King Prawn]]) can talk and that she is no longer in Kansas.\n\nDorothy and Toto discover that they are in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], a small town part of the vast [[Land of Oz]]. After discussing her situation with the town's people, the Munchkins (played by [[Rizzo the Rat]] and the other rats), she learns that the land's ruler the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]], has the power to grant her wish of becoming a famous singer. She meets the [[Good Witch of the North]] ([[Miss Piggy]]), and receives a pair of magic [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]] from the [[Wicked Witch of the East]] (Miss Piggy), the Witch of the North's sister who was killed when Dorothy's trailer fell on her. Soon after, she embarks on a journey with Toto on the [[yellow brick road]] to meet the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the [[Emerald City]], the capital of Oz. On her journey, she meets three creatures: a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] ([[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]]), a [[Tin Woodman|Tin Thing]] ([[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]]), and a [[Cowardly Lion]] ([[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]]). They are also seeking the Wizard of Oz to give them a brain, heart, and courage, respectively. The group meets various obstacles involving a deep gorge where the Kalidah Critics ([[Statler and Waldorf]]) are heckling them and a Poppy Field Club run by [[List of Muppets#Clifford|Clifford]] which nearly puts them to sleep. After arriving at the Emerald City and meeting the Wizard, Dorothy and her friends are sent to retrieve the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]'s magic eye, a tool she uses to see anything she desires in the Land of Oz.\n\nThe group assumes that completing this task will result in the granting of their wishes. The Wicked Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet [[List of Muppets#Additional characters|Foo-Foo]] and her henchman [[List of Muppets#Johnny Fiama and Sal Minella|Johnny Fiama]]. When the Wicked Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 [[American crow|crow]]s of despair, a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that the animals that work for her are unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other [[Winged monkeys|Flying Monkeys]] (played by [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]], [[List of Muppets#Crazy Harry|Crazy Harry]], Black Dog, Bobo the Bear, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'') to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy, Toto and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.\n\nAfter being threatened to be killed by her, Toto calls the Munchkins, who set him and Dorothy free and hold up the witch. During the final battle, it cuts away to a scene where [[Quentin Tarantino]] is having a meeting with Kermit, discussing ideas for how Dorothy can defeat the Wicked Witch of the West. Tarantino's ideas are deemed too expensive and too violent for a Muppet movie, so they agree for Dorothy to do a powerful kick on the witch. Cutting back to the action, Dorothy kicks the witch into her own \"bottled water bath\" which contains tap water (to which she is severely allergic). Angel Marie admitted that he filled the water bottles with tap water to restock them. This action causes the Wicked Witch of the West to melt as Johnny averts Foo-Foo's eyes. With the Wicked Witch of the West dead, Dorothy finds the magic eye floating in the tub unharmed and grabs it.\n\nDorothy gains control of the Flying Monkeys by giving back the group's Magic Biker Cap to Sal Minella. She has Scarecrow and Tin Thing rebuilt by the Flying Monkeys. Then she and her friends travel back to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. When they all storm into the Wizard's room, they discover it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) is just an ordinary man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that she could not see him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really wanted was to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the South]] (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City. She does so, saying \"take me home to Aunt Em\".\n\nShe is then spun by the slippers' charm into Kansas, and, much to her surprise, she finds out that Kermit was looking for her, saying that she had the best voice they heard on the whole search, and that she has been chosen to go on the Star Hunt. Dorothy, having been reunited with her aunt and uncle, and feeling that she is not ready to leave Kansas to become a real star, rejects, but Aunt Em says that she wants her to go with the Muppets on their Star Hunt, much to her even bigger surprise. She then sings \"Good Life\" on television with them at the Muppet Theater as the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]: A [[Kansas]] teen dreaming of leaving her home and becoming a singer.\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as [[Aunt Em]]: Dorothy's aunt and co-owner of the family diner in Kansas.\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]: Dorothy's uncle and co-owner of the family diner.\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as The [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]]: The legendary Wizard of Oz.
