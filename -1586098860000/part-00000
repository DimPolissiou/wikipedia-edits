In the context of the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Dutch East India Company]] established its presence on Formosa to trade with the Chinese ([[Ming Empire]]) and Japanese, and also to interdict [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] trade and colonial activities in [[East Asia]].\n\nThe time of Dutch rule saw economic development in Taiwan, including both large-scale hunting of [[deer]] and the cultivation of [[rice]] and [[sugarcane|sugar]] by imported [[Han people|Han]] labour from the Ming Empire. The Dutch also attempted to convert the [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] inhabitants to [[Christianity]], and suppress aspects of traditional culture that they found disagreeable, such as [[head hunting]], [[forced abortion]] and public [[nakedness]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hsu |first=Mutsu |year=1991 |title=Culture, Self and Adaptation: The Psychological Anthropology of Two Malayo-Polynesian Groups in Taiwan |publisher=Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica |place=Taipei, Taiwan |isbn=9789579046794 |oclc=555680313 |ol=1328279M}}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch were not universally welcomed, and uprisings by both aborigines and recent [[Han people|Han]] arrivals were quelled by the Dutch military on more than one occasion. With the rise of the [[Qing dynasty]] in the early 17th century, [[Dutch East India Company]] cut ties with the Ming dynasty and allied with the Qing instead, in exchange for the right to unfettered access to their [[trade route|trade]] and [[shipping route]]s. The colonial period was brought to an end after the 1662 [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] by the [[Koxinga]]'s army who promptly dismantled the Dutch colony, expelled the Dutch and established the Ming loyalist, [[anti-Qing sentiment|anti-Qing]] [[Kingdom of Tungning]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|left|thumb|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]] (VOC).]]\n[[File:Fort Zeelandia, Anping District, Tainan City (Taiwan).jpg|left|thumb|Wall of [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]], [[Anping District]], [[Tainan City]].

The Dutch first attempted to trade with China in 1601{{sfnb|Ts'ao|2006|p=28}} but were rebuffed by the Chinese authorities, who were already engaged in trade with the Portuguese at [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] from 1535.\n\nIn a 1604 expedition from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (the central base of the Dutch in Asia), Admiral van Warwijk set out to attack Macau, but his force was waylaid by a [[typhoon]], driving them to the [[Pescadores]] ([[Penghu]]), a group of islands {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}} west of Formosa (Taiwan). Once there, the admiral attempted to negotiate trade terms with the Chinese on the mainland, but was asked to pay an exorbitant fee for the privilege of an interview. Surrounded by a vastly superior Chinese fleet, he left without achieving any of his aims.{{sfnb|Davidson|1903|p=10}}\n\nThe Dutch East India Company tried to use military force to make China open up a port in Fujian to trade and demanded that China expel the Portuguese, whom the Dutch were fighting in the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]], from Macau. The Dutch raided Chinese shipping after 1618 and took junks hostage in an unsuccessful attempt to get China to meet their demands.{{sfnb|Cooper|1979|p=658}}{{sfnb|Freeman|2003|p=132}}{{sfnb|Thomson|1996|p=39}}\n\nIn 1622, after another unsuccessful [[Battle of Macau|Dutch attack on Macau]] ([[trade post]] of [[Portugal]] from 1557), the fleet sailed to the Pescadores, this time intentionally, and proceeded to set up a base there at [[Makung]]. They built a [[Fengguiwei Fort|fort]] with [[forced labour]] recruited from the local Chinese population. Their oversight was reportedly so severe and rations so short that 1,300 of the 1,500 Chinese enslaved died in the process of construction.{{sfnb|Davidson|1903|p=11}} The same year a ship named the ''Golden Lion'' (Dutch: ''Gouden Leeuw'') was wrecked at [[Hsiao Liuchiu|Lamey]] just off the southwest coast of Formosa; the survivors were slaughtered by the native inhabitants.{{sfnb|Bluss\u00e9|2000|p=144}} The following year, 1623, Dutch traders in search of an Asian base first arrived on the island, intending to use the island as a station for Dutch commerce with Japan and the coastal areas of China.\n\nThe Dutch demanded that China open up ports in Fujian to Dutch trade. China refused, warning the Dutch that the Pescadores were Chinese territory. The Chinese Governor of Fujian (Fukien), Shang Zhouzuo (Shang Chou-tso), demanded that the Dutch withdraw from the Pescadores to Formosa, where the Chinese would permit them to engage in trade. This led to a war between the Dutch and China between 1622-1624 which ended with the Chinese being successful in making the Dutch abandon the Pescadores and withdraw to Formosa.{{sfnb|Covell|1998|p=70}}{{sfnb|Wright|1908|p=817}} The Dutch threatened that China would face Dutch raids on Chinese ports and shipping unless the Chinese allowed trading on the Pescadores and that China not trade with Manila but only with the Dutch in Batavia and Siam and Cambodia. However, the Dutch found out that, unlike tiny Southeast Asian Kingdoms, China could not be bullied or intimidated by them (comment added by Chinese editor). After Shang ordered them to withdraw to Formosa on 19 September 1622, the Dutch raided Amoy on October and November.{{sfnb|Twitchett|Mote|1998|p=368}} The Dutch intended to \"induce the Chinese to trade by force or from fear.\" by raiding Fujian and Chinese shipping from the Pescadores.{{sfnb|Shepherd|1993|p=49}} Long artillery batteries were erected at Amoy in March 1622 by Colonel Li-kung-hwa as a defence against the Dutch.{{sfnb|Hughes|1872|p=25}}\n\nOn the Dutch attempt in 1623 to force China to open up a port, five Dutch ships were sent to [[Liu'ao, Zhangpu County|Liu-ao]] and the mission ended in failure for the Dutch, with a number of Dutch sailors taken prisoner and one of their ships lost. In response to the Dutch using captured Chinese for forced labor and strengthening their garrison in the Pescadores with five more ships in addition to the six already there, the new Governor of Fujian, Nan Juyi (Nan Ch\u00fc-i), was permitted by China to begin preparations to attack the Dutch forces in July 1623. A Dutch raid was defeated by the Chinese at Amoy on October 1623, with the Chinese taking the Dutch commander Christian Francs prisoner and burning one of the four Dutch ships. [[Yu Zigao]] began an offensive in February 1624 with warships and troops against the Dutch in the Pescadores with the intent of expelling them.{{sfnb|Goodrich|Fang|1976|p=1086}} The Chinese offensive reached the Dutch fort on 30 July 1624, with 5,000 Chinese troops (or 10,000) and 40-50 warships under Yu and General [[Wang Mengxiong]] surrounding the fort commanded by [[Martinus Sonck|Marten Sonck]], and the Dutch were forced to sue for peace on August 3 and folded before the Chinese demands, withdrawing from the Pescadores to Formosa. The Dutch admitted that their attempt at military force to coerce China into trading with them had failed with their defeat in the Pescadores. At the Chinese victory celebrations over the \"red-haired barbarians,\" as the Dutch were called by the Chinese, Nan Juyi (Nan Ch\u00fc-yi) paraded twelve Dutch soldiers who were captured before the Emperor in Beijing.{{sfnb|Goodrich|Fang|1976|p=1087}}{{sfnb|Twitchett|Mote|1998|p=369}}{{sfnb|Deng|1999|p=191}}{{sfnb|Parker|1917|p=92}} The Dutch were astonished that their violence did not intimidate the Chinese and at the subsequent Chinese attack on their fort in the Pescadores, since they thought them as timid and a \"faint-hearted troupe,\" based on their experience with them in Southeast Asia.{{sfnb|Idema|1981|p=93}}\n\n===Early years (1624\u20131625)===\nTaiwan's southwest was already home to a Chinese population numbering close to 15,000 before 1623 when the Dutch first came.<ref>{{cite book |last=Andrade|first=Tonio |date=2007 |title=How Taiwan Became Chinese |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/17552533/How-Taiwan-Became-Chinese-by-Tonio-Andrade-Project-Gutenberg-Edition |publisher=Columbia University Press |series=(Project Gutenberg Edition) |page=129 |isbn=978-9622090835 }}</ref>\n\nOn deciding to set up in Taiwan and in common with standard practice at the time, the Dutch built a defensive fort to act as a base of operations. This was built on the sandy peninsula of ''Tayouan''{{sfnp|Valentijn|1903|p=52|ps=: quoting [[Pieter Nuyts|Nuyts, Pieter]] (10 February 1629)}} (now part of mainland Taiwan, in current-day [[Anping District]]). This temporary fort was replaced four years later by the more substantial [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]].{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=13}}\n\n===Growing control, pacification of the aborigines (1626\u20131636)===\n{{main|Lamey Island Massacre|Dutch pacification campaign on Formosa}}\nThe first order of business was to punish villages that had violently opposed the Dutch and unite the aborigines in allegiance with the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC). The first [[punitive expedition]] was against the villages of Bakloan and Mattau, north of [[Fort Provintia|Saccam]] near Tayowan. The Mattau campaign was easier than expected, and the tribe submitted after having their village razed by fire. The campaign also served as a threat to other villages from Tirosen ([[Chiayi]]) to Longkiau ([[Hengchun]]).\n\nWhile the pacification campaign continued in Formosa, at sea, relations with the Chinese were strained by the Dutch attempts to [[tax]] ships in the [[Taiwan Strait]]. War eventually broke out between the Ming and the Dutch, and the Chinese Admiral [[Zheng Zhilong]] defeated the Dutch at the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]] in 1633.\n\nSome Dutch [[missionaries]] were killed by aboriginals whom they had tried to convert: \"The catechist, Daniel Hendrickx, whose name has been often mentioned, accompanied this expedition to the south, as his great knowledge of the Formosa language and his familiar intercourse with the natives, rendered his services very valuable.

These villages stretched from [[Hengchun|Longkiau]] in the south (125&nbsp;km from the Dutch base at [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]) to [[Huwei|Favorlang]] in central Taiwan, 90&nbsp;km to the north of Fort Zeelandia. The relative calm of this period has been called the ''Pax Hollandica'' (Dutch Peace) by some commentators{{sfnb|Andrade|2005}} (a reference to the [[Pax Romana]]).\n\nOne area not under their control was the north of the island, which from 1626 had been under Spanish sway, with their two settlements at [[Danshui|Tamsui]] and [[Keelung]]. The fortification at Keelung was abandoned because the Spanish lacked the resources to maintain it, but [[Fort Santo Domingo]] in Tamsui was seen as a major obstacle to Dutch ambitions on the island and the region in general.\n\nAfter failing to drive out the Spanish in 1641, the Dutch returned in 1642 with reinforcements of Dutch soldiers and aboriginal warriors in ships, managing to dislodge the small Spanish-Filipino contingent from their fortress and drive them from the island. Following this victory, the Dutch set about bringing the northern villages under their banner in a similar way to the pacification campaign carried out in the previous decade in the south.\n\n===Growing Han presence and the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion (1643\u20131659)===\n{{main|Guo Huaiyi Rebellion}}\nThe Dutch began to encourage large-scale Han [[immigration]] to the island, mainly from the south of [[Fujian|Hokkien]]. Most of the immigrants were young single males who were discouraged from staying on the island often referred to by Han as \"The Gate of Hell\" for its reputation in taking the lives of sailors and explorers.{{sfnb|Keliher|2003|p=32}} After one uprising by Hanin 1640, the [[Guo Huaiyi Rebellion]] in 1652 saw an organised [[insurrection]] against the Dutch, fuelled by anger over punitive taxes and corrupt officials. The Dutch again put down the revolt hard, with fully 25% of those participating in the rebellion being killed over a period of a couple of weeks.{{sfnb|Andrade|2005}}\n\n===Aboriginal rebellions in other areas of Taiwan (1650s)===\n\nMultiple Aboriginal villages rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression like when the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 at the same time as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died.  After an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan the aboriginals were forced to sue for peace on February 1653.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3oWoSKVnVIC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false Shepherd1993], p. 59.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Zeelandia and the end of Dutch government on Formosa (1660\u20131662)===\n[[File:Koxinga Dutch Treaty.jpg|thumb|Peace Treaty of 1662, between [[Frederick Coyett|Governor Coyett]] and [[Koxinga]]]]{{main|Siege of Fort Zeelandia}}\nIn 1661, a naval fleet of 200 ships, led by the Ming loyalist [[Koxinga]], landed at {{Interlanguage link multi|Lakjemuyse|zh|3=\u9e7f\u8033\u9580}} with the intention of ousting the Dutch from [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Zeelandia]] and making the island a base for Ming loyalists.

Koxinga then forced the local representatives of the Dutch East India Company to sign a peace treaty at Zeelandia on 1 February 1662, and leave the island.

This territory was acquired from 1624 to 1642, with most of the villages being required to swear allegiance to the Dutch and then largely being left to govern themselves.\n\nThe manner of acknowledging Dutch lordship was to bring a small native plant (often [[betel nut]] or [[coconut]]) planted in earth from that particular town to the Governor, signifying the granting of the land to the Dutch. The Governor would then award the village leader a robe and a staff as symbols of office and a ''Prinsenvlag'' (\"Prince's Flag\", the flag of [[William the Silent]]) to display in their village.\n\n===Governor of Formosa===\n{{main|Governor of Formosa}}\nThe '''Governor of Formosa''' ({{lang-nl|'''Gouverneur van Formosa'''}}; {{zh|t=''\u53f0\u7063\u9577\u5b98''}})  was the head of government. Appointed by the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (modern-day [[Jakarta]], Indonesia), the Governor of Formosa was empowered to legislate, collect taxes, wage war and declare peace on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and therefore by extension the [[Netherlands|Dutch state]].\n\nHe was assisted in his duties by the '''Council of Tayouan''', a group made up of the various worthies in residence in Tayouan. The President of this council was the second-in-command to the Governor, and would take over his duties if the Governor died or was incapacitated. The Governor's residence was in [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] on Tayouan (then an island, now the [[Anping District]] of [[Tainan City]]). There were a total of twelve Governors during the Dutch colonial era.{{sfnb|Valentijn|1903|p=75}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe Tayouan ''factory'' (as VOC trading posts were called) was to become the second-most profitable factory in the whole of the Dutch East Indies (after the post at [[Hirado]]/[[Dejima]]),{{sfnb|Knapp|1995|p=14}} although it took 22 years for the colony to first return a profit.{{sfnb|van Veen|2003}} Benefitting from triangular trade between themselves, the Chinese and the Japanese, plus exploiting the natural resources of Formosa, the Dutch were able to turn the malarial sub-tropical bay into a lucrative asset. A cash economy was introduced (using the [[Spanish real]], which was used by the VOC) and the period also saw the first serious attempts in the island's history to develop it economically.{{sfnb|Roy|2003|p=15}}\n\n===Trade===\n[[File:Cervus nippon taioanus.JPG|thumb|right|Formosan Sika Deer]]\nThe original intention of setting up [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] at Tayowan ([[Anping District|Anping]]) in southern Formosa was to provide a base for trading with China and Japan, as well as interfering with Portuguese and Spanish trade in the region. Goods traded included silks from China and silver from Japan, among many other things.\n\nAfter establishing their fortress, the Dutch realised the potential of the vast herds of the native [[Formosan sika deer]] (''Cervus nippon taioanus'') roaming the western plains of the island. The tough deer skins were highly prized by the Japanese, who used them to make [[samurai]] armour. Other parts of the deer were sold to Chinese traders for meat and medical use.

It is difficult to arrive at an estimate of the numbers of these native Formosans when the Dutch arrived, as there was no island-wide authority in a position to count the population, while the aborigines themselves did not keep written records. Even at the extent of greatest Dutch control in the 1650s there were still large regions of the island outside the pale of Dutch authority, meaning that any statistics given necessarily relate only to the area of Dutch sovereignty.\n\n===Ethnicity===\nThe population of Dutch Formosa was composed of three main groups; the aborigines, the Dutch contingent, and the Chinese. There were also a number of [[Spanish people]] resident in the north of the island between 1626 and 1642 in the area around [[Keelung]] and [[Tamsui District|Tamsui]]. At times there were also a handful of Japanese-Korean trader-pirates known as [[Wokou|Wak\u014d]] operating out of coastal areas outside Dutch control.\n\n====The Aborigines====\nThe [[Taiwanese aborigines|native Formosan peoples]] had been in Taiwan for thousands of years before the Dutch arrived. Estimates of the total numbers of aborigines in Taiwan are difficult to come by, but one commentator suggests that there were 150,000 over the entire island during the Dutch era. They lived in villages with populations ranging from a couple of hundred up to around 2,000 people for the biggest towns, with different groups speaking different [[Formosan languages]] which were not mutually intelligible.\n\n====The Dutch====\nThe Dutch contingent was initially composed mostly of soldiers, with some slaves and other workers from the other Dutch colonies, particularly the area around [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (current day [[Jakarta]]). The number of soldiers stationed on the island waxed and waned according to the military needs of the colony, from a low of 180 troops in the early days to a high of 1,800 shortly before [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia|Koxinga's invasion]]. There were also a number of other personnel, from traders and merchants to missionaries and schoolteachers, plus the Dutch brought with them [[slavery|slaves]] from their other colonies, who mainly served as personal slaves for important Dutch people.\n\nDutch women were kept as sexual partners by the Chinese after the Dutch were expelled from Taiwan in 1662. During the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, in which Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] loyalist forces commanded by [[Koxinga]] besieged and defeated the [[Dutch East India Company]] and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and children prisoner. The Dutch missionary [[Antonius Hambroek]], two of his daughters, and his wife were among the Dutch prisoners of war with Koxinga. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding that he persuade them to surrender or else Hambroek would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort, where two of his other daughters were. He urged the Fort not to surrender, assuring them that Koxinga's troops were growing hungry and rebellious, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation. In addition to this, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners in retaliation. A few women and children were also killed. The surviving Dutch women and children were then turned into slaves. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine;<ref>{{cite book |last=Moffett |first=Samuel H. |date=1998 |title=A History of Christianity in Asia: 1500-1900 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_XglAQAAIAAJ&dq=hambroek+daughter&q=one+sweet+young+seized+harem |location= |publisher=Orbis Books |edition=2, illustrated, reprint |volume=Volume 2 of A History of Christianity in Asia: 1500-1900.

Estimates of the numbers of Han people in Taiwan at the end of the Dutch era vary widely, from 10\u201315,000 up to 50\u201360,000, although the lower end of that scale seems more likely.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n====Others====\n\nThe Dutch had Pampang and Quinamese ([[Vietnamese people in Taiwan|Vietnamese]]) slaves on their colony in Taiwan, and in 1643 offered rewards to aboriginal allies who would recapture the slaves for them when they ran away.{{sfnp|Chiu|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4QzpJtddFxEC&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false 124].

Despite temporary alliances, similar agricultural practices and few inter-marriages, there also exhibited distinct linguistic and internal structure differences of the tribes. These differences coupled with the widespread practice of head-hunting caused Formosan groups to be suspicious and cautious of strangers.{{sfnb|Shepherd|1993}}\n\nUpon arrival, the first indigenous groups the Dutch made contact with were the Sinkang (\u65b0\u6e2f), Backloan (\u76ee\u52a0\u6e9c\u7063), Soelangh (\u856d), and Mattauw (\u9ebb\u8c46).  The native Taiwanese tribes\u2019 antagonistic predispositions lead to an initial hostile relationship with the colonizers, involving several uprisings including the Hamada Yahei incident of 1628 involving the Sinkang people, and the killing of 20 Dutch soldiers in 1629 by the Mattauw tribe.<ref name=LeeYuchung>{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Yuchung |title=\u8377\u897f\u6642\u671f\u7e3d\u8ad6 (Dutch and Spanish period of Taiwan) |url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=1214 |publisher=Council for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=29 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002944/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=1214 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> VOC eventually transitioned into a divide-and-conquer strategy, and went on to create an alliance with the Sinkang and Seolangh tribes against Mattauw, simultaneously conquering numerous tribes that did not comply with these commands.{{sfnb|Chiu|2008}}\n\nThis interventionist process included the massacre of the indigenous people inhabiting [[Lamay Island]] in 1642 by Dutch forces led by Officer Francois Caron.<ref name=LeeYuchung/> \nAfter these events, the native aborigines eventually were forced into pacification under military domination and were used for a variety of labor activities during the span of Dutch Formosa.  According to documents in 1650, Dutch settlers ruled \u201c315 tribal villages with a total population of around 68,600, estimated 40-50% of the entire indigenes of the island\u201d.{{sfnb|Tai|2007|p=246}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Tai|first=Pao-tsun|title=The Concise History of Taiwan|year=2007|publisher=Taiwan Historica|location=Taiwan|isbn=9789860109504}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nOne of the key pillars of the Dutch colonial era was conversion of the natives to Christianity. From the descriptions of the early missionaries, the native religion was [[animism|animist]] in nature, in one case presided over by priestesses called ''Inibs''.\n\nThe Formosans also practiced various activities which the Dutch perceived as sinful or at least uncivilised, including mandatory abortion (by massage) for women under 37,{{sfnb|Shepherd|1995}} frequent marital infidelity,{{sfnb|Shepherd|1995}} non-observation of the [[Christian Sabbath]] and general nakedness.\nThe Christian Bible was translated into native aboriginal languages and evangelised among the tribes. This marks the first recorded instance of Christianity entering into Taiwanese history, and preludes to the active Christian practices experienced in Taiwan in modern times.{{sfnb|Tai|2007|p=246}}\n\n===Education===\nThe missionaries were also responsible for setting up schools in the villages under Dutch control, teaching not only the religion of the colonists but also other skills such as reading and writing. Prior to Dutch arrival the native inhabitants did not use writing, and the missionaries created a number of [[romanization]] schemes for the various [[Formosan languages]]. This is the first record in history of a written language in Taiwan.<ref name=LeeYuchung/>\n\nExperiments were made with teaching native children the [[Dutch language]], however these were abandoned fairly rapidly after they failed to produce good results. At least one Formosan received an education in the Netherlands; he eventually married a Dutch woman and was apparently well integrated into Dutch society.{{sfnb|Everts|2000|p=151}}\n\n===Technology===\nThe unique variety of trading resources (in particular, deerskins, venison and sugarcane), as well as the untouched nature of Formosa led to an extremely lucrative market for VOC.  A journal record written by the Dutch Governor [[Pieter Nuyts]] holds that \"Taiwan was an excellent trading port, enabling 100 per cent profits to be made on all goods\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bluss\u00e9 |first1=J.L. |last2=van Opstall |first2=M.E. |last3=Milde |first3=W.E. |last4=Ts'ao |first4=Yung-Ho |title=De dagregisters van het kasteel Zeelandia, Taiwan 1629-1662 |language=Dutch |publisher=Inst. voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis |location=Den Haag |year=1986 |url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/retroboeken/taiwan/ |accessdate=19 December 2014}}, described in English at {{cite web |url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/voctaiwan/index_html_en |title=The United East India Company (VOC) in Taiwan 1629-1662 |publisher=Huygens ING |accessdate=19 December 2014|date=June 4, 2014 }}</ref> In monopolizing on these goods, Taiwanese natives were used as manual labor, whose skills were honed in the employment on sugarcane farms and deer hunting.\n\nSimilarly, Dutch colonizers upheaved the traditional agricultural practices in favor of more modern systems. The native tribes in the field-regions were taught how to use Western systems of crop management that used more sustainable and efficient ecological technologies, albeit attributed mostly to the fact that due to the increased exploitation of the land, alternative means of management were needed to veer off the extinction of deer and sugar resources.\n\nThe Dutch introduced well-digging,<ref>Murray Rubinstein, (1999) A New History of Taiwan, M.E. Sharpe Inc, New York 66.</ref>  as well as bringing both oxen and cattle to the island.\n\n===Military===\nTaiwanese aborigines became an important part of maintaining a stable milieu and eliminating conflicts during the latter half of Dutch rule. According to the Daily Journals of Fort Zeelandia ({{lang-nl|De dagregisters van het kasteel Zeelandia}}), Dutch colonizers frequently employed males from nearby indigenous tribes, including Hsin-kang (\u65b0\u6e2f) and Mattau (\u9ebb\u8c46) as foot-soldiers in the general militia, to heighten their numbers when quick action was needed during rebellions or uprisings. Such was the case during that of the Guo Huaiyi Revolt in 1652, where the conspirators were eventually bested and subdued by the Dutch through the sourcing of over a hundred native Taiwanese aborigines.{{sfnb|Chiu|2008}}\n\nHowever, the [[Taiwanese Aboriginal]] tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] and defected to [[Koxinga]]'s Chinese forces.<ref>{{cite book |last=Covell |first=Ralph R. |date=1998 |title=Pentecost of the Hills in Taiwan: The Christian Faith Among the Original Inhabitants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaP2UFZVGDoC&pg=PA96 |location= |publisher=Hope Publishing House |edition=illustrated |pages=96\u201397 |isbn=0932727905 |accessdate=10 December 2014 }}</ref> The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty, the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions, the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.{{sfnp|Chiu|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4QzpJtddFxEC&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q&f=false 222].

At the start of the Dutch era, there were estimated to be between 1,000\u20131,500 Chinese in Taiwan, mostly traders living in aboriginal villages.{{sfnb|Shepherd|1993}} During Dutch Formosa rule, Dutch colonial policies encouraged the active immigration of Han Chinese in order to solidify the ecological and agricultural trade establishments, and help maintain control over the area. Because of these reasons, by the end of the colonial period, Taiwan had many Chinese villages holding tens of thousands of people in total, and the ethnic balance of the island was already well on the way to favouring the newly arrived Chinese over the aboriginal tribes.{{sfnb|Andrade|2005}} Furthermore, Dutch settlers opened up communication between both peoples, and set about maintaining relationships with both Han Chinese and native Taiwanese \u2013 which were non-existent beforehand.<ref name=LeeYuchung/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Taiwan]]  \n* [[Eighty Years' War]]  \n* [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]\n* [[Taiwanese aborigines#The European period|Taiwanese aborigines: The European period]]\n* [[Han Taiwanese#Influence of Non-Han Languages|Han Taiwanese: Influence of the Dutch language]]\n* [[Dutch East India Company]]\n* [[Koxinga]]\n* [[Kingdom of Tungning]]\n* [[Spanish Formosa]]\n* [[Dutch pacification campaign on Formosa]]\n* [[Landdag]]\n* ''[[Lord of Formosa]]'' - A historical novel about the period\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Andrade |first=Tonio |title=How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2005 |url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/ |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bluss\u00e9 |first=Leonard |chapter=Dutch Protestant Missionaries as Protagonists of the Territorial Expansion of the VOC on Formosa |title=Conversion, Competition and Conflict : essays on the role of religion in Asia |editor=Kooiman |editor2=van den Muijzenburg |editor3=van der Veer |publisher=VU Uitgeverij, Free University Press |location=Amsterdam |year=1984 |isbn=9789062560851 |ref=Blusse1984}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bluss\u00e9 |first=Leonard |title=After Colonialism: Imperial Histories and Postcolonial Displacement |chapter=Retribution and Remorse: The Interaction between the Administration and the Protestant Mission in Early Colonial Formosa |editor=Prakash, Gyan |year=1994 |isbn=9780691037424 |publisher=Princeton University Press |ref=Blusse1994}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bluss\u00e9 |first=Leonard |editor=Blundell, David |title=Austronesian Taiwan |year=2000 |publisher=University of California |location=California |chapter=The Cave of the Black Spirits |isbn=9780936127095 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Bluss\u00e9 |editor-first=Leonard |editor2-last=Everts |editor2-first=Natalie |editor3-last=Frech |editor3-first=Evelien |title=The Formosan Encounter: Notes on Formosa's Aboriginal Society: A Selection of Documents from Dutch Archival Sources |volume=Vol. I |publisher=Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines |year=1999 |isbn=9579976724 |ref=NotesI}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Bluss\u00e9 |editor-first=Leonard |editor2-last=Everts |editor2-first=Natalie |title=The Formosan Encounter: Notes on Formosa's Aboriginal Society: A Selection of Documents from Dutch Archival Sources |volume=Vol. II |publisher=Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines |year=2000 |isbn=9579976775 |ref=NotesII}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Bluss\u00e9 |editor-first=Leonard |editor2-last=Everts |editor2-first=Natalie |title=The Formosan Encounter: Notes on Formosa's Aboriginal Society: A Selection of Documents from Dutch Archival Sources |volume=Vol. III |publisher=Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines |year=2006 |isbn=9573028735 |ref=NotesIII}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Gospel of St Matthew in Formosan (Sinkang Dialect) with Corresponding Versions in Dutch and English;

In the context of the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Dutch East India Company]] established its presence on Formosa to trade with the Chinese ([[Ming Empire]]) and Japanese, and also to interdict [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] trade and colonial activities in [[East Asia]].\n\nThe time of Dutch rule saw economic development in Taiwan, including both large-scale hunting of [[deer]] and the cultivation of [[rice]] and [[sugarcane|sugar]] by imported [[Han people|Han]] labour from the Ming Empire. The Dutch also attempted to convert the [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] inhabitants to [[Christianity]], and suppress aspects of traditional culture that they found disagreeable, such as [[head hunting]], [[forced abortion]] and public [[nakedness]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hsu |first=Mutsu |year=1991 |title=Culture, Self and Adaptation: The Psychological Anthropology of Two Malayo-Polynesian Groups in Taiwan |publisher=Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica |place=Taipei, Taiwan |isbn=9789579046794 |oclc=555680313 |ol=1328279M}}</ref>\n\nThe Dutch were not universally welcomed, and uprisings by both aborigines and recent [[Han people|Han]] arrivals were quelled by the Dutch military on more than one occasion. With the rise of the [[Qing dynasty]] in the early 17th century, [[Dutch East India Company]] cut ties with the Ming dynasty and allied with the Qing instead, in exchange for the right to unfettered access to their [[trade route|trade]] and [[shipping route]]s. The colonial period was brought to an end after the 1662 [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] by the [[Koxinga]]'s army who promptly dismantled the Dutch colony, expelled the Dutch and established the Ming loyalist, [[anti-Qing sentiment|anti-Qing]] [[Kingdom of Tungning]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|left|thumb|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]] (VOC).]]\n[[File:Fort Zeelandia, Anping District, Tainan City (Taiwan).jpg|left|thumb|Wall of [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]], [[Anping District]], [[Tainan City]].

The Dutch first attempted to trade with China in 1601{{sfnb|Ts'ao|2006|p=28}} but were rebuffed by the Chinese authorities, who were already engaged in trade with the Portuguese at [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] from 1535.\n\nIn a 1604 expedition from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (the central base of the Dutch in Asia), Admiral van Warwijk set out to attack Macau, but his force was waylaid by a [[typhoon]], driving them to the [[Pescadores]] ([[Penghu]]), a group of islands {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}} west of Formosa (Taiwan). Once there, the admiral attempted to negotiate trade terms with the Chinese on the mainland, but was asked to pay an exorbitant fee for the privilege of an interview. Surrounded by a vastly superior Chinese fleet, he left without achieving any of his aims.{{sfnb|Davidson|1903|p=10}}\n\nThe Dutch East India Company tried to use military force to make China open up a port in Fujian to trade and demanded that China expel the Portuguese, whom the Dutch were fighting in the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]], from Macau. The Dutch raided Chinese shipping after 1618 and took junks hostage in an unsuccessful attempt to get China to meet their demands.{{sfnb|Cooper|1979|p=658}}{{sfnb|Freeman|2003|p=132}}{{sfnb|Thomson|1996|p=39}}\n\nIn 1622, after another unsuccessful [[Battle of Macau|Dutch attack on Macau]] ([[trade post]] of [[Portugal]] from 1557), the fleet sailed to the Pescadores, this time intentionally, and proceeded to set up a base there at [[Makung]]. They built a [[Fengguiwei Fort|fort]] with [[forced labour]] recruited from the local Chinese population. Their oversight was reportedly so severe and rations so short that 1,300 of the 1,500 Chinese enslaved died in the process of construction.{{sfnb|Davidson|1903|p=11}} The same year a ship named the ''Golden Lion'' (Dutch: ''Gouden Leeuw'') was wrecked at [[Hsiao Liuchiu|Lamey]] just off the southwest coast of Formosa; the survivors were slaughtered by the native inhabitants.{{sfnb|Bluss\u00e9|2000|p=144}} The following year, 1623, Dutch traders in search of an Asian base first arrived on the island, intending to use the island as a station for Dutch commerce with Japan and the coastal areas of China.\n\nThe Dutch demanded that China open up ports in Fujian to Dutch trade. China refused, warning the Dutch that the Pescadores were Chinese territory. The Chinese Governor of Fujian (Fukien), Shang Zhouzuo (Shang Chou-tso), demanded that the Dutch withdraw from the Pescadores to Formosa, where the Chinese would permit them to engage in trade. This led to a war between the Dutch and China between 1622-1624 which ended with the Chinese being successful in making the Dutch abandon the Pescadores and withdraw to Formosa.{{sfnb|Covell|1998|p=70}}{{sfnb|Wright|1908|p=817}} The Dutch threatened that China would face Dutch raids on Chinese ports and shipping unless the Chinese allowed trading on the Pescadores and that China not trade with Manila but only with the Dutch in Batavia and Siam and Cambodia. However, the Dutch found out that, unlike tiny Southeast Asian Kingdoms, China could not be bullied or intimidated by them. After Shang ordered them to withdraw to Formosa on 19 September 1622, the Dutch raided Amoy on October and November.{{sfnb|Twitchett|Mote|1998|p=368}} The Dutch intended to \"induce the Chinese to trade by force or from fear.\" by raiding Fujian and Chinese shipping from the Pescadores.{{sfnb|Shepherd|1993|p=49}} Long artillery batteries were erected at Amoy in March 1622 by Colonel Li-kung-hwa as a defence against the Dutch.{{sfnb|Hughes|1872|p=25}}\n\nOn the Dutch attempt in 1623 to force China to open up a port, five Dutch ships were sent to [[Liu'ao, Zhangpu County|Liu-ao]] and the mission ended in failure for the Dutch, with a number of Dutch sailors taken prisoner and one of their ships lost. In response to the Dutch using captured Chinese for forced labor and strengthening their garrison in the Pescadores with five more ships in addition to the six already there, the new Governor of Fujian, Nan Juyi (Nan Ch\u00fc-i), was permitted by China to begin preparations to attack the Dutch forces in July 1623. A Dutch raid was defeated by the Chinese at Amoy on October 1623, with the Chinese taking the Dutch commander Christian Francs prisoner and burning one of the four Dutch ships. [[Yu Zigao]] began an offensive in February 1624 with warships and troops against the Dutch in the Pescadores with the intent of expelling them.{{sfnb|Goodrich|Fang|1976|p=1086}} The Chinese offensive reached the Dutch fort on 30 July 1624, with 5,000 Chinese troops (or 10,000) and 40-50 warships under Yu and General [[Wang Mengxiong]] surrounding the fort commanded by [[Martinus Sonck|Marten Sonck]], and the Dutch were forced to sue for peace on August 3 and folded before the Chinese demands, withdrawing from the Pescadores to Formosa. The Dutch admitted that their attempt at military force to coerce China into trading with them had failed with their defeat in the Pescadores. At the Chinese victory celebrations over the \"red-haired barbarians,\" as the Dutch were called by the Chinese, Nan Juyi (Nan Ch\u00fc-yi) paraded twelve Dutch soldiers who were captured before the Emperor in Beijing.{{sfnb|Goodrich|Fang|1976|p=1087}}{{sfnb|Twitchett|Mote|1998|p=369}}{{sfnb|Deng|1999|p=191}}{{sfnb|Parker|1917|p=92}} The Dutch were astonished that their violence did not intimidate the Chinese and at the subsequent Chinese attack on their fort in the Pescadores, since they thought them as timid and a \"faint-hearted troupe,\" based on their experience with them in Southeast Asia.{{sfnb|Idema|1981|p=93}}\n\n===Early years (1624\u20131625)===\nTaiwan's southwest was already home to a Chinese population numbering close to 15,000 before 1623 when the Dutch first came.<ref>{{cite book |last=Andrade|first=Tonio |date=2007 |title=How Taiwan Became Chinese |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/17552533/How-Taiwan-Became-Chinese-by-Tonio-Andrade-Project-Gutenberg-Edition |publisher=Columbia University Press |series=(Project Gutenberg Edition) |page=129 |isbn=978-9622090835 }}</ref>\n\nOn deciding to set up in Taiwan and in common with standard practice at the time, the Dutch built a defensive fort to act as a base of operations. This was built on the sandy peninsula of ''Tayouan''{{sfnp|Valentijn|1903|p=52|ps=: quoting [[Pieter Nuyts|Nuyts, Pieter]] (10 February 1629)}} (now part of mainland Taiwan, in current-day [[Anping District]]). This temporary fort was replaced four years later by the more substantial [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]].{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=13}}\n\n===Growing control, pacification of the aborigines (1626\u20131636)===\n{{main|Lamey Island Massacre|Dutch pacification campaign on Formosa}}\nThe first order of business was to punish villages that had violently opposed the Dutch and unite the aborigines in allegiance with the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC). The first [[punitive expedition]] was against the villages of Bakloan and Mattau, north of [[Fort Provintia|Saccam]] near Tayowan. The Mattau campaign was easier than expected, and the tribe submitted after having their village razed by fire. The campaign also served as a threat to other villages from Tirosen ([[Chiayi]]) to Longkiau ([[Hengchun]]).\n\nWhile the pacification campaign continued in Formosa, at sea, relations with the Chinese were strained by the Dutch attempts to [[tax]] ships in the [[Taiwan Strait]]. War eventually broke out between the Ming and the Dutch, and the Chinese Admiral [[Zheng Zhilong]] defeated the Dutch at the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]] in 1633.\n\nSome Dutch [[missionaries]] were killed by aboriginals whom they had tried to convert: \"The catechist, Daniel Hendrickx, whose name has been often mentioned, accompanied this expedition to the south, as his great knowledge of the Formosa language and his familiar intercourse with the natives, rendered his services very valuable.

These villages stretched from [[Hengchun|Longkiau]] in the south (125&nbsp;km from the Dutch base at [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]) to [[Huwei|Favorlang]] in central Taiwan, 90&nbsp;km to the north of Fort Zeelandia. The relative calm of this period has been called the ''Pax Hollandica'' (Dutch Peace) by some commentators{{sfnb|Andrade|2005}} (a reference to the [[Pax Romana]]).\n\nOne area not under their control was the north of the island, which from 1626 had been under Spanish sway, with their two settlements at [[Danshui|Tamsui]] and [[Keelung]]. The fortification at Keelung was abandoned because the Spanish lacked the resources to maintain it, but [[Fort Santo Domingo]] in Tamsui was seen as a major obstacle to Dutch ambitions on the island and the region in general.\n\nAfter failing to drive out the Spanish in 1641, the Dutch returned in 1642 with reinforcements of Dutch soldiers and aboriginal warriors in ships, managing to dislodge the small Spanish-Filipino contingent from their fortress and drive them from the island. Following this victory, the Dutch set about bringing the northern villages under their banner in a similar way to the pacification campaign carried out in the previous decade in the south.\n\n===Growing Han presence and the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion (1643\u20131659)===\n{{main|Guo Huaiyi Rebellion}}\nThe Dutch began to encourage large-scale Han [[immigration]] to the island, mainly from the south of [[Fujian|Hokkien]]. Most of the immigrants were young single males who were discouraged from staying on the island often referred to by Han as \"The Gate of Hell\" for its reputation in taking the lives of sailors and explorers.{{sfnb|Keliher|2003|p=32}} After one uprising by Hanin 1640, the [[Guo Huaiyi Rebellion]] in 1652 saw an organised [[insurrection]] against the Dutch, fuelled by anger over punitive taxes and corrupt officials. The Dutch again put down the revolt hard, with fully 25% of those participating in the rebellion being killed over a period of a couple of weeks.{{sfnb|Andrade|2005}}\n\n===Aboriginal rebellions in other areas of Taiwan (1650s)===\n\nMultiple Aboriginal villages rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression like when the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 at the same time as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died.  After an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan the aboriginals were forced to sue for peace on February 1653.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3oWoSKVnVIC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false Shepherd1993], p. 59.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Zeelandia and the end of Dutch government on Formosa (1660\u20131662)===\n[[File:Koxinga Dutch Treaty.jpg|thumb|Peace Treaty of 1662, between [[Frederick Coyett|Governor Coyett]] and [[Koxinga]]]]{{main|Siege of Fort Zeelandia}}\nIn 1661, a naval fleet of 200 ships, led by the Ming loyalist [[Koxinga]], landed at {{Interlanguage link multi|Lakjemuyse|zh|3=\u9e7f\u8033\u9580}} with the intention of ousting the Dutch from [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Zeelandia]] and making the island a base for Ming loyalists. Following [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia|a nine-month siege]], Koxinga captured Zeelandia. Koxinga then forced the local representatives of the Dutch East India Company to sign a peace treaty at Zeelandia on 1 February 1662, and leave the island. From then on, the island became Koxinga's base for the [[Kingdom of Tungning]].\n\n===Coda: The Dutch retake Keelung (1664\u20131668) and further hostilies===\nAfter being ousted from Taiwan, the Dutch allied with the new [[Qing dynasty]] in China against the Zheng regime in Taiwan.

This territory was acquired from 1624 to 1642, with most of the villages being required to swear allegiance to the Dutch and then largely being left to govern themselves.\n\nThe manner of acknowledging Dutch lordship was to bring a small native plant (often [[betel nut]] or [[coconut]]) planted in earth from that particular town to the Governor, signifying the granting of the land to the Dutch. The Governor would then award the village leader a robe and a staff as symbols of office and a ''Prinsenvlag'' (\"Prince's Flag\", the flag of [[William the Silent]]) to display in their village.\n\n===Governor of Formosa===\n{{main|Governor of Formosa}}\nThe '''Governor of Formosa''' ({{lang-nl|'''Gouverneur van Formosa'''}}; {{zh|t=''\u53f0\u7063\u9577\u5b98''}})  was the head of government. Appointed by the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (modern-day [[Jakarta]], Indonesia), the Governor of Formosa was empowered to legislate, collect taxes, wage war and declare peace on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and therefore by extension the [[Netherlands|Dutch state]].\n\nHe was assisted in his duties by the '''Council of Tayouan''', a group made up of the various worthies in residence in Tayouan. The President of this council was the second-in-command to the Governor, and would take over his duties if the Governor died or was incapacitated. The Governor's residence was in [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] on Tayouan (then an island, now the [[Anping District]] of [[Tainan City]]). There were a total of twelve Governors during the Dutch colonial era.{{sfnb|Valentijn|1903|p=75}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe Tayouan ''factory'' (as VOC trading posts were called) was to become the second-most profitable factory in the whole of the Dutch East Indies (after the post at [[Hirado]]/[[Dejima]]),{{sfnb|Knapp|1995|p=14}} although it took 22 years for the colony to first return a profit.{{sfnb|van Veen|2003}} Benefitting from triangular trade between themselves, the Chinese and the Japanese, plus exploiting the natural resources of Formosa, the Dutch were able to turn the malarial sub-tropical bay into a lucrative asset. A cash economy was introduced (using the [[Spanish real]], which was used by the VOC) and the period also saw the first serious attempts in the island's history to develop it economically.{{sfnb|Roy|2003|p=15}}\n\n===Trade===\n[[File:Cervus nippon taioanus.JPG|thumb|right|Formosan Sika Deer]]\nThe original intention of setting up [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] at Tayowan ([[Anping District|Anping]]) in southern Formosa was to provide a base for trading with China and Japan, as well as interfering with Portuguese and Spanish trade in the region. Goods traded included silks from China and silver from Japan, among many other things.\n\nAfter establishing their fortress, the Dutch realised the potential of the vast herds of the native [[Formosan sika deer]] (''Cervus nippon taioanus'') roaming the western plains of the island. The tough deer skins were highly prized by the Japanese, who used them to make [[samurai]] armour. Other parts of the deer were sold to Chinese traders for meat and medical use. The Dutch paid aborigines for the deer brought to them and tried to manage the deer stocks to keep up with demand. Unfortunately the deer the aborigines had relied on for their livelihoods began to disappear, forcing the aborigines to adopt new means of survival.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Minna J. |last1=Hsu |first2 =Govindasamy | last2 = Agoramoorthy |date=August 1997 |last3=Desender |first3=Konjev |last4=Baert |first4=Leon |last5=Bonilla |first5=Hector Reyes |title=Wildlife conservation in Taiwan |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=834\u2013836 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.011004834.x |jstor=2387316 |ref=harv}}</ref> However, the subspecies was kept alive in captivity and subsequent reintroduction of the subspecies into the wild has been successful.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u53f0\u7063\u74b0\u5883\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5354\u6703-\u74b0\u5883\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4e2d\u5fc3 |url=http://e-info.org.tw/node/57024 |title=\u58be\u4e01\u793e\u9802\u751f\u614b\u904a \u6885\u82b1\u9e7f\u898b\u5ba2 &#124; \u53f0\u7063\u74b0\u5883\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5354\u6703-\u74b0\u5883\u8cc7\u8a0a\u4e2d\u5fc3 |publisher=E-info.org.tw |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> In 1638, the Dutch exported 151,400 deer hides from Taiwan to Japan.<ref name=\"p. 70\" /> Although the number of deer hides exported to Japan dropped due to the deer population decreased, the considerable number of deer hides ranged from 50,000 to 80,000 was still exported.<ref name=\"p. 70\" /> Tea was also a major export item.

It is difficult to arrive at an estimate of the numbers of these native Formosans when the Dutch arrived, as there was no island-wide authority in a position to count the population, while the aborigines themselves did not keep written records. Even at the extent of greatest Dutch control in the 1650s there were still large regions of the island outside the pale of Dutch authority, meaning that any statistics given necessarily relate only to the area of Dutch sovereignty.\n\n===Ethnicity===\nThe population of Dutch Formosa was composed of three main groups; the aborigines, the Dutch contingent, and the Chinese. There were also a number of [[Spanish people]] resident in the north of the island between 1626 and 1642 in the area around [[Keelung]] and [[Tamsui District|Tamsui]]. At times there were also a handful of Japanese-Korean trader-pirates known as [[Wokou|Wak\u014d]] operating out of coastal areas outside Dutch control.\n\n====The Aborigines====\nThe [[Taiwanese aborigines|native Formosan peoples]] had been in Taiwan for thousands of years before the Dutch arrived. Estimates of the total numbers of aborigines in Taiwan are difficult to come by, but one commentator suggests that there were 150,000 over the entire island during the Dutch era. They lived in villages with populations ranging from a couple of hundred up to around 2,000 people for the biggest towns, with different groups speaking different [[Formosan languages]] which were not mutually intelligible.\n\n====The Dutch====\nThe Dutch contingent was initially composed mostly of soldiers, with some slaves and other workers from the other Dutch colonies, particularly the area around [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (current day [[Jakarta]]). The number of soldiers stationed on the island waxed and waned according to the military needs of the colony, from a low of 180 troops in the early days to a high of 1,800 shortly before [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia|Koxinga's invasion]]. There were also a number of other personnel, from traders and merchants to missionaries and schoolteachers, plus the Dutch brought with them [[slavery|slaves]] from their other colonies, who mainly served as personal slaves for important Dutch people.\n\nDutch women were kept as sexual partners by the Chinese after the Dutch were expelled from Taiwan in 1662. During the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, in which Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] loyalist forces commanded by [[Koxinga]] besieged and defeated the [[Dutch East India Company]] and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and children prisoner. The Dutch missionary [[Antonius Hambroek]], two of his daughters, and his wife were among the Dutch prisoners of war with Koxinga. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding that he persuade them to surrender or else Hambroek would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort, where two of his other daughters were. He urged the Fort not to surrender, assuring them that Koxinga's troops were growing hungry and rebellious, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation. In addition to this, a rumor was spread among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners in retaliation. A few women and children were also killed. The surviving Dutch women and children were then turned into slaves. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine;<ref>{{cite book |last=Moffett |first=Samuel H. |date=1998 |title=A History of Christianity in Asia: 1500-1900 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_XglAQAAIAAJ&dq=hambroek+daughter&q=one+sweet+young+seized+harem |location= |publisher=Orbis Books |edition=2, illustrated, reprint |volume=Volume 2 of A History of Christianity in Asia: 1500-1900.

Despite temporary alliances, similar agricultural practices and few inter-marriages, there also exhibited distinct linguistic and internal structure differences of the tribes. These differences coupled with the widespread practice of head-hunting caused Formosan groups to be suspicious and cautious of strangers.{{sfnb|Shepherd|1993}}\n\nUpon arrival, the first indigenous groups the Dutch made contact with were the Sinkang (\u65b0\u6e2f), Backloan (\u76ee\u52a0\u6e9c\u7063), Soelangh (\u856d), and Mattauw (\u9ebb\u8c46).  The native Taiwanese tribes\u2019 antagonistic predispositions lead to an initial hostile relationship with the colonizers, involving several uprisings including the Hamada Yahei incident of 1628 involving the Sinkang people, and the killing of 20 Dutch soldiers in 1629 by the Mattauw tribe.<ref name=LeeYuchung>{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Yuchung |title=\u8377\u897f\u6642\u671f\u7e3d\u8ad6 (Dutch and Spanish period of Taiwan) |url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=1214 |publisher=Council for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=29 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002944/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=1214 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> VOC eventually transitioned into a divide-and-conquer strategy, and went on to create an alliance with the Sinkang and Seolangh tribes against Mattauw, simultaneously conquering numerous tribes that did not comply with these commands.{{sfnb|Chiu|2008}}\n\nThis interventionist process included the massacre of the indigenous people inhabiting [[Lamay Island]] in 1642 by Dutch forces led by Officer Francois Caron.<ref name=LeeYuchung/> \nAfter these events, the native aborigines eventually were forced into pacification under military domination and were used for a variety of labor activities during the span of Dutch Formosa.  According to documents in 1650, Dutch settlers ruled \u201c315 tribal villages with a total population of around 68,600, estimated 40-50% of the entire indigenes of the island\u201d.{{sfnb|Tai|2007|p=246}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Tai|first=Pao-tsun|title=The Concise History of Taiwan|year=2007|publisher=Taiwan Historica|location=Taiwan|isbn=9789860109504}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nOne of the key pillars of the Dutch colonial era was conversion of the natives to Christianity. From the descriptions of the early missionaries, the native religion was [[animism|animist]] in nature, in one case presided over by priestesses called ''Inibs''.\n\nThe Formosans also practiced various activities which the Dutch perceived as sinful or at least uncivilised, including mandatory abortion (by massage) for women under 37,{{sfnb|Shepherd|1995}} frequent marital infidelity,{{sfnb|Shepherd|1995}} non-observation of the [[Christian Sabbath]] and general nakedness.\nThe Christian Bible was translated into native aboriginal languages and evangelised among the tribes. This marks the first recorded instance of Christianity entering into Taiwanese history, and preludes to the active Christian practices experienced in Taiwan in modern times.{{sfnb|Tai|2007|p=246}}\n\n===Education===\nThe missionaries were also responsible for setting up schools in the villages under Dutch control, teaching not only the religion of the colonists but also other skills such as reading and writing. Prior to Dutch arrival the native inhabitants did not use writing, and the missionaries created a number of [[romanization]] schemes for the various [[Formosan languages]]. This is the first record in history of a written language in Taiwan.<ref name=LeeYuchung/>\n\nExperiments were made with teaching native children the [[Dutch language]], however these were abandoned fairly rapidly after they failed to produce good results. At least one Formosan received an education in the Netherlands; he eventually married a Dutch woman and was apparently well integrated into Dutch society.{{sfnb|Everts|2000|p=151}}\n\n===Technology===\nThe unique variety of trading resources (in particular, deerskins, venison and sugarcane), as well as the untouched nature of Formosa led to an extremely lucrative market for VOC.

The native tribes in the field-regions were taught how to use Western systems of crop management that used more sustainable and efficient ecological technologies, albeit attributed mostly to the fact that due to the increased exploitation of the land, alternative means of management were needed to veer off the extinction of deer and sugar resources.\n\nThe Dutch introduced well-digging,<ref>Murray Rubinstein, (1999) A New History of Taiwan, M.E.

According to the Daily Journals of Fort Zeelandia ({{lang-nl|De dagregisters van het kasteel Zeelandia}}), Dutch colonizers frequently employed males from nearby indigenous tribes, including Hsin-kang (\u65b0\u6e2f) and Mattau (\u9ebb\u8c46) as foot-soldiers in the general militia, to heighten their numbers when quick action was needed during rebellions or uprisings. Such was the case during that of the Guo Huaiyi Revolt in 1652, where the conspirators were eventually bested and subdued by the Dutch through the sourcing of over a hundred native Taiwanese aborigines.{{sfnb|Chiu|2008}}\n\nHowever, the [[Taiwanese Aboriginal]] tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] and defected to [[Koxinga]]'s Chinese forces.<ref>{{cite book |last=Covell |first=Ralph R. |date=1998 |title=Pentecost of the Hills in Taiwan: The Christian Faith Among the Original Inhabitants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaP2UFZVGDoC&pg=PA96 |location= |publisher=Hope Publishing House |edition=illustrated |pages=96\u201397 |isbn=0932727905 |accessdate=10 December 2014 }}</ref> The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty, the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions, the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.{{sfnp|Chiu|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4QzpJtddFxEC&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q&f=false 222].

At the start of the Dutch era, there were estimated to be between 1,000\u20131,500 Chinese in Taiwan, mostly traders living in aboriginal villages.{{sfnb|Shepherd|1993}} During Dutch Formosa rule, Dutch colonial policies encouraged the active immigration of Han Chinese in order to solidify the ecological and agricultural trade establishments, and help maintain control over the area. Because of these reasons, by the end of the colonial period, Taiwan had many Chinese villages holding tens of thousands of people in total, and the ethnic balance of the island was already well on the way to favouring the newly arrived Chinese over the aboriginal tribes.{{sfnb|Andrade|2005}} Furthermore, Dutch settlers opened up communication between both peoples, and set about maintaining relationships with both Han Chinese and native Taiwanese \u2013 which were non-existent beforehand.<ref name=LeeYuchung/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Taiwan]]  \n* [[Eighty Years' War]]  \n* [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]\n* [[Taiwanese aborigines#The European period|Taiwanese aborigines: The European period]]\n* [[Han Taiwanese#Influence of Non-Han Languages|Han Taiwanese: Influence of the Dutch language]]\n* [[Dutch East India Company]]\n* [[Koxinga]]\n* [[Kingdom of Tungning]]\n* [[Spanish Formosa]]\n* [[Dutch pacification campaign on Formosa]]\n* [[Landdag]]\n* ''[[Lord of Formosa]]'' - A historical novel about the period\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Andrade |first=Tonio |title=How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2005 |url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/ |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bluss\u00e9 |first=Leonard |chapter=Dutch Protestant Missionaries as Protagonists of the Territorial Expansion of the VOC on Formosa |title=Conversion, Competition and Conflict : essays on the role of religion in Asia |editor=Kooiman |editor2=van den Muijzenburg |editor3=van der Veer |publisher=VU Uitgeverij, Free University Press |location=Amsterdam |year=1984 |isbn=9789062560851 |ref=Blusse1984}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bluss\u00e9 |first=Leonard |title=After Colonialism: Imperial Histories and Postcolonial Displacement |chapter=Retribution and Remorse: The Interaction between the Administration and the Protestant Mission in Early Colonial Formosa |editor=Prakash, Gyan |year=1994 |isbn=9780691037424 |publisher=Princeton University Press |ref=Blusse1994}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bluss\u00e9 |first=Leonard |editor=Blundell, David |title=Austronesian Taiwan |year=2000 |publisher=University of California |location=California |chapter=The Cave of the Black Spirits |isbn=9780936127095 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Bluss\u00e9 |editor-first=Leonard |editor2-last=Everts |editor2-first=Natalie |editor3-last=Frech |editor3-first=Evelien |title=The Formosan Encounter: Notes on Formosa's Aboriginal Society: A Selection of Documents from Dutch Archival Sources |volume=Vol. I |publisher=Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines |year=1999 |isbn=9579976724 |ref=NotesI}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Bluss\u00e9 |editor-first=Leonard |editor2-last=Everts |editor2-first=Natalie |title=The Formosan Encounter: Notes on Formosa's Aboriginal Society: A Selection of Documents from Dutch Archival Sources |volume=Vol. II |publisher=Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines |year=2000 |isbn=9579976775 |ref=NotesII}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Bluss\u00e9 |editor-first=Leonard |editor2-last=Everts |editor2-first=Natalie |title=The Formosan Encounter: Notes on Formosa's Aboriginal Society: A Selection of Documents from Dutch Archival Sources |volume=Vol. III |publisher=Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines |year=2006 |isbn=9573028735 |ref=NotesIII}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Gospel of St Matthew in Formosan (Sinkang Dialect) with Corresponding Versions in Dutch and English;

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. It was written by [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] and sung by drummer [[Ringo Starr]], his lead vocal for the album. As the second track on the album, it segues from the applause of the [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|title track]].\n\nA subsequent recording of the track by [[Joe Cocker]] became a hit single in 1968 and an anthem for the [[Woodstock]] era.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=247}} In 1978, the Beatles' recording, paired with \"[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\", was reissued as a single, and peaked at number 63 in Britain and number 71 in the United States. Starr has regularly performed the song in concert as a solo artist. \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" was ranked number 311 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].\n\n==Background and composition==\nLennon and McCartney finished writing this song in mid-March 1967,{{sfn|Dowlding|1989|p=165}} written specifically as Starr's track for the album. McCartney said: \"It was pretty much co-written, John and I doing a work song for Ringo, a little craft job.\" In 1970 Lennon stated: \"Paul had the line about 'a little help from my friends.' He had some kind of structure for it, and we wrote it pretty well fifty-fifty from his original idea.\", but in 1980 Lennon said: \"This is Paul, with a little help from me. 'What do you see when you turn out the light/ I can't tell you, but I know it's mine...' is mine.\"<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Beatles Songs. No. 61 \u2013 'With a Little Help From My Friends'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-19691231|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> It was briefly called \"Bad Finger Boogie\" (later the inspiration for the band name [[Badfinger]]),{{sfn|Matovina|2000}} supposedly because Lennon composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having hurt his forefinger.\n\nThe song begins with the applause from the end of \"[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\".\n\nLennon and McCartney deliberately wrote a tune with a limited range \u2013 except for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Starr to achieve. Speaking in the ''[[The Beatles Anthology|Anthology]]'', Starr explained that he insisted on changing the first line \u2014 which originally was \"What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you throw ripe tomatoes at me?\" \u2014 so that fans would not throw tomatoes at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after [[George Harrison]] made a passing comment that he liked [[jelly babies]], the group was showered with them at all of their live performances.){{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=242}}\n\nThe song's composition is unusually well documented, as [[Hunter Davies]] was present and described the writing process in the Beatles' official biography.\n\nThe song is partly in the form of a conversation in which Lennon and McCartney ask a question \u2014 e.g. \"Would you believe in a love at first sight?\" where Starr answers, \"Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.\"\n\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles began recording the song on 29 March 1967, the day before they posed for the ''Sgt.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. It was written by [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] and sung by drummer [[Ringo Starr]], his lead vocal for the album. As the second track on the album, it segues from the applause of the [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|title track]].\n\nA subsequent recording of the track by [[Joe Cocker]] became a hit single in 1968 and an anthem for the [[Woodstock]] era.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=247}} In 1978, the Beatles' recording, paired with \"[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\", was reissued as a single, and peaked at number 63 in Britain and number 71 in the United States. Starr has regularly performed the song in concert as a solo artist. \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" was ranked number 311 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].\n\n==Background and composition==\nLennon and McCartney finished writing this song in mid-March 1967,{{sfn|Dowlding|1989|p=165}} written specifically as Starr's track for the album. McCartney said: \"It was pretty much co-written, John and I doing a work song for Ringo, a little craft job.\" In 1970 Lennon stated: \"Paul had the line about 'a little help from my friends.' He had some kind of structure for it, and we wrote it pretty well fifty-fifty from his original idea.\", but in 1980 Lennon said: \"This is Paul, with a little help from me. 'What do you see when you turn out the light/ I can't tell you, but I know it's mine...' is mine.\"<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Beatles Songs. No. 61 \u2013 'With a Little Help From My Friends'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-19691231|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> It was briefly called \"Bad Finger Boogie\" (later the inspiration for the band name [[Badfinger]]),{{sfn|Matovina|2000}} supposedly because Lennon composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having hurt his forefinger.\n\nThe song begins with the applause from the end of \"[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\".\n\nLennon and McCartney deliberately wrote a tune with a limited range \u2013 except for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Starr to achieve. Speaking in the ''[[The Beatles Anthology|Anthology]]'', Starr explained that he insisted on changing the first line \u2014 which originally was \"What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you throw ripe tomatoes at me?\" \u2014 so that fans would not throw tomatoes at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after [[George Harrison]] made a passing comment that he liked [[jelly babies]], the group was showered with them at all of their live performances.){{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=242}}\n\nThe song's composition is unusually well documented, as [[Hunter Davies]] was present and described the writing process in the Beatles' official biography.\n\nThe song is partly in the form of a conversation in which Lennon and McCartney ask a question \u2014 e.g. \"Would you believe in a love at first sight?\" where Starr answers, \"Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.\"\n\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles began recording the song on 29 March 1967, the day before they posed for the ''Sgt.

The club is based at Selhurst Street, off Radford Road. They are nicknamed 'The Pheasants'. They play in the {{English football updater|Radford}}.\n\n==History==\n\nThe club was established in [[1964 in association football|1964]] as a Sunday League side, '''[[Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd.|Manlove & Alliots]]'''. In 1970 they became '''Radford Olympic''' and in [[1977 in association football|1977]] became the first amateur club in Britain to be allowed to wear advertising on their shirts.\n\nIn season 1979-80 a move to Saturday football was made when the club joined the [[Central Alliance]]. A season later they joined the East Midlands Regional League. They became champions of the [[East Midlands Regional League]] Division One in 1983. The club joined the newly formed Central Midlands League in season 83-84 and in this season the team won the Central Midlands League Senior Cup. For the start of the 1985/86 season the club moved into their Selhurst Street ground\n\nIn 2003 the team became champions of the [[Central Midlands League Premier Division]]. From 2003\u201304, the club played its football in the [[Central Midlands League Supreme Division]], and won the Central Midlands League Floodlit Cup in 2006.<ref name=hist>[http://www.freewebs.com/radfordfc/honoursandhistory.htm Radford F.C. website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201022020/http://freewebs.com/radfordfc/honoursandhistory.htm |date=2009-02-01 }} accessed 24 May 2008</ref>\n\nThey were invited to join the semi\u2013professional [[East Midlands Counties Football League]] for the 2008\u201309 season.<ref name=news>[http://www.freewebs.com/radfordfc/latestnews.htm News on Radford F.C. website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201190721/http://www.freewebs.com/radfordfc/latestnews.htm |date=2009-02-01 }} accessed 24 May 2008</ref> and joined the new league along with seven other Central Midlands League clubs.\n\n2014 - Still playing in the EMCL, Radford's 50th anniversary celebrations included the installation of a brand new playing surface at Selhurst Street and a friendly against a Nottingham Forest XI. Funding for the surface was secured through the Lottery Foundation and has really benefitted the club while once again, bringing local attention to Radford Football Club.  A fantastic 50th anniversary year was completed with  Radford finishing 3rd in the EMCL, their highest ever league position.

The club is based at Selhurst Street, off Radford Road. They are nicknamed 'The Pheasants'. They play in the {{English football updater|Radford}}.\n\n==History==\n\nThe club was established in [[1964 in association football|1964]] as a Sunday League side, '''[[Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd.|Manlove & Alliots]]'''. In 1970 they became '''Radford Olympic''' and in [[1977 in association football|1977]] became the first amateur club in Britain to be allowed to wear advertising on their shirts.\n\nIn season 1979-80 a move to Saturday football was made when the club joined the [[Central Alliance]]. A season later they joined the East Midlands Regional League. They became champions of the [[East Midlands Regional League]] Division One in 1983. The club joined the newly formed Central Midlands League in season 83-84 and in this season the team won the Central Midlands League Senior Cup. For the start of the 1985/86 season the club moved into their Selhurst Street ground\n\nIn 2003 the team became champions of the [[Central Midlands League Premier Division]]. From 2003\u201304, the club played its football in the [[Central Midlands League Supreme Division]], and won the Central Midlands League Floodlit Cup in 2006.<ref name=hist>[http://www.freewebs.com/radfordfc/honoursandhistory.htm Radford F.C. website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201022020/http://freewebs.com/radfordfc/honoursandhistory.htm |date=2009-02-01 }} accessed 24 May 2008</ref>\n\nThey were invited to join the Semi \u2013 Professional [[East Midlands Counties Football League]] for the 2008\u201309 season.<ref name=news>[http://www.freewebs.com/radfordfc/latestnews.htm News on Radford F.C. website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201190721/http://www.freewebs.com/radfordfc/latestnews.htm |date=2009-02-01 }} accessed 24 May 2008</ref> and joined the new league along with seven other Central Midlands League clubs.\n\n2014 - Still playing in the EMCL, Radford's 50th anniversary celebrations included the installation of a brand new playing surface at Selhurst Street and a friendly against a Nottingham Forest XI. Funding for the surface was secured through the Lottery Foundation and has really benefitted the club while once again, bringing local attention to Radford Football Club.  A fantastic 50th anniversary year was completed with  Radford finishing 3rd in the EMCL, their highest ever league position. The finish also ensured FA cup football was played at Selhurst street in the 15/16 season.\n\nIn 2015/16 Under manager Glenn Russell the club had a run of 19 unbeaten league games and finished runners up in the EMCL behind St Andrews.

'''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019, presenter and poet Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer, and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech at the Radio 4 listening festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSoul Music has no presenter, focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began, it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.  When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol, Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world.  He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day, a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning.  Here is a blog by Sarah Blunt, the distinguished natural history radio producer, writing about the birth of Tweet.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/3143388d-5c2f-3e73-a3c1-727bb8c6b65d</ref>\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nBristol Network Radio still makes original and groundbreaking Natural History content for public service radio (not for profit)\nand produced the first eco-thriller drama podcast 'FOREST 404' for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3</ref>\n\nSet in the 24th century, after a data crash called 'The Cataclysm'. Pan, the main character, is a young woman with a boring job sorting and deleting old sound files that survived the crash. She uncovers a set of sound recordings from the early 21st century that haunt her. \n\nThis immersive sci-fi thriller stars Pearl Mackie, Tanya Moodie, and Pippa Haywood \u2013 with original music by Bonobo. You can still hear it on BBC Sounds.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p074m60p</ref>\n\nForest 404 was used to launch a groundbreaking public experiment investigating the impact of natural sounds on well-being and mental health. This was done in partnership with the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council), Natural History Television, Exeter University, Bristol University, and the Open University. The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>  \n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas.  The series has received critical acclaim, which includes winning a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack and a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten.  Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\n\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime, and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\".  \nThe BBC acquired the Christchurch Studios in Clifton to record dramas. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001).  As drama changed, the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as the performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers, and broadcasters.  The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.  \n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city.  More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012.  Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster.  The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes.  The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living.  The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\n\nPresenters associated with Bristol include: \n\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nIn March 2012, The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in Bristol called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership. It was staged to celebrate the best of BBC Radio 4 in conjunction with appropriate non-commercial partners including St George's Bristol, The British Library, Bristol City Council, University of the West of England, Pervasive Media Studios, Bristol University, QEH Bristol, and BBC Radio Bristol.\n\nSome of the events and involvement with the creative people of Bristol were captured in this blog\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2012/03/more_than_words_festival_-_day_1.html</ref>\n\nIn March 2013, BBC Network Radio in Bristol celebrated the arrival of Radio 4's Food Programme to the city by inviting food professionals, food groups, and food lovers to join them in an innovative community partnership festival called \"Bristol Food Connections\", bringing people together around good food.  The first Bristol Food Connections festival was an ambitious 11-day initiative, born out of a five-year partnership between the BBC and public bodies in the city to drive much stronger engagement between the BBC in Whiteladies Road and local people. The aim of Bristol Food Connections was to open up food education, aspiring entrepreneurs, and the food industry to the widest possible talent pool through outreach and education initiatives via BBC broadcasting.<ref>https://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/the-bbc-at-bristol-food-connections/</ref><ref>https://visitbristol.co.uk/whats-on/bristol-food-connections-p2196433</ref>\n\n== BBC Food and Farming Awards ==\n\nThe BBC Food and Farming Awards has been an annual event in the city since 2013 although the awards themselves were launched in 2000 in London by HRH Prince Charles.

The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019, presenter and poet Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer, and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech at the Radio 4 listening festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSoul Music has no presenter, focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began, it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.  When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol, Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world.  He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day, a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning.  Here is a blog by Sarah Blunt, the distinguished natural history radio producer, writing about the birth of Tweet.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/3143388d-5c2f-3e73-a3c1-727bb8c6b65d</ref>\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nBristol Network Radio still makes original and groundbreaking Natural History content for public service radio (not for profit)\nand produced the first eco-thriller drama podcast 'FOREST 404' for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3</ref>\n\nSet in the 24th century, after a data crash called 'The Cataclysm'. Pan, the main character, is a young woman with a boring job sorting and deleting old sound files that survived the crash. She uncovers a set of sound recordings from the early 21st century that haunt her. \n\nThis immersive sci-fi thriller stars Pearl Mackie, Tanya Moodie, and Pippa Haywood \u2013 with original music by Bonobo. You can still hear it on BBC Sounds.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p074m60p</ref>\n\nForest 404 was used to launch a groundbreaking public experiment investigating the impact of natural sounds on well-being and mental health. This was done in partnership with the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council), Natural History Television, Exeter University, Bristol University, and the Open University. The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>  \n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas.  The series has won critical acclaim and some awards include a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack and a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten.  Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\n\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime, and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\".  \nThe BBC acquired the Christchurch Studios in Clifton to record dramas. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001).  As drama changed, the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as the performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers, and broadcasters.  The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.  \n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city.  More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012.  Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster.  The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes.  The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living.  The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\n\nPresenters associated with Bristol include: \n\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nIn March 2012, The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in Bristol called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership. It was staged to celebrate the best of BBC Radio 4 in conjunction with appropriate non-commercial partners including St George's Bristol, The British Library, Bristol City Council, University of the West of England, Pervasive Media Studios, Bristol University, QEH Bristol, and BBC Radio Bristol.\n\nSome of the events and involvement with the creative people of Bristol were captured in this blog\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2012/03/more_than_words_festival_-_day_1.html</ref>\n\nIn March 2013, BBC Network Radio in Bristol celebrated the arrival of Radio 4's Food Programme to the city by inviting food professionals, food groups, and food lovers to join them in an innovative community partnership festival called \"Bristol Food Connections\", bringing people together around good food.  The first Bristol Food Connections festival was an ambitious 11-day initiative, born out of a five-year partnership between the BBC and public bodies in the city to drive much stronger engagement between the BBC in Whiteladies Road and local people. The aim of Bristol Food Connections was to open up food education, aspiring entrepreneurs, and the food industry to the widest possible talent pool through outreach and education initiatives via BBC broadcasting.<ref>https://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/the-bbc-at-bristol-food-connections/</ref><ref>https://visitbristol.co.uk/whats-on/bristol-food-connections-p2196433</ref>\n\n== BBC Food and Farming Awards ==\n\nThe BBC Food and Farming Awards has been an annual event in the city since 2013 although the awards themselves were launched in 2000 in London by HRH Prince Charles.
