[[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] are most respected and viewed as very prominent and greatest rulers in [[Andhra Pradesh]] [[History of Andhra Pradesh|history]] as they were the reason for the origin of [[Telugu New Year]], [[Ugadi]] from this region. Their language was [[Prakrit]] of [[Brahmi script|Brahmi Script]], which served as the base for the [[script]] of [[Telugu language|Telugu Language]]. They issued many [[Gautamiputra Satakarni|coins]] with this [[Prakrit]] language which can be found in many insciptions in this region today. They even started the [[Shaka Calendar|Satavahana Calendar]], The first Indian National Calendar from this region. They even respected and practised [[Buddhism]] and partly responsible for the prevalence of [[Buddhism]] in the region.   \n\nThe city was also once the [[Holy place|holy site]] of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The city used to have a biggest [[Stupa|Buddhist Stupa]] known as [[Amaravati Stupa|Mahachaitya]] (also known as [[Amaravati Stupa]]) which was detroyed over the time. It was also the center of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Culture of Buddhism|learning]] and [[Buddhist art|art]] where many [[Bhikkhu|buddhist followers]] from many [[Southeast Asia|South East Asian]] countries used to visit and practice the [[Culture of Buddhism|buddhist culture]] here in this place. It can be seen from the [[Amaravati Stupa]], many [[Inscriptions|Buddhist inscriptions]], [[Sculpture|sculptures]] and [[Dhyana Buddha statue|Gautam Buddha Statue]] in the city. Many other ancient [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati Buddhist Marbels]] and Buddhist [[remains]] from the region were unfortunately destroyed over the time and some of them were exported to Chennai Museum and [[British Museum]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]] which can be seen there today. The sculptures on the [[Amaravati Marbles|Limestone Marbels]] depict many [[Buddhist art]], [[Epigraphy|incriptions]] and [[Amaravati Stupa|buddhist stupas]] serving as an eye feast.

The State Government identified the Capital City area between Vijayawada and Guntur cities on the Southern bank of River Krishna upstream of Prakasam Barrage. The Amaravati Capital City has an area of 217.23 km<sup>2</sup> and is spread across 25 villages in 3 mandals (Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli) of Guntur district. The 25 villages in the Capital City area have about 1 lakh population in about 27,000 households. The nearest cities are Vijayawada at a distance of 30 km and Guntur at a distance of 18 km. The nearest railway station is KC Canal railway station near Tadepalli and the nearest airport is Gannavaram which is at a distance of 22 km. The city is planned to spread over 217 km<sup>2</sup> area with a total cost of \u20b9 553.43 billions to the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) out of which state government contribution is only \u20b9 126 billion (equity \u20b9 66.29 billion and supporting grant \u20b9 59.71 billion) spread over a period of 8 years from April 2018 to March 2026 (\u20b9 5 billion in 2018\u201319, \u20b9 18 billion per year for later six years and \u20b9 13 billion in 2025\u201326).<ref name=\"amr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eenadu.net/eenadu-exclusive/newsarticle/general/1500/120008374|title=Amaravati city a self financed project |language=Telugu|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA)\n|'''City area details:'''\n|'''Land utilization'''\n|-\n|Roads, public utilities, parks, natural streams, water bodies\n|27,885 acres\n|-\n|Plots for residential area allotted to the Land contributors(Farmers)\n|11,826 acres\n|-\n|For the needs of other developments presently owned by the CRDA\n|14,037 acres\n|-\n|Total area under the jurisdiction of CRDA\n|53,748 acres\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Amaravati City Land Usage\n!Land use\n!Area (Sq.&nbsp;km)\n!'''%'''\n|-\n|Residential\n|60.77\n|27.9\n|-\n|Commercial\n|20.99\n|9.34\n|-\n|Public and Semi Public\n|11.49\n|5.29\n|-\n|Open spaces and Recreation\n|52.78\n|24.29\n|-\n|Industrial\n|12.26\n|5.64\n|-\n|Water Bodies\n|25.78\n|11.87\n|-\n|Traffic and Transportation\n|23.04\n|10.61\n|-\n|Cultural Heritage\n|0.15\n|0.07\n|-\n|Seed Capital\n|10.67\n|4.91\n|-\n|Total\n|217.23\n|100\n|}\nThe contribution from the government is to be repaid by the CRDA after the year 2037.

[[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] are most respected and viewed as very prominent and greatest rulers in [[Andhra Pradesh]] [[History of Andhra Pradesh|history]] as they were the reason for the origin of [[Telugu New Year]], [[Ugadi]] from this region.

They issued many [[Gautamiputra Satakarni|coins]] with this [[Prakrit]] language which can be found in many insciptions in this region today.

The city used to have a biggest [[Stupa|Buddhist Stupa]] known as [[Amaravati Stupa|Mahachaitya]] (also known as [[Amaravati Stupa]]) which was detroyed over the time. It was also the center of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Culture of Buddhism|learning]] and [[Buddhist art|art]] which can be seen from the [[Amaravati Stupa]], many [[Inscriptions|Buddhist inscriptions]], [[Sculpture|sculptures]] and [[Dhyana Buddha statue|Gautam Buddha Statue]] in the city. Many other ancient [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati Buddhist Marbels]] and Buddhist [[remains]] from the region were unfortunately destroyed over the time and some of them were exported to Chennai Museum and [[British Museum]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]] which can be seen there today. The sculptures on the [[Amaravati Marbles|Limestone Marbels]] depict many [[Buddhist art]], [[Epigraphy|incriptions]] and [[Amaravati Stupa|buddhist stupas]] serving as an eye feast.

These two episodes led to countless other television roles that Borgnine would gain in ''[[Goodyear Television Playhouse]]'', ''[[The Ford Television Theatre]]'', ''[[Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Frontier Justice (TV series)|Frontier Justice]]'', ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', ''[[Run for Your Life (TV series)|Run for Your Life]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (a two-part episode entitled \"The Lord is My Shepherd\"), ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', the final episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', the first episode of ''[[Wagon Train]]'', and many others.\n\nIn 2009, at the age of 92, Borgnine earned a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for his performance as Paul Manning in the series finale of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', entitled \"[[And in the End...]]\". He made his first appearance as the character in the preceding episode \"Old Times\".\n\n====''McHale's Navy''====\n[[File:Ernest Borgnine McHale McHale's Navy 1963.JPG|thumb|Borgnine as [[Lieutenant Commander]] McHale in ''McHale's Navy'' in 1963]]\n\nIn 1962, Borgnine signed a contract with [[Universal Studios]] for the lead role as the gruff but lovable skipper, Quinton McHale, in what began as a serious one-hour 1962 episode called ''[[Seven Against the Sea]]'' for ''Alcoa Premiere'', and later reworked to a comedy called ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', a World War II sitcom, which also co-starred unfamiliar comedians [[Joe Flynn (American actor)|Joe Flynn]] as Capt. Wally Binghamton and [[Tim Conway]] as Ens. Charles Parker. The insubordinate crew of PT-73 helped the show become an overnight success during its first season, landing in the Top 30 in 1963.\n\nHe thrived on the adulation from fans for their favorite navy man, and in 1963 received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. At the end of the fourth season, in 1966 low ratings and repetitive storylines brought ''McHale's Navy'' to an end.\n\nTim Conway said about the sitcom: \"You know, we were all guys, it was about the war, and about men, so, there weren't many women working on the show, so we can spit, talk, swear, and everything\u2014smoke? Gosh. So, it was male oriented.\" Conway once referred to Borgnine making new friends off of the Universal set, \"It was the beginning of the trams, going through Universal. Ernie was probably one of the few people at Universal, who would stop the trams and say, 'Hello, how are you?' He would talk to everybody at the tram.\" While the show ''McHale's Navy'' was going strong, Tim had also said of Borgnine's short-lived marriage to [[Ethel Merman]], \"Ernie is volatile. I mean, there's no question about that; and Ethel was a very strong lady. So, you put two bombs in a room, something is going to explode, and I guess it probably did.\" He also said about the cancellation of ''McHale's Navy'' was, \"We had gone from the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] to [[Italy]], and then, once in a while, we got to New York or something. The storylines were beginning to duplicate themselves. So, they actually said, 'Maybe, they had its run!'\". Conway kept in touch with Borgnine for more than 40 years, while living not too far from one another. In 1999, the duo reunited to lend their voices to several episodes of the popular 2000s animated comedy, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. \n\nAt the time ''McHale's Navy'' began production, Borgnine was married to actress [[Katy Jurado]]. Her death in 2002 drew Borgnine and Conway much closer, as Conway had heard so much of the actress's death. He knew that Borgnine had once referred to her as \"beautiful, but a tiger.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Katy Jurado|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1400752/Katy-Jurado.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=29 August 2017|language=en|date=2002-07-09}}</ref> Conway thought Borgnine was more than likely to have died an Italian count, had it not been for [[Mussolini|Benito Mussolini]]: \"I can't envision him as a count. But maybe as a king&nbsp;\u2014 certainly not a count.\" The last thing he said about his acting mentor's long career: \"There were no limits to Ernie. When you look at his career&nbsp;\u2014 ''Fatso Judson'' to ''Marty''&nbsp;\u2014 that's about as varied as you get in characters and he handled both of them with equal delicacy and got the most out of those characters.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryclairekendall/2012/10/11/remembering-ernest-borgnine-on-50th-anniversary-of-mchales-navy-premiere/#401a0f7f47f3|title=Remembering Ernest Borgnine on 50th Anniversary of McHale's Navy Premiere|magazine=Forbes.com|date=2012-10-11 |access-date=2016-10-04}}</ref>\n\n====''Airwolf''====\nBorgnine returned to a new contract with [[Universal Studios]] in 1983, for a co-starring role opposite [[Jan-Michael Vincent]], on ''[[Airwolf]]''. After he was approached by producer [[Donald P. Bellisario]], who had been impressed by Borgnine's guest role as a wrestler in a 1982 episode of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', he immediately agreed. He played Dominic Santini, a helicopter pilot, in the series, which became an immediate hit. Borgnine's strong performances belied his exhaustion due to the grueling production schedule, and the challenges of working with his younger, troubled series lead. The show was cancelled by [[CBS]] in 1986.\n\n====''The Single Guy''====\nHe auditioned a third time for a co-starring role opposite [[Jonathan Silverman]] in ''[[The Single Guy]]'' as doorman Manny Cordoba, which lasted two seasons. According to Silverman, Borgnine came to work with more energy and passion than all other stars combined. He was the first person to arrive on the set every day and the last to leave.\n\n====''Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders''====\nIn 1996, Borgnine starred in the televised fantasy/thriller film ''[[Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders]]'' (partially adapted from the 1984 horror film ''[[The Devil's Gift]]''). As narrator and storyteller, Borgnine recounts a string of related supernatural tales, his modern-day fables notably centering on an enchanted and malicious [[cymbal-banging monkey toy]] stolen from the wizard [[Merlin]]. The film was later featured in the parodical television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', and has since gained a prominent cult following.<ref name=\"mstk.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mst3kinfo.com/?p=5768|title=Episode guide: 1003 \u2013 Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders|publisher=Satellite News|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Other activities===\nAlso in 1996, Borgnine toured the United States on a bus to meet his fans and see the country. The trip was the subject of a 1997 documentary, ''[[Ernest Borgnine on the Bus]]''. He also served one year as the chairman of the National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, visiting patients in many [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] medical centers.\n\n===Work after 1999===\nStarting in 1999, Borgnine provided his voice talent to the [[animated sitcom]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' as the elderly superhero [[Mermaid Man]] (where he was paired up with his ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' co-star [[Tim Conway]] as the voice of Mermaid Man's sidekick [[Barnacle Boy]]). He expressed affection for this role, in no small part for its popularity among children. After his death Nickelodeon re-aired all of the episodes in which Mermaid Man appeared in memoriam. Borgnine also appeared as himself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood]]\", in addition to a number of television commercials. In 2000, he was the executive producer of ''[[Hoover (film)|Hoover]]'', in which he was the only credited actor.\n\nIn 2007, Borgnine starred in the [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] original film ''[[A Grandpa for Christmas]]''. He played a man who, after his estranged daughter ends up in the hospital because of a car accident, discovers that he has a granddaughter he never knew about. She is taken into his care, and they soon become great friends. Borgnine received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television for his performance. At 90, he was the oldest Golden Globe nominee ever.\n\nBorgnine's autobiography ''Ernie'' was published by [[Citadel Press]] in July 2008. ''Ernie'' is a loose, conversational recollection of highlights from his acting career and notable events from his personal life.\n\nOn April 2, 2009, he appeared in the last episode of the long-running medical series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''. His role was that of a husband whose long marriage ended with his wife's death. In his final scene, his character is in a hospital bed lying beside his just-deceased wife. His performance garnered an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, his third nomination and his first in 29 years (since being nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Special in 1980 for ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'').\n\nIn 2009, at age 92, he starred as Frank, the main character of ''[[Another Harvest Moon]]'', directed by Greg Swartz and also starring [[Piper Laurie]] and [[Anne Meara]]. On October 2, 2010, Borgnine appeared as himself in a sketch with [[Morgan Freeman]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. On October 15, 2010, he appeared in ''[[Red (2010 film)|Red]]'', which was filmed earlier that year. In late 2011, Borgnine completed what would be his last film, playing Rex Page in ''[[The Man Who Shook the Hand of Vicente Fernandez]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Ernest Borgnine McHale McHale's Navy dress whites 1962.JPG|thumb|upright|Publicity photo of Borgnine as Lieutenant Commander Quinton McHale from ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' in 1963]]\nBorgnine married five times.

He was then married to actress [[Katy Jurado]] from 1959 to 1963. Borgnine's marriage to singer [[Ethel Merman]] in 1964 lasted only 42 days. Their time together was mostly spent hurling profane insults at each other, and both would later admit that the marriage was a colossal mistake (Merman's description of the marriage in her autobiography was a solitary blank page). Their divorce was finalized on May 25, 1965.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1972, Borgnine was married to Donna Rancourt, with whom he had a son, Cristopher (born August 9, 1969) and two daughters, Sharon (born August 5, 1965) and Diana (born December 29, 1970). His fifth and last marriage was to [[Tova Traesnaes]], which lasted from February 24, 1973 until his death in July 2012.\n\nIn 2000, Borgnine received his 50-year pin as a [[Freemason]] at Abingdon Lodge No. 48 in [[Abingdon, Virginia]].

He achieved continuing success in the sitcom ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' (1962\u20131966), in which he played the title character, and co-starred as Dominic Santini in the action series ''[[Airwolf]]'' (1984&ndash;1986), in addition to a wide variety of other roles.\n\nBorgnine earned his third [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination at age 92 for his work on the 2009 series finale of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.

In a British Film Institute interview about his life and career, he said:\n\n{{quote|After World War II, we wanted no more part in war. I didn't even want to be a Boy Scout. I went home and said that I was through with the Navy and so now, what do we do?

His mother encouraged him to pursue a more glamorous profession and suggested to him that his personality would be well suited for the stage. He surprised his mother by taking the suggestion to heart, although his father was far from enthusiastic. In 2011, Borgnine remembered,\n\n{{quote|She said, \"You always like getting in front of people and making a fool of yourself, why don't you give it a try?\" I was sitting at the kitchen table and I saw this light.

And 10 years later, I had [[Grace Kelly]] handing me an [[Academy Award]].}}\n\n===Stage===\nHe studied acting at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford, then moved to Virginia, where he became a member of the [[Barter Theatre]] in [[Abingdon, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/movies/ernest-borgnine-tough-but-tender-actor-is-dead-at-95.html|title=Ernest Borgnine, Tough but Tender Actor, Is Dead at 95|first=Anita|last=Gates|date=July 8, 2012|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> It had been named for the director's allowing audiences to barter produce for admission during the cash-lean years of the [[Great Depression]]. In 1947, Borgnine landed his first stage role in ''[[State of the Union (play)|State of the Union]]''. Although it was a short role, he won over the audience. His next role was as the Gentleman Caller in [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''.\n\nIn 1949, Borgnine went to New York, where he had his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the role of a nurse in the play ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''. More roles on stage led him to being cast for decades as a [[character actor]].\n\n===Films===\n[[File:Ernest Borgnine-Betsy Blair in Marty trailer.jpg|thumb|Borgnine and [[Betsy Blair]] in  a [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', 1955]]\n\nAn appearance as the villain on TV's ''[[Captain Video]]'' led to Borgnine's casting in the motion picture ''[[The Whistle at Eaton Falls]]'' (1951) for Columbia Pictures.<ref>Kisselhoff, Jeff; THE BOX: An Oral History of Television, 1929-1961; Viking Penguin, 1995</ref>  That year, Borgnine moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], where he eventually received his big break in Columbia's ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), playing the sadistic Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson, who beats a stockade prisoner in his charge, Angelo Maggio (played by [[Frank Sinatra]]). Borgnine built a reputation as a dependable character actor and played villains in early films, including movies such as ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'', and ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]''.\n\nIn 1955, the actor starred as a warmhearted butcher in ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', the film version of [[Marty (teleplay)|the television play of the same name]]. He gained an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] over Frank Sinatra, [[James Dean]] (who had died by the time of the ceremony), and former Best Actor winners [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[James Cagney]].\n\nBorgnine's film career flourished for the next three decades, including roles in ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|The Flight of the Phoenix]]'' (1965), ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967),  ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'' (1968), ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972), ''[[Emperor of the North]]'' (1973), ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978), ''[[The Black Hole]]'' (1979), and ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981).\n\nOne of his most famous roles was that of Dutch, a member of ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' in the 1969 Western classic from director [[Sam Peckinpah]]. Of his role in ''The Wild Bunch'', Borgnine later said,\n\n{{quote|I did [think it was a moral film]. Because to me, every picture should have some kind of a moral to it. I feel that when we used to watch old pictures, as we still do I'm sure, the bad guys always got it in the end and the good guys always won out. Today it's a little different. Today it seems that the bad guys are getting the good end of it. There was always a moral in our story.<ref name=\"bfi.org.uk\"/>}}\n\n===Television===\nBorgnine made his TV debut as a character actor in ''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers]]'', beginning in 1951. These two episodes led to countless other television roles that Borgnine would gain in ''[[Goodyear Television Playhouse]]'', ''[[The Ford Television Theatre]]'', ''[[Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Frontier Justice (TV series)|Frontier Justice]]'', ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', ''[[Run for Your Life (TV series)|Run for Your Life]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (a two-part episode entitled \"The Lord is My Shepherd\"), ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', the final episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', the first episode of ''[[Wagon Train]]'', and many others.\n\nIn 2009, at the age of 92, Borgnine earned a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for his performance as Paul Manning in the series finale of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', entitled \"[[And in the End...]]\". He made his first appearance as the character in the preceding episode \"Old Times\".\n\n====''McHale's Navy''====\n[[File:Ernest Borgnine McHale McHale's Navy 1963.JPG|thumb|Borgnine as [[Lieutenant Commander]] McHale in ''McHale's Navy'' in 1963]]\n\nIn 1962, Borgnine signed a contract with [[Universal Studios]] for the lead role as the gruff but lovable skipper, Quinton McHale, in what began as a serious one-hour 1962 episode called ''[[Seven Against the Sea]]'' for ''Alcoa Premiere'', and later reworked to a comedy called ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', a World War II sitcom, which also co-starred unfamiliar comedians [[Joe Flynn (American actor)|Joe Flynn]] as Capt. Wally Binghamton and [[Tim Conway]] as Ens. Charles Parker. The insubordinate crew of PT-73 helped the show become an overnight success during its first season, landing in the Top 30 in 1963.\n\nHe thrived on the adulation from fans for their favorite navy man, and in 1963 received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. At the end of the fourth season, in 1966 low ratings and repetitive storylines brought ''McHale's Navy'' to an end.\n\nTim Conway said about the sitcom: \"You know, we were all guys, it was about the war, and about men, so, there weren't many women working on the show, so we can spit, talk, swear, and everything\u2014smoke? Gosh. So, it was male oriented.\" Conway once referred to Borgnine making new friends off of the Universal set, \"It was the beginning of the trams, going through Universal. Ernie was probably one of the few people at Universal, who would stop the trams and say, 'Hello, how are you?' He would talk to everybody at the tram.\" While the show ''McHale's Navy'' was going strong, Tim had also said of Borgnine's short-lived marriage to [[Ethel Merman]], \"Ernie is volatile. I mean, there's no question about that; and Ethel was a very strong lady. So, you put two bombs in a room, something is going to explode, and I guess it probably did.\" He also said about the cancellation of ''McHale's Navy'' was, \"We had gone from the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] to [[Italy]], and then, once in a while, we got to New York or something. The storylines were beginning to duplicate themselves. So, they actually said, 'Maybe, they had its run!'\". Conway kept in touch with Borgnine for more than 40 years, while living not too far from one another. In 1999, the duo reunited to lend their voices to several episodes of the popular 2000s animated comedy, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. \n\nAt the time ''McHale's Navy'' began production, Borgnine was married to actress [[Katy Jurado]]. Her death in 2002 drew Borgnine and Conway much closer, as Conway had heard so much of the actress's death. He knew that Borgnine had once referred to her as \"beautiful, but a tiger.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Katy Jurado|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1400752/Katy-Jurado.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=29 August 2017|language=en|date=2002-07-09}}</ref> Conway thought Borgnine was more than likely to have died an Italian count, had it not been for [[Mussolini|Benito Mussolini]]: \"I can't envision him as a count. But maybe as a king&nbsp;\u2014 certainly not a count.\" The last thing he said about his acting mentor's long career: \"There were no limits to Ernie. When you look at his career&nbsp;\u2014 ''Fatso Judson'' to ''Marty''&nbsp;\u2014 that's about as varied as you get in characters and he handled both of them with equal delicacy and got the most out of those characters.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryclairekendall/2012/10/11/remembering-ernest-borgnine-on-50th-anniversary-of-mchales-navy-premiere/#401a0f7f47f3|title=Remembering Ernest Borgnine on 50th Anniversary of McHale's Navy Premiere|magazine=Forbes.com|date=2012-10-11 |access-date=2016-10-04}}</ref>\n\n====''Airwolf''====\nBorgnine returned to a new contract with [[Universal Studios]] in 1983, for a co-starring role opposite [[Jan-Michael Vincent]], on ''[[Airwolf]]''. After he was approached by producer [[Donald P. Bellisario]], who had been impressed by Borgnine's guest role as a wrestler in a 1982 episode of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', he immediately agreed. He played Dominic Santini, a helicopter pilot, in the series, which became an immediate hit. Borgnine's strong performances belied his exhaustion due to the grueling production schedule, and the challenges of working with his younger, troubled series lead. The show was cancelled by [[CBS]] in 1986.\n\n====''The Single Guy''====\nHe auditioned a third time for a co-starring role opposite [[Jonathan Silverman]] in ''[[The Single Guy]]'' as doorman Manny Cordoba, which lasted two seasons. According to Silverman, Borgnine came to work with more energy and passion than all other stars combined. He was the first person to arrive on the set every day and the last to leave.\n\n====''Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders''====\nIn 1996, Borgnine starred in the televised fantasy/thriller film ''[[Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders]]'' (partially adapted from the 1984 horror film ''[[The Devil's Gift]]''). As narrator and storyteller, Borgnine recounts a string of related supernatural tales, his modern-day fables notably centering on an enchanted and malicious [[cymbal-banging monkey toy]] stolen from the wizard [[Merlin]]. The film was later featured in the parodical television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', and has since gained a prominent cult following.<ref name=\"mstk.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mst3kinfo.com/?p=5768|title=Episode guide: 1003 \u2013 Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders|publisher=Satellite News|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Other activities===\nAlso in 1996, Borgnine toured the United States on a bus to meet his fans and see the country. The trip was the subject of a 1997 documentary, ''[[Ernest Borgnine on the Bus]]''. He also served one year as the chairman of the National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, visiting patients in many [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] medical centers.\n\n===Work after 1999===\nStarting in 1999, Borgnine provided his voice talent to the [[animated sitcom]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' as the elderly superhero [[Mermaid Man]] (where he was paired up with his ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' co-star [[Tim Conway]] as the voice of Mermaid Man's sidekick [[Barnacle Boy]]). He expressed affection for this role, in no small part for its popularity among children. After his death Nickelodeon re-aired all of the episodes in which Mermaid Man appeared in memoriam. Borgnine also appeared as himself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood]]\", in addition to a number of television commercials. In 2000, he was the executive producer of ''[[Hoover (film)|Hoover]]'', in which he was the only credited actor.\n\nIn 2007, Borgnine starred in the [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] original film ''[[A Grandpa for Christmas]]''. He played a man who, after his estranged daughter ends up in the hospital because of a car accident, discovers that he has a granddaughter he never knew about. She is taken into his care, and they soon become great friends. Borgnine received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television for his performance. At 90, he was the oldest Golden Globe nominee ever.\n\nBorgnine's autobiography ''Ernie'' was published by [[Citadel Press]] in July 2008. ''Ernie'' is a loose, conversational recollection of highlights from his acting career and notable events from his personal life.\n\nOn April 2, 2009, he appeared in the last episode of the long-running medical series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''. His role was that of a husband whose long marriage ended with his wife's death. In his final scene, his character is in a hospital bed lying beside his just-deceased wife. His performance garnered an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, his third nomination and his first in 29 years (since being nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Special in 1980 for ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'').\n\nIn 2009, at age 92, he starred as Frank, the main character of ''[[Another Harvest Moon]]'', directed by Greg Swartz and also starring [[Piper Laurie]] and [[Anne Meara]]. On October 2, 2010, Borgnine appeared as himself in a sketch with [[Morgan Freeman]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. On October 15, 2010, he appeared in ''[[Red (2010 film)|Red]]'', which was filmed earlier that year. In late 2011, Borgnine completed what would be his last film, playing Rex Page in ''[[The Man Who Shook the Hand of Vicente Fernandez]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Ernest Borgnine McHale McHale's Navy dress whites 1962.JPG|thumb|upright|Publicity photo of Borgnine as Lieutenant Commander Quinton McHale from ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' in 1963]]\nBorgnine married five times.

He was then married to actress [[Katy Jurado]] from 1959 to 1963. Borgnine's marriage to singer [[Ethel Merman]] in 1964 lasted only 42 days. Their time together was mostly spent hurling profane insults at each other, and both would later admit that the marriage was a colossal mistake (Merman's description of the marriage in her autobiography was a solitary blank page).
