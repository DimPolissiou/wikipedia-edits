The lightsaber first appeared in the original [[1977 in film|1977]] film ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' and has since appeared in every ''Star Wars'' movie, with at least one lightsaber [[duel]] occurring in each main film installment.

It leaves [[cauterization|cauterized]] wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another lightsaber blade, or by [[energy shield]]s. The blade has even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the lightsaber has been shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof materials have been introduced in the ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Expanded Universe]]''. An active lightsaber gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the blade into contact with another lightsaber's blade produces a loud crackle.\n\n==Conceptual origin==\nThere are several literary precedents in science fiction for a \"[[sword]]\" of pure energy that can cut through anything, notably:[[File:Analog_magazine_cover_art_showing_a_lightsaber.jpg|thumb|upright|Gordon R.

Adding a few \"[[greeble]]s\" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. [[George Lucas]] decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where filming on ''Star Wars'' began.<ref>Star Wars Insider magazine issue No 98 January 2008</ref> It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]/[[Darth Vader]] duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.\n\n=== Visual effects ===\nKorean [[animator]] [[Nelson Shin]], who was working for [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a [[rotoscope]], an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look \"a little shaky\" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an [[optical printer]], making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a [[degaussing|degausser]] sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an [[X-Acto|X-Acto knife]] to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Interview with Nelson Shin| publisher = [[CNN]]|date = November 9, 2007 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/18/talkasia.nelsonshin/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===Sound===\nThe lightsaber [[sound effect]] was developed by sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] as a combination of the hum of idling [[Movie projector#Automation and the rise of the multiplex|interlock motors]] in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless [[microphone]].

Each lightsaber is unique, though some may bear resemblance to others, especially if there is a connection between the builders. The first film appearance of a dual-bladed lightsaber (first depicted in the comic series ''[[Tales of the Jedi]]'') was in ''The Phantom Menace'', wielded by [[Darth Maul]]. The video game ''[[The Force Unleashed]]'' introduced two other variants: a lightsaber pike (a lightsaber with a shorter blade but a long handle, resembling a spear) and a [[Tonfa]]-style lightsaber with right-angle hilt. [[Count Dooku]] wields a standard lightsaber with a curved hilt.\n\nThe [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] adds several lightsaber types, including short<ref name=\"KOTOR1\">{{cite video game|title=[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]] |developer=[[BioWare]] |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |date=November 19, 2003 |platform=PC }}</ref> and dual-phase (adjustable length) weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Anderson |first=Kevin J. |authorlink=Kevin J.

More obscure lightsaber variations, such as the \"lightwhip\", an elongated flexible blade used in a matter akin to a [[whip]], the \"lightclub\", an enlarged standard lightsaber, and the \"shoto\", a dramatically smaller variation often paired with a standard sized saber have also made appearances.\n\n===Colors===\nLightsabers depicted in the first two released films, ''A New Hope'' and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). [[Luke Skywalker]]'s new lightsaber in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters. However, it was changed to green in the film's final edit after initial viewings by the filmmakers, who felt that it would better stand out against the blue sky of [[Tatooine]] in outdoor scenes, and this color change is also reflected in the film's re-release posters. [[Mace Windu]]'s purple-bladed lightsaber, as first seen in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', was requested by the actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] for two reasons; purple is his favorite color and that the purple blade is one way to make his character stand out among other Jedi. Jackson is known to frequently request that the characters he plays use an item that is purple in color.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubyo5eZz_Jc|title=Samuel L.

The color of this crystal becomes the blade's color when installed into a lightsaber hilt. In the book ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'' and the comic series ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith'', it is shown that dark side users remove the crystal from a defeated Jedi's lightsaber and concentrate force energy on it to break its connection to the light side, a process known as \"bleeding\" to create a red crystal. The process can also be reversed, as shown in ''Ahsoka'' when the titular character does so to a pair of crystals taken from an Inquisitor; she uses them in a pair of white-bladed lightsabers.\n\nA multitude of blade colors have appeared in the Expanded Universe before the precursor films rendered many of the explanations for their coloring [[canon (fiction)|non-canonical]].\n\n{{anchor|Darksaber}} The Darksaber is a unique lightsaber that has a distinct black blade with a white halo, introduced in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) and subsequently appearing in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', where it is described as an ancient lightsaber created by the first [[Mandalorian]] to become a Jedi, and later serves as a symbol of Mandalorian authority.

Anderson personally trained [[Mark Hamill]] (Luke Skywalker) and, in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', performed all the stunts as [[Darth Vader]] during the lightsaber duels wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the trilogy was highlighted in the film ''[[Reclaiming the Blade]]'' where he shared his experiences as a fencer developing the lightsaber techniques for the three original movies.\n\nThe lightsaber duels in the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy were specifically choreographed by stunt-coordinator [[Nick Gillard]] to be miniature \"stories\". For these films, Gillard was the primary sword instructor for [[Liam Neeson]] ([[Qui-Gon Jinn]]), [[Ewan McGregor]] (Obi-Wan Kenobi), [[Ray Park]] ([[Darth Maul]]) and [[Hayden Christensen]] (Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader) among other actors. His goal in choreographing the action for ''The Phantom Menace'' was to create stunts that flow from the story; \"You can't just think, 'I'm a [[stunt coordinator]], I'm going to make a big stunt happen',\" Gillard said. \"It's all about making it tie in nicely with the film so that you don't notice the stunts.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn writing the prequel trilogy, George Lucas said he wanted the lightsaber combat to be \"reminiscent of what had been done in the previous films but also something that was more energized. We'd seen old men, young boys, and characters who were half-droid, but we'd never seen a Jedi in his prime.

In the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], there were several [[Star Wars video games|''Star Wars'' video games]] available on the [[Wii]] (''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Lightsaber Duels]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]'') and one on the [[Xbox 360]] (''[[Kinect Star Wars]]'') that utilized motion controls to wield a lightsaber through arm gestures. ''Unleashed'' and ''Duels'', both developed by [[Krome Studios]], have more precise control of the lightsaber, allowing players to swing it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the [[Wii Remote]], while ''Kinect'' takes advantage of [[Kinect#Kinect for Xbox 360 (2010)|the eponymous, camera-based motion controller]] to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the lightsaber.\n\nPrior to the seventh generation, there were also a few earlier ''Star Wars'' games that used gesture-based control to simulate lightsaber combat, such as the two bonus levels of the [[arcade game]] ''[[Star Wars Trilogy Arcade|Star Wars Trilogy]]'', where the player controls Luke Skywalker as he wields his lightsaber against [[Boba Fett]] and Darth Vader in ''Return of the Jedi'' by pushing a joystick in one of eight directions to follow on-screen offensive and defensive cues,<ref name=\"SWTA overview at AllGame\">{{allgame | 15820 | first=Christopher Michael | last=Baker | accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> and a [[TV game]] released around the release of ''Revenge of the Sith'', titled ''Star Wars: Saga Edition - Lightsaber Battle Game'', in which the player swings a lightsaber-shaped controller to deflect blaster bolts from infantry (such as [[battle droids]] and [[clone troopers]]) and duel against characters from across the saga.\n\nBy the time [[Disney]] purchased Lucasfilm, new technological advances made [[augmented reality]] possible, leading to the creation of some more notable motion-controlled lightsaber video games that took advantage of that feature. One of them came in the form of a special activity mode in the official ''Star Wars'' fan app on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in which players use their smartphone's motion sensors to practice and master blaster deflection with a training droid (which appears on the phone's rear camera), similar to the deflection training exercises featured aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' in ''A New Hope'', while progressing through the ranks of the Jedi or Sith order. Another is in ''Star Wars: Jedi Challenges'', which works with a Lenovo Mirage AR headset, a tracking sensor and a dedicated lightsaber controller that launched in December 2017. One of the multiple game modes available in ''Challenges'', which was jointly developed by Disney and [[Lenovo]], enables players to confront ''Star Wars'' villains in lightsaber duels, such as Darth Maul and Kylo Ren.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/star-wars-jedi-challenges-augmented-reality-game-launches-with-lenovo-mirage-headset.html|title=Lenovo, Disney launch ''Star Wars'' Jedi aurgmented reality game that lets you use a real lightsaber|first=Arjun|last=Kharpal|date=August 31, 2017|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction|Film}}\n* [[List of Star Wars weapons|List of ''Star Wars'' weapons]]\n* [[Physics and Star Wars|Physics and ''Star Wars'']]\n* [[Photonic molecule]]\n* ''[[Star Wars: Evolution of the Lightsaber Duel]]''\n\n== References ==\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{notelist}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lightsabers}}\n*{{Star Wars Databank|subject=lightsaber|text = Lightsaber}}\n* {{Wookieepedia|Lightsaber}}\n* [http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/lightsaber1.htm \"Howstuffworks \u2013 Inside the Lightsaber\"]\n* [http://www.shortlist.com/news/scientists-could-create-real-lightsabers#art Scientists Could Create Real Lightsabers]\n\n{{Star Wars universe|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Star Wars weapons]]\n[[Category:Fictional swords]]\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:Sith]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts]]\n[[Category:Fictional energy weapons]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the song by EXO|Lightsaber (song)}}\n{{short description|Fictional weapon}}\n{{Infobox fictional artifact\n|color           = Black\n|name            = Lightsaber\n|image           = Lightsaber, silver hilt, blue blade.png\n|caption         = A blue beamed lightsaber\n|alt             = Lightsaber with blue beam\n|first           = [[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977)\n|first_ep        = \n|first_type      = \n|date            = \n|creator         = [[George Lucas]]\n|episode_creator = \n|source          = {{Linkcolor|LightBlue|Star Wars}}\n|source_type     = franchise\n|company         = [[Lucasfilm]] \n|type            = Energy sword\n|genre           = [[Science fiction/Science fantasy]]\n|traits          = \n|affiliation     = [[Jedi]]<br />[[Sith]]<br />[[Knights of Ren]]\n}}\n{{Use American English|date = July 2019}}\n\nA '''lightsaber''' is a fictional energy sword featured in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.

Adding a few \"[[greeble]]s\" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. [[George Lucas]] decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where filming on ''Star Wars'' began.<ref>Star Wars Insider magazine issue No 98 January 2008</ref> It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]/[[Darth Vader]] duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.\n\n=== Visual effects ===\nKorean [[animator]] [[Nelson Shin]], who was working for [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a [[rotoscope]], an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look \"a little shaky\" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an [[optical printer]], making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a [[degaussing|degausser]] sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an [[X-Acto|X-Acto knife]] to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Interview with Nelson Shin| publisher = [[CNN]]|date = November 9, 2007 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/18/talkasia.nelsonshin/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===Sound===\nThe lightsaber [[sound effect]] was developed by sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] as a combination of the hum of idling [[Movie projector#Automation and the rise of the multiplex|interlock motors]] in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless [[microphone]].

Each lightsaber is unique, though some may bear resemblance to others, especially if there is a connection between the builders. The first film appearance of a dual-bladed lightsaber (first depicted in the comic series ''[[Tales of the Jedi]]'') was in ''The Phantom Menace'', wielded by [[Darth Maul]]. The video game ''[[The Force Unleashed]]'' introduced two other variants: a lightsaber pike (a lightsaber with a shorter blade but a long handle, resembling a spear) and a [[Tonfa]]-style lightsaber with right-angle hilt. [[Count Dooku]] wields a standard lightsaber with a curved hilt.\n\nThe [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] adds several lightsaber types, including short<ref name=\"KOTOR1\">{{cite video game|title=[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]] |developer=[[BioWare]] |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |date=November 19, 2003 |platform=PC }}</ref> and dual-phase (adjustable length) weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Anderson |first=Kevin J. |authorlink=Kevin J.

[[Kylo Ren]], introduced in ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', uses a lightsaber that features two [[crossguard|crosshilt]] blades, giving it the appearance of a [[greatsword]]. His blade also has an unstable, fiery appearance, explained in canon reference books as stemming from a cracked kyber crystal.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pinchefsky |first=Carol |title=Kylo Ren's janky lightsaber, explained |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/kylo-rens-janky-lightsaber-explained |website=SyFy Wire |accessdate=October 18, 2019 |date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> The Inquisitors of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] are depicted as wielding a unique variation of a double-bladed saber, mounted on a rotating ring enabling the blades 360 degrees of rotation. More obscure lightsaber variations, such as the \"lightwhip\", an elongated flexible blade used in a matter akin to a [[whip]], the \"lightclub\", an enlarged standard lightsaber, and the \"shoto\", a dramatically smaller variation often paired with a standard sized saber have also made appearances.\n\n===Colors===\nLightsabers depicted in the first two released films, ''A New Hope'' and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). [[Luke Skywalker]]'s new lightsaber in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters. However, it was changed to green in the film's final edit after initial viewings by the filmmakers, who felt that it would better stand out against the blue sky of [[Tatooine]] in outdoor scenes, and this color change is also reflected in the film's re-release posters. [[Mace Windu]]'s purple-bladed lightsaber, as first seen in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', was requested by the actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] for two reasons; purple is his favorite color and that the purple blade is one way to make his character stand out among other Jedi. Jackson is known to frequently request that the characters he plays use an item that is purple in color.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubyo5eZz_Jc|title=Samuel L.

The color of this crystal becomes the blade's color when installed into a lightsaber hilt. In the book ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'' and the comic series ''Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith'', it is shown that dark side users remove the crystal from a defeated Jedi's lightsaber and concentrate force energy on it to break its connection to the light side, a process known as \"bleeding\" to create a red crystal. The process can also be reversed, as shown in ''Ahsoka'' when the titular character does so to a pair of crystals taken from an Inquisitor; she uses them in a pair of white-bladed lightsabers.\n\nA multitude of blade colors have appeared in the Expanded Universe before the precursor films rendered many of the explanations for their coloring [[canon (fiction)|non-canonical]].\n\n{{anchor|Darksaber}} The Darksaber is a unique lightsaber that has a distinct black blade with a white halo, introduced in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) and subsequently appearing in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', where it is described as an ancient lightsaber created by the first [[Mandalorian]] to become a Jedi, and later serves as a symbol of Mandalorian authority. It subsequently appears briefly in the first season finale of ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darksaber|url=https://www.starwars.com/databank/darksaber|website=StarWars.com|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Darksaber?|url= https://www.starwars.com/news/what-is-the-darksaber|date=February 11, 2020|last=Knox|first=Kelly|accessdate=February 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://io9.gizmodo.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-darksaber-the-bl-1840779738 | title = Everything You Need to Know About the Darksaber, the Black Blade That Freed Mandalore | first = James | last= Whitbrook | date = January 3, 2020 | accessdate = January 3, 2020 | work = [[io9]] }}</ref>\n\n===Choreography===\nThe technical lightsaber choreography for the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy was developed by [[Hollywood]] sword-master [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]]. Anderson personally trained [[Mark Hamill]] (Luke Skywalker) and, in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', performed all the stunts as [[Darth Vader]] during the lightsaber duels wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the trilogy was highlighted in the film ''[[Reclaiming the Blade]]'' where he shared his experiences as a fencer developing the lightsaber techniques for the three original movies.\n\nThe lightsaber duels in the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy were specifically choreographed by stunt-coordinator [[Nick Gillard]] to be miniature \"stories\". For these films, Gillard was the primary sword instructor for [[Liam Neeson]] ([[Qui-Gon Jinn]]), [[Ewan McGregor]] (Obi-Wan Kenobi), [[Ray Park]] ([[Darth Maul]]) and [[Hayden Christensen]] (Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader) among other actors. His goal in choreographing the action for ''The Phantom Menace'' was to create stunts that flow from the story; \"You can't just think, 'I'm a [[stunt coordinator]], I'm going to make a big stunt happen',\" Gillard said. \"It's all about making it tie in nicely with the film so that you don't notice the stunts.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIn writing the prequel trilogy, George Lucas said he wanted the lightsaber combat to be \"reminiscent of what had been done in the previous films but also something that was more energized. We'd seen old men, young boys, and characters who were half-droid, but we'd never seen a Jedi in his prime. I wanted to do that with a fight that was faster and more dynamic \u2013 and we were able to pull that off.\"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Bouzereau| first = Laurent| last2 = Duncan| first2 = Jody| title = Star Wars: The Making of Episode I: The Phantom Menace| place=New York| publisher = Ballantine Publ.

Qui-Gon was brash, that rubbed off on Obi-Wan and Obi-Wan then taught Anakin, who was way too old to learn anyway... I think the style really worked well.

''Unleashed'' and ''Duels'', both developed by [[Krome Studios]], have more precise control of the lightsaber, allowing players to swing it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the [[Wii Remote]], while ''Kinect'' takes advantage of [[Kinect#Kinect for Xbox 360 (2010)|the eponymous, camera-based motion controller]] to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the lightsaber.\n\nPrior to the seventh generation, there were also a few earlier ''Star Wars'' games that used gesture-based control to simulate lightsaber combat, such as the two bonus levels of the [[arcade game]] ''[[Star Wars Trilogy Arcade|Star Wars Trilogy]]'', where the player controls Luke Skywalker as he wields his lightsaber against [[Boba Fett]] and Darth Vader in ''Return of the Jedi'' by pushing a joystick in one of eight directions to follow on-screen offensive and defensive cues,<ref name=\"SWTA overview at AllGame\">{{allgame | 15820 | first=Christopher Michael | last=Baker | accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> and a [[TV game]] released around the release of ''Revenge of the Sith'', titled ''Star Wars: Saga Edition - Lightsaber Battle Game'', in which the player swings a lightsaber-shaped controller to deflect blaster bolts from infantry (such as [[battle droids]] and [[clone troopers]]) and duel against characters from across the saga.\n\nBy the time [[Disney]] purchased Lucasfilm, new technological advances made [[augmented reality]] possible, leading to the creation of some more notable motion-controlled lightsaber video games that took advantage of that feature. One of them came in the form of a special activity mode in the official ''Star Wars'' fan app on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in which players use their smartphone's motion sensors to practice and master blaster deflection with a training droid (which appears on the phone's rear camera), similar to the deflection training exercises featured aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' in ''A New Hope'', while progressing through the ranks of the Jedi or Sith order. Another is in ''Star Wars: Jedi Challenges'', which works with a Lenovo Mirage AR headset, a tracking sensor and a dedicated lightsaber controller that launched in December 2017. One of the multiple game modes available in ''Challenges'', which was jointly developed by Disney and [[Lenovo]], enables players to confront ''Star Wars'' villains in lightsaber duels, such as Darth Maul and Kylo Ren.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/star-wars-jedi-challenges-augmented-reality-game-launches-with-lenovo-mirage-headset.html|title=Lenovo, Disney launch ''Star Wars'' Jedi aurgmented reality game that lets you use a real lightsaber|first=Arjun|last=Kharpal|date=August 31, 2017|publisher=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction|Film}}\n* [[List of Star Wars weapons|List of ''Star Wars'' weapons]]\n* [[Physics and Star Wars|Physics and ''Star Wars'']]\n* [[Photonic molecule]]\n* ''[[Star Wars: Evolution of the Lightsaber Duel]]''\n\n== References ==\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{notelist}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lightsabers}}\n*{{Star Wars Databank|subject=lightsaber|text = Lightsaber}}\n* {{Wookieepedia|Lightsaber}}\n* [http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/lightsaber1.htm \"Howstuffworks \u2013 Inside the Lightsaber\"]\n* [http://www.shortlist.com/news/scientists-could-create-real-lightsabers#art Scientists Could Create Real Lightsabers]\n\n{{Star Wars universe|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Star Wars weapons]]\n[[Category:Fictional swords]]\n[[Category:Jedi]]\n[[Category:Sith]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts]]\n[[Category:Fictional energy weapons]]\n", "name_user": "JeffreyLoeber", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDisney Parks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber"}

She attended dance classes from an early age, in the [[Cecchetti method]] of ballet. She later studied dance and acting at the [[North Carolina School of the Arts]] and went on to attend the [[University of Georgia]], where she would graduate summa cum laude with a degree in journalism.\n\n==Personal life==\nAutumn lives in Los Angeles. In her spare time, she is an avid photographer and [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia Bulldogs]] supporter. She also meditates daily. On October 19, 2014, she married her husband, actor [[Gideon Emery]] at [[Santa Barbara, California]]. In 2017, Withers and her husband revealed that they were expecting their first child together. On April 7, 2018, they welcomed their daughter, Mia Monroe Emery. [[File:Gideon Emery and Autumn Withers attend LA Opera 27 April 2017.jpg|thumb|Gideon Emery and Autumn Withers attend Tosca at LA Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles on 27 April 2017.]]\n\n==Career==\nAutumn's first professional acting credit came during her childhood. While still in the Carolinas, she landed a small role in the dance movie, [[Shag (film)|Shag]], starring [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Phoebe Cates]]. After university, Autumn moved to New York to pursue her dance career. She worked on several off-Broadway productions, before landing a role in Broadway show ''Yo Alice'', from creator [[Maurice Hines]]. After a few years, she decided to head to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. While there, the famed [[Radio City Rockettes]] were holding auditions for their company. On a whim, she auditioned, and ended up being cast. Given the choice between staying in New York or touring with the show, she opted for the latter, as it would offer a chance to fulfill not only her love for dance, but another passion: travel. For four years, Autumn danced with the Rockettes across the US, as well as Canada but then fate intervened. She was injured during a show, requiring arthroscopic hip surgery, effectively ending her professional dance career.\n\nReturning to Los Angeles to recover, Autumn would focus on her acting, specifically in comedy. She studied improv comedy at both [[iO West]] and at [[The Groundlings]]. One of her first film roles would be as a dancer in [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]. Other notable on-camera roles include Mrs Ebbert in [[Modern Family]], Jean in the [[Sundance film festival]] favorite ''Catherine'' alongside [[Jenny Slate]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laimyours.com/60428/catherine/|title=Catherine|accessdate=2 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072727/http://laimyours.com/60428/catherine/|archive-date=3 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and multiple roles in sketch comedy news parody series ''E&N with Ed Neusbit''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/edneusbit/playlists/431774|title=E&N with Ed Nesbit - Season 1 Playlist|accessdate=2 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103073128/http://www.funnyordie.com/edneusbit/playlists/431774|archive-date=3 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> More recently, Autumn starred in, and co-produced, the dark comedy feature, ''Avalanche'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofthenerd.com/2018/02/avalanche-trailer/ |title=Avalanche Trailer Teases Madness|accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref> alongside husband [[Gideon Emery]].\n\nAutumn is also a writer. Together with her writing partner, Ryann Ferguson, they have penned a number of television pilots, from comedy to drama, which center around strong female characters. They are currently actively pitching their shows to studios in Hollywood.\n\n==Other works==\nAutumn is also a country/folk singer-songwriter. In 2011, together with fellow composer and guitarist, Jeff Marshall, she released the album ''No Romeo'' under the name Autumn Lee. She followed that up with her second album, ''Angel Made of Steel'', as well as the single, ''Invisible''.\n\nAside from performing, Autumn has a passion for helping empower other women. In 2015 she founded the ''Hollywood Women's Collective'', a \"women's community dedicated to supporting women creatives and engendering a spirit of support, collaboration, and giving back.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodwomenscollective.com/about-us/ |title=Hollywood Womens Collective|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2017 US presidential election, Autumn lent her voice in support of her former fellow [[Radio City Rockettes]] dancers.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/12/23/rockettes-owners-say-attendance-at-inauguration-is-a-choice| publisher= Boston.com |title= Rockettes' owners say attendance at inauguration is a choice| agency= Associated Press| first= Mark| last= Kennedy| date= December 23, 2016 |accessdate= January 2, 2018}}</ref> At the time, Trump's derogatory comments about women in the leaked  [[Access Hollywood controversy|Access Hollywood tape]] were a hot topic and the Rockettes were said to be being pressured to perform at the inauguration event under threat of financial penalty or firing, despite several being upset at what would be a tantamount endorsement of Trump's treatment of women.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2016/12/27/former_rockette_troupe_should_not_perform |title=Former Rockette Troupe Should Not Perform |accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> Despite Trump's more recent questioning of the tape's veracity,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/us/politics/trump-access-hollywood-tape.html |title=Trump Once Said the 'Access Hollywood' Tape Was Real.

She attended dance classes from an early age, in the [[Cecchetti method]] of ballet. She later studied dance and acting at the [[North Carolina School of the Arts]] and went on to attend the [[University of Georgia]], where she would graduate summa cum laude with a degree in journalism.\n\n==Personal life==\nAutumn lives in Los Angeles. In her spare time, she is an avid photographer and [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia Bulldogs]] supporter. She also meditates daily. On October 19, 2014, she married her husband, actor [[Gideon Emery]] at [[Santa Barbara, California]]. In 2017, Withers and her husband revealed that they were expecting their first child together. On April 7, 2018, they welcomed their daughter, Mia Monroe Emery. [[File:Gideon Emery and Autumn Withers attend LA Opera 27 April 2017.jpg|thumb|Gideon Emery and Autumn Withers attend Tosca at LA Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles on 27 April 2017.]]\n\n==Career==\nAutumn's first professional acting credit came during her childhood. While still in the Carolinas, she landed a small role in the dance movie, [[Shag (film)|Shag]], starring [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Phoebe Cates]]. After university, Autumn moved to New York to pursue her dance career. She worked on several off-Broadway productions, before landing a role in Broadway show ''Yo Alice'', from creator [[Maurice Hines]]. After a few years, she decided to head to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. While there, the famed [[Radio City Rockettes]] were holding auditions for their company. On a whim, she auditioned, and ended up being cast. Given the choice between staying in New York or touring with the show, she opted for the latter, as it would offer a chance to fulfill not only her love for dance, but another passion: travel. For four years, Autumn danced with the Rockettes across the US, as well as Canada but then fate intervened. She was injured during a show, requiring arthroscopic hip surgery, effectively ending her professional dance career.\n\nReturning to Los Angeles to recover, Autumn would focus on her acting, specifically in comedy. She studied improv comedy at both [[iO West]] and at [[The Groundlings]]. One of her first film roles would be as a dancer in [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]. Other notable on-camera roles include Mrs Ebbert in [[Modern Family]], Jean in the [[Sundance film festival]] favorite ''Catherine'' alongside [[Jenny Slate]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laimyours.com/60428/catherine/|title=Catherine|accessdate=2 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072727/http://laimyours.com/60428/catherine/|archive-date=3 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and multiple roles in sketch comedy news parody series ''E&N with Ed Neusbit''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/edneusbit/playlists/431774|title=E&N with Ed Nesbit - Season 1 Playlist|accessdate=2 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103073128/http://www.funnyordie.com/edneusbit/playlists/431774|archive-date=3 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> More recently, Autumn starred in, and co-produced, the dark comedy feature, ''Avalanche'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofthenerd.com/2018/02/avalanche-trailer/ |title=Avalanche Trailer Teases Madness|accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref> alongside husband [[Gideon Emery]].\n\nAutumn is also a writer. Together with her writing partner, Ryann Ferguson, they have penned a number of television pilots, from comedy to drama, which center around strong female characters. They are currently actively pitching their shows to studios in Hollywood.\n\n==Other works==\nAutumn is also a country/folk singer-songwriter. In 2011, together with fellow composer and guitarist, Jeff Marshall, she released the album ''No Romeo'' under the name Autumn Lee. She followed that up with her second album, ''Angel Made of Steel'', as well as the single, ''Invisible''.\n\nAside from performing, Autumn has a passion for helping empower other women. In 2015 she founded the ''Hollywood Women's Collective'', a \"women's community dedicated to supporting women creatives and engendering a spirit of support, collaboration, and giving back.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodwomenscollective.com/about-us/ |title=Hollywood Womens Collective|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2017 US presidential election, Autumn lent her voice in support of her former fellow [[Radio City Rockettes]] dancers.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/12/23/rockettes-owners-say-attendance-at-inauguration-is-a-choice| publisher= Boston.com |title= Rockettes' owners say attendance at inauguration is a choice| agency= Associated Press| first= Mark| last= Kennedy| date= December 23, 2016 |accessdate= January 2, 2018}}</ref> At the time, Trump's derogatory comments about women in the leaked  [[Access Hollywood controversy|Access Hollywood tape]] were a hot topic and the Rockettes were said to be being pressured to perform at the inauguration event under threat of financial penalty or firing, despite several being upset at what would be a tantamount endorsement of Trump's treatment of women.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2016/12/27/former_rockette_troupe_should_not_perform |title=Former Rockette Troupe Should Not Perform |accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> Despite Trump's more recent questioning of the tape's veracity,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/us/politics/trump-access-hollywood-tape.html |title=Trump Once Said the 'Access Hollywood' Tape Was Real.
