After that event and its consecuences, Vigil was persuaded in acquiring his own printing. With the machines and the installations ready, he established \"Editorial Atl\u00e1ntida\", his own publishing house, headquartered in [[Buenos Aires]]. \n\nThe first magazine from the recently created publisher was ''El Gr\u00e1fico'', with its #1 being released on May 30, 1919.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180428143117/http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/preguntasfrecuentes.php Preguntas frecuentes], ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' (Archived, 28 Apr 2018)</ref> It was printed in [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format (57 x 39 cm) with a great amount of photographs.

Indeed, the magazine only contained photos and epigraphs which had originated its name (\"The Graphic\" in English) and at first the publication was not related to sports covering all sort of news and events. Alberto Palazzo (under the pseudonym ''Garabito'') was the first photographer of the magazine.\n\nAlthough not a sports magazine, the #5 was the first to include a [[association football|football]] chronicle on its cover, a match between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] national teams.

Before the beginning of the twentieth century both girls and women were not given the same amount of exposure in the media as men were. Their chances and abilities to play were hindered as they were overshadowed by the male-dominated world of media and sport. Fortunately, after major changes to women's uniforms were implemented by the 1920's, ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' played a key role in the creation of new images of women and sports <ref>{{Cite book|last=Elsey and Nadel|first=Brenda and Joshua|title=Futbolera: A History of Women and Sports in Latin America|publisher=University of Texas Press, Austin|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4773-1042-7|location=United States of America|pages=1}}</ref>.

Another way it aided in displaying these women was by identifying the women's club memberships. Although a small and simple act, this highlighted their participation in the sporting community on a larger scale.\n\nThis all helped to \"normalize the idea of sportswomen\", as ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' \"presented women as active subjects instead of passive objects and highlighted their physical prowess instead of ''only'' their beauty\", ultimately disrupting the visual culture of Argentina in the 1920's and 1930's.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Esley and Nadel|first=Brenda and Joshua|title=Futbolera: A History of Women and Sports in Latin America|publisher=University of Texas Press, Austin|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4773-1042-7|location=United States of America|pages=1}}</ref> Despite the fact that this amount of exposure still represented a minority compared to that of men at the time, it is still considered a breakthrough as this representation exceeded that of any similar publication in Argentina and beyond.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Zamora esp 1926.jpeg|[[Ricardo Zamora]]\nFile:Charro moreno 1940s.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno|Jos\u00e9 M.

Before the beginning of the twentieth century both girls and women were not given the same amount of exposure in the media as men were. Their chances and abilities to play were hindered as they were overshadowed by the male-dominated world of media and sport. Fortunately, after major changes to women's uniforms were implemented by the 1920's, ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' played a key role in the creation of new images of women and sports <ref>{{Cite book|last=Elsey and Nadel|first=Brenda and Joshua|title=Futbolera: A History of Women and Sports in Latin America|publisher=University of Texas Press, Austin|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4773-1042-7|location=United States of America|pages=1}}</ref>.

The magazine not only displayed the women in action playing on the fields, but it featured their accomplishments within the contents of the pages. Another way it aided in displaying these women was by identifying the women's club memberships. Although a small and simple act, this highlighted their participation in the sporting community on a larger scale.\n\nThis all helped to \"normalize the idea of sportswomen\", as ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' \"presented women as active subjects instead of passive objects and highlighted their physical prowess instead of ''only'' their beauty\", ultimately disrupting the visual culture of Argentina in the 1920's and 1930's<ref>{{Cite book|last=Esley and Nadel|first=Brenda and Joshua|title=Futbolera: A History of Women and Sports in Latin America|publisher=University of Texas Press, Austin|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4773-1042-7|location=United States of America|pages=1}}</ref>.

Three commanders of the squadron went on to be [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chiefs of the Air Staff]], two of the RAF and one of the Royal Pakistani Air Force.\n\n==First World War==\nThe squadron was formed in August 1918, by merging No. [[No. 442 Flight RAF|442]], [[No. 555 Flight RAF|555]], [[No. 556 Flight RAF|556]] and [[No. 470 Flight RAF|470]] Flights. It operated a mixture of aircraft, including [[seaplane]]s, [[Airco DH.9]] bombers, and [[Sopwith Camel]] fighters, and was responsible for the defence of the [[Thames Estuary]]. It was disbanded in early 1920, following the end of the war.\n\n==Second World War==\nIt reformed in October 1939, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], operating [[Bristol Blenheim]]s from [[RAF Catterick]]. Whilst it was intended to carry out shipping protection missions, it began to be used as a [[night fighter]] unit after becoming fully operational in February 1940; in October, it was moved to [[RAF Redhill]], near London, and converted to the [[Bristol Beaufighter]]. In December, it moved to [[RAF Tangmere]] in Sussex, continuing in its operational role.\n\nIt moved back to north England in mid 1942, to [[RAF Acklington]] and later [[RAF Scorton]]; in May 1943, the squadron was transferred to North Africa, where it was dispersed between various ports to provide night fighter defence. In September 1943 it operated a number of aircraft from Sicily, but moved back to the UK in January 1944 to join the newly forming [[Second Tactical Air Force]] in preparation for the [[invasion of Normandy]]. It re-equipped with [[de Havilland Mosquito]] night fighters, first Mk. 17 and later Mk. 30 models, and flew intruder missions over north-western Europe from [[RAF Woodvale]], [[RAF Honiley]], [[RAF Bradwell Bay]] and [[RAF Hunsdon]]. It moved to bases in France in October 1944, returning to the UK after the end of hostilities in August 1945, and was disbanded in September 1946.\n\n==Cold War==\nThe squadron reformed in March 1951 at [[RAF Kabrit]] in the [[Suez Canal Zone]], again as a night fighter squadron operating Mosquitoes. In October 1952 it received its first [[Gloster Meteor]] jet fighters, and was fully re-equipped with Meteors by April 1953. The squadron disbanded in September 1954, but was reformed again in September 1955 at [[RAF Driffield]], with [[de Havilland Venom]] NF.2. After two further years of operating in this role, it was disbanded for the fourth time in mid-1957.\n\n==Notable members==\nNotable members of the unit included:\n\n*[[Richard Atcherley]], later [[Chief of Air Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of the Air Staff]] of the [[Royal Pakistani Air Force]], who commanded the squadron on its formation in 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/AtcherleyR.htm |title=Air Marshal Sir Richard Atcherley |first=M.

{"title_page": "Effect of Brexit on Gibraltar", "text_new": "{{short description|Status of Gibraltar after withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union}}\n{{Brexit sidebar}}\nThe '''effect of Brexit on Gibraltar''' concerns the status of [[Gibraltar]] after [[Brexit|withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union]]. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 after having voted to leave in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] and formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw in March 2017. Gibraltar is not part of the UK, but contrary to all other [[British Overseas Territory]] was a part of the European Union like the UK. It participated in the Brexit referendum and it ceased, by default, to be a part of the EU upon the UK's withdrawal.\n\nGibraltar's position during the process of UK withdrawal from the European Union presents specific issues during the negotiations. Gibraltar voted strongly to remain in the European Union during the referendum, and its unique situation could lead to difficulties in [[Brexit negotiations]] due to the [[Spanish claim on Gibraltar]], the large contribution of on-line gambling, offshore banking and duty-free shopping to the [[Economy of Gibraltar|Gibraltar economy]], and the strong likelihood that Gibraltar will cease to be a part of the [[single market]].\n\n== History ==\n\nGibraltar was part of the [[European Union]], having joined through the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)]], which gave effect to the [[Treaty of Accession 1972]], as a dependent territory of the United Kingdom. It status in the European Union was under what was then article 227(4) of the [[Treaty Establishing the European Community]] covering [[Gibraltar and the European Union|special member state territories]], with exemption from some areas such as the [[European Union Customs Union]], [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and the [[Schengen Area]]. It was the only [[British Overseas Territory]] included in the European Union.\n\n=== Gibraltar's status in EU elections ===\n\nGibraltar did not participate in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 UK European Communities membership referendum]] even though the result had a direct impact on it. Neither did it participate in any European Parliamentary Elections between 1979 and 1999, but in 2002 legislation was passed by the [[British Parliament]] which allowed Gibraltar to formally take part in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Gibraltar|2004 European Parliament election]] as part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]] constituency in all subsequent European elections. Following the surprise election victory by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in May 2015 it was announced that Gibraltar would fully participate in the proposed referendum on continuing EU membership, and this was legislated for in the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]].  This meant that Gibraltar was the only [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the [[European Union]] (EU) and uniquely it has the right to vote in EU elections and in referenda.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/02/spain-drops-plan-to-impose-veto-if-scotland-tries-to-join-eu|title=Spain drops plan to impose veto if Scotland tries to join EU|first=Jennifer|last=Rankin|date=2 April 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===Pre referendum===\nIn 2015, Gibraltar would attempt to remain part of the EU in the event the UK voted to leave,<ref>{{cite web|title=Gibraltar suggests it wants to stay in EU in the event of Brexit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/gibraltar/11534580/Gibraltar-suggests-it-wants-to-stay-in-EU-in-the-event-of-Brexit.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 February 2016|last=Swinford|first=Steven|date=14 April 2015}}</ref> but reaffirmed that, regardless of the result, the territory would remain a British overseas territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gibraltarpanorama.gi/15209/191011/a/happy-birthday-your-majesty|title=Happy Birthday, Your Majesty|accessdate=27 April 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In a letter to the UK [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]], he requested that Gibraltar be considered in negotiations post-Brexit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.gi/2016/03/britain-must-include-gibraltar-in-post-brexit-negotiations-report-says|title=Britain must include Gibraltar in post-Brexit negotiations, report says|accessdate=27 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420084614/http://chronicle.gi/2016/03/britain-must-include-gibraltar-in-post-brexit-negotiations-report-says/|archive-date=20 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBefore the referendum, [[Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil|Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo]], the Spanish minister of foreign affairs at the time, stated that in the event of Brexit, Gibraltar would not have access to the single market unless a formula giving Spain co-sovereignty were agreed for a transitional period; after the referendum, he saw the result as increasing the chance of a Spanish flag on Gibraltar.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[Le Monde]]|url= http://www.lemonde.fr/referendum-sur-le-brexit/article/2017/04/03/brexit-l-espagne-inflige-deux-camouflets-a-londres_5104823_4872498.html| accessdate=8 April 2017|date=3 April 2017|title= Brexit: l\u2019Espagne inflige deux camouflets \u00e0 Londres\n|trans-title=Brexit: Spain hits London with double whammy|first1= Philippe |last1=Bernard|first2= Sandrine |last2=More|language=French |quote=''... peu avant le vote britannique, le ministre des affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res espagnol d\u2019alors, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garcia-Margallo, avait affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019' en cas de Brexit Gibraltar n\u2019aurait pas acc\u00e8s au march\u00e9 int\u00e9rieur, \u00e0 moins que [ne soit] accept[\u00e9] une formule qui suppose la cosouverainet\u00e9 de l\u2019Espagne durant une p\u00e9riode transitoire'.

The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 after having voted to leave in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] and formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw in March 2017. Gibraltar is not part of the UK, but contrary to all other [[British Overseas Territory]] was a part of the European Union like the UK. It participated in the Brexit referendum and it ceased, by default, to be a part of the EU upon the UK's withdrawal.\n\nGibraltar's position during the process of UK withdrawal from the European Union presents specific issues during the negotiations. Gibraltar voted strongly to remain in the European Union during the referendum, and its unique situation could lead to difficulties in [[Brexit negotiations]] due to the [[Spanish claim on Gibraltar]], the large contribution of on-line gambling, offshore banking and duty-free shopping to the [[Economy of Gibraltar|Gibraltar economy]], and the strong likelihood that Gibraltar will cease to be a part of the [[single market]].\n\n== History ==\n\nGibraltar was part of the [[European Union]], having joined through the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)]], which gave effect to the [[Treaty of Accession 1972]], as a dependent territory of the United Kingdom. It status in the European Union was under what was then article 227(4) of the [[Treaty Establishing the European Community]] covering [[Gibraltar and the European Union|special member state territories]], with exemption from some areas such as the [[European Union Customs Union]], [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and the [[Schengen Area]]. It was the only [[British Overseas Territory]] included in the European Union.\n\n=== Gibraltar's status in EU elections ===\n\nGibraltar did not participate in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 UK European Communities membership referendum]] even though the result had a direct impact on it. Neither did it participate in any European Parliamentary Elections between 1979 and 1999, but in 2002 legislation was passed by the [[British Parliament]] which allowed Gibraltar to formally take part in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Gibraltar|2004 European Parliament election]] as part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]] constituency in all subsequent European elections. Following the surprise election victory by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in May 2015 it was announced that Gibraltar would fully participate in the proposed referendum on continuing EU membership, and this was legislated for in the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]].  This meant that Gibraltar was the only [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the [[European Union]] (EU) and uniquely it has the right to vote in EU elections and in referenda.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/02/spain-drops-plan-to-impose-veto-if-scotland-tries-to-join-eu|title=Spain drops plan to impose veto if Scotland tries to join EU|first=Jennifer|last=Rankin|date=2 April 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===Pre referendum===\nIn 2015, Gibraltar would attempt to remain part of the EU in the event the UK voted to leave,<ref>{{cite web|title=Gibraltar suggests it wants to stay in EU in the event of Brexit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/gibraltar/11534580/Gibraltar-suggests-it-wants-to-stay-in-EU-in-the-event-of-Brexit.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 February 2016|last=Swinford|first=Steven|date=14 April 2015}}</ref> but reaffirmed that, regardless of the result, the territory would remain a British overseas territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gibraltarpanorama.gi/15209/191011/a/happy-birthday-your-majesty|title=Happy Birthday, Your Majesty|accessdate=27 April 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In a letter to the UK [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]], he requested that Gibraltar be considered in negotiations post-Brexit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.gi/2016/03/britain-must-include-gibraltar-in-post-brexit-negotiations-report-says|title=Britain must include Gibraltar in post-Brexit negotiations, report says|accessdate=27 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420084614/http://chronicle.gi/2016/03/britain-must-include-gibraltar-in-post-brexit-negotiations-report-says/|archive-date=20 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBefore the referendum, [[Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo y Marfil|Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo]], the Spanish minister of foreign affairs at the time, stated that in the event of Brexit, Gibraltar would not have access to the single market unless a formula giving Spain co-sovereignty were agreed for a transitional period; after the referendum, he saw the result as increasing the chance of a Spanish flag on Gibraltar.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[Le Monde]]|url= http://www.lemonde.fr/referendum-sur-le-brexit/article/2017/04/03/brexit-l-espagne-inflige-deux-camouflets-a-londres_5104823_4872498.html| accessdate=8 April 2017|date=3 April 2017|title= Brexit: l\u2019Espagne inflige deux camouflets \u00e0 Londres\n|trans-title=Brexit: Spain hits London with double whammy|first1= Philippe |last1=Bernard|first2= Sandrine |last2=More|language=French |quote=''... peu avant le vote britannique, le ministre des affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res espagnol d\u2019alors, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garcia-Margallo, avait affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019' en cas de Brexit Gibraltar n\u2019aurait pas acc\u00e8s au march\u00e9 int\u00e9rieur, \u00e0 moins que [ne soit] accept[\u00e9] une formule qui suppose la cosouverainet\u00e9 de l\u2019Espagne durant une p\u00e9riode transitoire'.

{"title_page": "Edward Small", "text_new": ":''For the Gambian politician, see [[Edward Francis Small]].''\n'''Edward Small''' (born '''Edward Schmalheiser''', February 1, 1891, [[Brooklyn, New York]] \u2013 January 25, 1977, [[Los Angeles, California]]) was a film producer from the late 1920s through 1970, who was enormously prolific over a 50-year career. He is best known for the movies ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (1934 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1934), ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' (1939), ''[[The Corsican Brothers (1941 film)|The Corsican Brothers]]'' (1941), ''[[Brewster's Millions (1945 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1945), ''[[Raw Deal (1948 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1948), ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]] (1949)'', ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957) and ''[[Solomon and Sheba]]'' (1959).\n\n==Early Life and Career==\nSmall was the son of Jewish Austrian-born Philip Schmalheiser and Prussian-born Rose Lewin, and had three sisters and two brothers.<ref>Mother of Small, Film Producer, Dies\n''Los Angeles Times'' 12 Feb 1940: 8.</ref> He began his career as a talent agent in New York City.

He formed the firm Asher, Small and Rogers, as a partner with Charles Rogers and E.M Asher.<ref>Nils Worked Days, Nights and Was Ill, ''Los Angeles Times'' 29 Apr 1928: C13.</ref><ref>Loew's Inaugurate Change. ''Los Angeles Times'' 5 Nov 1926: A11.</ref> The partnerships early films were all based on plays: ''[[The Sporting Lover]]'' (1926), ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'' (1926) (which led to a lawsuit with the author of ''[[Abie's Irish Rose]]''), ''[[The Gorilla (1927 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1927), ''[[McFadden's Flats]]'' (1927), and ''[[Ladies' Night in a Turkish Bath]]'' (1928).\n\nOf these ''Cohens and Kellys'' was particularly popular, leading to a number of sequels starting with ''[[The Cohens and the Kellys in Paris]]'' (1928). Small also produced ''[[My Man (1928 film)|My Man]]'' (1928) with [[Fanny Brice]], and ''[[Companionate Marriage]]'' (1929).\n\nExcept for ''The Gorilla'' all these early films were comedies. In 1926 Small said, \"Making a comedy requires far more care than is necessary for any other form of screen production because audiences are more exacting than in any other form of entertainment.\"<ref>American Audiences Revise Idea of Virtue and Comedy. ''Los Angeles Times'' 14 Nov 1926: C23</ref>\n\n\"Picture making is a youngster's game,\" he added the same year. \"When a man gets older he doesn't want to take a chance to try something new. And this business moves so fast that if you don't change your methods with every picture you're out of luck. In a few years I won't have a thing to do with the creative.

For his own company he made ''[[Clancy in Wall Street]]'' (1930) starring ''Cohens and Kellys'' star [[Charles Murray (American actor)|Charles Murray]].\n\nSmall sent an expedition to the Arctic and they made the documentary ''[[Igloo (film)|Igloo]]'' (1932).\n\n==Reliance Pictures and United Artists==\nIn 1932, Small formed [[Reliance Pictures]] together with partner Harry M. Goetz. The new company was to be made with finance from Art Cinema, a subsidiary company of [[United Artists]], in a deal brokered by [[Joseph Schenck]]. On the basis of this verbal commitment, Small and Goetz started pre production on three films. However, when Schenck presented the deal to Art Cinema's board, it was turned down. An embarrassed Schenck decided personally put up half the cost of the three films, with the other half met by Small and Goetz.\n\nThe films were ''[[I Cover the Waterfront]]'' (1933), a crime drama based on a book with [[Claudette Colbert]]; ''[[Palooka (film)|Palooka]]'' (1934), a comedy based on the comic ''[[Joe Palooka]]'' with [[Jimmy Durante]]; and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (1934 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1934), a swashbuckler based on [[The Count of Monte Cristo|the Dumas novel]] starring [[Robert Donat]] and the first screen credit for [[Philip Dunne (writer)|Philip Dunne]]. Of the three ''Monte Cristo'' was an especially big hit and Small would go on to produce a number of swashbucklers.<ref>Balio 2009, p. 117</ref>\n\nWilliam Phipps then stepped in to provide financing in Schenck's place and Reliance made five more movies for United Artists over two years: ''[[Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1934), a musical comedy; ''[[Let 'Em Have It]]'' (1935); a gangster movie; ''[[Red Salute (1935 film)|Red Salute]]'' (1935), a screwball comedy with an anti-Communist slant starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and Robert Young; ''[[The Melody Lingers On]]'' (1935), a melodrama; and ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1936), based on [[The Last of the Mohicans|the classic novel]], starring [[Randolph Scott]] and co-written by Dunne. The latter was a big hit.\n\nIn 1935, Small announced plans to make a series of 4,000 feet films (i.e. short features) based on short stories and novelettes as an alternative to the double bill<ref name=\"doug\">Douglas W. Churchill.  Hollywood. ''New York Times'' 24 Nov 1935: X5.</ref> but this did not seem to come to fruition.\n\n===RKO===\nAfter making ''The Last of the Mohicans'', Small left United Artists and established himself as an associate producer at [[RKO]] in January 1936;<ref name=\"Times19360127\">Robert Donat, Jack Oakie and Other Stars to Glisten on R.-K.-O.

Small:\n<blockquote>I intend to produce a different type of historical productions. There will be less of the awesomeness and less of the blind respect that has often marked the modern's approach to a historical character. ''[[Diamond Jim]]'' and ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' are only the beginning. ''Napoleon'', ''[[Marie Antoinette]]'', and ''Mary of Scotland'', contemplated, will be great steps in the direction of honesty. We have on our schedules the filming of the stories of [[Beau Brummell]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]] and we are contemplating a minimum of punch-pulling. Newsreels are telling the truth about people, showing them as they are. Feature pictures are going to do the same thing; they will make men and women out of celebrities.<ref>Switching Around of Movie Executives Goes On and On: Transfer Companies Do Booming Business as Film Bosses Move From One Lot to Another, With All Assistants. Scott, John. ''Los Angeles Times'' 2 Feb 1936: C1</ref></blockquote>\nSmall's time at RKO resulted in six pictures: ''[[The Bride Walks Out]]'' (1936), a romantic comedy with Stanwyck and Young from ''Red Channels''; ''[[We Who Are About to Die]]'' (1937), based on a true story about a man unjustly sent to prison; ''[[Sea Devils (1937 film)|Sea Devils]]'' (1937), a military drama with [[Victor McLaglen]]; ''[[New Faces of 1937]]'' (1937), a musical revue designed to introduce new talent such as [[Milton Berle]]; ''[[Super-Sleuth]]'' (1937) with [[Jack Oakie]]; and ''[[The Toast of New York]]'' (1937), a biopic of [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] starring [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]], [[Cary Grant]] and [[Frances Farmer]].\n\nSome of these performed well, notably ''Te Bride Walks Out'' but others were less successful, particularly ''New Faces of 1937'' and the expensive ''[[The Toast of New York]]'', which was RKO's biggest money losing picture of 1937.<ref name=\"rko\">Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', ''Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television'', Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p57</ref>\n\nHowever Small did sell the studio his rights to ''Gunga Din'' which he had purchased from the [[Rudyard Kipling]] estate in 1936 and became a big hit later on. (He made ''Son of Cristo'' later at United Artists and never produced a Beau Brummel film.) Small departed from RKO in 1938.<ref>Richard B.

Small returned to swashbucklers with another adaptation of a Dumas novel, ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' (1939), starring Hayward; this was one of Small's most popular films.\n\nSmall bought the [[Howard Spring]] novel ''[[My Son, My Son! (film)|My Son, My Son!]]'' to turn into a film with Hayward. He also put Heyward into another swashbuckler, ''[[The Son of Monte Cristo]]'' (1940), a sequel to his 1934 hit, co-starring [[Joan Bennett]].\n\nSmall borrowed [[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]] to star in two films: ''[[South of Pago Pago]]'' (1940), a South Sea island movie, with Victor McLaglen and [[Frances Farmer]], and ''[[Kit Carson (1940 film)|Kit Carson]]'' (1940), a Western.\n\nIn 1940, Small stopped making movies for six months as he renegotiated his deal with United Artists. He spoke out against rising costs and the impact of the [[double bill]] on filmmakers.<ref>Louella O.

The majority were Westerns and crime melodramas (in contrast with his Columbia Films, which were mostly swashbucklers); towards the end of the 1950s he also increasingly made films aimed at the teenage market.

He is best known for the movies ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (1934 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1934), ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' (1939), ''[[The Corsican Brothers (1941 film)|The Corsican Brothers]]'' (1941), ''[[Brewster's Millions (1945 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1945), ''[[Raw Deal (1948 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1948), ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]] (1949)'', ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957) and ''[[Solomon and Sheba]]'' (1959).\n\n==Early Life and Career==\nSmall was the son of Jewish Austrian-born Philip Schmalheiser and Prussian-born Rose Lewin, and had three sisters and two brothers.<ref>Mother of Small, Film Producer, Dies\n''Los Angeles Times'' 12 Feb 1940: 8.</ref> He began his career as a talent agent in New York City.

''Los Angeles Times'' 5 Nov 1926: A11.</ref> The partnerships early films were all based on plays: ''[[The Sporting Lover]]'' (1926), ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'' (1926) (which led to a lawsuit with the author of ''[[Abie's Irish Rose]]''), ''[[The Gorilla (1927 film)|The Gorilla]]'' (1927), ''[[McFadden's Flats]]'' (1927), and ''[[Ladies' Night in a Turkish Bath]]'' (1928).\n\nOf these ''Cohens and Kellys'' was particularly popular, leading to a number of sequels starting with ''[[The Cohens and the Kellys in Paris]]'' (1928). Small also produced ''[[My Man (1928 film)|My Man]]'' (1928) with [[Fanny Brice]], and ''[[Companionate Marriage]]'' (1929).\n\nExcept for ''The Gorilla'' all these early films were comedies. In 1926 Small said, \"Making a comedy requires far more care than is necessary for any other form of screen production because audiences are more exacting than in any other form of entertainment.\"<ref>American Audiences Revise Idea of Virtue and Comedy. ''Los Angeles Times'' 14 Nov 1926: C23</ref>\n\n\"Picture making is a youngster's game,\" he added the same year. \"When a man gets older he doesn't want to take a chance to try something new.

For his own company he made ''[[Clancy in Wall Street]]'' (1930) starring ''Cohens and Kellys'' star [[Charles Murray (American actor)|Charles Murray]].\n\nSmall sent an expedition to the Arctic and they made the documentary ''[[Igloo (film)|Igloo]]'' (1932).\n\n==Reliance Pictures and United Artists==\nIn 1932, Small formed [[Reliance Pictures]] together with partner Harry M. Goetz. The new company was to be made with finance from Art Cinema, a subsidiary company of [[United Artists]], in a deal brokered by [[Joseph Schenck]]. On the basis of this verbal commitment, Small and Goetz started pre production on three films. However, when Schenck presented the deal to Art Cinema's board, it was turned down. An embarrassed Schenck decided personally put up half the cost of the three films, with the other half met by Small and Goetz.\n\nThe films were ''[[I Cover the Waterfront]]'' (1933), a crime drama based on a book with [[Claudette Colbert]]; ''[[Palooka (film)|Palooka]]'' (1934), a comedy based on the comic ''[[Joe Palooka]]'' with [[Jimmy Durante]]; and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (1934 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1934), a swashbuckler based on [[The Count of Monte Cristo|the Dumas novel]] starring [[Robert Donat]] and the first screen credit for [[Philip Dunne (writer)|Philip Dunne]]. Of the three ''Monte Cristo'' was an especially big hit and Small would go on to produce a number of swashbucklers.<ref>Balio 2009, p. 117</ref>\n\nWilliam Phipps then stepped in to provide financing in Schenck's place and Reliance made five more movies for United Artists over two years: ''[[Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1934), a musical comedy; ''[[Let 'Em Have It]]'' (1935); a gangster movie; ''[[Red Salute (1935 film)|Red Salute]]'' (1935), a screwball comedy with an anti-Communist slant starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and Robert Young; ''[[The Melody Lingers On]]'' (1935), a melodrama; and ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1936), based on [[The Last of the Mohicans|the classic novel]], starring [[Randolph Scott]] and co-written by Dunne. The latter was a big hit.\n\nIn 1935, Small announced plans to make a series of 4,000 feet films (i.e. short features) based on short stories and novelettes as an alternative to the double bill<ref name=\"doug\">Douglas W. Churchill.  Hollywood. ''New York Times'' 24 Nov 1935: X5.</ref> but this did not seem to come to fruition.\n\n===RKO===\nAfter making ''The Last of the Mohicans'', Small left United Artists and established himself as an associate producer at [[RKO]] in January 1936;<ref name=\"Times19360127\">Robert Donat, Jack Oakie and Other Stars to Glisten on R.-K.-O.

Small:\n<blockquote>I intend to produce a different type of historical productions. There will be less of the awesomeness and less of the blind respect that has often marked the modern's approach to a historical character. ''[[Diamond Jim]]'' and ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]'' are only the beginning. ''Napoleon'', ''[[Marie Antoinette]]'', and ''Mary of Scotland'', contemplated, will be great steps in the direction of honesty. We have on our schedules the filming of the stories of [[Beau Brummell]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]] and we are contemplating a minimum of punch-pulling. Newsreels are telling the truth about people, showing them as they are. Feature pictures are going to do the same thing; they will make men and women out of celebrities.<ref>Switching Around of Movie Executives Goes On and On: Transfer Companies Do Booming Business as Film Bosses Move From One Lot to Another, With All Assistants.

''Los Angeles Times'' 2 Feb 1936: C1</ref></blockquote>\nSmall's time at RKO resulted in six pictures: ''[[The Bride Walks Out]]'' (1936), a romantic comedy with Stanwyck and Young from ''Red Channels''; ''[[We Who Are About to Die]]'' (1937), based on a true story about a man unjustly sent to prison; ''[[Sea Devils (1937 film)|Sea Devils]]'' (1937), a military drama with [[Victor McLaglen]]; ''[[New Faces of 1937]]'' (1937), a musical revue designed to introduce new talent such as [[Milton Berle]]; ''[[Super-Sleuth]]'' (1937) with [[Jack Oakie]]; and ''[[The Toast of New York]]'' (1937), a biopic of [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] starring [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]], [[Cary Grant]] and [[Frances Farmer]].\n\nSome of these performed well, notably ''Te Bride Walks Out'' but others were less successful, particularly ''New Faces of 1937'' and the expensive ''[[The Toast of New York]]'', which was RKO's biggest money losing picture of 1937.<ref name=\"rko\">Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', ''Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television'', Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p57</ref>\n\nHowever Small did sell the studio his rights to ''Gunga Din'' which he had purchased from the [[Rudyard Kipling]] estate in 1936 and became a big hit later on. (He made ''Son of Cristo'' later at United Artists and never produced a Beau Brummel film.) Small departed from RKO in 1938.<ref>Richard B.

Small returned to swashbucklers with another adaptation of a Dumas novel, ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' (1939), starring Hayward; this was one of Small's most popular films.\n\nSmall bought the [[Howard Spring]] novel ''[[My Son, My Son! (film)|My Son, My Son!]]'' to turn into a film with Hayward. He also put Heyward into another swashbuckler, ''[[The Son of Monte Cristo]]'' (1940), a sequel to his 1934 hit, co-starring [[Joan Bennett]].\n\nSmall borrowed [[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]] to star in two films: ''[[South of Pago Pago]]'' (1940), a South Sea island movie, with Victor McLaglen and [[Frances Farmer]], and ''[[Kit Carson (1940 film)|Kit Carson]]'' (1940), a Western.\n\nIn 1940, Small stopped making movies for six months as he renegotiated his deal with United Artists.

Starring [[Anthony Dexter]], it was a box-office flop.\n\nHis other Columbia films included ''[[Lorna Doone (1951 film)|Lorna Doone]]'' (1951), another swashbuckler based on a classic novel, directed by [[Phil Karlson]] and starring Richard Greene. He made some Westerns with George Montgomery, ''[[The Texas Rangers (1951 film)|The Texas Rangers]]'' (1951), ''[[Indian Uprising (film)|Indian Uprising]]'' (1951) and ''[[Cripple Creek (film)|Cripple Creek]]'' (1952).\n\nSmall also produced two films directed by Karlson: ''[[Scandal Sheet (1952 film)|Scandal Sheet]]'' (1952) from a novel by [[Sam Fuller]]; and ''[[The Brigand (film)|The Brigand]]'' (1952), a swashbuckler starring ''Valentino''s Anthony Dexter.\n\n===Return to United Artists===\nIn 1951, Small helped fund [[Arthur Krim]] and [[Bob Benjamin]] acquire 50% of UA.

They were usually shot within seven to nine days and went for around seventy minutes, starring lesser ranked names who were paid around $25,000. The majority were Westerns and crime melodramas (in contrast with his Columbia Films, which were mostly swashbucklers); towards the end of the 1950s he also increasingly made films aimed at the teenage market.

He was known by the nickname '''Colonel House''', although he had performed no military service.  He was a highly influential back-stage politician in Texas before becoming a key supporter of the presidential bid of Wilson in 1912.  Having a self-effacing manner, he did not hold office but was an \"executive agent\", Wilson's chief advisor on European politics and diplomacy during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318) and at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. In 1919 Wilson, suffering from a series of small strokes, broke with House and many other top advisors, believing they had deceived him at Paris.\n\n==Early years==\n\nHe was born July 26, 1858 in [[Houston, Texas]], the last of seven children<!-- He was the son of Houston mayor [[Thomas William House Sr.]], a gunrunner during the [[US Civil War]] who amassed a fortune.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} --> of Mary Elizabeth (Shearn) and [[Thomas William House Sr.]] His father an emigrant from England by way of New Orleans, who became a prominent Houston businessman, with a large role in developing the city and served a term as its mayor.  An ardent Confederate, he had also sent blockade runners against the [[Union blockade]] in the Gulf of Mexico during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=TSHA/><ref>{{cite web\n  |<!-- authorlink=Julia Beazley --> |first=Julia |last=Beazley |title=HOUSE, THOMAS WILLIAM\n  |work=Handbook of Texas Online  |date=June 15, 2010 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association\n  |accessdate=2014-07-12 |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho68}}</ref>\n\nHouse attended Houston Academy<!-- probably not the one founded 1970 in Alabama -->, a school in [[Bath, England]], a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] in [[Virginia]], and [[Hopkins Grammar School]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]].<ref name=TSHA/>\nHe went on to study at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], in 1877 where he was a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity.

He eventually sold the [[cotton]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s, and invested in [[banking]]. He was a founder of the [[Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway]].  House moved to New York City about 1902.\n\nIn 1912, House published anonymously a novel called ''[[Philip Dru: Administrator]]'', in which the title character leads the democratic western U.S. in a civil war against the [[plutocratic]] East, becoming the dictator of America. Dru as dictator imposes a series of reforms which resemble the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Bull Moose platform of 1912]] and then vanishes.<ref>Lasch, pp. 230\u201335.</ref>\n\nHouse helped to make four men [[governor of Texas]]: [[Jim Hogg|James S. Hogg]] (1892), [[Charles Allen Culberson|Charles A. Culberson]] (1894), [[Joseph D. Sayers]] (1898), and [[S. W. T. Lanham]] (1902). After their elections, House acted as unofficial advisor to each.  In 1893, Hogg appointed House to his military staff with the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], a position which came with a title but no actual military responsibilities.<ref name=Volume_1>{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Rupert Norval |date=1964 |title=Colonel Edward M.

He became an intimate of Wilson and helped set up his administration.\n\nHouse was offered the cabinet position of his choice (except for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], which was already pledged to [[William Jennings Bryan]]) but declined, choosing instead \"to serve wherever and whenever possible.\" House was even provided living quarters within the White House.\n\nHe continued as an advisor to Wilson particularly in the area of foreign affairs. House functioned as Wilson's chief negotiator in Europe during the negotiations for peace (1917\u20131919) and as chief deputy for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\nIn the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 presidential election]], House declined any public role but was Wilson's top campaign advisor: \"he planned its structure; set its tone; guided its finance; chose speakers, tactics, and strategy; and, not least, handled the campaign's greatest asset and greatest potential liability: its brilliant but temperamental candidate.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Godfrey Hodgson|title=Woodrow Wilson's right hand: the life of Colonel Edward M.

However, Wilson's second wife, [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson|Edith]], of whom he had commissioned the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo M\u00fcller-Ury]] (1862\u20131947) to paint a portrait in 1916, disliked House, and his position weakened. It is believed that her personal animosity was significantly responsible for Wilson's eventual decision to break with House.\n\n[[File:ColonelHouse.PNG|thumb|right|225px|Col.

He spent much of 1915 and 1916 in Europe, trying to negotiate peace through diplomacy. He was enthusiastic but lacked deep insight into European affairs and relied on the information received from British diplomats, especially the British foreign secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], to shape his outlook.  Nicholas Ferns argues that  Grey's ideas meshed with House's. Grey's diplomatic goal was to establish close Anglo-American relations; he deliberately built  a close connection to further that aim. Thereby Grey re-enforced House's pro-Allied proclivities so that Wilson's chief advisor promoted the British position.<ref>Nicolas Ferns, \"Loyal Advisor? Colonel Edward House's Confidential Trips to Europe, 1913\u20131917.\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' 24.3 (2013): 365-382.</ref>\n\nAfter a German U-boat sank without warning the British passenger liner {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} on 7 May 1915, with  128  Americans among the 1198 dead, many Americans called for war. The ship was carrying war munitions, although this was not publicly revealed at the time.<ref>http://www.centenarynews.com/article?id=1616</ref>{{vc|date=April 2018}} Wilson demanded that Germany respect American neutral rights, and especially not sink merchant ships or passenger liners without giving the passengers and crew the opportunity to get into lifeboats, as required by international law.  Tension escalated with Germany, until Germany agreed to Wilson's terms. House felt that the war was an epic battle between democracy and autocracy; he argued the United States ought to help Britain and France win a limited Allied victory. However, Wilson still insisted on neutrality.\n\nHouse played a major role in shaping wartime diplomacy. He supported [[Thomas Garrigue Masaryk]] Czechoslovak legions especially in Russia as well.<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

In September 1918, Wilson gave House the responsibility for preparing a constitution for a [[League of Nations]]. In October 1918, when Germany petitioned for peace based on the [[Fourteen Points]], Wilson charged House with working out details of an [[armistice]] with the Allies.\n\n[[File:Edward Mandell House cph.3b17553.jpg|thumb|left|237px|Edward M. House in 1920]]\n\n==Paris conference==\n\nHouse helped Wilson outline his [[Fourteen Points]] and worked with the president on the drafting of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. House served on the [[League of Nations Mandate|League of Nations Commission on Mandates]] with [[Lord Milner]] and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] of Great Britain, Henri Simon<ref>[[Margaret MacMillan|MacMillan, Margaret]]. ''Paris 1919''. New York, Random House, 2002</ref> of France, [[Chinda Sutemi|Viscount Chinda]] of Japan, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] of Italy, and [[George Louis Beer]] as adviser. On May 30, 1919 House participated in a meeting in Paris which laid the groundwork for establishment of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR). Throughout 1919, House urged Wilson to work with Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] to achieve ratification of the [[Versailles Treaty]], but Wilson refused to deal with Lodge or any other senior [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].\n   \nThe conference revealed serious policy disagreements and personality conflicts between Wilson and House. Wilson became less tolerant and broke with his closest advisors, one after another. Later, he dismissed House's son-in-law, Gordon Auchincloss, from the American peace commission when it became known the young man was making derogatory comments about him.<ref name=Berg>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A.

The following month, Wilson returned to Paris. He decided that House had taken too many liberties in negotiations,  and relegated him to the sidelines. After they returned to the US later that year, the two men never saw or spoke to each other again.<ref name=Berg/><!--page=601}}-->\n\nIn the 1920s, House strongly supported membership of both the [[League of Nations]] and the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].\n\nIn 1932, House supported [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for the presidency without joining his inner circle. Although he became disillusioned with the course of the [[New Deal]] after Roosevelt's election, he expressed his reservations only privately.  House was a confidant of [[William E. Dodd]], Roosevelt's first Ambassador to [[Nazi Germany]], acting at times as Dodd's intermediary with the White House and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].<ref>[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]] (2011) ''[[In the Garden of Beasts]]'' New York: Broadway Paperbacks. pp. 38, 136, 152, 217, 245 {{isbn|978-0-307-40885-3}}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nHouse died on March 28, 1938 in [[Manhattan, New York City]], following a bout of [[pleurisy]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Colonel House Dies Here At Age Of 79.

He was known by the nickname '''Colonel House''', although he had performed no military service.  He was a highly influential back-stage politician in Texas before becoming a key supporter of the presidential bid of Wilson in 1912.  Having a self-effacing manner, he did not hold office but was an \"executive agent\", Wilson's chief advisor on European politics and diplomacy during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318) and at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. In 1919 Wilson, suffering from a series of small strokes, broke with House and many other top advisors, believing they had deceived him at Paris.\n\n==Early years==\n\nHe was born July 26, 1858 in [[Houston, Texas]], the last of seven children<!-- He was the son of Houston mayor [[Thomas William House Sr.]], a gunrunner during the [[US Civil War]] who amassed a fortune.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} --> of Mary Elizabeth (Shearn) and [[Thomas William House Sr.]] His father an emigrant from England by way of New Orleans, who became a prominent Houston businessman, with a large role in developing the city and served a term as its mayor.

Hogg]] (1892), [[Charles Allen Culberson|Charles A. Culberson]] (1894), [[Joseph D. Sayers]] (1898), and [[S. W. T. Lanham]] (1902). After their elections, House acted as unofficial advisor to each.  In 1893, Hogg appointed House to his military staff with the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], a position which came with a title but no actual military responsibilities.<ref name=Volume_1>{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Rupert Norval |date=1964 |title=Colonel Edward M.

He became an intimate of Wilson and helped set up his administration.\n\nHouse was offered the cabinet position of his choice (except for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], which was already pledged to [[William Jennings Bryan]]) but declined, choosing instead \"to serve wherever and whenever possible.\" House was even provided living quarters within the White House.\n\nHe continued as an advisor to Wilson particularly in the area of foreign affairs. House functioned as Wilson's chief negotiator in Europe during the negotiations for peace (1917\u20131919) and as chief deputy for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\nIn the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 presidential election]], House declined any public role but was Wilson's top campaign advisor: \"he planned its structure; set its tone; guided its finance; chose speakers, tactics, and strategy; and, not least, handled the campaign's greatest asset and greatest potential liability: its brilliant but temperamental candidate.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Godfrey Hodgson|title=Woodrow Wilson's right hand: the life of Colonel Edward M.

However, Wilson's second wife, [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson|Edith]], of whom he had commissioned the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo M\u00fcller-Ury]] (1862\u20131947) to paint a portrait in 1916, disliked House, and his position weakened. It is believed that her personal animosity was significantly responsible for Wilson's eventual decision to break with House.\n\n[[File:ColonelHouse.PNG|thumb|right|225px|Col.

He spent much of 1915 and 1916 in Europe, trying to negotiate peace through diplomacy. He was enthusiastic but lacked deep insight into European affairs and relied on the information received from British diplomats, especially the British foreign secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], to shape his outlook.  Nicholas Ferns argues that  Grey's ideas meshed with House's. Grey's diplomatic goal was to establish close Anglo-American relations; he deliberately built  a close connection to further that aim. Thereby Grey re-enforced House's pro-Allied proclivities so that Wilson's chief advisor promoted the British position.<ref>Nicolas Ferns, \"Loyal Advisor? Colonel Edward House's Confidential Trips to Europe, 1913\u20131917.\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' 24.3 (2013): 365-382.</ref>\n\nAfter a German U-boat sank without warning the British passenger liner {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} on 7 May 1915, with  128  Americans among the 1198 dead, many Americans called for war. The ship was carrying war munitions, although this was not publicly revealed at the time.<ref>http://www.centenarynews.com/article?id=1616</ref>{{vc|date=April 2018}} Wilson demanded that Germany respect American neutral rights, and especially not sink merchant ships or passenger liners without giving the passengers and crew the opportunity to get into lifeboats, as required by international law.  Tension escalated with Germany, until Germany agreed to Wilson's terms. House felt that the war was an epic battle between democracy and autocracy; he argued the United States ought to help Britain and France win a limited Allied victory. However, Wilson still insisted on neutrality.\n\nHouse played a major role in shaping wartime diplomacy. He supported [[Thomas Garrigue Masaryk]] Czechoslovak legions especially in Russia as well<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

Wilson had House assemble \"[[The Inquiry]]\", a team of academic experts to devise efficient postwar solutions to all the world's problems. In September 1918, Wilson gave House the responsibility for preparing a constitution for a [[League of Nations]]. In October 1918, when Germany petitioned for peace based on the [[Fourteen Points]], Wilson charged House with working out details of an [[armistice]] with the Allies.\n\n[[File:Edward Mandell House cph.3b17553.jpg|thumb|left|237px|Edward M. House in 1920]]\n\n==Paris conference==\n\nHouse helped Wilson outline his [[Fourteen Points]] and worked with the president on the drafting of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. House served on the [[League of Nations Mandate|League of Nations Commission on Mandates]] with [[Lord Milner]] and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] of Great Britain, Henri Simon<ref>[[Margaret MacMillan|MacMillan, Margaret]]. ''Paris 1919''. New York, Random House, 2002</ref> of France, [[Chinda Sutemi|Viscount Chinda]] of Japan, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] of Italy, and [[George Louis Beer]] as adviser. On May 30, 1919 House participated in a meeting in Paris which laid the groundwork for establishment of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR). Throughout 1919, House urged Wilson to work with Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] to achieve ratification of the [[Versailles Treaty]], but Wilson refused to deal with Lodge or any other senior [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].\n   \nThe conference revealed serious policy disagreements and personality conflicts between Wilson and House. Wilson became less tolerant and broke with his closest advisors, one after another. Later, he dismissed House's son-in-law, Gordon Auchincloss, from the American peace commission when it became known the young man was making derogatory comments about him.<ref name=Berg>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A.

The following month, Wilson returned to Paris. He decided that House had taken too many liberties in negotiations,  and relegated him to the sidelines. After they returned to the US later that year, the two men never saw or spoke to each other again.<ref name=Berg/><!--page=601}}-->\n\nIn the 1920s, House strongly supported membership of both the [[League of Nations]] and the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].\n\nIn 1932, House supported [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for the presidency without joining his inner circle. Although he became disillusioned with the course of the [[New Deal]] after Roosevelt's election, he expressed his reservations only privately.  House was a confidant of [[William E. Dodd]], Roosevelt's first Ambassador to [[Nazi Germany]], acting at times as Dodd's intermediary with the White House and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].<ref>[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]] (2011) ''[[In the Garden of Beasts]]'' New York: Broadway Paperbacks. pp. 38, 136, 152, 217, 245 {{isbn|978-0-307-40885-3}}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nHouse died on March 28, 1938 in [[Manhattan, New York City]], following a bout of [[pleurisy]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Colonel House Dies Here At Age Of 79.

Many follow its routes as a form of spiritual path or retreat for their spiritual growth. It is also popular with hiking and cycling enthusiasts and organized tour groups.\n\nThe French Way (Camino Franc\u00e9s) and the Routes of Northern Spain are the courses listed in the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/669 |title=Routes of Santiago de Compostela: ''Camino Franc\u00e9s'' and Routes of Northern Spain |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref><ref name=\"Starkie\">{{Cite book |last=Starkie |first=Walter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9xJGrnvuNW4C |title=The Roads to Santiago: Pilgrims of St. James |publisher=University of California Press |year=1965 |author-link=Walter Starkie |orig-year=1957}}</ref>\n\n== Major Christian pilgrimage route ==\n[[File:Spain Santiago de Compostela - Cathedral.jpg|thumb| [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]]]\nThe Way of St. James was one of the most important [[Christian pilgrimage]]s during the later [[Middle Ages]], and a pilgrimage route on which a plenary [[indulgence]] could be earned;<ref>{{CathEncy|title =Indulgences|first= William H.|last= Kent|wstitle=Indulgences}} This entry on indulgences suggests that the evolution of the doctrine came to include pilgrimage to shrines as a trend that developed from the 8th century A.D.: \"Among other forms of commutation were pilgrimages to well-known shrines such as that at [[St. Albans]] in [[England]] or at Compostela in Spain. But the most important place of pilgrimage was Rome. According to [[Bede]] (674\u2013735) the ''visitatio liminum'', or visit to the tomb of the Apostles, was even then regarded as a good work of great efficacy (Hist. Eccl., IV, 23). At first the pilgrims came simply to venerate the relics of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]], but in course of time their chief purpose was to gain the indulgences granted by the pope and attached especially to the [[Stations of the Cross|Stations]].\"</ref> other major pilgrimage routes include the [[Via Francigena]] to [[Rome]] and the pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]].\n\nLegend holds that [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]'s remains were carried by boat from Jerusalem to northern Spain, where he was buried in what is now the city of [[Santiago de Compostela]].  (The name ''Santiago'' is the local Galician evolution of [[Vulgar Latin]] ''Sancti Iacobi'', \"Saint James\".)\n\nThe Way can take one of dozens of pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela. Traditionally, as with most pilgrimages, the Way of Saint James began at one's home and ended at the pilgrimage site. However, a few of the routes are considered main ones. During the [[Middle Ages]], the route was highly travelled. However, the [[Black Death]], the [[Protestant Reformation]], and political unrest in 16th century Europe led to its decline. By the 1980s, only a few hundred pilgrims per year registered in the pilgrim's office in Santiago. In October 1987, the route was declared the first [[European Cultural Route]] by the [[Council of Europe]]; it was also named one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s. Since the 1980s the route has attracted a growing number of modern-day international pilgrims.\n\nWhenever St. James's [[Feast Day|Day]] (25 July) falls on a Sunday, the cathedral declares a Holy or [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] Year. Depending on leap years, Holy Years occur in 5-, 6-, and 11-year intervals. The most recent were 1982, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2010. The next will be 2021, 2027, and 2032.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.csj.org.uk/holy-years.htm |title=Holy Years at Santiago de Compostela |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916050419/http://www.csj.org.uk/holy-years.htm |archive-date=16 September 2014 |access-date=6 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Burgos-Metal-Pilgrim-2010.jpg|thumb|Monument of the pilgrims, [[Burgos]]]]\n\n=== Pre-Christian history ===\nThe main pilgrimage route to Santiago follows an earlier Roman trade route, which continues to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of Galicia, ending at [[Cape Finisterre]].  Although it is known today that Cape Finisterre, Spain's westernmost point, is not the westernmost point of Europe ([[Cabo da Roca]] in [[Portugal]] is farther west), the fact that the Romans called it ''Finisterrae'' (literally the ''end of the world'' or ''Land's End'' in [[Latin]]) indicates that they viewed it as such.  At night, the [[Milky Way]] overhead seems to point the way, so the route acquired the nickname \"Voie lact\u00e9e\" \u2013 the Milky Way in French.<ref name=\"route\">\"[http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/telegraph/04camino/04000001.htm Medieval footpath under the stars of the Milky Way] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217160109/http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/telegraph/04camino/04000001.htm |date=17 December 2006 }}\". ''Telegraph Online''.</ref>\n\n=== Scallop symbol ===\n[[File:Vieira Camino de Santiago.jpg|thumb|St. James pilgrim accessories]]\n{{See also|Shell of Saint James|Pilgrim's hat}}\nThe [[scallop]] shell, often found on the shores in Galicia, has long been the symbol of the Camino de Santiago. Over the centuries the scallop shell has taken on a variety of meanings, metaphorical, practical, and mythical, even if its relevance may have actually derived from the desire of pilgrims to take home a souvenir.\n\nTwo versions of the most common myth about the origin of the symbol concern the death of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], who was [[martyr]]ed by beheading in [[Jerusalem]] in 44 AD. According to Spanish legends, he had spent time preaching the gospel in Spain, but returned to Judaea upon seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary on the bank of the [[Ebro River]].<ref name=\"chadwick\">{{Citation |last=Chadwick |first=Henry |title=Priscillian of Avila |year=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref name=\"Fletcher\">{{Citation |last=Fletcher |first=Richard A. |title=Saint James's Catapult : The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela |url=http://libro.uca.edu/sjc/sjc.htm |year=1984 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n:Version 1: After James's death, his disciples shipped his body to the Iberian Peninsula to be buried in what is now Santiago. Off the coast of Spain, a heavy storm hit the ship, and the body was lost to the ocean. After some time, however, it washed ashore undamaged, covered in scallops.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n:Version 2: After James's death his body was transported by a ship piloted by an angel, back to the Iberian Peninsula to be buried in what is now Santiago. As the ship approached land, a wedding was taking place on shore. The young groom was on horseback, and on seeing the ship approaching, his horse got spooked, and horse and rider plunged into the sea. Through miraculous intervention, the horse and rider emerged from the water alive, covered in seashells.<ref name=Starkie/>{{rp|71}}\n\n[[File:SantiagoMatamoros.jpg|thumb|left|St. James the [[Moors|Moor]] Slayer ([[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]])]]\nFrom its connection to the Camino, the scallop shell came to represent pilgrimage, both to a specific shrine as well as heaven, recalling Hebrews 11:13, identifying that Christians \"are pilgrims and strangers on the earth\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://aleteia.org/2017/07/25/how-the-scallop-shell-became-a-symbol-of-pilgrimage/ |title=How the scallop shell became a symbol of pilgrimage |last=Kosloski |first=Philip |date=25 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs the symbol of the Camino de Santiago, the shell is seen very frequently along the trails. The shell is seen on posts and signs along the Camino in order to guide pilgrims along the way. The shell is even more commonly seen on the pilgrims themselves. Wearing a shell denotes that one is a traveler on the Camino de Santiago. Most pilgrims receive a shell at the beginning of their journey and either attach it to them by sewing it onto their clothes or wearing it around their neck or by simply keeping it in, or attached to the outside of, their backpack.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es |title=Camino de Santiago en Navarra |publisher=Government of Navarre |access-date=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe scallop shell also served practical purposes for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago. The shell was the right size for gathering water to drink or for eating out of as a makeshift bowl. During the medieval period, the shell was proof of completion rather than a symbol worn during the pilgrimage.\n\nThe [[pilgrim's staff]] is a walking stick used by pilgrims to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela in Spain.<ref name=\"navarra\">\"{{Cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es/eng/propuestas/camino-santiago/informacion-general-camino/curiosidades-camino.htm |title=Pilgrim's Way to Santiago: Curiosities |website=Navarre Tourist Board}}</ref> Generally, the stick has a hook on it so that something may be hung from it, and may have a crosspiece on it.<ref>Pilgrim's or Palmer's Staff {{lang-fr|bourdon}}: this was used as a device in a coat of arms as early at least as Edward II's reign, as will be seen.

For the road which leads us to life is narrow; on the other hand, the road which leads to death is broad and spacious. The pilgrim route is for those who are good: it is the lack of vices, the thwarting of the body, the increase of virtues, pardon for sins, sorrow for the penitent, the road of the righteous, love of the saints, faith in the resurrection and the reward of the blessed, a separation from hell, the protection of the heavens. It takes us away from luscious foods, it makes gluttonous fatness vanish, it restrains voluptuousness, constrains the appetites of the flesh which attack the fortress of the soul, cleanses the spirit, leads us to contemplation, humbles the haughty, raises up the lowly, loves poverty.  It hates the reproach of those fuelled by greed. It loves, on the other hand, the person who gives to the poor. It rewards those who live simply and do good works; And, on the other hand, it does not pluck those who are stingy and wicked from the claws of sin.\n|source=''[[Codex Calixtinus]]''\n}}\n\n[[File:Othem wall paintings 04.jpg|left|upright|Saint James with his pilgrim's staff.

The pilgrimage to the shrine became the most renowned medieval pilgrimage, and it became customary for those who returned from Compostela to carry back with them a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[scallop]] shell as proof of their completion of the journey.  This practice gradually led to the scallop shell becoming the badge of a pilgrim.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Waldron |first=Thomas |year=1979 |title=The Sign of the Scallop Shell |journal=The Furrow |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=646\u2013649 |jstor=27660823}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest recorded pilgrims from beyond the [[Pyrenees]] visited the shrine in the middle of the 11th century, but it seems that it was not until a century later that large numbers of pilgrims from abroad were regularly journeying there. The earliest records of pilgrims that arrived from [[England]] belong to the period between 1092 and 1105. However, by the early 12th century the pilgrimage had become a highly organized affair.\n\nOne of the great proponents of the pilgrimage in the 12th century was [[Pope Callixtus II]], who started the Compostelan Holy Years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.caminoguides.com/history.html |title=Brief history: The Camino \u2013 past, present & future |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301095104/http://www.caminoguides.com/history.html |archive-date=1 March 2012 |access-date=6 March 2014}}</ref> The official guide in those times was the [[Codex Calixtinus]]. Published around 1140, the 5th book of the Codex is still considered the definitive source for many modern guidebooks. Four pilgrimage routes listed in the Codex originate in France and converge at [[Puente la Reina]]. From there, a well-defined route crosses northern Spain, linking [[Burgos]], [[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]], [[Sahag\u00fan]], [[Le\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Astorga (Spain)|Astorga]], and Compostela.\n\nThe daily needs of pilgrims on their way to and from Compostela were met by a series of [[hospital]]s and contributed to the development of the idea itself, some Spanish towns still bearing the name, as [[Hospital de \u00d3rbigo]].  The hospitals were often staffed by Catholic orders and under royal protection.  Donations were encouraged but many poorer pilgrims had few clothes and poor health often barely getting to the next hospital.\n\n[[Romanesque architecture]], a new genre of ecclesiastical architecture, was designed with massive archways to cope with huge crowds of the devout.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/romanesque |title=Romanesque Architecture - Durham World Heritage Site |website=www.durhamworldheritagesite.com}}</ref> There was also the sale of the now-familiar paraphernalia of [[tourism]], such as badges and souvenirs.  Since the Christian symbol for [[James the Greater]] was the scallop shell, many pilgrims wore one as a sign to anyone on the road that they were a pilgrim. Pilgrims often prayed to [[Saint Roch]] whose numerous depictions with the [[Cross of Saint James|Cross of St James]] can still be seen along the Way even today.\n\n[[File:Jakobsweg - Pilger 1568 - Hurden IMG 5664.JPG|thumb|upright|Way of St. James pilgrims (1568)]]\nThe pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela was possible because of the protection and freedom provided by the [[Kingdom of France]], where the majority of pilgrims originated. Enterprising French (including [[Gascony|Gascons]] and other peoples not under the French crown) settled in towns along the pilgrimage routes, where their names appear in the archives. The pilgrims were tended by people like [[Domingo de la Calzada]], who was later recognized as a saint.\n\nPilgrims walked the Way of St. James, often for months and occasionally years at a time, to arrive at the great church in the main square of Compostela and pay homage to St. James.  Many arrived with very little due to illness or robbery or both.  Traditionally pilgrims lay their hands on the pillar just inside the doorway of the cathedral, and so many now have done this it has visibly worn away the stone.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Bethan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZSSaHJ8AsqcC&pg=PA179 |title=Walking the Camino de Santiago |last2=Cole |first2=Ben |publisher=Pili Pala Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-9731698-0-X |page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe popular Spanish name for the astronomical [[Milky Way]] is ''El Camino de Santiago''.

According to this system, pilgrimages were a suitable form of expiation for some temporal punishment, and they could be used as acts of penance for those who were guilty of certain crimes.

[[Cluny]], site of the celebrated medieval abbey, was another important rallying point for pilgrims and, in 2002, it was integrated into the official European pilgrimage route linking V\u00e9zelay and Le Puy.\n\nMost Spanish consider the French border in the [[Pyrenees]] the natural starting point.

The route is believed to have been first used by pilgrims to avoid traveling through the territories occupied by the Muslims in the Middle Ages.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== Accommodation ===\n[[File:Spain Leon - Santiago Shell.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.5|St. James's shell, a symbol of the route, on a wall in [[Le\u00f3n, Spain]]]]\n[[File:Navarrete pavement camino marker.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.5|A marker in the pavement indicates the route of the Way of St. James through [[Navarrete, La Rioja]], Spain.]]\nIn Spain, France, and Portugal, pilgrim's [[hostel]]s with beds in dormitories provide overnight accommodation for pilgrims who hold a ''credencial'' (see below). In Spain this type of accommodation is called a ''refugio'' or ''albergue'', both of which are similar to [[youth hostel]]s or hostelries in the French system of ''[[G\u00eete|g\u00eetes d'\u00e9tape]]''.\n\nHostels may be run by a local parish, the local council, private owners, or pilgrims' associations. Occasionally, these ''refugios'' are located in monasteries, such as the one run by monks in [[Samos, Galicia, Spain|Samos, Spain]], and the one in Santiago de Compostela.\n\nThe final hostel on the route is the famous [[Hostal de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos]], which lies across the plaza from the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Cathedral of Santiago de Campostela]].

Also known as the \"pilgrim's passport\", the ''credencial'' is stamped with the official St. James stamp of each town or ''refugio'' at which the pilgrim has stayed. It provides pilgrims with a record of where they ate or slept and serves as proof to the Pilgrim's Office in Santiago that the journey was accomplished according to an official route and thus that the pilgrim qualifies to receive a ''compostela'' (certificate of completion of the pilgrimage).\n\n=== ''Compostela'' ===\nThe ''compostela'' is a certificate of accomplishment given to pilgrims on completing the Way. To earn the ''compostela'' one needs to walk a minimum of 100&nbsp;km or cycle at least 200&nbsp;km.

But the most important place of pilgrimage was Rome. According to [[Bede]] (674\u2013735) the ''visitatio liminum'', or visit to the tomb of the Apostles, was even then regarded as a good work of great efficacy (Hist. Eccl., IV, 23). At first the pilgrims came simply to venerate the relics of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]], but in course of time their chief purpose was to gain the indulgences granted by the pope and attached especially to the [[Stations of the Cross|Stations]].\"</ref> other major pilgrimage routes include the [[Via Francigena]] to [[Rome]] and the pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]].\n\nLegend holds that [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]'s remains were carried by boat from Jerusalem to northern Spain, where he was buried in what is now the city of [[Santiago de Compostela]].  (The name ''Santiago'' is the local Galician evolution of [[Vulgar Latin]] ''Sancti Iacobi'', \"Saint James\".)\n\nThe Way can take one of dozens of pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela. Traditionally, as with most pilgrimages, the Way of Saint James began at one's home and ended at the pilgrimage site. However, a few of the routes are considered main ones. During the [[Middle Ages]], the route was highly travelled. However, the [[Black Death]], the [[Protestant Reformation]], and political unrest in 16th century Europe led to its decline. By the 1980s, only a few hundred pilgrims per year registered in the pilgrim's office in Santiago. In October 1987, the route was declared the first [[European Cultural Route]] by the [[Council of Europe]]; it was also named one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s. Since the 1980s the route has attracted a growing number of modern-day international pilgrims.\n\nWhenever St. James's [[Feast Day|Day]] (25 July) falls on a Sunday, the cathedral declares a Holy or [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] Year. Depending on leap years, Holy Years occur in 5-, 6-, and 11-year intervals. The most recent were 1982, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2010.

Over the centuries the scallop shell has taken on a variety of meanings, metaphorical, practical, and mythical, even if its relevance may have actually derived from the desire of pilgrims to take home a souvenir.\n\nTwo versions of the most common myth about the origin of the symbol concern the death of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], who was [[martyr]]ed by beheading in [[Jerusalem]] in 44 AD. According to Spanish legends, he had spent time preaching the gospel in Spain, but returned to Judaea upon seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary on the bank of the [[Ebro River]].<ref name=\"chadwick\">{{Citation |last=Chadwick |first=Henry |title=Priscillian of Avila |year=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref name=\"Fletcher\">{{Citation |last=Fletcher |first=Richard A. |title=Saint James's Catapult : The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela |url=http://libro.uca.edu/sjc/sjc.htm |year=1984 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n:Version 1: After James's death, his disciples shipped his body to the Iberian Peninsula to be buried in what is now Santiago.

The shell is seen on posts and signs along the Camino in order to guide pilgrims along the way. The shell is even more commonly seen on the pilgrims themselves. Wearing a shell denotes that one is a traveler on the Camino de Santiago. Most pilgrims receive a shell at the beginning of their journey and either attach it to them by sewing it onto their clothes or wearing it around their neck or by simply keeping it in, or attached to the outside of, their backpack.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.turismo.navarra.es |title=Camino de Santiago en Navarra |publisher=Government of Navarre |access-date=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe scallop shell also served practical purposes for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago.

It takes us away from luscious foods, it makes gluttonous fatness vanish, it restrains voluptuousness, constrains the appetites of the flesh which attack the fortress of the soul, cleanses the spirit, leads us to contemplation, humbles the haughty, raises up the lowly, loves poverty.  It hates the reproach of those fuelled by greed. It loves, on the other hand, the person who gives to the poor.

The pilgrimage to the shrine became the most renowned medieval pilgrimage, and it became customary for those who returned from Compostela to carry back with them a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[scallop]] shell as proof of their completion of the journey.  This practice gradually led to the scallop shell becoming the badge of a pilgrim.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Waldron |first=Thomas |year=1979 |title=The Sign of the Scallop Shell |journal=The Furrow |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=646\u2013649 |jstor=27660823}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest recorded pilgrims from beyond the [[Pyrenees]] visited the shrine in the middle of the 11th century, but it seems that it was not until a century later that large numbers of pilgrims from abroad were regularly journeying there. The earliest records of pilgrims that arrived from [[England]] belong to the period between 1092 and 1105. However, by the early 12th century the pilgrimage had become a highly organized affair.\n\nOne of the great proponents of the pilgrimage in the 12th century was [[Pope Callixtus II]], who started the Compostelan Holy Years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.caminoguides.com/history.html |title=Brief history: The Camino \u2013 past, present & future |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301095104/http://www.caminoguides.com/history.html |archive-date=1 March 2012 |access-date=6 March 2014}}</ref> The official guide in those times was the [[Codex Calixtinus]]. Published around 1140, the 5th book of the Codex is still considered the definitive source for many modern guidebooks. Four pilgrimage routes listed in the Codex originate in France and converge at [[Puente la Reina]]. From there, a well-defined route crosses northern Spain, linking [[Burgos]], [[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]], [[Sahag\u00fan]], [[Le\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Astorga (Spain)|Astorga]], and Compostela.\n\nThe daily needs of pilgrims on their way to and from Compostela were met by a series of [[hospital]]s and contributed to the development of the idea itself, some Spanish towns still bearing the name, as [[Hospital de \u00d3rbigo]].  The hospitals were often staffed by Catholic orders and under royal protection.  Donations were encouraged but many poorer pilgrims had few clothes and poor health often barely getting to the next hospital.\n\n[[Romanesque architecture]], a new genre of ecclesiastical architecture, was designed with massive archways to cope with huge crowds of the devout.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/romanesque |title=Romanesque Architecture - Durham World Heritage Site |website=www.durhamworldheritagesite.com}}</ref> There was also the sale of the now-familiar paraphernalia of [[tourism]], such as badges and souvenirs.  Since the Christian symbol for [[James the Greater]] was the scallop shell, many pilgrims wore one as a sign to anyone on the road that they were a pilgrim. Pilgrims often prayed to [[Saint Roch]] whose numerous depictions with the [[Cross of Saint James|Cross of St James]] can still be seen along the Way even today.\n\n[[File:Jakobsweg - Pilger 1568 - Hurden IMG 5664.JPG|thumb|upright|Way of St. James pilgrims (1568)]]\nThe pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela was possible because of the protection and freedom provided by the [[Kingdom of France]], where the majority of pilgrims originated. Enterprising French (including [[Gascony|Gascons]] and other peoples not under the French crown) settled in towns along the pilgrimage routes, where their names appear in the archives. The pilgrims were tended by people like [[Domingo de la Calzada]], who was later recognized as a saint.\n\nPilgrims walked the Way of St. James, often for months and occasionally years at a time, to arrive at the great church in the main square of Compostela and pay homage to St. James.  Many arrived with very little due to illness or robbery or both.  Traditionally pilgrims lay their hands on the pillar just inside the doorway of the cathedral, and so many now have done this it has visibly worn away the stone.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Bethan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZSSaHJ8AsqcC&pg=PA179 |title=Walking the Camino de Santiago |last2=Cole |first2=Ben |publisher=Pili Pala Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-9731698-0-X |page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe popular Spanish name for the astronomical [[Milky Way]] is ''El Camino de Santiago''.

Also known as the \"pilgrim's passport\", the ''credencial'' is stamped with the official St. James stamp of each town or ''refugio'' at which the pilgrim has stayed.

The earliest surviving mention of the townland is on the 1609 Ulster Plantation map of the Barony of Loughtee, where it is spelled ''Granchinah''. A 1610 grant spells it as ''Granchinagh''. A 1627 grant spells it as ''Granchynagh, or Craynkyney, and Cronaghan''. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Cranaghan''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nIt is bounded on the north by Killywilly townland, on the east by Ardue, Ture and Greaghrahan townlands, on the south by [[Aghavoher]] and [[Carrigan]] townlands and on the west by [[Cavanagh (townland)]] and [[Mullaghduff, County Cavan|Mullaghduff]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Killywilly Lough, Agavoher Lough, Lough Rud, the [[Rag River]] and several small drumlin hills reaching to an altitude of 250 feet above sea-level. Cranaghan is traversed by the [[N87 road (Ireland)]] and some minor lanes. The townland covers 492 acres, including 108 acres of water.\n\n==History==\n\nIn a grant of the Manor of Monaghan dated 21 June 1610 from King James I to Sir Hugh Wyrral, it was specified that ''the two polls of Granchinagh containing 90 acres are excepted from this grant''. The reason they were excepted is that they were intended as glebe-land for the Protestant Church. On 25 January 1627 a grant was made of ''two poles of Granchynagh, or Craynkyney, and Cronaghan to Thomas Groves, the Rector or Vicar of the parish of Dromlaghan''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ireland Public Record Office|author2=James Morrin|title=Calender of the Patent and Close Rolls of Chancery in Ireland, of the Reign of Charles the First: First to Eighth Year, Inclusive--|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5xCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA187|year=1863|publisher=H.M.

The earliest surviving mention of the townland is on the 1609 Ulster Plantation map of the Barony of Loughtee, where it is spelled ''Granchinah''. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Cranaghan''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nIt is bounded on the north by Killywilly townland, on the east by Ardue, Ture and Greaghrahan townlands, on the south by [[Aghavoher]] and [[Carrigan]] townlands and on the west by [[Cavanagh (townland)]] and [[Mullaghduff, County Cavan|Mullaghduff]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Killywilly Lough, Agavoher Lough, Lough Rud, the [[Rag River]] and several small drumlin hills reaching to an altitude of 250 feet above sea-level. Cranaghan is traversed by the [[N87 road (Ireland)]] and some minor lanes. The townland covers 492 acres, including 108 acres of water.\n\n==History==\n\nIn a grant of the Manor of Monaghan dated 21 June 1610 from King James I to Sir Hugh Wyrral, it was specified that ''the two polls of Granchinagh containing 90 acres are excepted from this grant''. The reason they were excepted is that they were intended as glebe-land for the Protestant Church. On 25 January 1627 a grant was made of ''two poles of Granchynagh, or Craynkyney, and Cronaghan to Thomas Groves, the Rector or Vicar of the parish of Dromlaghan''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ireland Public Record Office|author2=James Morrin|title=Calender of the Patent and Close Rolls of Chancery in Ireland, of the Reign of Charles the First: First to Eighth Year, Inclusive--|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5xCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA187|year=1863|publisher=H.M.
