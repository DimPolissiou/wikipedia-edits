It stars [[Kriti Sanon]] and [[Sushant Singh Rajput]], with [[Jim Sarbh]], [[Rajkumar Yadav]] and [[Varun Sharma]] in supporting roles. The story is based on the concept of [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] [[star-crossed lovers]]. ''Raabta'' released on 9 June 2017 at a budget of {{INR|450 million}}. It underperformed at the box office, grossing {{INR|398 million}} worldwide, and was termed a \"disaster\" by [[Box Office India]].\n\n==Plot==\nShiv Kakkar ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) is a young man from [[Amritsar]] who gets a lucrative opportunity to work in [[Budapest]] for a job as a banker, and lives with his friend, Radha ([[Varun Sharma]]). Shiv is shown to have been a fun-loving womanizer back home and continues this behaviour in Budapest. Saira Singh ([[Kriti Sanon]]), a young woman, is haunted by mysterious nightmares of drowning to death. She lives by herself in Budapest and works as a chocolatier. Shiv happens to stumble upon Saira's shop while on a date with a woman, but finds himself deeply attracted to Saira. Though she initially rejects his advances, she eventually succumbs and sleeps with Shiv, revealing the next day that she actually has a boyfriend and what happened with Shiv was a mistake. Unwilling to let go of their connection, Shiv interrupts Saira's date with her boyfriend Manav ([[Vikas Verma]]) and shows her that she would rather be with him than with her boyfriend. Manav breaks up with her, and Shiv and Saira start spending time together, growing close. One night, they go to a club with Radha, where they happen to meet an eccentric psychic who knows about Saira's nightmares and tells her that the events of her previous life will repeat themselves, and only she can fix them. Saira tearfully reveals to Shiv that she has a fear of water because her parents drowned after a car accident when she was two years old.\n\nWhile trying to test their love a final time, Shiv and Saira make a pact. Shiv flirts with multiple women, but Saira finds herself strongly drawn to a young businessman Zakir \"Zack\" Merchant ([[Jim Sarbh]]). Shiv reveals he has to leave for a business trip for a week and he and Saira decide to see how they feel after a week's separation. If they still feel strongly about each other, they will start considering marriage. During Shiv's absence, Saira gets to know Zakir better and confides in him about her nightmares. During one of their dinners, Zakir drugs Saira and kidnaps her.\n\nSaira wakes up and finds herself trapped in Zakir's isolated mansion on an island off the coast. She demands him to let her go, but he refuses, saying that he spent his whole life looking for her. He explains that he was madly in love with her in a previous life but his love remained unrequited. He refuses to let go of her again. When she does not believe him, he shows her a collection of uncannily accurate paintings he made of her at various ages and says she will find the explanation for her nightmares. Thinking he is crazy, she attempts to escape but ends up falling into the ocean, which triggers the memories of her previous life.\n\nThree hundred years ago, Saira was warrior princess Saiba. She had a childhood best friend Kabir ([[Jim Sarbh]]), a fellow warrior from her tribe who was in love with her. Their kingdom was threatened by the Muraakis, led by a wise, old Rajput ruler Muwwaqqil ([[Rajkummar Rao]]). Qaabir is severely wounded by the fierce warrior Jilaan ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]), who gives Qaabir an ultimatum to surrender. Saiba challenges Jilaan, and they find themselves attracted to each other. Saiba accepts defeat, surrendering the kingdom to the Muraakis and herself to Jilaan. Qaabir attempts to take Saiba back, but she reveals that she and Jilaan are in love. On their wedding night, a [[comet]] falls and Muwwaqqil realizes that this will be a fateful night. Qaabir ambushes Jilaan and Saiba, and murders Jilaan by wounding him and throws him in the ocean. Saiba jumps into the ocean to save him, but to no avail. Heartbroken on seeing Jilaan die, Saiba who is also heartbroken decides to drown too. On seeing Saiba dead, Qaabir slits his own throat, killing himself. Muwwaqqil forebodes that these events will repeat.\n\nHowever, this time, when Shiv shows up, Saira decides to fight back against Zakir. When their previous lives' events repeat, Zakir throwing Shiv into the ocean, Shiv drags Zakir down with him and Zakir dies. Saira jumps into the water and is able to save Shiv.\n\nThe film ends with Shiv humorously telling their children to not to believe Saira if she tells them any far-fetched stories about reincarnation, implying that he is still oblivious to the events of their previous lives.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sushant Singh Rajput]] as Jilaan/Shiv Kakkar\n* [[Kriti Sanon]] as Saiba/Saira Singh\n* [[Jim Sarbh]] as Kabir/Zakir \"Zak\" Merchant\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Radha, Shiv's friend\n* [[Vikas Verma]] as Manav Mehta\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Muwwaqqil\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] in a special appearance in the title track\n\n==Production ==\nThe film production began in 2015 and it was set to release in 2016.

Saira jumps into the water and is able to save Shiv.\n\nThe film ends with Shiv humorously telling their children to not to believe Saira if she tells them any far-fetched stories about reincarnation, implying that he is still oblivious to the events of their previous lives.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sushant Singh Rajput]] as Jilaan/Shiv Kakkar\n* [[Kriti Sanon]] as Saiba/Saira Singh\n* [[Jim Sarbh]] as Kabir/Zakir \"Zak\" Merchant\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Radha, Shiv's friend\n* [[Vikas Verma]] as Manav Mehta\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Muwwaqqil\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] in a special appearance in the title track\n\n==Production ==\nThe film production began in 2015 and it was set to release in 2016.

The game takes place in a surrealistic [[neon noir]] environment and features the player slicing blocks representing musical beats with a pair of contrasting colored sabers. Following an [[early access]] release in November 2018, the game was fully released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] on May 21, 2019. The game supports most [[virtual reality headset]]s, such as [[PlayStation VR]], [[HTC Vive]], [[Oculus Rift]], and [[Oculus Quest]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn Beat Saber, you assume the role of a person wielding two 'sabers'. The goal of the game is to cut blocks in a certain direction, to the beat of a selected song. If you miss multiple blocks, you fail. In the bottom left corner of the screen, you can see your grade. SS is the highest grade, while E is the lowest. The goal is to get a high grade. />\n\nSince its early access stages, the game included a single player mode as well as a party mode, which features a leaderboard with the player's names, which are entered after each song is played. Additionally, the 1.0 release version introduced a level editor and a practice mode which allows the player to alter the song's speed, or start playing it from some point in time other than the beginning, as well as custom songs.\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Beat saber team gdca 2019.jpg|thumb|left|L-R: programmer Vladimir \"Loki\" Hrin\u010d\u00e1r, head of marketing Michaela Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, and composer [[Jaroslav Beck]] at the Game Developers Choice Awards 2019]]\nThe game was first released in [[early access]] on [[Microsoft Windows]] on May 1, 2018.<ref name=\"Windows Central Beat Saber\">{{cite web|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/beat-saber-everything-we-know-about-vr-rhythm-game|title=Beat Saber: Everything we know about the VR rhythm game|last=Hunt|first=Cale|date=April 5, 2018|website=Windows Central|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> The game was released on PlayStation 4 on November 20, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/beat-saber-ps4/|title=Beat Saber|website=PlayStation|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref> An editor was announced for release in May 2018, which would allow for the creation of custom user songs, but it was postponed,<ref name=\"Beat Saber Level Editor\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/vr-rhythm-game-beat-saber-now-the-highest-rated-game-on-steam-releasing-level-editor-next-week/|title=VR rhythm game Beat Saber, now the highest rated game on Steam, releasing level editor next week|last=Horti|first=Samuel|date=May 6, 2018|website=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> and added in May 2019.<ref name=\"RPS 2019-05-21\" />\n\nIn March 2019, Beat Games released its first paid [[downloadable content|song pack]], featuring 10 songs from electronic music record label [[Monstercat]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/beat-saber-releases-first-paid-dlc-song-pack-contains-10-tracks/|title=Beat Saber releases first paid DLC music pack|last=Horti|first=Samuel|date=March 16, 2019|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref> \"[[Crab Rave]]\" was added as a free update on [[April Fools' day]] that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/04/01/crab-rave-beat-saber-free-song/|title=Crab Rave is the Latest Free Beat Saber Song, Available Now|date=April 1, 2019|website=PlayStation LifeStyle|access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref> On May 2, 2019, to celebrate the game's first anniversary, a prototype version created three years prior was released to the public as ''Beat Saber Origins''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techmoneyfit.com/blog/beat-saber-releases-origins-early-build-to-celebrate-first-anniversary/|title=Beat Saber Releases Origins Early Build To Celebrate First Anniversary|date=March 4, 2019|website=techmoneyfit.com|access-date=May 10, 2019}}</ref> The game was fully released out of early access on PC on May 21, 2019.<ref name=\"RPS 2019-05-21\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/05/22/beat-saber-out/|title=Beat Saber bops out of early access|first=Matt|last=Cox|date=May 21, 2019|accessdate=May 21, 2019|work=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]]}}</ref> On January 29, 2020, the game received a free pack featuring three songs by Japanese artist Camellia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uploadvr.com/beat-saber-new-track/|title=Three New Free Beat Saber Songs Arrive In New Update From Cametek|date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2019, [[Facebook, Inc.]] via [[Oculus Studios]] announced that it had acquired Beat Games.

The game takes place in a surrealistic [[neon noir]] environment and features the player slicing blocks representing musical beats with a pair of contrasting colored sabers. Following an [[early access]] release in November 2018, the game was fully released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] on May 21, 2019. The game supports most [[virtual reality headset]]s, such as [[PlayStation VR]], [[HTC Vive]], [[Oculus Rift]], and [[Oculus Quest]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game includes several songs with up to five levels of difficulty, starting from Easy all the way to Expert+. The player uses VR motion controllers to wield a pair of lightsabers, the left one colored red and the right one colored blue by default. In each song, the game presents the player with a stream of approaching blocks, laid out in sync with the song's beats and notes, located in one of the 12 possible positions of a 4x3 grid. The game also features the option of playing some songs in 360\u00b0, or 90\u00b0 orientations where blocks approach from around the player. Each block varies in color, corresponding to the color of the saber that should be used to slash it. It may also be marked with an arrow indicating one of eight possible directions in which the block may be required to be slashed through. There are also blocks with dots instead of arrows, which players may hit in any direction. When a block is properly slashed by a saber, it is destroyed and a score is awarded, based on the length and angles of the swing and the accuracy of the cut. In addition, there are occasionally mines that the player should not hit, and obstacles in the form of oncoming walls that the player's head should avoid. There is also a white bar underneath the path where the blocks travel, which slowly fills up as the player hits notes correctly. If the player hits any note in the incorrect direction, the white 'health bar' will become less full by a small chunk. If the player completely misses a note, the bar will lose a large chunk. If the bar becomes completely empty, the game will end.<ref name=\"Windows Central Beat Saber\" />\n\nSince its early access stages, the game included a single player mode as well as a party mode, which features a leaderboard with the player's names, which are entered after each song is played. Additionally, the 1.0 release version introduced a level editor and a practice mode which allows the player to alter the song's speed, or start playing it from some point in time other than the beginning, as well as custom songs.\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Beat saber team gdca 2019.jpg|thumb|left|L-R: programmer Vladimir \"Loki\" Hrin\u010d\u00e1r, head of marketing Michaela Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, and composer [[Jaroslav Beck]] at the Game Developers Choice Awards 2019]]\nThe game was first released in [[early access]] on [[Microsoft Windows]] on May 1, 2018.<ref name=\"Windows Central Beat Saber\">{{cite web|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/beat-saber-everything-we-know-about-vr-rhythm-game|title=Beat Saber: Everything we know about the VR rhythm game|last=Hunt|first=Cale|date=April 5, 2018|website=Windows Central|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> The game was released on PlayStation 4 on November 20, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/beat-saber-ps4/|title=Beat Saber|website=PlayStation|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref> An editor was announced for release in May 2018, which would allow for the creation of custom user songs, but it was postponed,<ref name=\"Beat Saber Level Editor\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/vr-rhythm-game-beat-saber-now-the-highest-rated-game-on-steam-releasing-level-editor-next-week/|title=VR rhythm game Beat Saber, now the highest rated game on Steam, releasing level editor next week|last=Horti|first=Samuel|date=May 6, 2018|website=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> and added in May 2019.<ref name=\"RPS 2019-05-21\" />\n\nIn March 2019, Beat Games released its first paid [[downloadable content|song pack]], featuring 10 songs from electronic music record label [[Monstercat]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/beat-saber-releases-first-paid-dlc-song-pack-contains-10-tracks/|title=Beat Saber releases first paid DLC music pack|last=Horti|first=Samuel|date=March 16, 2019|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref> \"[[Crab Rave]]\" was added as a free update on [[April Fools' day]] that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/04/01/crab-rave-beat-saber-free-song/|title=Crab Rave is the Latest Free Beat Saber Song, Available Now|date=April 1, 2019|website=PlayStation LifeStyle|access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref> On May 2, 2019, to celebrate the game's first anniversary, a prototype version created three years prior was released to the public as ''Beat Saber Origins''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techmoneyfit.com/blog/beat-saber-releases-origins-early-build-to-celebrate-first-anniversary/|title=Beat Saber Releases Origins Early Build To Celebrate First Anniversary|date=March 4, 2019|website=techmoneyfit.com|access-date=May 10, 2019}}</ref> The game was fully released out of early access on PC on May 21, 2019.<ref name=\"RPS 2019-05-21\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/05/22/beat-saber-out/|title=Beat Saber bops out of early access|first=Matt|last=Cox|date=May 21, 2019|accessdate=May 21, 2019|work=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]]}}</ref> On January 29, 2020, the game received a free pack featuring three songs by Japanese artist Camellia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uploadvr.com/beat-saber-new-track/|title=Three New Free Beat Saber Songs Arrive In New Update From Cametek|date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2019, [[Facebook, Inc.]] via [[Oculus Studios]] announced that it had acquired Beat Games.

The historical origin is unclear. Links with [[Middle English]] ''te'' forms of the article remain unproved.\n\nA similar usage of an article with a consonant \"t'\" can also be found in Modern Dutch and in the [[West Frisian language]] off the north Netherlands coast. In these languages, \"t\" clearly derives from the neuter definite article (Dutch ''het'' and West Frisian ''it)'' because the Dutch and Frisian masculine and feminine singular as well as plural definite article ''de'' cannot become \"t\").\n\nThe family name \"Huis in't Feld\" exists in Dutch, meaning \"house in the field\". Claims that this is phonetically similar to DAR remain to be verified experimentally. In [[Cumbria]], a [[voiceless alveolar plosive]] (the English ''t'' sound) does occur, which may have some superficial similarities to realizations in West Frisian and [[Low German]], but the glottal and glottalised DAR variants found elsewhere in the DAR area and across Yorkshire present a very different realisation. Jones (2002: 342) comments that no contact explanation with other varieties of Germanic is required (or could be supported on the basis of available evidence) to explain DAR as the development of DAR involves common cross-linguistic patterns of change (stopping of dental fricatives, change of plosive to glottal) that occur in unrelated languages and so have a purely phonetic origin.\n\n==Phonetics==\nThe phonetic forms of DAR are very varied. The \"th'\" form suggests a [[voiceless dental fricative]] realisation, usually voiceless {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} (as in ''th''in), and is restricted to the western parts of the DAR area ([[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]]). It also occurred widely across northern and central [[Staffordshire]] in earlier dialect surveys (Jones 2002) and sporadic forms similar to DAR were reported to occur in localities in [[Berkshire]], [[Sussex]], and [[Essex]], and also in [[Aylesham]] in [[Kent]] owing to the large influx of miners from Northern England to work in the Kent Coalfield.<ref>''Welcome to the north!

The glottal form is most widely encountered. Some dialects may show more than one phonetic form, but the conditioning factors for such variation are unknown. It seems that unvarying glottal forms are most widely found now (2005). Variation with a full form ''[[the]]'' is also common.\n\nSpeakers of other forms of English often find it difficult to hear, especially the 'glottal' forms that affect the pitch and duration and voice quality of surrounding words and sounds in subtle ways. This often leads to claims that the article is absent, but this is rarely the case. True absence of the article may occur in the east of the DAR area around [[Kingston upon Hull]].\n\nRecent instrumental acoustic work (2007) shows that DAR speakers use very subtle differences in the quality and timing of [[glottalisation]] to differentiate between a [[glottal stop]] occurring as an [[allophone]] of final /t/ in a word like \"seat\" and a [[glottal stop]] occurring as the form of the definite article in otherwise identical sentences (compare \"seat sacks\" and \"see t' sacks\").

The film is based on the Chinese folklore \"The Ballad of [[Hua Mulan|Mulan]]\" and is a [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action adaptation]] of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s [[Mulan (1998 film)|1998 animated film of the same name]]. The film stars [[Liu Yifei]] in the [[Mulan (Disney character)|title role]], alongside [[Donnie Yen]], [[Jason Scott Lee]], [[Yoson An]], [[Gong Li]], and [[Jet Li]] in supporting roles.\n\nPlans for a live-action ''Mulan'' remake began in 2010, but the project never came to fruition. In March 2015, a new attempt was announced and Caro was hired to direct in February 2017. Liu was cast in the title role in November 2017, following a casting call of 1,000 actresses, and the rest of the cast joined over the following year. Filming began in August 2018 and lasted through November, taking place in [[New Zealand]] and [[China]].\n\n''Mulan'' is the first live-action remake from Disney to be given a PG-13 rating by the [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/mulan-rating-pg-13-violence-disney-1203508059/|title=\u2018Mulan\u2019 Is Disney\u2019s First Live-Action Remake to Get a PG-13 Rating|last=Rico|first=Klaritza|date=2020-02-19|website=Variety|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> It was scheduled to be released in the United States on March 27, 2020, but was delayed to July 24, 2020 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Premise==\n{{Quote|When the Emperor of China issues a decree that one man per family must serve in the Imperial Army to defend the country from Northern invaders, Hua Mulan, the eldest daughter of an honored warrior, steps in to take the place of her ailing father.

For example, the song \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was removed. Also, Mulan's original love interest, Captain Li Shang, was removed, with his role being spilt into two different characters, <ref>{{cite web|https://collider.com/mulan-changes-live-action-animated-version-disney/</ref>}}Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) and Chen Honghui (Yoson An). Also, Mushu, played by Eddie Murphy, was removed from the remake and a new character, Mulan's sister Hua Xiu, will be added. Finally, Shan Yu, the main antagonist of the original film, will not be in the remake.

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"afv.com\" /> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s.

He was replaced by radio and television actor [[Gary Owens]] in 1995, who stayed in that role until Saget left, but Anderson briefly returned shortly before his death in February 1997. Besides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott. The success of ''AFHV'' led to a spinoff called ''[[America's Funniest People]],'' hosted by Saget's ''Full House'' co-star [[Dave Coulier]] (and co-hosted by actress/producer [[Arleen Sorkin]] for the first two seasons, then model [[Tawny Kitaen]] for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people ''intentionally'' trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title='Video' host rewinds pal's format|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 3, 1990|access-date=March 8, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> During the show's first four seasons, ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' aired on Sunday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120321/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=John Carmody|title=The TV Column|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 6, 1989|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> beginning with the fifth season, the show started the Sunday primetime lineup on ABC, airing at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., followed by ''America's Funniest People'' at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. as part of an hour-long block of funny home videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC153DF932A25756C0A965958260|author=Bill Carter|title=Coming Next: New ABC Prime Time|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 1993}}</ref> Saget always ended each episode with the phrase \"Keep those cameras safely rolling\" and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show. Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

Saget returned to ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' on three different occasions-- first, to co-host a 20th anniversary special edition episode alongside future host [[Tom Bergeron]], which aired on November 29, 2009 (which was three days shy of ''AFV''{{'}}s actual 20th anniversary date of its premiere on the air on November 26, 1989); a cameo appearance at the end of Bergeron's final episode on May 17, 2015, where he was driving a golf cart and to co-host a 30th anniversary special edition episode (\"AFV: America...

During this period, the show introduced a segment called \"Bad News, Good News,\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \"AFV Hall of Fame,\" in which a clip is shown and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \"Who Would You Like to See...\" in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors.

Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008\u201309 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail. Except for reruns of episodes from seasons 21 and 22 that referenced uploading to ABC.com, the re-edited season 11\u201320 episodes that used to originally reference ABC.com on the unaltered versions of the episodes reference uploading to AFV.com. \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Salute To...\" were discontinued after season 29; the completion of Alfonso Ribiero's first four years as AFV host.<ref>{{cite press release |last= Lindenbaum|first= Sybil |date= February 16, 2008|title= America's Funniest Home Videos Accepts Submission Via Internet|url= https://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/41231/americas-funniest-home-videos-accepts-submissions-via-internet|location= |publisher= 24-7PressRelease|agency= |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> During the 2011\u201312 season, the ''AFV'' [[iOS]] app was released on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], allowing users of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] mobile devices to record and upload videos for submission to the show; a version of the app was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices the following season. In the final six seasons of Bergeron's run as host, the show started its \"Funny Since 1989\" campaign in 2009 and had two anniversary seasons. Season 20, in 2009, had a special 20th anniversary episode that aired on November 29, with Saget returning to ''AFV'' for the first time in 12 years as a guest. Both Saget and Bergeron ended that episode with a pinata party skit and a nod to the Star Wars lightsaber fight scenes when the credits started rolling.

Bergeron's final new episode from his in-studio stage home of 15 years (which was really his second to final episode) aired on May 10, 2015 (and for the final time in rerun form on September 13, 2015) and was the final (and season 25's second) $100,000 show of his tenure and featured at different times of the episode a look back at classic and modern funny home videos that defined the show's then-25-year run. Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions-- the first on July 19, 2015, to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and the second on September 20, 2015, as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of ''AFV'' with Saget and Bergeron signing off for the final time. Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \"Grand Prize Spectacular\" finale of Ribiero's ''AFV'' on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \"Who Breaks It?\" and won an Ribiero ''AFV'' pillow and socks. Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\n*\"Here's What Happens\" (Showing viewers what happens when you do certain things before one other person or thing should do first) \nBeginning with the 2018\u201319 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].'' During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14\u201322, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=McClellan, Steve|title=MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=October 3, 1994|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1\u20135 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6\u20138 (1994\u201397). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1\u20135 aired on [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] from 2004 to 2007, [[Nick at Nite]] from April 2007 to October 2013 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2013. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the TBS airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6\u20138 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2006 to October 2010 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6\u20138) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94\u201397 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003\u20132015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\n===VHS/DVD===\nABC, [[Shout! Factory]], and Slingshot Entertainment have released numerous compilation releases of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' on VHS and DVD in Region 1 (North America).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"afv.com\" /> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1\u201310) based on that particular tape's humor. The videos deemed the funniest by the screeners then go on to the show's producers and then is turned over to Di Bona and another producer for final approval.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120124/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Susan Bickelhaupt, Globe Staff|title='Funniest Home Videos' Outstrips '60 Minutes'|agency=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=February 28, 1990|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Home video material that involves staged accidents, or/and adults, children, or babies getting seriously injured or the abuse of animals, or overall does not meet ABC network [[standards and practices]] are generally not accepted and will not appear on the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3995728.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120132/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3995728.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title=Saget aims to clip hurtful video bits|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=April 27, 1990|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Every week, the producers choose three videos that the studio audience will vote on.

Besides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott. The success of ''AFHV'' led to a spinoff called ''[[America's Funniest People]],'' hosted by Saget's ''Full House'' co-star [[Dave Coulier]] (and co-hosted by actress/producer [[Arleen Sorkin]] for the first two seasons, then model [[Tawny Kitaen]] for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people ''intentionally'' trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title='Video' host rewinds pal's format|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 3, 1990|access-date=March 8, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> During the show's first four seasons, ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' aired on Sunday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120321/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=John Carmody|title=The TV Column|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 6, 1989|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> beginning with the fifth season, the show started the Sunday primetime lineup on ABC, airing at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., followed by ''America's Funniest People'' at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. as part of an hour-long block of funny home videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC153DF932A25756C0A965958260|author=Bill Carter|title=Coming Next: New ABC Prime Time|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 1993}}</ref> Saget always ended each episode with the phrase \"Keep those cameras safely rolling\" and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show. Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

Saget returned to ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' on three different occasions-- first, to co-host a 20th anniversary special edition episode alongside future host [[Tom Bergeron]], which aired on November 29, 2009 (which was three days shy of ''AFV''{{'}}s actual 20th anniversary date of its premiere on the air on November 26, 1989); a cameo appearance at the end of Bergeron's final episode on May 17, 2015, where he was driving a golf cart and to co-host a 30th anniversary special edition episode (\"AFV: America...

During this period, the show introduced a segment called \"Bad News, Good News,\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \"AFV Hall of Fame,\" in which a clip is shown and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \"Who Would You Like to See...\" in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

While Fugelsang has not been seen in new recent never-before-seen footage on the road or in the studio on ''AFV'' since leaving the show in May 1999 after only two years co-hosting it together, Fuentes made a few brief cameo appearances in interview segments likely taking place at her house speaking on behalf of her and Fugelsang (and AFV; especially during their tenure) on the \"AFV: America...

Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008\u201309 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

Bergeron's final new episode from his in-studio stage home of 15 years (which was really his second to final episode) aired on May 10, 2015 (and for the final time in rerun form on September 13, 2015) and was the final (and season 25's second) $100,000 show of his tenure and featured at different times of the episode a look back at classic and modern funny home videos that defined the show's then-25-year run. Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions-- the first on July 19, 2015, to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and the second on September 20, 2015, as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of ''AFV'' with Saget and Bergeron signing off for the final time. Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \"Grand Prize Spectacular\" finale of Ribiero's ''AFV'' on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \"Who Breaks It?\" and won an Ribiero ''AFV'' pillow and socks. Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\n*\"Here's What Happens\" (Showing viewers what happens when you do certain things before one other person or thing should do first) \nBeginning with the 2018\u201319 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].'' During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14\u201322, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other.

Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1\u20135 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6\u20138 (1994\u201397). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1\u20135 aired on [[TBS]] from 2004 to 2007, [[Nick at Nite]] from April 2007 to October 2013 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2013. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the TBS airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6\u20138 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2006 to October 2010 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6\u20138) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94\u201397 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003\u20132015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Merchandise==\n\n===VHS/DVD===\nABC, [[Shout! Factory]], and Slingshot Entertainment have released numerous compilation releases of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' on VHS and DVD in Region 1 (North America).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Between bands, several video clips honouring Freddie Mercury were shown while [[Road crew|roadies]] changed the stage for the following act's performance. [[Elizabeth Taylor]] then gave an AIDS prevention speech, which was followed by a compilation of Mercury's various interactions with audiences.\n\nThe second half of the concert featured the three remaining Queen members \u2013 [[John Deacon]] (on bass), [[Brian May]] (on guitar) and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (on drums) \u2013 along with guest singers and guitarists, including [[Elton John]], [[Roger Daltrey]] (of [[The Who]]), [[Tony Iommi]] (of [[Black Sabbath]]), [[David Bowie]], [[Mick Ronson]] (of [[Spiders from Mars]]), [[James Hetfield]] (of [[Metallica]]), [[George Michael]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Paul Young (singer and guitarist)|Paul Young]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Lisa Stansfield]], [[Robert Plant]] (of [[Led Zeppelin]]), [[Joe Elliott]] and [[Phil Collen]] (of [[Def Leppard]]), [[Axl Rose]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (of [[Guns N' Roses]]), [[Liza Minnelli]], and others.

The film co-stars [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]. The film was released on December 22, 1983.\n\nSet in the 19th century in [[History of Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|old Hong Kong]], ''Project A'' blends comedy moments and spectacular stunts, including set-pieces reminiscent of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]]. One stunt in particular involved Chan hanging and falling from the hand of a clock tower some 60 feet high, tearing through awning canopies before hitting the ground head-first. It was inspired by Lloyd's famous clock-tower stunt from the 1923 film ''[[Safety Last!]]''; while Lloyd only hanged from the tower, Chan took it a step further and actually fell from the tower.\n\nThe film was a box office success in [[East Asia]]. At the [[4th Hong Kong Film Awards]], Chan received two nominations for the film (and another for ''[[Wheels on Meals]]''), including his first [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] nomination, and won his first [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography|Best Action Choreography]] award. A sequel, ''[[Project A Part II]]'', was released in 1987.\n\n==Plot==\nSergeant Dragon Ma ([[Jackie Chan]]) is part of the [[Hong Kong Marine Police]]'s effort to suppress the [[pirates]], who have been raiding ships for months. Members of the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] and the MP, who have strong [[interservice rivalries]], get into a fight in a bar. Shortly after this, Captain Chi ([[Kwan Hoi-san]]) releases all of the sailors to their commanding officer, and two of the MP's ships get blown up.\n\nGangsters Chiang and Mr. Chou meet at a VIP Club, and discuss fleeing to [[Vietnam]]. As soon as Chiang leaves, he meets one of the pirates and they laugh about sabotaging the Marine Police ships. In the course of the conversation, the pirate tells him that his boss, San-po ([[Dick Wei]]), wants 100 police rifles.\n\nAs they do not have enough ships, Dragon Ma and his squad are forced to become regular police officers. They have to undergo \"hard training\" with the police, under Captain Chi's nephew, Hong Tin-tsu ([[Yuen Biao]]). After the police learn that Chiang is at the VIP Club, and that the guests there are not to be disturbed, Dragon and Tin-tsu go to arrest Chiang, but a big fight breaks out. After tiring of the blatant corruption in the police force, Dragon drags Chiang out and tells Tin-tsu to take the credit. That is his last official act as an officer with the Hong Kong police.\n\nFei ([[Sammo Hung]]) finds Dragon in the street. They have a conversation, in which Fei reveals that someone from within the police force is selling rifles. Fei tells Dragon that all he wants are the guns, and Dragon can catch the traitor. At night, Dragon and Fei interrupt a gun deal between the Army and the police Captain. After pushing everyone into the water and making off with the guns, Fei hides the rifles inside a log and marks it with a red flag. He later tries to sell the guns to the gangsters and pirates, but Dragon has intervened by removing the red flag and putting flags on other logs.\n\nAfter thwarting Fei's plan to sell the rifles to the pirates, Dragon has a conversation with the Admiral's daughter, Winnie. He learns that the Captain wasn't [[smuggling]] rifles for San-po, he was buying the rifles from the army to arm his men. On overhearing this, Fei gets into an argument with Dragon. The gangsters come after Fei, so he tells them that Dragon is to blame for the missing rifles. Dragon is forced to flee with Winnie.

After Mr. Chou leaves, Dragon confronts the Colonel and convinces him that the gangsters and the pirates will never fear the law if the police force are corrupt.

Logan identifies that a possible reason for the poor performance was the comparative lack of action. Edward Tang and the production team felt that a period film could still have success if it had sufficient action, and so researched the history of Hong Kong during the time of pirates for ''Project A''.\n\nUnlike other Hollywood period films that are set on an exact time and place, many Hong Kong films play fast and loose with their period in history. A prominent example by Bey Logan is set like this: the Hong Kong Marine Police is set up in 1846 by the British Colonial Government. The Hong Kong Headquarters is set up in 1884. The Kowloon Canton Railway Clock tower is set up in 1915. So in other words, this film takes place between the 19th and early 20th century. Jackie and the Golden Harvest team employ some researchers to come up with background for this story about pirates in Hong Kong and are not really concerned at all about depicting the film in the exact era. Bey Logan coined regarding historical heroes and stories like Wong Fei Hong: if you choose between the truth and the legend, you print the legend because if you pick the truth, you won't have for example, having items, vehicles and certain historical figures if you are shooting it in a time where certain things would or would not have existed, unless it's made as a documentary.\n\n''Project A'' marks the first time that veteran Michael Lai used orchestral music for a film score, instead of using library music, or lifting the score from other films.\n\nIn rehearsal for the clock tower fall inspired by ''[[Safety Last!]]'', Chan took a week to build the courage to drop from such a great height.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} During the shooting of the bicycle chase sequence, one of the stuntmen informed Chan that ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' was playing at the local cinema. Chan halted filming to watch the bicycle chase scene in the finale of ''E.T.'', to ensure that his scene and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s scene were not the same. After watching the film, Chan became more confident, realizing that the audience doesn't really care so much about such minor details, only in watching the film and having a good time.

The film co-stars [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]. The film was released on December 22, 1983.\n\nSet in the 19th century in [[History of Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|old Hong Kong]], ''Project A'' blends comedy moments and spectacular stunts, including set-pieces reminiscent of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]]. One stunt in particular involved Chan hanging and falling from the hand of a clock tower some 60 feet high, tearing through awning canopies before hitting the ground head-first. It was inspired by Lloyd's famous clock-tower stunt from the 1923 film ''[[Safety Last!]]''; while Lloyd only hanged from the tower, Chan took it a step further and actually fell from the tower.\n\nThe film was a box office success in [[East Asia]]. At the [[4th Hong Kong Film Awards]], Chan received two nominations for the film (and another for ''[[Wheels on Meals]]''), including his first [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] nomination, and won his first [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography|Best Action Choreography]] award. A sequel, ''[[Project A Part II]]'', was released in 1987.\n\n==Plot==\nSergeant Dragon Ma ([[Jackie Chan]]) is part of the [[Hong Kong Marine Police's]] effort to suppress the [[pirates]], who have been raiding ships for months. Members of the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] and the [[MP]], who have strong [[interservice rivalries]], get into a fight in a bar. Shortly after this, Captain Chi ([[Kwan Hoi-san]]) releases all of the sailors to their commanding officer, and two of the [[MP's]] ships get blown up.\n\nGangsters Chiang and Mr. Chou meet at a VIP Club, and discuss fleeing to [[Vietnam]]. As soon as Chiang leaves, he meets one of the pirates and they laugh about sabotaging the Marine Police ships. In the course of the conversation, the pirate tells him that his boss, San-po ([[Dick Wei]]), wants 100 police rifles.\n\nAs they do not have enough ships, Dragon Ma and his squad are forced to become regular police officers. They have to undergo \"hard training\" with the police, under Captain Chi's nephew, Hong Tin-tsu ([[Yuen Biao]]). After the police learn that Chiang is at the VIP Club, and that the guests there are not to be disturbed, Dragon and Tin-tsu go to arrest Chiang, but a big fight breaks out. After tiring of the blatant corruption in the police force, Dragon drags Chiang out and tells Tin-tsu to take the credit. That is his last official act as an officer with the Hong Kong police.\n\nFei ([[Sammo Hung]]) finds Dragon in the street. They have a conversation, in which Fei reveals that someone from within the police force is selling rifles. Fei tells Dragon that all he wants are the guns, and Dragon can catch the traitor. At night, Dragon and Fei interrupt a gun deal between the Army and the police Captain. After pushing everyone into the water and making off with the guns, Fei hides the rifles inside a log and marks it with a red flag. He later tries to sell the guns to the gangsters and pirates, but Dragon has intervened by removing the red flag and putting flags on other logs.\n\nAfter thwarting Fei's plan to sell the rifles to the pirates, Dragon has a conversation with the Admiral's daughter, Winnie. He learns that the Captain wasn't [[smuggling]] rifles for San-po, he was buying the rifles from the army to arm his men. On overhearing this, Fei gets into an argument with Dragon. The gangsters come after Fei, so he tells them that Dragon is to blame for the missing rifles. Dragon is forced to flee with Winnie. After teaming up with Fei, being tortured for information about the rifles, and falling from the face of a clock tower, the police track Dragon down for a third time, and help him get away as they arrest the gangsters.\n\nAs the pirates have lost the rifles they held everyone on board a ship hostage, including a Rear Admiral. The Colonel has a conversation with Mr. Chou, which Dragon overhears. Mr. Chou proposes an arms-for-hostages deal. He tells the Colonel that this will \"greatly expedite matters,\" and the Colonel consents. After Mr. Chou leaves, Dragon confronts the Colonel and convinces him that the gangsters and the pirates will never fear the law if the police force are corrupt. After it is agreed that Dragon will assume all responsibility for the mission to save the hostages, the Colonel allows the Marine Police to be brought back into full force.\n\nMr. Chou is brought in by the police and beaten until he tells Dragon and Tin-tsu how to get to San-po.

In contrast, ''Project A'' was huge success at the Hong Kong box office, earning [[HK$]]19,323,824<ref>{{cite web | title = Project A| work = Database entry| publisher = HKMDb| url = http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=6542&display_set=eng| accessdate = 2009-02-11 }}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:19.323824/7.265 round 1}} million}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1983&locations=HK&start=1982 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1983 |accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nIt was also very well received abroad, and particularly throughout [[East Asia]].

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event, is caught in a [[time loop]], repeatedly reliving the same day. [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Chris Elliott]] co-star.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was a modest success on release and garnered generally positive reviews. It later attracted critical acclaim and is often included in lists of the best comedy films. The term \"groundhog day\" is now commonly used in the English language to describe a recurring situation. In 2006, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Films Added to National Film Registry for 2006 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-234.html |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref> [[Groundhog Day (musical)|A stage musical adaptation]] premiered in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February 1st, weatherman Phil Connors reassures [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. He goes with news producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], to cover the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities, which he has done for several years. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there.\n\nThe next day, February 2nd, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney [[bed and breakfast]] to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" on the clock radio. He tapes a half-hearted report on [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh. The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.\n\nPhil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is again February 2nd when he wakes - he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge eating and drinking, one-night stands, robbery, and reckless driving. After spending several loops trying and failing to court Rita, he becomes depressed and desperate for a solution to end the loop. He tries numerous times to commit suicide, including going so far as to kidnap Punxsutawney Phil and drive off a cliff with him, but he continuously wakes up to \"I Got You Babe\" on the radio.\n\nPhil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathizes, and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to save a homeless man, who dies regardless of his actions.\n\nDuring one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, and Phil impresses her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter is different; it is now February 3rd, he has escaped the time loop.

With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif found its \"deeper purpose\" within the new script.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin first conceived of the dating aspect for the film, \"being able to use your superior knowledge to pick up women\", which led to the film leaning more to the comedy side.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when he looked at his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but one with little fanfare, and a date on which the film could be played annually, similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and \"rules\" for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin started to shop the screenplay to around 50 producers. While many studios expressed interest, they told him they would not be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a [[Spec script|spec agent]] to help sell the script more. The script got to the hands of Richard Lovett in the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who was able to get it to Harold Ramis around 1991, leading to Ramis offering to produce the film.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/>\n\n===Writing and casting===\nIn the first draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to have to explain to the audience how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start ''[[in medias res]]'', with Phil already in the midst of the looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to \"I Got You Babe\" where he is already aware of what will be happening, and thus provoking the audience's curiosity; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rita would also confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own.<ref name=\"Mentalfloss\">{{cite web|last1=Cormier|first1=Roger|title=16 Repeatable Facts About 'Groundhog Day'|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70147/16-repeatable-facts-about-groundhog-day|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> Rubin considered this draft to be more in line with the black comedy ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'', particularly with regards to how Phil's suicides were presented.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>\n\nWhile Ramis wanted to keep this approach, the studio applied pressure to use a more standard narrative structure, forcing Rubin to rewrite the script under Ramis's direction.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> A major change was to restructure the film as a standard three-act piece.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\">{{cite web | url = http://uproxx.com/movies/the-story-behind-bill-murray-and-harold-ramis-21-year-rift/ | title = The Story Behind Bill Murray And Harold Ramis's 21 Year Rift | first = Dariel | last = Figueroa | date = September 21, 2014 | accessdate = February 25, 2017 | work = [[Uproxx]] }}</ref> This second draft of the screenplay established the reason for Phil being put in a time loop, according to actor [[Eddie Deezen]].

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event, is caught in a [[time loop]], repeatedly reliving the same day. [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Chris Elliott]] co-star.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was a modest success on release and garnered generally positive reviews. It later attracted critical acclaim and is often included in lists of the best comedy films. The term \"groundhog day\" is now commonly used in the English language to describe a recurring situation. In 2006, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Films Added to National Film Registry for 2006 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-234.html |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref> [[Groundhog Day (musical)|A stage musical adaptation]] premiered in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February 1st, weatherman Phil Connors reassures [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. He goes with news producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], to cover the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities, which he has done for several years. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there.\n\nThe next day, February 2nd, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney [[bed and breakfast]] to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" on the clock radio. He tapes a half-hearted report on [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh. The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.\n\nPhil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is again February 2nd when he wakes - he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge eating and drinking, one-night stands, robbery, and reckless driving. After spending several loops trying and failing to court Rita, he becomes depressed and desperate for a solution to end the loop. He tries numerous times to commit suicide, including going so far as to kidnap Punxsutawney Phil and drive off a cliff with him, but he continuously wakes up to \"I Got You Babe\" on the radio.\n\nPhil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathizes, and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to save a homeless man, who dies regardless of his actions.\n\nDuring one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, and Phil impresses her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter is different; it is now February 3rd, he has escaped the time loop. He tells Rita he wants to live together with her in Punxsutawney.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Andiegroundhog.png|thumb|Andie MacDowell with a groundhog, 2008]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Rita Hanson\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Larry the cameraman\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Ned Ryerson\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Buster Green\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Mrs. Lancaster\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Gus\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Ralph\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Doris the waitress\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Nancy Taylor\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Neurologist\n* [[Richard Henzel]] as D.J. #1\n* Rob Riley as D.J. #2\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Debbie the bride\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Fred the groom\n* Rod Sell as Groundhog official\n* [[Ken Hudson Campbell]] as Man in the hallway\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Concept===\nDanny Rubin had completed and sold his script for ''[[Hear No Evil (1993 film)|Hear No Evil]]'' and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to become a professional screenwriter around 1990.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/07/how-i-wrote-the-script-for-groundhog-day-in-less-than-a-week/ | title = How I wrote the script for Groundhog Day in less than a week | first = Danny | last = Rubin | date = August 7, 2016 | accessdate = February 27, 2017 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] }}</ref> His agent suggested that he prepare a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He came up with the core idea of the script which would become ''Groundhog Day'' while sitting in a movie theater.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He asked himself the question \"If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?\"<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\">{{Cite web | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-danny-rubin | title = Big Think Interview With Danny Rubin | first=  Paul | last = Hoffman | date = May 10, 2010 | accessdate = February 24, 2017 | work = [[Big Think]] }}</ref> Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif found its \"deeper purpose\" within the new script.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin first conceived of the dating aspect for the film, \"being able to use your superior knowledge to pick up women\", which led to the film leaning more to the comedy side.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when he looked at his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but one with little fanfare, and a date on which the film could be played annually, similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and \"rules\" for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin started to shop the screenplay to around 50 producers. While many studios expressed interest, they told him they would not be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a [[Spec script|spec agent]] to help sell the script more. The script got to the hands of Richard Lovett in the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who was able to get it to Harold Ramis around 1991, leading to Ramis offering to produce the film.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/>\n\n===Writing and casting===\nIn the first draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to have to explain to the audience how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start ''[[in medias res]]'', with Phil already in the midst of the looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to \"I Got You Babe\" where he is already aware of what will be happening, and thus provoking the audience's curiosity; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rita would also confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own.<ref name=\"Mentalfloss\">{{cite web|last1=Cormier|first1=Roger|title=16 Repeatable Facts About 'Groundhog Day'|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70147/16-repeatable-facts-about-groundhog-day|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> Rubin considered this draft to be more in line with the black comedy ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'', particularly with regards to how Phil's suicides were presented.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>\n\nWhile Ramis wanted to keep this approach, the studio applied pressure to use a more standard narrative structure, forcing Rubin to rewrite the script under Ramis's direction.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> A major change was to restructure the film as a standard three-act piece.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\">{{cite web | url = http://uproxx.com/movies/the-story-behind-bill-murray-and-harold-ramis-21-year-rift/ | title = The Story Behind Bill Murray And Harold Ramis's 21 Year Rift | first = Dariel | last = Figueroa | date = September 21, 2014 | accessdate = February 25, 2017 | work = [[Uproxx]] }}</ref> This second draft of the screenplay established the reason for Phil being put in a time loop, according to actor [[Eddie Deezen]].
