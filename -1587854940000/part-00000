The second Congress of the high Altai was called in March 1918 and officially created this government. The government was founded by Altai painter [[Grigory Gurkin|Grigoriy Gurkin]] and by Russian writer and publicist Vasily Anuchin. The government was not a fully independent entity but rather an administrative entity with some autonomy, although it was relatively independent in reality due to the chaos of the [[Russian Civil War]].
