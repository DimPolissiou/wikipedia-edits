The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

Jorga\n\n==ITKF Manifest==\n'''Traditional (Dento) Karate-Do characteristics'''\n\nThe martial art of Karate-Do has its roots in Okinawa and has been further established in Japan. \nKarate-Do includes the three main practice characteristics of Kihon, Kata and Shi-Ai with a clear envelope of BuDo principles maintained around any practice always keeping rai-gi (warrior conduct and manners) of dojo behavior including neat and clean uniform with a custom rank belt, polite speech, quiet and respect among all students yet emphasized toward their teachers according to seniority and rank. All ITKF-organized events are conducted according to the above BuDo code - we all train in a Dojo and not in a sports center, keeping dojo atmosphere and proper conduct, our teachers are referred to as Sensei rather than the instructor or coach.\n\n'''Umbrella organization for all Traditional Karate styles'''\n \nThe ITKF was formed to accommodate and serve as an international umbrella organization for all traditional karate styles under the following assumptions and concepts:\n1. All original Karate-Do styles share common basic principles in terms of efficient human body use, timing and    strategy as well as BuDo mental principles and conduct. \n2. These common principles are well reflected and demonstrated in the ITKF coaches\u2019 manual and competition rule    book. \n3. The ITKF welcomes the diversity among styles and considers those \u201cstyle-differences\u201d as an opportunity for the    exchange of knowledge and mutual enrichment of all ITKF members.  \n\n'''ITKF competition concept'''\n\nThe concept of competition in traditional karate, as expressed in the ITKF competition rule book, is based on the ancient BuDo concept of Shi-Ai, which means \u201ctesting each other\u201d for the purpose of guiding future development rather than simply for the purpose of winning. While competition is \ndefinitely not Traditional Karate\u2019s essence or goal, we recognize the value and contribution that competitions can provide as one more form of training as long as such competitions are based on traditional karate principles as manifested in the judging rules, event atmosphere and the proper\n\u201cBuDo conduct\u201d of all participants. Unlike other sports Traditional Karate is not defined by its competition rules rather it is those core principles of the art that serve to define the competition rules.   \n\n'''\u201cBuDo for Life\u201d and the \u201cITKF open University\u201d'''\n\nThe ITKF considers Traditional Karate\u2019s centuries-long accumulated knowledge, wisdom and\nexperience as \u201ctools for life\u201d that are of much value in human life beyond the well-known self-defense context. Through its global presence, accumulated experience and world experts the ITKF leverages this \nTraditional Karate treasure of knowledge to globally promote next generation education, harmony \namong people to create a better society and enabling individuals to lead a meaningful life.\nImplementing the \u201cITKF open University\u201d the ITKF merges and enhances \u201cold wisdom\u201d with \ncontemporary academic and scientific studies and research. \n\n==2019 World Championship==\n[[File:2019 World champ.jpg|300px|thumb|2019 World Championship]]\n[[File:ITKF 2019 World championship.jpg|thumb|World Championship Judges]]\nThe 20th '''ITKF World Traditional Karate Championship''' and the 5th ITKF World Traditional Karate Interclubs Cup were held from 2 to 8 December 2019 in Curitiba - PR Brazil, bringing together representatives from 31 countries in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia.

During the 1930s and much of the 1940s, that detective-hero was possibly the best known American fictional detective.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjgE_CRiIW4C&pg=PA161&dq=%22ellery+queen%22&lr=&as_brr=3&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |title=Herbert, '&#39;Who's Who in Crime'&#39;, p.161 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> Movies, radio shows, and television shows were based on Dannay and Lee's works.\n\nFrederic Dannay, without much involvement from Lee, was founding and directing editor of ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'', a [[crime fiction]] magazine. They were also prominent historians in the field, editing numerous collections and anthologies of short stories such as ''The Misadventures of [[Sherlock Holmes]]''. Their 994-page anthology for the [[Modern Library]], ''101 Years' Entertainment: The Great Detective Stories, 1841\u20131941'', was a landmark work that remained in print for many years. Under their collective pseudonym, the cousins were given the Grand Master Award for achievements in the field of the mystery story by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] in 1961.\n\nThe fictional Ellery Queen was the hero of more than 30 novels and several short story collections, written by Dannay and Lee and published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. Dannay and Lee also wrote four novels about a detective named [[Drury Lane (character)|Drury Lane]] using the pseudonym '''Barnaby Ross'''. They allowed the [[Ellery Queen (house name)|Ellery Queen name]] to be used as a house name for a number of novels written by other authors from outlines provided by Dannay, most of them published in the 1960s as paperback originals and not featuring Ellery Queen as a character.\n\nDannay and Lee remained circumspect about their writing methods. Novelist and critic [[H. R. F. Keating|H.R.F. Keating]] wrote, \"How actually did they do it? Did they sit together and hammer the stuff out word by word? Did one write the dialogue and the other the narration? ...&nbsp;What eventually happened was that Fred Dannay, in principle, produced the plots, the clues, and what would have to be deduced from them as well as the outlines of the characters and Manfred Lee clothed it all in words. But it is unlikely to have been as clear cut as that.\"<ref name=\"KEAT\">Keating, H.R.F., ''The Bedside Companion to Crime''.  New York: Mysterious Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-89296-416-2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to critic [[Otto Penzler]], \"As an anthologist, Ellery Queen is without peer, his taste unequalled. As a bibliographer and a collector of the detective short story, Queen is, again, a historical personage. Indeed, Ellery Queen clearly is, after Poe, the most important American in mystery fiction.\"<ref>Penzler, Otto, ''et al.'' ''Detectionary''. Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press, 1977.  {{ISBN|0-87951-041-2}}</ref> British crime novelist [[Margery Allingham]] wrote that Ellery Queen had \"done far more for the detective story than any other two men put together\".\n\nAlthough Frederic Dannay outlived his cousin by eleven years, the Ellery Queen authorial name died with Manfred Lee. The last novel featuring the character Ellery Queen, ''A Fine and Private Place'', was published in 1971, the year of Lee's death. However, ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'', now published by [[Dell Magazines]], continues as a crime fiction magazine as of 2020, currently publishing six \"double issues\" per year.\n\n==Ellery Queen, the fictional character==\nEllery Queen was created in 1928 when Dannay and Lee entered a writing contest sponsored by ''[[McClure's]]'' magazine for the best first mystery novel. They decided to use as their collective pseudonym the same name that they had given their detective. Inspired by the formula and style of the [[Philo Vance]] novels by [[S. S. Van Dine|S.S. Van Dine ]], their entry won the contest, but before it could be published, the magazine closed. Undeterred, the cousins took their novel to other publishers, and ''The Roman Hat Mystery'' was published in 1929. According to H.R.F. Keating, \"Later the cousins took a sharper view of the Philo Vance character, Manfred Lee calling him, with typical vehemence, 'the biggest prig that ever came down the pike'.\"<ref name=\"KEAT\" />\n\n''The Roman Hat Mystery'' established a reliable template: a geographic formula title (''[[The Dutch Shoe Mystery]]'', ''The Egyptian Cross Mystery'', etc.); an unusual crime; a complex series of clues and [[red herring]]s; multiple misdirected solutions before the final truth is revealed, and a cast of supporting characters including Ellery's father, Inspector Richard Queen, and his irascible assistant, Sergeant Velie. What became the best known part of the early Ellery Queen books was the \"Challenge to the Reader.\" This was a single page near the end of the book declaring that the reader had seen all the same clues Ellery had, and that only one solution was possible. According to novelist/critic [[Julian Symons]], \"The rare distinction of the books is that this claim is accurate. There are problems in deduction that do really permit of only one answer, and there are few crime stories indeed of which this can be said.\"<ref name=\"SYM\">''Bloody Murder'', [[Julian Symons]], first published Faber and Faber 1972, with revisions in Penguin 1974, {{ISBN|0-14-003794-2}}</ref>\n\nThe fictional detective Ellery Queen is the author of the books in which he appears (''The Finishing Stroke'', 1958) and the editor of the magazine that bears his name (''The Player On The Other Side'', 1963). As Van Dine had done earlier with Philo Vance, the creators of the Queen character gave him an extremely elaborate back story that was rarely mentioned after the first few novels. In fact, Queen goes through several transformations in his personality and his approach to investigation over the course of the series. \n\nIn the earlier novels, Queen is a snobbish [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated intellectual of independent means who wears [[pince-nez]] glasses and investigates crimes because he finds them stimulating. He supposedly derived these characteristics from his mother, the daughter of an  [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] New York family, who had married Richard Queen, a bluff, man-in-the-street New York Irishman, and who died before the stories began. From 1938, Ellery spends some time working in [[Hollywood]] as a screenwriter (in ''The Four of Hearts'' and ''The Origin of Evil''), and solves cases with a Hollywood setting. At this point, he has a slick fa\u00e7ade, is part of Hollywood society and hobnobs comfortably with the wealthy and famous. Beginning with ''Calamity Town'' in 1942, Ellery becomes less of a cypher and more of a human being, often becoming emotionally affected by the people in his cases, and at one point quitting detective work altogether. ''Calamity Town'', two sequels, and some short stories are set in the imaginary town of Wrightsville, and subsidiary characters recur from story to story; Ellery relates to the various strata of American society as an outsider. However, after his Hollywood and Wrightsville periods, he is returned to his New York City roots for the remainder of his career, and is then seen again as an ultra-logical crime solver who remains distant from his cases. In the very late novels, he often seems a near-faceless, near-characterless persona whose role is purely to solve the mystery. So striking are the differences between the different periods of the Ellery Queen character that [[Julian Symons]] advanced the theory that there were two \"Ellery Queens\" \u2014 an older and younger brother.<ref>Julian Symons, ''The Great Detectives'', Harry N. Abrams, 1981</ref>\n\nEllery Queen is said to be married and the father of a child in the introductions to the first few novels, but this plot line is never developed and Ellery is mainly portrayed as a bachelor. The character of Nikki Porter, who acts as Ellery's secretary and is something of a love interest, was encountered first in the radio series. Nikki's curiosity and her attempts to encourage Ellery to work as a detective are responsible for a number of radio and film plots from the early 1940s. Her first appearance in a written story is in the final pages of ''There Was An Old Woman'' (1943), when a character with whom Ellery has had some flirtatious moments announces spontaneously that she's changing her name to Nikki Porter and going to work as Ellery's secretary. Nikki Porter appears sporadically thereafter in novels and stories, linking the character from radio and movies into the written canon. The character of Paula Paris, an [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] gossip columnist, is linked romantically with Ellery in one novel, ''The Four of Hearts,'' and in short stories during the Hollywood period, but does not appear in the radio series or films, and soon vanished from the books. Ellery is not given any serious romantic interests after Nikki Porter and Paula Paris disappear from the books. Late in the series, in the 1968 novel ''The House of Brass'', Inspector Queen remarries after decades as a widower.\n\nThe Queen household, an apartment in New York shared by the Queens father and son, also contains a houseboy named Djuna, at least in the earliest novels and short stories. This young man, who may be of [[Romani people|Roma]] origin, appears periodically in the canon, apparently ageless and family-free, in a supporting role as cook, receiver of parcels, valet, and as occasional minor comedy relief.  He is the principal character in some, not all, of the juvenile novels ghost-written by other writers under the pseudonym Ellery Queen, Jr.\n\n==Fictional style==\nThe Queen novels are examples of the classic \"fair play\" [[whodunit]] mystery, and are textbook examples of what became known as the [[Golden age of detective fiction]]. Because the reader obtains clues in the same way as the protagonist detective, the book becomes an intellectually challenging puzzle. Mystery writer [[John Dickson Carr]] termed it \"the grandest game in the world\".\n\nThe early Queen novels were characterized by intricately plotted clues and solutions. In ''[[The Greek Coffin Mystery]]'' ([[1932 in literature|1932]]), ''The Siamese Twin Mystery'', and others, multiple solutions to the mystery are proposed, a feature that also showed up in later books such as ''Double, Double'' and ''Ten Days' Wonder''. Queen's \"false solution, followed by the truth\" became a hallmark of the canon. Another stylistic element in many early books (notably ''The Dutch Shoe Mystery'', ''The French Powder Mystery'' and ''Halfway House'') is Ellery's method of creating a list of attributes (the murderer is male, the murderer smokes a pipe, etc.). Then, by comparing each suspect to these attributes, he reduces the list of suspects to a single name, often an unlikely one.<ref name=\"SS1\">{{cite web| last=Andrews|first=Dale| title=If It's Tuesday This Must Be Belgium| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2011/11/if-its-tuesday-this-must-be-belgium-or.html| publisher=SleuthSayers| date=2011-11-08| location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1930s, when Ellery Queen\u2014author and character\u2014moved to [[Hollywood]] to try movie scriptwriting, the tone of the novels began to change along with the detective's character. Romance was introduced, solutions began to involve more psychological elements, and the \"Challenge to the Reader\" vanished from the books. Some of the novels also moved from mere puzzles to more introspective themes. The three novels set in the fictional [[New England]] town of Wrightsville, starting with ''Calamity Town'' in 1942, even showed the limitations of Ellery's methods of detection. According to [[Julian Symons]], \"Ellery&nbsp;... occasionally lost his father, as his exploits took place more frequently in the small town of Wrightsville&nbsp;... where his arrival as a house guest was likely to be the signal for the commission of one or more murders. Very intelligently, Dannay and Lee used this change in locale to loosen the structure of their stories. More emphasis was placed on personal relationships, and less on the details of investigation.\"<ref name=\"SYM\" />\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the authors tried some more experimental work, especially in three novels written by other writers, all based on detailed outlines by Dannay. ''The Player on the Other Side'', ghost-written by [[Theodore Sturgeon]], delves more deeply into motive than most Ellery Queen novels. ''And on the Eighth Day'' (1964), ghost-written by [[Avram Davidson]], was a religious allegory touching on [[fascism]]. Davidson also wrote ''The Fourth Side of the Triangle''.<ref name=\"Hubin2\">''Crime Fiction, 1749-1980: A Comprehensive Bibliography'' by Allen J. Hubin, Garland, 1984, {{ISBN|0-8240-9219-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Queen Campus.jpg|thumb|During the 1960s, Dannay and Lee commissioned more than twenty-five crime thrillers from other writers to be published as paperback originals under the Ellery Queen pseudonym, an early example of the now common practice of \"franchising\" a well-known authorial name.]]\nToward the end of their careers, the cousins allowed some crime novels, mainly paperback originals, to be written by ghostwriters as part of the Ellery Queen franchise. These books did not feature the character Ellery Queen as the protagonist. They included three novels featuring \"the governor's troubleshooter\", Micah \"Mike\" McCall, and six featuring Captain Tim Corrigan, of the [[NYPD|NYPD's]] Main Office Squad. The prominent science-fiction writer [[Jack Vance]] wrote three of these original paperbacks, including the [[locked room mystery]] ''A Room to Die In''.\n\nThere are also several collections of Ellery Queen short stories. These were praised by [[Julian Symons]] as follows \"in some ways the short story is better suited than the novel to this kind of writing... This is notable especially in the case of Ellery Queen. The best of his short stories belong to the early intensely ratiocinative period, and both ''The Adventures of Ellery Queen'' (1934) and ''The New Adventures'' (1940) are as absolutely fair and totally puzzling as the most passionate devotee of orthodoxy could wish... (E)very story in these books is composed with wonderful skill.\"<ref name=\"SYM\" />\n\n==Novels as Barnaby Ross==\nBeginning in 1932, the cousins wrote four novels using the pseudonym Barnaby Ross about Drury Lane, a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor who had retired from the stage due to deafness and was consulted as an amateur detective. The novels also featured Inspector Thumm (at first of the New York police, then later a private investigator) and his crime-solving daughter Patience. The Drury Lane novels are in the whodunit style. ''The Tragedy of X'' and ''The Tragedy of Y'' are variations on the [[locked-room mystery]] format.  ''The Tragedy of Y'' bears some resemblance to the later Ellery Queen novel ''There Was an Old Woman'': both are about eccentric families headed by a matriarch.\n\nIn the early 1930s, before Dannay and Lee's identity as the authors had been made public, \"Ellery Queen\" and \"Barnaby Ross\" staged a series of public debates in which one cousin impersonated Queen and the other impersonated Ross, both of them wearing masks to preserve their anonymity. According to H.R.F. Keating, \"People said Ross must be the wit and critic [[Alexander Woollcott]] and Queen S.S. Van Dine..., creator of the super-snob detective Philo Vance, on whom 'Ellery Queen' was indeed modeled.\"<ref name=\"KEAT\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, the cousins allowed the Barnaby Ross name to be used as a pseudonym for the publication of a series of historical romance novels by Don Tracy.  From the 1940s, republications of the Drury Lane books were mostly under the Ellery Queen name.\n\nThe first Ellery Queen novel ''[[The Roman Hat Mystery]]'' refers to \"the now ancient Barnaby Ross murder case.\"<ref name=\"Clarke\">{{Cite book|title=Pseudonyms|author=Joseph F.

From 1961, Dannay and Lee also commissioned other authors to write crime thrillers under the Ellery Queen authorial name, but not featuring Ellery Queen as a character.\n\n'''Daniel Nathan''', professionally known as '''Frederic Dannay''' (b Brooklyn October 20, 1905&nbsp;\u2013 d New York September 3, 1982),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6823242|title=Find a Grave}}</ref> and '''Emanuel Benjamin Lepofsky''', professionally known as '''Manfred Bennington Lee''' (b Brooklyn January 11, 1905&nbsp;\u2013 d Roxbury, Connecticut April 3, 1971),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6816634|title=Find a Grave}}</ref> were American cousins from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  In addition to writing most of the novels and short stories featuring the brilliant amateur detective Ellery Queen, Dannay and Lee edited more than thirty anthologies of crime fiction and true crime, which were published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. Dannay was the founder and longtime editor of ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'', which has been published continuously from 1941 to the present.\n\nDannay and Lee wrote four mysteries under the pseudonym '''Barnaby Ross''', a name that they later allowed another author to use. Several juvenile novels were credited to '''Ellery Queen, Jr.'''\n\n==Career of Dannay and Lee==\n\n[[File:Ellery Queen NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Frederic Dannay (left), with EQMM contributor James Yaffe in 1943.]]\nIn a successful series of novels and short stories that covered 42 years, \"Ellery Queen\" served as a joint pseudonym for the cousins Dannay and Lee, as well as the name of the primary detective-hero they created. During the 1930s and much of the 1940s, that detective-hero was possibly the best known American fictional detective.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjgE_CRiIW4C&pg=PA161&dq=%22ellery+queen%22&lr=&as_brr=3&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |title=Herbert, '&#39;Who's Who in Crime'&#39;, p.161 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> Movies, radio shows, and television shows were based on Dannay and Lee's works.\n\nFrederic Dannay, without much involvement from Lee, was founding and directing editor of ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'', a [[crime fiction]] magazine. They were also prominent historians in the field, editing numerous collections and anthologies of short stories such as ''The Misadventures of [[Sherlock Holmes]]''. Their 994-page anthology for the [[Modern Library]], ''101 Years' Entertainment: The Great Detective Stories, 1841\u20131941'', was a landmark work that remained in print for many years. Under their collective pseudonym, the cousins were given the Grand Master Award for achievements in the field of the mystery story by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] in 1961.\n\nThe fictional Ellery Queen was the hero of more than 30 novels and several short story collections, written by Dannay and Lee and published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. Dannay and Lee also wrote four novels about a detective named [[Drury Lane (character)|Drury Lane]] using the pseudonym '''Barnaby Ross'''. They allowed the [[Ellery Queen (house name)|Ellery Queen name]] to be used as a house name for a number of novels written by other authors from outlines provided by Dannay, most of them published in the 1960s as paperback originals and not featuring Ellery Queen as a character.\n\nDannay and Lee remained circumspect about their writing methods. Novelist and critic [[H. R. F. Keating|H.R.F. Keating]] wrote, \"How actually did they do it? Did they sit together and hammer the stuff out word by word? Did one write the dialogue and the other the narration? ...&nbsp;What eventually happened was that Fred Dannay, in principle, produced the plots, the clues, and what would have to be deduced from them as well as the outlines of the characters and Manfred Lee clothed it all in words. But it is unlikely to have been as clear cut as that.\"<ref name=\"KEAT\">Keating, H.R.F., ''The Bedside Companion to Crime''.  New York: Mysterious Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-89296-416-2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to critic [[Otto Penzler]], \"As an anthologist, Ellery Queen is without peer, his taste unequalled. As a bibliographer and a collector of the detective short story, Queen is, again, a historical personage. Indeed, Ellery Queen clearly is, after Poe, the most important American in mystery fiction.\"<ref>Penzler, Otto, ''et al.'' ''Detectionary''. Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press, 1977.  {{ISBN|0-87951-041-2}}</ref> British crime novelist [[Margery Allingham]] wrote that Ellery Queen had \"done far more for the detective story than any other two men put together\".\n\nAlthough Frederic Dannay outlived his cousin by eleven years, the Ellery Queen authorial name died with Manfred Lee. The last novel featuring the character Ellery Queen, ''A Fine and Private Place'', was published in 1971, the year of Lee's death. However, ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'', now published by [[Dell Magazines]], continues as a crime fiction magazine as of 2018, currently publishing six \"double issues\" per year.\n\n==Ellery Queen, the fictional character==\nEllery Queen was created in 1928 when Dannay and Lee entered a writing contest sponsored by ''[[McClure's]]'' magazine for the best first mystery novel. They decided to use as their collective pseudonym the same name that they had given their detective. Inspired by the formula and style of the [[Philo Vance]] novels by [[S. S. Van Dine|S.S. Van Dine ]], their entry won the contest, but before it could be published, the magazine closed. Undeterred, the cousins took their novel to other publishers, and ''The Roman Hat Mystery'' was published in 1929. According to H.R.F. Keating, \"Later the cousins took a sharper view of the Philo Vance character, Manfred Lee calling him, with typical vehemence, 'the biggest prig that ever came down the pike'.\"<ref name=\"KEAT\" />\n\n''The Roman Hat Mystery'' established a reliable template: a geographic formula title (''[[The Dutch Shoe Mystery]]'', ''The Egyptian Cross Mystery'', etc.); an unusual crime; a complex series of clues and [[red herring]]s; multiple misdirected solutions before the final truth is revealed, and a cast of supporting characters including Ellery's father, Inspector Richard Queen, and his irascible assistant, Sergeant Velie. What became the best known part of the early Ellery Queen books was the \"Challenge to the Reader.\" This was a single page near the end of the book declaring that the reader had seen all the same clues Ellery had, and that only one solution was possible. According to novelist/critic [[Julian Symons]], \"The rare distinction of the books is that this claim is accurate. There are problems in deduction that do really permit of only one answer, and there are few crime stories indeed of which this can be said.\"<ref name=\"SYM\">''Bloody Murder'', [[Julian Symons]], first published Faber and Faber 1972, with revisions in Penguin 1974, {{ISBN|0-14-003794-2}}</ref>\n\nThe fictional detective Ellery Queen is the author of the books in which he appears (''The Finishing Stroke'', 1958) and the editor of the magazine that bears his name (''The Player On The Other Side'', 1963). As Van Dine had done earlier with Philo Vance, the creators of the Queen character gave him an extremely elaborate back story that was rarely mentioned after the first few novels. In fact, Queen goes through several transformations in his personality and his approach to investigation over the course of the series. \n\nIn the earlier novels, Queen is a snobbish [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated intellectual of independent means who wears [[pince-nez]] glasses and investigates crimes because he finds them stimulating. He supposedly derived these characteristics from his mother, the daughter of an  [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] New York family, who had married Richard Queen, a bluff, man-in-the-street New York Irishman, and who died before the stories began. From 1938, Ellery spends some time working in [[Hollywood]] as a screenwriter (in ''The Four of Hearts'' and ''The Origin of Evil''), and solves cases with a Hollywood setting. At this point, he has a slick fa\u00e7ade, is part of Hollywood society and hobnobs comfortably with the wealthy and famous. Beginning with ''Calamity Town'' in 1942, Ellery becomes less of a cypher and more of a human being, often becoming emotionally affected by the people in his cases, and at one point quitting detective work altogether. ''Calamity Town'', two sequels, and some short stories are set in the imaginary town of Wrightsville, and subsidiary characters recur from story to story; Ellery relates to the various strata of American society as an outsider. However, after his Hollywood and Wrightsville periods, he is returned to his New York City roots for the remainder of his career, and is then seen again as an ultra-logical crime solver who remains distant from his cases. In the very late novels, he often seems a near-faceless, near-characterless persona whose role is purely to solve the mystery. So striking are the differences between the different periods of the Ellery Queen character that [[Julian Symons]] advanced the theory that there were two \"Ellery Queens\" \u2014 an older and younger brother.<ref>Julian Symons, ''The Great Detectives'', Harry N. Abrams, 1981</ref>\n\nEllery Queen is said to be married and the father of a child in the introductions to the first few novels, but this plot line is never developed and Ellery is mainly portrayed as a bachelor. The character of Nikki Porter, who acts as Ellery's secretary and is something of a love interest, was encountered first in the radio series. Nikki's curiosity and her attempts to encourage Ellery to work as a detective are responsible for a number of radio and film plots from the early 1940s. Her first appearance in a written story is in the final pages of ''There Was An Old Woman'' (1943), when a character with whom Ellery has had some flirtatious moments announces spontaneously that she's changing her name to Nikki Porter and going to work as Ellery's secretary. Nikki Porter appears sporadically thereafter in novels and stories, linking the character from radio and movies into the written canon. The character of Paula Paris, an [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] gossip columnist, is linked romantically with Ellery in one novel, ''The Four of Hearts,'' and in short stories during the Hollywood period, but does not appear in the radio series or films, and soon vanished from the books. Ellery is not given any serious romantic interests after Nikki Porter and Paula Paris disappear from the books. Late in the series, in the 1968 novel ''The House of Brass'', Inspector Queen remarries after decades as a widower.\n\nThe Queen household, an apartment in New York shared by the Queens father and son, also contains a houseboy named Djuna, at least in the earliest novels and short stories. This young man, who may be of [[Romani people|Roma]] origin, appears periodically in the canon, apparently ageless and family-free, in a supporting role as cook, receiver of parcels, valet, and as occasional minor comedy relief.  He is the principal character in some, not all, of the juvenile novels ghost-written by other writers under the pseudonym Ellery Queen, Jr.\n\n==Fictional style==\nThe Queen novels are examples of the classic \"fair play\" [[whodunit]] mystery, and are textbook examples of what became known as the [[Golden age of detective fiction]]. Because the reader obtains clues in the same way as the protagonist detective, the book becomes an intellectually challenging puzzle. Mystery writer [[John Dickson Carr]] termed it \"the grandest game in the world\".\n\nThe early Queen novels were characterized by intricately plotted clues and solutions. In ''[[The Greek Coffin Mystery]]'' ([[1932 in literature|1932]]), ''The Siamese Twin Mystery'', and others, multiple solutions to the mystery are proposed, a feature that also showed up in later books such as ''Double, Double'' and ''Ten Days' Wonder''. Queen's \"false solution, followed by the truth\" became a hallmark of the canon. Another stylistic element in many early books (notably ''The Dutch Shoe Mystery'', ''The French Powder Mystery'' and ''Halfway House'') is Ellery's method of creating a list of attributes (the murderer is male, the murderer smokes a pipe, etc.). Then, by comparing each suspect to these attributes, he reduces the list of suspects to a single name, often an unlikely one.<ref name=\"SS1\">{{cite web| last=Andrews|first=Dale| title=If It's Tuesday This Must Be Belgium| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2011/11/if-its-tuesday-this-must-be-belgium-or.html| publisher=SleuthSayers| date=2011-11-08| location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1930s, when Ellery Queen\u2014author and character\u2014moved to [[Hollywood]] to try movie scriptwriting, the tone of the novels began to change along with the detective's character. Romance was introduced, solutions began to involve more psychological elements, and the \"Challenge to the Reader\" vanished from the books. Some of the novels also moved from mere puzzles to more introspective themes. The three novels set in the fictional [[New England]] town of Wrightsville, starting with ''Calamity Town'' in 1942, even showed the limitations of Ellery's methods of detection. According to [[Julian Symons]], \"Ellery&nbsp;... occasionally lost his father, as his exploits took place more frequently in the small town of Wrightsville&nbsp;... where his arrival as a house guest was likely to be the signal for the commission of one or more murders. Very intelligently, Dannay and Lee used this change in locale to loosen the structure of their stories. More emphasis was placed on personal relationships, and less on the details of investigation.\"<ref name=\"SYM\" />\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the authors tried some more experimental work, especially in three novels written by other writers, all based on detailed outlines by Dannay. ''The Player on the Other Side'', ghost-written by [[Theodore Sturgeon]], delves more deeply into motive than most Ellery Queen novels. ''And on the Eighth Day'' (1964), ghost-written by [[Avram Davidson]], was a religious allegory touching on [[fascism]]. Davidson also wrote ''The Fourth Side of the Triangle''.<ref name=\"Hubin2\">''Crime Fiction, 1749-1980: A Comprehensive Bibliography'' by Allen J. Hubin, Garland, 1984, {{ISBN|0-8240-9219-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Queen Campus.jpg|thumb|During the 1960s, Dannay and Lee commissioned more than twenty-five crime thrillers from other writers to be published as paperback originals under the Ellery Queen pseudonym, an early example of the now common practice of \"franchising\" a well-known authorial name.]]\nToward the end of their careers, the cousins allowed some crime novels, mainly paperback originals, to be written by ghostwriters as part of the Ellery Queen franchise. These books did not feature the character Ellery Queen as the protagonist. They included three novels featuring \"the governor's troubleshooter\", Micah \"Mike\" McCall, and six featuring Captain Tim Corrigan, of the [[NYPD|NYPD's]] Main Office Squad. The prominent science-fiction writer [[Jack Vance]] wrote three of these original paperbacks, including the [[locked room mystery]] ''A Room to Die In''.\n\nThere are also several collections of Ellery Queen short stories. These were praised by [[Julian Symons]] as follows \"in some ways the short story is better suited than the novel to this kind of writing... This is notable especially in the case of Ellery Queen. The best of his short stories belong to the early intensely ratiocinative period, and both ''The Adventures of Ellery Queen'' (1934) and ''The New Adventures'' (1940) are as absolutely fair and totally puzzling as the most passionate devotee of orthodoxy could wish... (E)very story in these books is composed with wonderful skill.\"<ref name=\"SYM\" />\n\n==Novels as Barnaby Ross==\nBeginning in 1932, the cousins wrote four novels using the pseudonym Barnaby Ross about Drury Lane, a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor who had retired from the stage due to deafness and was consulted as an amateur detective. The novels also featured Inspector Thumm (at first of the New York police, then later a private investigator) and his crime-solving daughter Patience. The Drury Lane novels are in the whodunit style. ''The Tragedy of X'' and ''The Tragedy of Y'' are variations on the [[locked-room mystery]] format.  ''The Tragedy of Y'' bears some resemblance to the later Ellery Queen novel ''There Was an Old Woman'': both are about eccentric families headed by a matriarch.\n\nIn the early 1930s, before Dannay and Lee's identity as the authors had been made public, \"Ellery Queen\" and \"Barnaby Ross\" staged a series of public debates in which one cousin impersonated Queen and the other impersonated Ross, both of them wearing masks to preserve their anonymity. According to H.R.F. Keating, \"People said Ross must be the wit and critic [[Alexander Woollcott]] and Queen S.S. Van Dine..., creator of the super-snob detective Philo Vance, on whom 'Ellery Queen' was indeed modeled.\"<ref name=\"KEAT\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, the cousins allowed the Barnaby Ross name to be used as a pseudonym for the publication of a series of historical romance novels by Don Tracy.  From the 1940s, republications of the Drury Lane books were mostly under the Ellery Queen name.\n\nThe first Ellery Queen novel ''[[The Roman Hat Mystery]]'' refers to \"the now ancient Barnaby Ross murder case.\"<ref name=\"Clarke\">{{Cite book|title=Pseudonyms|author=Joseph F.

Following an early career as a singer/songwriter in The Gremlins (1965\u20131968) he founded [[Mandrill Studios|Mandrill Recording Studios]] in Auckland in 1975, and produced and engineered hundreds of New Zealand songs in the late seventies, eighties and early nineties.<ref name=\"audioculture\">{{cite web | url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/glyn-tucker | title=Glyn Tucker Profile | work=Audio Culture | date=4 May 2015 | accessdate=16 March 2016 | author=Cammick, Murray}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn in [[Wellington]], New Zealand on 23 July 1943,<ref name=\"audioculture\" /> he was named after his father's brother Glyn, who was embarking that same day with the New Zealand armed forces to fight in the Italian campaign against Mussolini and Hitler.  The family would call them Big Glyn and Little Glyn. Later in life the elder Glyn would achieve celebrity status as a New Zealand television personality,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/glyn-tucker | title=Glyn Tucker | work=NZ On Screen | accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref> so Little Glyn became known as Glyn Tucker Jnr during the 1970-80s. He was to become an important and respected pioneer of the New Zealand recording community.<ref name=\"audioculture\"/>\n\nHaving learned some elementary piano and violin as a child, Tucker threw that all away when, as a young teenager he was \u201cfloored\u201d by the sound of rock 'n' roll. He was inspired by [[Buddy Holly]] to be a singer/songwriter.<ref name=\"audioculture\" />\n\n==Career==\nBy 1960, aged 17, Tucker recorded a version of Chuck Berry's \u201cCarol\u201d at Auckland's [[Stebbing Studios|Stebbings Recording Studio]] for the Zodiac Label.  It had one of his first compositions on the flipside.  He then joined new band \u201cThe Embers\" and worked at the popular teen club The Shirallee.  Bandmates were [[Gary Daverne]], Mike Kelly, Keith Graham and Johnny Willets.\n\nAfter a four-year stint as compere/singer at a suburban dance-hall Tucker put together a band to reflect the new beat sound coming out of Britain. During this period he adopted a stage name of Glyn Conway which he kept with his new band The Gremlins.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzmusician.co.nz/index.php/ps_pagename/article/pi_articleid/2867 | title=Moments Like These - Glyn Tucker Jnr | work=NZ Musician | accessdate=16 March 2016 | author=Reekie, Trevor | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012501/http://www.nzmusician.co.nz/index.php/ps_pagename/article/pi_articleid/2867 | archive-date=5 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"gremlins\">{{cite web | url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/the-gremlins | title=The Gremlins Profile | work=Audio Culture | date=10 May 2013 | accessdate=16 March 2016 | author=Gillanders, Grant}}</ref> They had a hit with their first record released on Gary Daverne's Viscount label in 1966; \u201cThe Coming Generation\u201d made it to #2 on the NZ Top 20 (the #1 was [[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]] by [[The Beatles]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=NZ%20listener%20charts&qyear=1966&qmonth=Sep&qweek=30-Sep-1966#n_view_location | title=1966 Listener Charts | work=Flavour of New Zealand | accessdate=16 March 2016 | author=Kohler, Steve}}</ref>\n\nThe Gremlins were voted as a finalist in the [[Loxene Gold Disc]] Awards with that recording in 1966 and again in 1967 with Tucker's composition, \u201cBlast Off 1970\u201d.<ref name=\"gremlins\" /> They toured New Zealand on the \u201cLoxene Gold Disc Spectacular\u201d with other finalists, [[Mr Lee Grant]], [[Larry's Rebels]], Ray Woolf, Sandy Edmonds, [[The Avengers (New Zealand band)|The Avengers]] and Herma Keil.

Tucker became a major influence on the New Zealand music scene encouraging and developing  scores of bands and singers, producing many hits on his labels Mandrill and later Reaction.  Some of the acts he signed and/or produced were, Alistair Riddell, [[Citizen Band (music band)|Citizen Band]], Rick Steele, Midge Marsden Connection, [[The Human Instinct|Human Instinct]], [[The Crocodiles]], [[The Mockers]], Danse Macabre, Car Crash Set, Paul Agar, Marginal Era, Blond Comedy, National Anthem, Gotham City Express, [[Knightshade]], Wayne Roland Brown, Everything That Flies, Mark Loveys [[Satellite Spies]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Billy T James]], The Hi Marks, [[Suzanne Prentice]], [[Howard Morrison]] and others.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.discogs.com/label/86187-Mandrill | title=Mandrill | work=Discogs | accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nJanuary 1979, Mandrill Studios had a visit from the legendary American record producer [[Kim Fowley]].  Tucker introduced him to Street Talk, one of Auckland's premier blues-rock bands and that began a series of recordings with Street Talk and later with Tucker producing [[The Crocodiles]]. It was the beginning of a long-term relationship; trading music ideas and talent with Kim and then [[peermusic|Peer-Southern Music Publishing]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/scenes/kim-fowley-stranded-in-paradise | title=Kim Fowley Stranded in Paradise | work=AudioCulture | date=11 March 2015 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Cammick, Murray}}</ref>\n\nTucker also set up Mandrill Music Publishing to administer many of the above listed recordings. He and Mandrill Music were major contributors the recording of the music for the [[1990 Commonwealth Games]] commemorative CD including the main theme song \u201cThis is The Moment\u201d, and the performance of \"Tukua Ahau\" by Sir Howard Morrison.\n\nTucker eventually bought out his partners in Mandrill Recording Studios Ltd, who had done their share towards its ultimate success. But it was Tucker who had everything on the line and had the drive to ensure survival. Dave Hurley, Gary Daverne, Mike Emerson, and [[Bruce Lynch]] were these contributors. The studio was sold in 1995, ending an era.\n\nDuring his twenty-one years operating Mandrill Recording Studios, Tucker wrote and produced hundreds of \u201cjingles\u201d for advertisers, mainly for TV and radio. Many of these were in partnership with singer-songwriter, Steve Allen. He was awarded the prestigious Axis Award from the Advertising Institute of NZ in 1987 for craft excellence, and in 1992 he received the International Mobius Award on behalf of Mandrill Studios for their work on a radio commercial for Castle Parcels.\n\nTucker became a member of [[Australasian Performing Right Association|APRA]] in 1960 when his first song was recorded, on the flipside of \u201cCarol\u201d, and in 1980 he became a Writer Full Member.<ref name=\"tuckers take\"/>\n\nHe became actively involved with the NZ recording industry, sitting on the board of the NZ Composers Foundation from 1985 to 1995.<ref name=\"tuckers take\"/> The foundation was funded by APRA to assist new musical talent in all genres, and Tucker was a strong lobbyist in supporting music producers and musicians to travel and attend MIDEM music trade festival in Cannes. This became an annual grant. The members of the board were:\n\n* Ashley Heenan (chairman)\n* Professor [[John Ritchie (composer)|John Ritchie]] - Christchurch University\n* Professor John Rimmer - Auckland University\n* Professor [[David Farquhar]] - Wellington University\n* Tony Baker - Musical Director, Light Entertainment, [[TVNZ]]\n* Glyn Tucker - record producer/publisher, Mandrill Studios\n\nTucker also sat on the NZ Music Promotions Committee (NZMPC), which was set up by RIANZ and representatives of independent and government broadcasters, to encourage more airplay for Kiwi recordings. He had regrets later that this initiative seemed to have been set up with a political agenda, to divert the Government from following Australia's lead in setting minimum quotas for NZ recordings on radio. Since the NZMPC's own monthly surveys in the mid-eighties averaged a mere 2-3% local content, it seemed to Tucker that Australia had got it right (and New Zealand had it horribly wrong).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nTucker retreated from the music industry for a few years to work on other business, but continued  to administer the publishing catalogue. He has spent several years re-mastering his collection of recordings from the analogue tapes  into a digital format and getting them online for posterity.\n\nIn 2002 he returned to set up a one-off project with [[Eddie Rayner]] ([[Split Enz]]) to record a CD entitled, \u201cPlay it Straight\u201d by the Eddie Rayner Project. This featured a collection of Kiwi singers performing a variety of Kiwi-written songs.\n \nTucker is still writing and recording songs from his home in [[Northland, Wellington|Northland, New Zealand]]. Guitar legend [[Gray Bartlett]] has recently recorded one of his most recent instrumental compositions, \"The Sad Princess\", due for release in April 2016.\n\n==Special Projects==\n\n===Satellite Spies - Destiny In Motion===\n\nSatellite Spies was an Auckland rock band formed in December 1984 as a vehicle for the songs of singer/bassist Mark Loveys. Their early life was as Loveys' former band, Blas\u00e9, that Glyn Tucker Jnr began mentoring and developing in 1983 after Loveys booked Mandrill Studios to record some song demos. Tucker was impressed and in 1984 released two Blas\u00e9 singles on his Reaction label : \u201cRock Solid\u201d and \u201cJust Like the Old Days\u201d.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1681568-Blas%C3%A9-2/ | title=Blas\u00e9 (2) | work=Discogs | accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> He continued to record several demos tracks of Lovey's new songs throughout 1984 (one of which was \u201cDestiny in Motion\u201d), but Blas\u00e9 was eventually judged to be a weak name, and so a name change was agreed. Deane Sutherland (aka Tommy Joy) was invited to join Loveys and so Satellite Spies was born and signed a recording agreement as a duo with Tucker's Reaction Records on 1 January 1985.<ref>{{cite book |last= Staff|first=Bryan |last2=Ashley|first2=Sheran |date=2002 |title=For the Record, A History of the New Zealand Recording Industry |location= |publisher=Bateman |page=138 |isbn=1-86953-508-1}}</ref>\n\nThey recorded the album \u201cDestiny in Motion\u201d at Mandrill Studios in 1985. The title track, produced by Tim Palmer (UK) became a hit single in NZ and led to the band touring NZ with [[Dire Straits]] [[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]] tour the following year; playing to a total audience of around 140,000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.satellitespies.net/Videos/SpiesDireStraitsSupport.html | title=Dire Straits Support Act | work=Satellite Spies Videos}}</ref>\n\nSatellite Spies' recorded works, won the official RIANZ Music Award for Most Promising Group of the Year, 1985 and Mark Loveys took the award for [[1985 in New Zealand#Music|Most Promising Male Vocal]].\n\nAfter the Dire Straits tour Loveys and Sutherland split, and Loveys continued to record and fulfill his contract with Reaction Records. He put together a new band with Tucker's approval that included Gordon Joll (drums) Eddie Pausma (guitar) and David Curtiss (keyboards).

The family would call them Big Glyn and Little Glyn.

He was to become an important and respected pioneer of the New Zealand recording community.<ref name=\"audioculture\"/>\n\nHaving learned some elementary piano and violin as a child, Tucker threw that all away when, as a young teenager he was \u201cfloored\u201d by the sound of rock 'n' roll. He was inspired by [[Buddy Holly]] to be a singer/songwriter.<ref name=\"audioculture\" />\n\n==Career==\nBy 1960, aged 17, Tucker recorded a version of Chuck Berry's \u201cCarol\u201d at Auckland's [[Stebbing Studios|Stebbings Recording Studio]] for the Zodiac Label.  It had one of his first compositions on the flipside.  He then joined new band \u201cThe Embers\" and worked at the popular teen club The Shirallee.  Bandmates were [[Gary Daverne]], Mike Kelly, Keith Graham and Johnny Willets.\n\nAfter a four-year stint as compere/singer at a suburban dance-hall Tucker put together a band to reflect the new beat sound coming out of Britain. During this period he adopted a stage name of Glyn Conway which he kept with his new band The Gremlins.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzmusician.co.nz/index.php/ps_pagename/article/pi_articleid/2867 | title=Moments Like These - Glyn Tucker Jnr | work=NZ Musician | accessdate=16 March 2016 | author=Reekie, Trevor | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012501/http://www.nzmusician.co.nz/index.php/ps_pagename/article/pi_articleid/2867 | archive-date=5 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"gremlins\">{{cite web | url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/the-gremlins | title=The Gremlins Profile | work=Audio Culture | date=10 May 2013 | accessdate=16 March 2016 | author=Gillanders, Grant}}</ref> They had a hit with their first record released on Gary Daverne's Viscount label in 1966; \u201cThe Coming Generation\u201d made it to #2 on the NZ Top 20 (the #1 was [[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]] by [[The Beatles]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=NZ%20listener%20charts&qyear=1966&qmonth=Sep&qweek=30-Sep-1966#n_view_location | title=1966 Listener Charts | work=Flavour of New Zealand | accessdate=16 March 2016 | author=Kohler, Steve}}</ref>\n\nThe Gremlins were voted as a finalist in the [[Loxene Gold Disc]] Awards with that recording in 1966 and again in 1967 with Tucker's composition, \u201cBlast Off 1970\u201d.<ref name=\"gremlins\" /> They toured New Zealand on the \u201cLoxene Gold Disc Spectacular\u201d with other finalists, [[Mr Lee Grant]], [[Larry's Rebels]], Ray Woolf, Sandy Edmonds, [[The Avengers (New Zealand band)|The Avengers]] and Herma Keil.

Tucker became a major influence on the New Zealand music scene encouraging and developing  scores of bands and singers, producing many hits on his labels Mandrill and later Reaction.  Some of the acts he signed and/or produced were, Alistair Riddell, [[Citizen Band (music band)|Citizen Band]], Rick Steele, Midge Marsden Connection, [[The Human Instinct|Human Instinct]], [[The Crocodiles]], [[The Mockers]], Danse Macabre, Car Crash Set, Paul Agar, Marginal Era, Blond Comedy, National Anthem, Gotham City Express, [[Knightshade]], Wayne Roland Brown, Everything That Flies, Mark Loveys [[Satellite Spies]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Billy T James]], The Hi Marks, [[Suzanne Prentice]], [[Howard Morrison]] and others.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.discogs.com/label/86187-Mandrill | title=Mandrill | work=Discogs | accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nJanuary 1979, Mandrill Studios had a visit from the legendary American record producer [[Kim Fowley]].  Tucker introduced him to Street Talk, one of Auckland's premier blues-rock bands and that began a series of recordings with Street Talk and later with Tucker producing [[The Crocodiles]]. It was the beginning of a long-term relationship; trading music ideas and talent with Kim and then [[peermusic|Peer-Southern Music Publishing]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/scenes/kim-fowley-stranded-in-paradise | title=Kim Fowley Stranded in Paradise | work=AudioCulture | date=11 March 2015 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Cammick, Murray}}</ref>\n\nTucker also set up Mandrill Music Publishing to administer many of the above listed recordings. He and Mandrill Music were major contributors the recording of the music for the [[1990 Commonwealth Games]] commemorative CD including the main theme song \u201cThis is The Moment\u201d, and the performance of \"Tukua Ahau\" by Sir Howard Morrison.\n\nTucker eventually bought out his partners in Mandrill Recording Studios Ltd, who had done their share towards its ultimate success. But it was Tucker who had everything on the line and had the drive to ensure survival. Dave Hurley, Gary Daverne, Mike Emerson, and [[Bruce Lynch]] were these contributors. The studio was sold in 1995, ending an era.\n\nDuring his twenty-one years operating Mandrill Recording Studios, Tucker wrote and produced hundreds of \u201cjingles\u201d for advertisers, mainly for TV and radio. Many of these were in partnership with singer-songwriter, Steve Allen. He was awarded the prestigious Axis Award from the Advertising Institute of NZ in 1987 for craft excellence, and in 1992 he received the International Mobius Award on behalf of Mandrill Studios for their work on a radio commercial for Castle Parcels.\n\nTucker became a member of [[Australasian Performing Right Association|APRA]] in 1960 when his first song was recorded, on the flipside of \u201cCarol\u201d, and in 1980 he became a Writer Full Member.<ref name=\"tuckers take\"/>\n\nHe became actively involved with the NZ recording industry, sitting on the board of the NZ Composers Foundation from 1985 to 1995.<ref name=\"tuckers take\"/> The foundation was funded by APRA to assist new musical talent in all genres, and Tucker was a strong lobbyist in supporting music producers and musicians to travel and attend MIDEM music trade festival in Cannes. This became an annual grant. The members of the board were:\n\n* Ashley Heenan (chairman)\n* Professor [[John Ritchie (composer)|John Ritchie]] - Christchurch University\n* Professor John Rimmer - Auckland University\n* Professor [[David Farquhar]] - Wellington University\n* Tony Baker - Musical Director, Light Entertainment, [[TVNZ]]\n* Glyn Tucker - record producer/publisher, Mandrill Studios\n\nTucker also sat on the NZ Music Promotions Committee (NZMPC), which was set up by RIANZ and representatives of independent and government broadcasters, to encourage more airplay for Kiwi recordings. He had regrets later that this initiative seemed to have been set up with a political agenda, to divert the Government from following Australia's lead in setting minimum quotas for NZ recordings on radio. Since the NZMPC's own monthly surveys in the mid-eighties averaged a mere 2-3% local content, it seemed to Tucker that Australia had got it right (and New Zealand had it horribly wrong).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nTucker retreated from the music industry for a few years to work on other business, but continued  to administer the publishing catalogue. He has spent several years re-mastering his collection of recordings from the analogue tapes  into a digital format and getting them online for posterity.\n\nIn 2002 he returned to set up a one-off project with [[Eddie Rayner]] ([[Split Enz]]) to record a CD entitled, \u201cPlay it Straight\u201d by the Eddie Rayner Project. This featured a collection of Kiwi singers performing a variety of Kiwi-written songs.\n \nTucker is still writing and recording songs from his home in [[Northland, Wellington|Northland, New Zealand]]. Guitar legend [[Gray Bartlett]] has recently recorded one of his most recent instrumental compositions, \"The Sad Princess\", due for release in April 2016.\n\n==Special Projects==\n\n===Satellite Spies - Destiny In Motion===\n\nSatellite Spies was an Auckland rock band formed in December 1984 as a vehicle for the songs of singer/bassist Mark Loveys. Their early life was as Loveys' former band, Blas\u00e9, that Glyn Tucker Jnr began mentoring and developing in 1983 after Loveys booked Mandrill Studios to record some song demos. Tucker was impressed and in 1984 released two Blas\u00e9 singles on his Reaction label : \u201cRock Solid\u201d and \u201cJust Like the Old Days\u201d.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1681568-Blas%C3%A9-2/ | title=Blas\u00e9 (2) | work=Discogs | accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> He continued to record several demos tracks of Lovey's new songs throughout 1984 (one of which was \u201cDestiny in Motion\u201d), but Blas\u00e9 was eventually judged to be a weak name, and so a name change was agreed. Deane Sutherland (aka Tommy Joy) was invited to join Loveys and so Satellite Spies was born and signed a recording agreement as a duo with Tucker's Reaction Records on 1 January 1985.<ref>{{cite book |last= Staff|first=Bryan |last2=Ashley|first2=Sheran |date=2002 |title=For the Record, A History of the New Zealand Recording Industry |location= |publisher=Bateman |page=138 |isbn=1-86953-508-1}}</ref>\n\nThey recorded the album \u201cDestiny in Motion\u201d at Mandrill Studios in 1985. The title track, produced by Tim Palmer (UK) became a hit single in NZ and led to the band touring NZ with [[Dire Straits]] [[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]] tour the following year; playing to a total audience of around 140,000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.satellitespies.net/Videos/SpiesDireStraitsSupport.html | title=Dire Straits Support Act | work=Satellite Spies Videos}}</ref>\n\nSatellite Spies' recorded works, won the official RIANZ Music Award for Most Promising Group of the Year, 1985 and Mark Loveys took the award for [[1985 in New Zealand#Music|Most Promising Male Vocal]].\n\nAfter the Dire Straits tour Loveys and Sutherland split, and Loveys continued to record and fulfill his contract with Reaction Records. He put together a new band with Tucker's approval that included Gordon Joll (drums) Eddie Pausma (guitar) and David Curtiss (keyboards). Satellite Spies with this line-up toured NZ venues 1986-1988 and recorded and released several singles, \u201cLiving in a Minefield\u201d, \u201cPrivate Detective\u201d, \u201cOnly Here for the Rock 'n' Roll\u201d, and \u201cGonna Have to Change\u201d, all produced by Tucker. Reaction also produced accompanying music videos.\n\nSatellite Spies disbanded in 1988. Two years later Deane Sutherland formed a new band by the same name with no other relation.

It can also act as a rudimentary tiling window manager.\n\nTo tile windows, the user selects them in the [[taskbar]] and uses the context menu choice ''Tile Vertically'' or ''Tile Horizontally''. Choosing ''Tile Vertically'' will cause the windows to tile horizontally but take on a vertical shape, while choosing ''Tile Horizontally'' will cause the windows to tile vertically but take on a horizontal shape. These options were later changed in [[Windows Vista]] to ''Show Windows Side by Side'' and ''Show Windows Stacked'', respectively. [[Windows 7]] adds the ability to drag windows to either side of the screen to create a simple side-by-side tiled layout, or to the top of the screen to [[maximize]].\n\nThe [[Windows 8]] [[GUI]] introduced a new basic tiling window manager.\nIn [[Windows 10]], users are able to tile Windows by quarters.\n\n====History====\nThe first version ([[Windows 1.0]]) featured a tiling window manager, partly because of litigation by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Apple Computer, Inc. v.

X itself enforces no specific window management approach and remains usable even without any window manager. Current X protocol version X11 explicitly mentions the possibility of tiling window managers. The Siemens RTL Tiled Window Manager (released in 1988) was the first to implement automatic placement/sizing strategies. Another tiling window manager from this period was the [[Cambridge Window Manager]] developed by [[IBM]]'s Academic Information System group.\n\nIn 2000, both [[larswm]] and [[Ion (window manager)|Ion]] released a first version.\n\n====List of tiling window managers for X{{Anchor|X-tile-anchor}}====\n* [[yabai]] - a tiling window manager for macOS that uses a plugin architecture, successor to kwm.

The default is a main area + stacking area arrangement, represented by a '''[]=''' character glyph. Other standard layouts are a single-window \"monocle\" mode represented by an '''M''' and a non-tiling floating layout that permits windows to be moved and resized, represented by a [[fish]]-like '''><>'''. Third party [[patch (Unix)|patches]] exist to add a [[golden section]]-based [[Fibonacci]] layout, horizontal and vertical row-based tiling or a grid layout.

Examples include email clients, [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]s, web browsers, and contextual help in Microsoft Office. The main windows of these applications are divided into \"[[Paned window|panes]]\" for the various displays. The panes are usually separated by a draggable divider to allow resizing. Paned windows are a common way to implement a [[master\u2013detail interface]].\n\nDeveloped since the 1970s, the [[Emacs]] text editor contains one of the earliest implementations of tiling. In addition, HTML [[framing (World Wide Web)|frames]] can be seen as a [[markup language]]-based implementation of tiling. The tiling window manager extends this usefulness beyond multiple functions within an application, to multiple applications within a desktop. The [[tabbed document interface]] can be a useful adjunct to tiling, as it avoids having multiple window tiles on screen for the same function.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Split screen (computer graphics)]]\n*[[Integrated development environment]] style interface\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- wmii References start -->\n\n<ref name=\"home-wmii\">{{cite web|url=http://wmii.suckless.org/|title=wmii - Window Manager Improved 2|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231012144/http://wmii.suckless.org/|archive-date=2011-12-31|website=Wmii.suckless.org|access-date=2013-07-13|df=ymd-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PK=wmi\">{{cite magazine|title=Light and speedy.

All later versions of the [[operating system]] stuck to this approach as the default behaviour.\n\n==== List of tiling window managers for Windows ====\n\n* bug.n \u2013 open source, configurable tiling window manager built as an [[AutoHotKey]] script and licensed under the [[GNU GPL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/fuhsjr00/bug.n|title=bug.n \u2013 Tiling Window Manager for Windows|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref>\n* MaxTo \u2014 customizable grid, global hotkeys.

X itself enforces no specific window management approach and remains usable even without any window manager. Current X protocol version X11 explicitly mentions the possibility of tiling window managers. The Siemens RTL Tiled Window Manager (released in 1988) was the first to implement automatic placement/sizing strategies. Another tiling window manager from this period was the [[Cambridge Window Manager]] developed by [[IBM]]'s Academic Information System group.\n\nIn 2000, both [[larswm]] and [[Ion (window manager)|Ion]] released a first version.\n\n====List of tiling window managers for X{{Anchor|X-tile-anchor}}====\n* [[yabai]] - a tiling window manager for macOS that uses a plugin architecture, successor to kwm. It represents windows as the leaves of a binary tree, and supports binary space partitioned, monocle and floating desktops.\n* [[Awesome (window manager)|awesome]] \u2014 a dwm derivative with window tiling, floating and tagging, written in C and configurable and extensible in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]. It was the first WM to be ported from [[Xlib]] to [[XCB]], and supports [[D-Bus]], [[pango]], [[XRandR]], [[Xinerama]].\n* [[dwm]] \u2014 allows for switching tiling layouts by clicking a textual [[ascii art]] 'icon' in the status bar. The default is a main area + stacking area arrangement, represented by a '''[]=''' character glyph. Other standard layouts are a single-window \"monocle\" mode represented by an '''M''' and a non-tiling floating layout that permits windows to be moved and resized, represented by a [[fish]]-like '''><>'''. Third party [[patch (Unix)|patches]] exist to add a [[golden section]]-based [[Fibonacci]] layout, horizontal and vertical row-based tiling or a grid layout. The keyboard-driven menu utility \"[[dmenu]]\", developed for use with dwm,<ref name=\"alm201001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archlinux.org/static/magazine/2010/ALM-2010-Jan.html|title=Software Review: 2009 LnF Awards|author=Arch Linux Magazine Team|date=January 2010|work=Arch Linux Magazine|accessdate=8 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216154649/http://www.archlinux.org/static/magazine/2010/ALM-2010-Jan.html|archive-date=2010-02-16|url-status=live}}</ref> is used with other tiling WMs such as [[xmonad]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.tuxradar.com/content/100-open-source-gems-part-2\n |title        = 100 open source gems - part 2\n |date         = 21 May 2009\n |work         = [[TuxRadar]]\n |publisher    = [[Future Publishing]]\n |accessdate   = 3 March 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100106002804/http://www.tuxradar.com/content/100-open-source-gems-part-2\n |archive-date = 2010-01-06\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref><!-- xmonad uses dmenu by default in Debian.

It has vi-like keybindings, and treats extra monitors as extra workspaces, meaning that windows can be moved between monitors easily. Allows vertical and horizontal splits, and tabbed and stacked layouts, and parent containers. It can be controlled entirely from the keyboard, but a mouse can also be used.\n* [[Ion (window manager)|Ion]] \u2014 combines tiling with a tabbing interface: the display is manually split in non-overlapping regions (frames). Each frame can contain one or more windows. Only one of these windows is visible and fills the entire frame.\n* [[Larswm]] \u2014 implements a form of dynamic tiling: the display is vertically split in two regions (tracks). The left track is filled with a single window. The right track contains all other windows stacked on top of each other.\n*[[LeftWM]] \u2014 a tiling window manager based on theming and supporting large monitors such as ultrawides.<ref>{{Citation|title=GitHub - leftwm/leftwm: LeftWM: A tiling window manager for Adventurers.|date=2019-04-04|url=https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm|publisher=leftwm|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>\n*[[Qtile]] \u2014 a tiling window manager written, configurable and extensible in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref name=\"FMAG\">{{cite web\n|title=5 cool tiling window managers\n|website=Fedora Magazine\n|first1=Cl\u00e9ment|last1=Verna\n|date=27 September 2018\n|id=Qtile\n|url=https://fedoramagazine.org/5-cool-tiling-window-managers/\n|access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Ratpoison]] \u2014 A keyboard-driven [[GNU Screen]] for X.\n* [[StumpWM]] \u2014 a keyboard driven offshoot of ratpoison supporting multiple displays (e.g. xrandr) that can be customized on the fly in Common Lisp.

The window manager offers extensive configuration through a virtual filesystem using the [[9P (protocol)|9P]] filesystem protocol similar to that offered by [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]].<ref name=\"home-wmii\"/> Every window, tag, and column is represented in the virtual filesystem, and windows are controlled by manipulating their file objects (in fact, the configuration file is just a script interfacing the virtual files).

The latest release 3.9 also includes configurations in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].<ref name=\"news-wmii\"/>  The latest release supported [[Xinerama]], shipping with its own keyboard-based menu program called wimenu, featuring history and programmable completion.<ref name=\"news-wmii\"/><ref name=\"PK=wmi\"/><ref name=\"LM64-wmii\"/><ref name=\"LF103-wmii\"/>\n* [[xmonad]] \u2014 an extensible WM written in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], which was both influenced by and has since influenced dwm.\n* [[Compiz]] \u2014 a [[compositing window manager]] available for usage without leaving familiar interfaces such as the ones from [[GNOME]], [[KDE]] or [[MATE (software)|Mate]]. One of its plugins (called Grid) allows the user to configure several keybindings to move windows to any corner, with five different lengths. There are also options to configure default placement for specific windows. The plugins can be configured through the Compiz Config Settings Manager / CCSM.\n* [[spectrwm]]  \u2014 a small dynamic tiling and reparenting window manager for X11. It tries to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff. It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any configuration. It is written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact and fast.

Examples include email clients, [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]s, web browsers, and contextual help in Microsoft Office. The main windows of these applications are divided into \"[[Paned window|panes]]\" for the various displays. The panes are usually separated by a draggable divider to allow resizing. Paned windows are a common way to implement a [[master\u2013detail interface]].\n\nDeveloped since the 1970s, the [[Emacs]] text editor contains one of the earliest implementations of tiling. In addition, HTML [[framing (World Wide Web)|frames]] can be seen as a [[markup language]]-based implementation of tiling. The tiling window manager extends this usefulness beyond multiple functions within an application, to multiple applications within a desktop. The [[tabbed document interface]] can be a useful adjunct to tiling, as it avoids having multiple window tiles on screen for the same function.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Split screen (computer graphics)]]\n*[[Integrated development environment]] style interface\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- wmii References start -->\n\n<ref name=\"home-wmii\">{{cite web|url=http://wmii.suckless.org/|title=wmii - Window Manager Improved 2|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231012144/http://wmii.suckless.org/|archive-date=2011-12-31|website=Wmii.suckless.org|access-date=2013-07-13|df=ymd-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PK=wmi\">{{cite magazine|title=Light and speedy.
