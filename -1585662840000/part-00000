The first seaside resorts were opened in the 18th century for the aristocracy, who began to frequent the seaside as well as the then fashionable spa towns, for recreation and health.<ref name=\"The business of tourism\">{{cite book | title=The business of tourism | author1=J.

This trend was praised and artistically elevated by the new [[Romanticism|romantic]] ideal of the picturesque landscape; [[Jane Austen]]'s unfinished novel ''[[Sanditon]]'' is an example of that. Later, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s long-standing patronage of the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Ramsgate]] in [[Kent]] ensured that a seaside residence was considered as a highly fashionable possession for those wealthy enough to afford more than one home.\n\n===Seaside resorts for the middle and working classes===\n[[File:The promenade, Blackpool, Lancashire, England, ca. 1898.jpg|thumb|The [[Blackpool]] [[Promenade]] c. 1898]]\nThe extension of this form of leisure to the middle and working classes began with the development of the railways in the 1840s; they offered cheap travel to fast-growing resort towns. In particular, the [[Blackpool Branch Line|branch line]] to the small seaside town of [[Blackpool]] from [[Poulton-le-Fylde]] led to a sustained economic and demographic boom. A sudden influx of visitors arriving by rail motivated entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and rapid growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blackpool History |publisher=[[Blackpool Tourist Office]]|url=http://www.blackpooltourism.com/resources/files/2_Blackpool%20History.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705082737/http://www.blackpooltourism.com/resources/files/2_Blackpool%20History.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe growth was intensified by the practice among the Lancashire [[cotton mill]] owners of closing the factories for a week every year to service and repair machinery. These became known as [[wakes week]]s. Each town's mills would close for a different week, allowing Blackpool to manage a steady and reliable stream of visitors over a prolonged period in the summer. A prominent feature of the resort was the [[promenade]] and the [[pleasure pier]]s, where an eclectic variety of performances vied for the people's attention. In 1863, the [[North Pier, Blackpool|North Pier]] in Blackpool was completed, rapidly becoming a centre of attraction for elite{{clarify|date=July 2019}} visitors. [[Central Pier, Blackpool|Central Pier]] was completed in 1868, with a theatre and a large open-air dance floor.<ref name=Rough597>{{harvnb|Andrews et al.|2002|p=597}}.</ref>\n\nMany popular beach resorts were equipped with [[bathing machine]]s, because even the all-covering [[swimsuit|beachwear]] of the period was considered immodest.\n\nBy the end of the century the English coastline had over 100 large resort towns, some with populations exceeding 50,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Sea/articles/walton.html|title=The seaside resort: a British cultural export|author=John K.

The [[French Riviera]] on the Mediterranean had already become a popular destination for the British upper class by the end of the 18th century. In 1864, the first railway to [[Nice]] was completed, making the Riviera accessible to visitors from all over Europe. By 1874, foreign residents in Nice, mostly British, numbered 25,000. The coastline became renowned for attracting the royalty of Europe, including [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]].<ref>Michael Nelson, ''Queen Victoria and the Discovery of the Riviera'', Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2007.</ref>\n[[File:Ahlbeck_Strandk\u00f6rbe_2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Strandkorb]] became a symbol of seaside tourism by the end of the 19th century, especially on the southern [[Baltic Sea]] coast.]]\nIn the United States, early seaside resorts in the late 1800s catered to the wealthy, including city businessmen. [[Cape May]], New Jersey became one of the first coastal resorts in the United States, when regular steamboat traffic on the [[Delaware River]] began after the War of 1812. Early visitors to Cape May included [[Henry Clay]] in 1847, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1849. By 1880, [[Henry Flagler]] had extended several rail lines southward down the US Atlantic coastline, enticing northern upper-class families south to subtropical Florida. The [[Florida East Coast Railway]] brought northern tourists to [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in greater numbers, and by 1887 Flagler began to build two large ornate hotels in St. Augustine, the 540-room [[Ponce de Leon Hotel]] and the [[Hotel Alcazar]], and bought the [[Casa Monica Hotel]] the next year.\n\nContinental European attitudes towards gambling and nudity tended to be more lax than in Britain, and British and French entrepreneurs were quick to exploit the possibilities. In 1863, the Prince of [[Monaco]], [[Charles III, Prince of Monaco|Charles III]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Blanc]], a French businessman, arranged for [[steamship]]s and carriages to take visitors from Nice to Monaco, where large luxury hotels, gardens and casinos were built. The place was renamed{{fact|date=July 2019}} [[Monte Carlo]]. Commercial seabathing also spread to other areas of the [[United States]] and parts of the [[British Empire]] such as [[Australia]], where [[surfing]] became popular in the early 20th century. By the 1970s cheap and affordable air travel was the catalyst for the growth of a truly global tourism market.\n\n[[Recreational fishing]] and leisure boat pursuits have recently become very lucrative, and traditional [[fishing village]]s are often well positioned to take advantage of this. For example, [[Destin, Florida|Destin]], on the coast of [[Florida]], has evolved from an [[artisanal fishing]] village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats.<ref>[http://www.destinchamber.com/destin/history-fishing.asp History of the World\u2019s Luckiest Fishing Village] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116180137/http://www.destinchamber.com/destin/history-fishing.asp |date=16 November 2007 }} The Destin Area Chamber of Commerce.

Nevertheless, a connection with the sea lies at this heart of seasideness, and anecdotally it appears to be something shared by modern societies; it is a common theme in literature and the arts. The case-study centred on Morecambe, a once popular Lancastrian resort on the North-West coast of England, which saw a dramatic decline in visitor numbers in the late 20th century and regeneration at the start of the 21st century. One could argue that such resorts, like any destination, need to understand the motivation and experiences of visitors and this is one way in which an understanding of seasideness may be useful.\n\n==Seaside resorts around the world==\n===Australia===\n[[File:Hyams_beach.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Hyams Beach]] in the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], which is renowned for its brilliantly white sand.]]\n[[File:Manly_Beach_and_water.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Manly Beach]] in [[Sydney]], a popular beach spot.]]\n[[File:Gold_Coast,_2015.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Surfers Paradise]], one of the most popular and frequently visited tourist spot in Australia.]]\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*[[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] ([[Surfers Paradise]])\n*[[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]\n*[[Jervis Bay]] ([[Hyams Beach]])\n*[[Tangalooma, Queensland|Tangalooma]]\n*[[Queenscliff, Victoria]]\n*[[Agnes Water, Queensland|Agnes Water]]\n*[[St Kilda Beach, Victoria|St Kilda Beach]]\n*[[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]]\n*[[Byron Bay]]\n*[[Central Coast, New South Wales|Central Coast]] ([[The Entrance, New South Wales|The Entrance]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Ettalong Beach]])\n*[[Batemans Bay]]\n*[[Port Douglas]]\n*[[Port Macquarie]]\n*[[Ballina, New South Wales]]\n*[[Fitzroy Island, Queensland|Fitzroy Island]]\n*[[Sydney]] ([[Bondi Beach]], [[Manly Beach]], [[Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales|Brighton-Le-Sands]], [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]])\n*[[Wollongong]]\n*[[Noosa Heads]]\n*[[Coffs Harbour]]\n*[[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]]\n*[[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]]\n*[[Nelson, Victoria|Nelson]]\n*[[Nelson Bay]]\n*[[South West Rocks, New South Wales|South West Rocks]]\n*[[Yamba, New South Wales|Yamba]]\n*[[Lizard Island National Park]]\n*[[Cairns]]\n*[[Airlie Beach]]\n*[[Kiama]]\n*[[Forster, New South Wales|Forster]]\n*[[Culburra Beach]]\n*[[Tweed Heads]]\n}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\nPopular seaside resorts on the Flemish coast of [[West Flanders|West-Vlaanderen]] exist at the famous [[Knokke]], [[Ostend]] and also [[De Panne]] and coastal towns along the [[North Sea]] served by the coastal tramway [[Coast Tram (Belgium)|Kustram]] run by [[De Lijn]].\n[[File:Oostende panoramic view.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|[[Ostend]] beach and the promenade pier, panoramic view]]\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n[[file:Nessebar lead collage.jpg|thumb|[[Nesebar]]]]\n[[file:Sanny beach.

Youghal has been a favoured holiday destination for over 100 years, situated on the banks of the [[Munster Blackwater|River Blackwater]] as it reaches the sea. Youghal is well known for its beaches, having been, until 2008, the only town in the [[Republic of Ireland]] with two beaches awarded [[E.U.]] [[Blue flag beach|Blue Flag]] status. Dungarvan is a seaside market town beneath the mountains in the centre of the Irish south coast. [[Kinsale]] is often described as a food lover's and yachting town, with a diverse range of restaurants, as well as a large and active creative community with numerous art galleries and record and book shops.\n\nSeaside resorts in the East of Ireland developed after the introduction of rail travel. The [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway]] introduced [[day-tripper]]s from [[Dublin]] to Kingstown (now [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]]) in [[South Dublin]], and the coastal town became Ireland's first seaside resort. Other South Dublin towns and villages such as [[Sandycove]], [[Dalkey]] and [[Killiney]] grew as seaside resorts when the rail network was expanded. Since the opening of [[Bray Daly Station]] in 1852, the [[County Wicklow]] coastal town of [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]] has become the largest seaside resort on the East Coast of Ireland. The town of [[Greystones]], five miles south of [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], also grew as a seaside resort when the railway line was extended in 1855. Other seaside resorts include [[Courtown]] and  [[Rosslare Strand]] in [[County Wexford]].\n\n[[Ulster]] has a number of seaside resorts, such as [[Portrush]], situated on the north coast, with its two beaches and a world-famous golf course, [[Royal Portrush Golf Club]].<ref>Ranked as the third best course outside the United States by ''Golf Digest'' in 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/planetgolf/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427221644/http://www.golfdigest.com/planetgolf/ |archivedate=27 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Other Ulster seaside resorts are [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]], located on the east coast at the foot of the Mourne Mountains; [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]]; [[Portstewart]]; [[Rathmullan]]; [[Bundoran]] and [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]]. [[Bangor Marina]] is one of the largest in Ireland and the marina has on occasion been awarded the [[Blue Flag beach|Blue Flag]] for attention to environmental issues.\n\nThe main seaside towns in the west of Ireland are in [[County Clare|Clare]]; the largest are [[Lahinch]] and [[Kilkee]]. Lahinch is a popular [[surfing]] location.\n\nLike British resorts, many seaside towns in Ireland have turned to other entertainment industries.

Blackpool catered for workers from across industrial [[Northern England]], who packed its beaches and [[promenade]]. Other northern seaside towns (for example [[Bridlington]], [[Cleethorpes]], [[Morecambe]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Skegness]], and [[Southport]]) shared in the success of this new concept, especially from trade during [[wakes week]]s. The concept spread rapidly to other British coastal towns, including several on the coast of [[North Wales]], notably [[Rhyl]], and [[Llandudno]], the largest resort in [[Wales]] and known as \"The Queen of the Welsh Resorts\", from as early as 1864.<ref>Ivor Wynne Jones. ''Llandudno Queen of Welsh Resorts'' (chapter 3 page 19) referring to the ''Liverpool Mercury''</ref>\nAs the 19th century progressed, British [[working class]] [[day-tripper]]s travelled on organised trips such as [[railway excursion]]s, or by [[Steamboat|steamer]], for which long [[pier]]s were erected so that the ships bringing the trade could berth.\n\nAnother area notable for its seaside resorts was (and is) the [[Firth of Clyde]], outside Glasgow. Glaswegians would take a ferry \"doon the watter\" from the city, down the [[River Clyde]], to the Firth's islands and peninsulas and beyond, such as [[Cowal]], [[Isle of Bute|Bute]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], and [[Kintyre]]. Resorts include [[Rothesay, Argyll and Bute|Rothesay]], [[Lamlash]], [[Whiting Bay]], [[Dunoon]], [[Tighnabruaich]], [[Carrick Castle]], [[Helensburgh]], [[Largs]], [[Millport, Cumbrae|Millport]] and [[Campbeltown]]. In contrast to many resorts, some on the Firth of Clyde have continued to prosper as middle-class [[commuter town]]s.\n\nSome resorts, especially those more southerly such as [[Hastings]], [[Worthing]], [[Eastbourne]], [[Bournemouth]] and [[Brighton]] were built as new towns or extended by local landowners to appeal to wealthier holidaymakers. Others came about due to their proximity to large urban areas of population, such as [[Southend-on-Sea]], which became increasingly popular with residents of London once rail links were established to it allowing day trips from London. The sunshine and sea air were seen by Victorians as beneficial for health,<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24214646|title=Oh, why do we like to be beside the seaside?|date=28 September 2013|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> and resorts such as [[Ventnor]] owed their growth to a visit being considered as treatment for chest complaints. Owing to its generally better climate, the south coast has many seaside towns, the most being in [[Sussex]].\n\nIn the later 20th century, the popularity of the British seaside resort declined for the same reason that it first flourished: advances in transport. The greater accessibility of foreign holiday destinations, through [[package holiday]]s and, more recently, European [[low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], makes it easier to holiday abroad. Despite the loyalty of returning holidaymakers, resorts such as Blackpool have struggled to compete against the hotter weather of [[Southern Europe]] and the [[sunbelt]] in the [[United States]]. Now, many symbols of the traditional British resort ([[holiday camp]]s, [[Pier#Pleasure piers|end-of-the-pier shows]] and saucy [[Seaside postcard#British seaside postcards|postcard]]s) are regarded by some as drab and outdated; the skies are imagined to be overcast and the beach windswept. This is not always true; for example [[Broadstairs]] in [[Kent]] has retained much of its old world charm with [[Punch and Judy]] and [[donkey rides]] and still remains popular, being only one hour from the [[M25 motorway|M25]]. Brighton has also seen a fall in visitor numbers over the past couple of years.\n<ref>Drop in day visitors to Brighton and Hove \u2013 BBC News, 11 October 2016: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-37619384</ref> <ref>Day visitors to Brighton and Hove fall by a million in a year \u2013 Brighton Argus, 11 October 2016: https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14794028.day-visitors-to-brighton-and-hove-fall-by-a-million/</ref> The city has also experienced a rise in homelessness, especially noticeable on the city streets and in green spaces where tents have been erected.<ref>Homeless camps and human excrement left in city centre: The Argus, Brighton, 17 August 2019: https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/17843597.homeless-camps-human-excrement-left-city-centre/</ref> Brighton now has the second highest homeless population in England, <ref>Brighton has the second highest homeless population in England \u2013 Independent, 25 January 2018: https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/news/brighton-has-second-largest-homeless-population-in-england-1-8347912</ref> which has resulted to the City Council applying to become the first UK city to pass a \u2018Homeless Bill of Rights.\u2019<ref>Political row over increasing homelessness in Brighton and Hove, 9 October 2018: https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/news/political-row-over-increasing-homelessness-in-brighton-and-hove-1-8661688</ref>\n<ref>Brighton Could Be the First UK City to Pass a 'Homeless Bill of Rights' : https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/zmjb43/homeless-bill-of-rights-brighton</ref>\n\nMany seaside towns have turned to other entertainment industries, and some of them have a good deal of nightlife. The cinemas and theatres often remain to become host to a number of pubs, bars, restaurants and nightclubs. Most of their entertainment facilities cater to local people, and the beaches are still popular in summer. Although international tourism turned people away from British seaside towns, it also brought in inward foreign travel; many seaside towns offer [[foreign language]] schools, the students of which often return to vacation and sometimes to settle.\nMany people can now afford more time off, and 'second holidays' and short breaks, resulting in increased tourism in British seaside towns. Many young people and students can take short holidays and discover the town's nightlife. Many seaside towns have large shopping centres which also attract people from a wide area. Day trippers still come to the coastal towns, but on a more local scale than during the 19th century. Many coastal towns are also popular retirement hotspots where older people reside permanently or take short breaks in the autumn months. Other English coastal  towns have successfully sought to project a sense of their unique character. In particular, [[Southwold]] on the [[Suffolk]] coast is an active yet peaceful retirement haven with an emphasis on calmness, quiet countryside and jazz. [[Weymouth, Dorset]] offers itself as 'the gateway to the Jurassic Coast', Britain's only natural World Heritage Site. [[Newquay]] in [[Cornwall]] offers itself as the 'surfing capital of Britain', hosting international surfing events on its shores.\n\n[[Torbay]] in South [[Devon]] is known is also known as the [[English Riviera]]. Consisting of the towns of [[Torquay]], [[Paignton]] with its pier and [[Brixham]], the bay has 20 beaches and coves along its {{convert|22|mi|km|0|adj=on}} coastline, ranging from small secluded coves to the larger promenade-style seafronts of Torquay's Torre Abbey Sands and Paignton Sands.\n\nHowever, British seaside resorts have faced increasingly stiff competition from sunnier resorts overseas since the 1970s. In 1975, some 9,000 British families holidayed abroad, but by the mid-1980s that figure had risen to some 20,000. A decade later, it was around 30,000.{{fact|date=July 2019}}{{Fix|text=far more than that}} This was largely due to the falling price of air travel which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] ([[1979 United Kingdom general election|elected in 1979]]) had allowed.{{Fix|text=What??}}<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4446012.stm | work=BBC News | title=Thatcher years in graphics | date=18 November 2005}}</ref> This decline is discussed in the [[Morrissey]] song '[[Everyday Is Like Sunday]]' where daily life in the resort is likened to the emptiness of streets once associated with the shop closures on Sunday.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Wide image|Coronado panorama2.jpg|900px|[[Hotel Del Coronado]] in [[Coronado, California]], 1908}}\nWith 3,800 miles (6100&nbsp;km) of coastline, the USA mainland has hundreds of seaside resorts on three coasts, [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Pacific ocean]]. Unlike in many smaller countries, the seaside resorts in the USA are located in various climate zones, with great differences in topography and environment. Many American seaside resorts are popular destination across the world, known for their climates, culture, and entertainment opportunities.\n\nAmerican seaside resorts first developed near the big industrial cities on the upper East Coast like New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. [[Cape May]], New Jersey, and [[Provincetown]], MA, were two of the first seaside resorts in the 1800s that catered to city workers in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Cape May is often called Americas \"first seaside resort\". The early emergence of Cape May as a summer resort was due to easy transport by water from Philadelphia to the Atlantic Ocean. Early Cape May vacationers were carried to the town on sloops from Philadelphia, and water transport was also easy from New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and points south. The resort business in Cape May began to thrive when regular steamboat traffic on the Delaware River began after the War of 1812. Early visitors to Cape May included [[Henry Clay]] in 1847, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1849. Today, the [[Cape May Historic District]] is one of the largest and well preserved examples of Victorian architecture in the United States.\n\nOn the southern Atlantic coast, [[Henry Flagler]] had the idea to make [[St. Augustine, Florida]] a winter resort. He built several rail lines south, and combined them with existing lines to create the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] in 1885. He built a railroad bridge over the [[St. Johns River]] in 1888, opening up the Atlantic coast of Florida to development. In 1887 Flagler began construction of two large ornate hotels in St. Augustine, the 540-room [[Ponce de Leon Hotel]] and the [[Hotel Alcazar]], and bought the [[Casa Monica Hotel]] the next year.\n\nIn [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], the community of [[Coconut Grove, Miami|Cocoanut (now Coconut) Grove]] began development as a resort town in the 1880s with the building of the Bayview House (aka Peacock Inn) which closed in 1902. Visitors to the greater Miami area then flocked to Camp Biscayne (in Coconut Grove), the [[Royal Palm Hotel (Miami)|Royal Palm Hotel]] in [[Downtown Miami]], and other resort hotels in Miami, as well as in smaller numbers to the [[Florida Keys]]. In 1894, the lavish [[Royal Poinciana Hotel]] opened in Palm Beach, Florida, with rave reviews from wealthy New York tourists who picked oranges in January to their delight. On the Gulf of Mexico, the City of Galveston was emerging as a booming city, and in 1882, architect [[Nicholas J. Clayton]] designed the [[Beach Hotel (Galveston)|Beach Hotel]]. By 1888, Galveston, TX was a wealthy city and booming seaside playground for wealthy [[New Orleans]] businessmen.\n\nOn the Pacific coast in California, in April 1886, Babcock and Story created the Coronado Beach Company, which sought to develop Coronado as a seaside resort. In the mid-1880s, the San Diego region was in the midst of one of its first real estate booms. The [[Hotel del Coronado]] was built in March 1887, with Babcock's visions for the hotel built around a courtyard of tropical trees, shrubs and flowers, with a dining wing to give full value to the view of the ocean, bay and city. By 1915, more hotels were built along the Los Angeles coastline to serve the wealthy tourists and Hollywood film makers. In May 1926, brothers E.A. \"Jack\" Harter and T.D. \"Til\" Harter built the [[Hotel Casa del Mar]] in Santa Monica, at a cost of $2 million, creating one of the most successful beach clubs in Southern California, popular with socialites and Hollywood celebrities.\n\nIn the 1920s,  Carl Fisher was the main promoter of [[Miami Beach]], and helped to develop the city as a seaside resort. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them the [[Flamingo Hotel]]. In 1926, the massive [[The Breakers hotel]] in Palm Beach had been rebuilt, and there was a large northern tourist industry in coastal southern Florida.  By the 1950s with increasing auto travel, more seaside resorts grew along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, while small, declining industrial ports were being rebuilt. In 1954, the [[Fontainebleau Miami Beach]], and was considered, (at that time) the most lavish seaside hotel in the world.\n\nIn the modern era, hundreds of seaside resorts now string the Gulf, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts of the United States. Many Americans move with the seasons when they visit seaside resorts, vacationing in northern seaside areas in the warm season (April through October), and then moving to southern areas in the cold season (November through March). Many seaside resorts in Florida and California however, see travelers all year.\n\nSome examples of well-known and sought-after American coastal resort towns are:\n[[File:Miamimetroarea.jpg|right|thumb|[[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]]]]\n[[File:Newport Beach Aerial photo 001 by Don Ramey Logan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Newport Beach, CA|Newport Beach]]]]\n[[File:LaJollaSkyline.jpg|right|thumb|[[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]]]]\n[[File:Rehoboth Beach at Delaware Avenue.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]]]]\n[[File:Myrtle Beach, 8 a.m..jpg|right|thumb|[[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]]]]\n[[File:South Padre Island beach.jpg|right|thumb|[[South Padre Island, Texas|South Padre Island]]]]\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]]\n* [[Orange Beach, Alabama]]\n* [[Dauphin Island, Alabama]]\n* [[Carlsbad, California]]\n* [[Corona Del Mar, California]]\n* [[Coronado, California]]\n* [[Dana Point, California]]\n* [[Laguna Beach, California]]\n* [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] ([[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] district)\n* [[Malibu, California]]\n* [[Montecito, California]]\n* [[Newport Beach, California]]\n* [[Pebble Beach, California]]\n* [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] ([[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla]], [[Pacific Beach, San Diego, California|Pacific Beach]], [[Mission Beach, San Diego, California|Mission Beach]] and [[Ocean Beach, San Diego, California|Ocean Beach]] neighborhoods)\n* [[Santa Monica, California]]\n* [[Mystic, Connecticut]]\n* [[Bethany Beach, Delaware]]\n* [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]]\n* [[Clearwater, Florida]]\n* [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]\n* [[Key West, Florida]]\n* [[Marco Island, Florida]]\n* [[Miami Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Palm Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Panama City, Florida]]\n* [[Panama City Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Pensacola Beach, Florida]]\n* [[St. Augustine, Florida]]\n* [[Saint Petersburg, Florida]]\n* [[Siesta Key, Florida]]\n* [[Tampa, Florida]]\n* [[Palm Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Sea Island, Georgia]]\n* [[Tybee Island, Georgia]]\n* [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii]]\n* [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]\n* [[Ocean City, Maryland]]\n* [[Martha's Vineyard]], Massachusetts\n* [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]]\n* [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]\n* [[Allenhurst, New Jersey]]\n* [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]]\n* [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]\n* [[Cape May, New Jersey]]\n* [[Deal, New Jersey]]\n* [[Elberon, New Jersey]]\n* [[Loch Arbour, New Jersey]]\n* [[Long Beach Island, New Jersey]]\n* [[Long Branch, New Jersey]]\n* [[Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey|Point Pleasant, New Jersey]]\n* [[Sea Isle City, New Jersey]]\n* [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]]\n* [[Wildwood, New Jersey]]\n* [[Fire Island, New York]]\n* [[The Hamptons]], New York\n* [[Bald Head Island, North Carolina]]\n* [[Figure Eight Island, North Carolina]]\n* [[Nags Head, North Carolina]]\n* [[Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina]]\n* [[Seaside, Oregon]]\n* [[Newport, Rhode Island]]\n* [[Folly Beach, South Carolina]]\n* [[Hilton Head, South Carolina]]\n* [[Isle of Palms, South Carolina]]\n* [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]\n* [[Galveston, Texas]]\n* [[South Padre Island, Texas]]\n* [[Virginia Beach|Virginia Beach, Virginia]]\n}}\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n[[File:Quarteira-Algarve.jpg|thumb|[[Quarteira]]]]\n\n*[http://palmgardenresort.com.vn Palm Garden Resort], [[Hoi An]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of beaches]]\n*[[Ski resort]]\n*[[Tourism]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{Cite news|title=Wish you were (back) here?|author=Tom Geoghegan|publisher=BBC News|date=21 August 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk./2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5260198.stm}} &mdash; Geoghegan looks at the economy of British seaside resorts and considers a possible resurgence in their popularity.\n*{{Cite web|work=British History|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk./history/british/victorians/seaside_01.shtml|title=The Victorian Seaside|author=Professor John Walton|date=1 March 2001|publisher=BBC}} \u2014 Walton looks at the Victorian traditions that underpin British seaside holidays.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Seaside resorts}}\n\n\n{{Tourism}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seaside Resort}}\n[[Category:Seaside resorts| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A resort located on the coast}}\nA '''seaside resort''' is a [[resort town]] or [[resort]] [[village]], or [[resort]] [[hotel]], located on the [[coast]].

This trend was praised and artistically elevated by the new [[Romanticism|romantic]] ideal of the picturesque landscape; [[Jane Austen]]'s unfinished novel ''[[Sanditon]]'' is an example of that. Later, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s long-standing patronage of the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Ramsgate]] in [[Kent]] ensured that a seaside residence was considered as a highly fashionable possession for those wealthy enough to afford more than one home.\n\n===Seaside resorts for the middle and working classes===\n[[File:The promenade, Blackpool, Lancashire, England, ca. 1898.jpg|thumb|The [[Blackpool]] [[Promenade]] c. 1898]]\nThe extension of this form of leisure to the middle and working classes began with the development of the railways in the 1840s; they offered cheap travel to fast-growing resort towns. In particular, the [[Blackpool Branch Line|branch line]] to the small seaside town of [[Blackpool]] from [[Poulton-le-Fylde]] led to a sustained economic and demographic boom. A sudden influx of visitors arriving by rail motivated entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and rapid growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blackpool History |publisher=[[Blackpool Tourist Office]]|url=http://www.blackpooltourism.com/resources/files/2_Blackpool%20History.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705082737/http://www.blackpooltourism.com/resources/files/2_Blackpool%20History.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe growth was intensified by the practice among the Lancashire [[cotton mill]] owners of closing the factories for a week every year to service and repair machinery. These became known as [[wakes week]]s. Each town's mills would close for a different week, allowing Blackpool to manage a steady and reliable stream of visitors over a prolonged period in the summer. A prominent feature of the resort was the [[promenade]] and the [[pleasure pier]]s, where an eclectic variety of performances vied for the people's attention. In 1863, the [[North Pier, Blackpool|North Pier]] in Blackpool was completed, rapidly becoming a centre of attraction for elite{{clarify|date=July 2019}} visitors. [[Central Pier, Blackpool|Central Pier]] was completed in 1868, with a theatre and a large open-air dance floor.<ref name=Rough597>{{harvnb|Andrews et al.|2002|p=597}}.</ref>\n\nMany popular beach resorts were equipped with [[bathing machine]]s, because even the all-covering [[swimsuit|beachwear]] of the period was considered immodest.\n\nBy the end of the century the English coastline had over 100 large resort towns, some with populations exceeding 50,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Sea/articles/walton.html|title=The seaside resort: a British cultural export|author=John K.

The [[French Riviera]] on the Mediterranean had already become a popular destination for the British upper class by the end of the 18th century. In 1864, the first railway to [[Nice]] was completed, making the Riviera accessible to visitors from all over Europe. By 1874, foreign residents in Nice, mostly British, numbered 25,000. The coastline became renowned for attracting the royalty of Europe, including [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]].<ref>Michael Nelson, ''Queen Victoria and the Discovery of the Riviera'', Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2007.</ref>\n[[File:Ahlbeck_Strandk\u00f6rbe_2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Strandkorb]] became a symbol of seaside tourism by the end of the 19th century, especially on the southern [[Baltic Sea]] coast.]]\nIn the United States, early seaside resorts in the late 1800s catered to the wealthy, including city businessmen. [[Cape May]], New Jersey became one of the first coastal resorts in the United States, when regular steamboat traffic on the [[Delaware River]] began after the War of 1812. Early visitors to Cape May included [[Henry Clay]] in 1847, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1849. By 1880, [[Henry Flagler]] had extended several rail lines southward down the US Atlantic coastline, enticing northern upper-class families south to subtropical Florida. The [[Florida East Coast Railway]] brought northern tourists to [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in greater numbers, and by 1887 Flagler began to build two large ornate hotels in St. Augustine, the 540-room [[Ponce de Leon Hotel]] and the [[Hotel Alcazar]], and bought the [[Casa Monica Hotel]] the next year.\n\nContinental European attitudes towards gambling and nudity tended to be more lax than in Britain, and British and French entrepreneurs were quick to exploit the possibilities. In 1863, the Prince of [[Monaco]], [[Charles III, Prince of Monaco|Charles III]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Blanc]], a French businessman, arranged for [[steamship]]s and carriages to take visitors from Nice to Monaco, where large luxury hotels, gardens and casinos were built. The place was renamed{{fact|date=July 2019}} [[Monte Carlo]]. Commercial seabathing also spread to other areas of the [[United States]] and parts of the [[British Empire]] such as [[Australia]], where [[surfing]] became popular in the early 20th century. By the 1970s cheap and affordable air travel was the catalyst for the growth of a truly global tourism market.\n\n[[Recreational fishing]] and leisure boat pursuits have recently become very lucrative, and traditional [[fishing village]]s are often well positioned to take advantage of this. For example, [[Destin, Florida|Destin]], on the coast of [[Florida]], has evolved from an [[artisanal fishing]] village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats.<ref>[http://www.destinchamber.com/destin/history-fishing.asp History of the World\u2019s Luckiest Fishing Village] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116180137/http://www.destinchamber.com/destin/history-fishing.asp |date=16 November 2007 }} The Destin Area Chamber of Commerce.

Nevertheless, a connection with the sea lies at this heart of seasideness, and anecdotally it appears to be something shared by modern societies; it is a common theme in literature and the arts. The case-study centred on Morecambe, a once popular Lancastrian resort on the North-West coast of England, which saw a dramatic decline in visitor numbers in the late 20th century and regeneration at the start of the 21st century. One could argue that such resorts, like any destination, need to understand the motivation and experiences of visitors and this is one way in which an understanding of seasideness may be useful.\n\n==Seaside resorts around the world==\n===Australia===\n[[File:Hyams_beach.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Hyams Beach]] in the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], which is renowned for its brilliantly white sand.]]\n[[File:Manly_Beach_and_water.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Manly Beach]] in [[Sydney]], a popular beach spot.]]\n[[File:Gold_Coast,_2015.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Surfers Paradise]], one of the most popular and frequently visited tourist spot in Australia.]]\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*[[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] ([[Surfers Paradise]])\n*[[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]\n*[[Jervis Bay]] ([[Hyams Beach]])\n*[[Tangalooma, Queensland|Tangalooma]]\n*[[Queenscliff, Victoria]]\n*[[Agnes Water, Queensland|Agnes Water]]\n*[[St Kilda Beach, Victoria|St Kilda Beach]]\n*[[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]]\n*[[Byron Bay]]\n*[[Central Coast, New South Wales|Central Coast]] ([[The Entrance, New South Wales|The Entrance]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Ettalong Beach]])\n*[[Batemans Bay]]\n*[[Port Douglas]]\n*[[Port Macquarie]]\n*[[Ballina, New South Wales]]\n*[[Fitzroy Island, Queensland|Fitzroy Island]]\n*[[Sydney]] ([[Bondi Beach]], [[Manly Beach]], [[Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales|Brighton-Le-Sands]], [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]])\n*[[Wollongong]]\n*[[Noosa Heads]]\n*[[Coffs Harbour]]\n*[[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]]\n*[[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]]\n*[[Nelson, Victoria|Nelson]]\n*[[Nelson Bay]]\n*[[South West Rocks, New South Wales|South West Rocks]]\n*[[Yamba, New South Wales|Yamba]]\n*[[Lizard Island National Park]]\n*[[Cairns]]\n*[[Airlie Beach]]\n*[[Kiama]]\n*[[Forster, New South Wales|Forster]]\n*[[Culburra Beach]]\n*[[Tweed Heads]]\n}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\nPopular seaside resorts on the Flemish coast of [[West Flanders|West-Vlaanderen]] exist at the famous [[Knokke]], [[Ostend]] and also [[De Panne]] and coastal towns along the [[North Sea]] served by the coastal tramway [[Coast Tram (Belgium)|Kustram]] run by [[De Lijn]].\n[[File:Oostende panoramic view.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|[[Ostend]] beach and the promenade pier, panoramic view]]\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n[[file:Nessebar lead collage.jpg|thumb|[[Nesebar]]]]\n[[file:Sanny beach.

Blackpool catered for workers from across industrial [[Northern England]], who packed its beaches and [[promenade]]. Other northern seaside towns (for example [[Bridlington]], [[Cleethorpes]], [[Morecambe]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Skegness]], and [[Southport]]) shared in the success of this new concept, especially from trade during [[wakes week]]s. The concept spread rapidly to other British coastal towns, including several on the coast of [[North Wales]], notably [[Rhyl]], and [[Llandudno]], the largest resort in [[Wales]] and known as \"The Queen of the Welsh Resorts\", from as early as 1864.<ref>Ivor Wynne Jones. ''Llandudno Queen of Welsh Resorts'' (chapter 3 page 19) referring to the ''Liverpool Mercury''</ref>\nAs the 19th century progressed, British [[working class]] [[day-tripper]]s travelled on organised trips such as [[railway excursion]]s, or by [[Steamboat|steamer]], for which long [[pier]]s were erected so that the ships bringing the trade could berth.\n\nAnother area notable for its seaside resorts was (and is) the [[Firth of Clyde]], outside Glasgow. Glaswegians would take a ferry \"doon the watter\" from the city, down the [[River Clyde]], to the Firth's islands and peninsulas and beyond, such as [[Cowal]], [[Isle of Bute|Bute]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], and [[Kintyre]]. Resorts include [[Rothesay, Argyll and Bute|Rothesay]], [[Lamlash]], [[Whiting Bay]], [[Dunoon]], [[Tighnabruaich]], [[Carrick Castle]], [[Helensburgh]], [[Largs]], [[Millport, Cumbrae|Millport]] and [[Campbeltown]]. In contrast to many resorts, some on the Firth of Clyde have continued to prosper as middle-class [[commuter town]]s.\n\nSome resorts, especially those more southerly such as [[Hastings]], [[Worthing]], [[Eastbourne]], [[Bournemouth]] and [[Brighton]] were built as new towns or extended by local landowners to appeal to wealthier holidaymakers. Others came about due to their proximity to large urban areas of population, such as [[Southend-on-Sea]], which became increasingly popular with residents of London once rail links were established to it allowing day trips from London. The sunshine and sea air were seen by Victorians as beneficial for health,<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24214646|title=Oh, why do we like to be beside the seaside?|date=28 September 2013|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> and resorts such as [[Ventnor]] owed their growth to a visit being considered as treatment for chest complaints. Owing to its generally better climate, the south coast has many seaside towns, the most being in [[Sussex]].\n\nIn the later 20th century, the popularity of the British seaside resort declined for the same reason that it first flourished: advances in transport. The greater accessibility of foreign holiday destinations, through [[package holiday]]s and, more recently, European [[low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], makes it easier to holiday abroad. Despite the loyalty of returning holidaymakers, resorts such as Blackpool have struggled to compete against the hotter weather of [[Southern Europe]] and the [[sunbelt]] in the [[United States]]. Now, many symbols of the traditional British resort ([[holiday camp]]s, [[Pier#Pleasure piers|end-of-the-pier shows]] and saucy [[Seaside postcard#British seaside postcards|postcard]]s) are regarded by some as drab and outdated; the skies are imagined to be overcast and the beach windswept. This is not always true; for example [[Broadstairs]] in [[Kent]] has retained much of its old world charm with [[Punch and Judy]] and [[donkey rides]] and still remains popular, being only one hour from the [[M25 motorway|M25]]. Brighton has also seen a fall in visitor numbers over the past couple of years.\n<ref>Drop in day visitors to Brighton and Hove \u2013 BBC News, 11 October 2016: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-37619384</ref> <ref>Day visitors to Brighton and Hove fall by a million in a year \u2013 Brighton Argus, 11 October 2016: https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14794028.day-visitors-to-brighton-and-hove-fall-by-a-million/</ref> The city has also experienced a rise in homelessness, especially noticeable on the city streets and in green spaces where tents have been erected.<ref>Homeless camps and human excrement left in city centre: The Argus, Brighton, 17 August 2019: https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/17843597.homeless-camps-human-excrement-left-city-centre/</ref> Brighton now has the second highest homeless population in England, <ref>Brighton has the second highest homeless population in England \u2013 Independent, 25 January 2018: https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/news/brighton-has-second-largest-homeless-population-in-england-1-8347912</ref> which has resulted to the City Council applying to become the first UK city to pass a \u2018Homeless Bill of Rights.\u2019<ref>Political row over increasing homelessness in Brighton and Hove, 9 October 2018: https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/news/political-row-over-increasing-homelessness-in-brighton-and-hove-1-8661688</ref>\n<ref>Brighton Could Be the First UK City to Pass a 'Homeless Bill of Rights' : https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/zmjb43/homeless-bill-of-rights-brighton</ref>\n\nMany seaside towns have turned to other entertainment industries, and some of them have a good deal of nightlife. The cinemas and theatres often remain to become host to a number of pubs, bars, restaurants and nightclubs. Most of their entertainment facilities cater to local people, and the beaches are still popular in summer. Although international tourism turned people away from British seaside towns, it also brought in inward foreign travel; many seaside towns offer [[foreign language]] schools, the students of which often return to vacation and sometimes to settle.\nMany people can now afford more time off, and 'second holidays' and short breaks, resulting in increased tourism in British seaside towns. Many young people and students can take short holidays and discover the town's nightlife. Many seaside towns have large shopping centres which also attract people from a wide area. Day trippers still come to the coastal towns, but on a more local scale than during the 19th century. Many coastal towns are also popular retirement hotspots where older people reside permanently or take short breaks in the autumn months. Other English coastal  towns have successfully sought to project a sense of their unique character. In particular, [[Southwold]] on the [[Suffolk]] coast is an active yet peaceful retirement haven with an emphasis on calmness, quiet countryside and jazz. [[Weymouth, Dorset]] offers itself as 'the gateway to the Jurassic Coast', Britain's only natural World Heritage Site. [[Newquay]] in [[Cornwall]] offers itself as the 'surfing capital of Britain', hosting international surfing events on its shores.\n\n[[Torbay]] in South [[Devon]] is known is also known as the [[English Riviera]]. Consisting of the towns of [[Torquay]], [[Paignton]] with its pier and [[Brixham]], the bay has 20 beaches and coves along its {{convert|22|mi|km|0|adj=on}} coastline, ranging from small secluded coves to the larger promenade-style seafronts of Torquay's Torre Abbey Sands and Paignton Sands.\n\nHowever, British seaside resorts have faced increasingly stiff competition from sunnier resorts overseas since the 1970s. In 1975, some 9,000 British families holidayed abroad, but by the mid-1980s that figure had risen to some 20,000. A decade later, it was around 30,000.{{fact|date=July 2019}}{{Fix|text=far more than that}} This was largely due to the falling price of air travel which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] ([[1979 United Kingdom general election|elected in 1979]]) had allowed.{{Fix|text=What??}}<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4446012.stm | work=BBC News | title=Thatcher years in graphics | date=18 November 2005}}</ref> This decline is discussed in the [[Morrissey]] song '[[Everyday Is Like Sunday]]' where daily life in the resort is likened to the emptiness of streets once associated with the shop closures on Sunday.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Wide image|Coronado panorama2.jpg|900px|[[Hotel Del Coronado]] in [[Coronado, California]], 1908}}\nWith 3,800 miles (6100&nbsp;km) of coastline, the USA mainland has hundreds of seaside resorts on three coasts, [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Pacific ocean]]. Unlike in many smaller countries, the seaside resorts in the USA are located in various climate zones, with great differences in topography and environment. Many American seaside resorts are popular destination across the world, known for their climates, culture, and entertainment opportunities.\n\nAmerican seaside resorts first developed near the big industrial cities on the upper East Coast like New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. [[Cape May]], New Jersey, and [[Provincetown]], MA, were two of the first seaside resorts in the 1800s that catered to city workers in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Cape May is often called Americas \"first seaside resort\". The early emergence of Cape May as a summer resort was due to easy transport by water from Philadelphia to the Atlantic Ocean. Early Cape May vacationers were carried to the town on sloops from Philadelphia, and water transport was also easy from New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and points south. The resort business in Cape May began to thrive when regular steamboat traffic on the Delaware River began after the War of 1812. Early visitors to Cape May included [[Henry Clay]] in 1847, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1849. Today, the [[Cape May Historic District]] is one of the largest and well preserved examples of Victorian architecture in the United States.\n\nOn the southern Atlantic coast, [[Henry Flagler]] had the idea to make [[St. Augustine, Florida]] a winter resort. He built several rail lines south, and combined them with existing lines to create the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] in 1885. He built a railroad bridge over the [[St. Johns River]] in 1888, opening up the Atlantic coast of Florida to development. In 1887 Flagler began construction of two large ornate hotels in St. Augustine, the 540-room [[Ponce de Leon Hotel]] and the [[Hotel Alcazar]], and bought the [[Casa Monica Hotel]] the next year.\n\nIn [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], the community of [[Coconut Grove, Miami|Cocoanut (now Coconut) Grove]] began development as a resort town in the 1880s with the building of the Bayview House (aka Peacock Inn) which closed in 1902. Visitors to the greater Miami area then flocked to Camp Biscayne (in Coconut Grove), the [[Royal Palm Hotel (Miami)|Royal Palm Hotel]] in [[Downtown Miami]], and other resort hotels in Miami, as well as in smaller numbers to the [[Florida Keys]]. In 1894, the lavish [[Royal Poinciana Hotel]] opened in Palm Beach, Florida, with rave reviews from wealthy New York tourists who picked oranges in January to their delight. On the Gulf of Mexico, the City of Galveston was emerging as a booming city, and in 1882, architect [[Nicholas J. Clayton]] designed the [[Beach Hotel (Galveston)|Beach Hotel]]. By 1888, Galveston, TX was a wealthy city and booming seaside playground for wealthy [[New Orleans]] businessmen.\n\nOn the Pacific coast in California, in April 1886, Babcock and Story created the Coronado Beach Company, which sought to develop Coronado as a seaside resort. In the mid-1880s, the San Diego region was in the midst of one of its first real estate booms. The [[Hotel del Coronado]] was built in March 1887, with Babcock's visions for the hotel built around a courtyard of tropical trees, shrubs and flowers, with a dining wing to give full value to the view of the ocean, bay and city. By 1915, more hotels were built along the Los Angeles coastline to serve the wealthy tourists and Hollywood film makers. In May 1926, brothers E.A. \"Jack\" Harter and T.D. \"Til\" Harter built the [[Hotel Casa del Mar]] in Santa Monica, at a cost of $2 million, creating one of the most successful beach clubs in Southern California, popular with socialites and Hollywood celebrities.\n\nIn the 1920s,  Carl Fisher was the main promoter of [[Miami Beach]], and helped to develop the city as a seaside resort. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them the [[Flamingo Hotel]]. In 1926, the massive [[The Breakers hotel]] in Palm Beach had been rebuilt, and there was a large northern tourist industry in coastal southern Florida.  By the 1950s with increasing auto travel, more seaside resorts grew along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, while small, declining industrial ports were being rebuilt. In 1954, the [[Fontainebleau Miami Beach]], and was considered, (at that time) the most lavish seaside hotel in the world.\n\nIn the modern era, hundreds of seaside resorts now string the Gulf, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts of the United States. Many Americans move with the seasons when they visit seaside resorts, vacationing in northern seaside areas in the warm season (April through October), and then moving to southern areas in the cold season (November through March). Many seaside resorts in Florida and California however, see travelers all year.\n\nSome examples of well-known and sought-after American coastal resort towns are:\n[[File:Miamimetroarea.jpg|right|thumb|[[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]]]]\n[[File:Newport Beach Aerial photo 001 by Don Ramey Logan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Newport Beach, CA|Newport Beach]]]]\n[[File:LaJollaSkyline.jpg|right|thumb|[[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]]]]\n[[File:Rehoboth Beach at Delaware Avenue.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]]]]\n[[File:Myrtle Beach, 8 a.m..jpg|right|thumb|[[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]]]]\n[[File:South Padre Island beach.jpg|right|thumb|[[South Padre Island, Texas|South Padre Island]]]]\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]]\n* [[Orange Beach, Alabama]]\n* [[Dauphin Island, Alabama]]\n* [[Carlsbad, California]]\n* [[Corona Del Mar, California]]\n* [[Coronado, California]]\n* [[Dana Point, California]]\n* [[Laguna Beach, California]]\n* [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] ([[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] district)\n* [[Malibu, California]]\n* [[Montecito, California]]\n* [[Newport Beach, California]]\n* [[Pebble Beach, California]]\n* [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] ([[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla]], [[Pacific Beach, San Diego, California|Pacific Beach]], [[Mission Beach, San Diego, California|Mission Beach]] and [[Ocean Beach, San Diego, California|Ocean Beach]] neighborhoods)\n* [[Santa Monica, California]]\n* [[Mystic, Connecticut]]\n* [[Bethany Beach, Delaware]]\n* [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]]\n* [[Clearwater, Florida]]\n* [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]\n* [[Key West, Florida]]\n* [[Marco Island, Florida]]\n* [[Miami Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Palm Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Panama City, Florida]]\n* [[Panama City Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Pensacola Beach, Florida]]\n* [[St. Augustine, Florida]]\n* [[Saint Petersburg, Florida]]\n* [[Siesta Key, Florida]]\n* [[Tampa, Florida]]\n* [[Palm Beach, Florida]]\n* [[Sea Island, Georgia]]\n* [[Tybee Island, Georgia]]\n* [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii]]\n* [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]\n* [[Ocean City, Maryland]]\n* [[Martha's Vineyard]], Massachusetts\n* [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]]\n* [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]\n* [[Allenhurst, New Jersey]]\n* [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]]\n* [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]\n* [[Cape May, New Jersey]]\n* [[Deal, New Jersey]]\n* [[Elberon, New Jersey]]\n* [[Loch Arbour, New Jersey]]\n* [[Long Beach Island, New Jersey]]\n* [[Long Branch, New Jersey]]\n* [[Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey|Point Pleasant, New Jersey]]\n* [[Sea Isle City, New Jersey]]\n* [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]]\n* [[Wildwood, New Jersey]]\n* [[Fire Island, New York]]\n* [[The Hamptons]], New York\n* [[Bald Head Island, North Carolina]]\n* [[Figure Eight Island, North Carolina]]\n* [[Nags Head, North Carolina]]\n* [[Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina]]\n* [[Seaside, Oregon]]\n* [[Newport, Rhode Island]]\n* [[Folly Beach, South Carolina]]\n* [[Hilton Head, South Carolina]]\n* [[Isle of Palms, South Carolina]]\n* [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]\n* [[Galveston, Texas]]\n* [[South Padre Island, Texas]]\n* [[Virginia Beach|Virginia Beach, Virginia]]\n}}\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n[[File:Quarteira-Algarve.jpg|thumb|[[Quarteira]]]]\n\n*[http://palmgardenresort.com.vn Palm Garden Resort], [[Hoi An]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of beaches]]\n*[[Ski resort]]\n*[[Tourism]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{Cite news|title=Wish you were (back) here?|author=Tom Geoghegan|publisher=BBC News|date=21 August 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk./2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5260198.stm}} &mdash; Geoghegan looks at the economy of British seaside resorts and considers a possible resurgence in their popularity.\n*{{Cite web|work=British History|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk./history/british/victorians/seaside_01.shtml|title=The Victorian Seaside|author=Professor John Walton|date=1 March 2001|publisher=BBC}} \u2014 Walton looks at the Victorian traditions that underpin British seaside holidays.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Seaside resorts}}\n\n\n{{Tourism}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seaside Resort}}\n[[Category:Seaside resorts| ]]\n", "name_user": "Ronbb345", "label": "safe", "comment": "Islands aren't resorts.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort"}

All day and night he pondered whether he would or would not fight a shark because he had never fought a shark without his religious lucky charm. The Spanish had increased their offer to 3 bars of Spanish gold. In the morning, as the shark came into the bay, the spectators who were gathered on the beach screamed and yelled in anticipation. Encouraged and unable to stop himself he jumped into the sea pursuing the shark and fought the shark with his bare hands, as he had done so many times before. Only this time he was nearly killed when the shark hit him with his tail. He received his prize of gold, he healed, but never again fought a shark in the open sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00078480/00001/25|language=es|title=Selecci\u00f3n de Leyendas puertorrique\u00f1as - El Matador de Tiburones (1640)|page=27|website=ufdc|access-date=2019-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043810/http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00078480/00001/25|archive-date=2019-03-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nAguada is located in the west coast of the island of [[Puerto Rico]].

The upper field features a cross, with the interlaced arms of [[Christ]] and Father Saint Francis. It is taken from the badge of the [[Order of Friars Minor]]. It represents the motto \"Pax et Bonum\", which means \"peace and good will between man and the Redeemer\". The sun below the cross symbolizes the light that brightens the world. The lower part of the shield consists of five ships that symbolize the [[Christopher columbus#Second voyage|second voyage of Christopher Columbus]], who allegedly arrived at the western \"Guaniquilla\" coast on November 19, 1493 to gather water. Although the precise location is disputed, the Aguada wells is a plausible site for the actual event.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe mural crown in the upper part of the shield signifies the title of [[village]], that was given to this town by [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] in 1778. The official colors of the shield are: red, which stands for the fraternal love in Aguada; gold, for the Spanish royalty in Puerto Rico; green, for the island's hope and fertility; black, for the wooden beam of the cross; blue, for the sky and the kingship of God; and white, for Christ's purity and the purity of the people of the town toward the cultural patrimony.<ref>\"Banderas y escudos municipales\" (Flags and Municipal Shields) by Anisa Productions Inc.</ref><ref>[http://aguada.gov.pr/historiayturismo/historiadeaguada/escudo-de-aguada/ Escudo de Aguada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004165830/http://aguada.gov.pr/historiayturismo/historiadeaguada/escudo-de-aguada/ |date=2015-10-04 }} on Aguada Official website</ref>\n\n===Nicknames===\n\nAguada has various nicknames, most of them pertaining to its origins. One is ''\"La Villa del Sotomayor\"'' (\"Sotomayor Village\"), which was the name originally given to it by Crist\u00f3bal de Sotomayor during its colonization in 1510. It is also called ''\"Villa de San Francisco de As\u00eds de la Aguada\"'', which was the name given to the region when the Franciscan friars took control of it. Aguada is also called ''\"La Ciudad del Descubrimiento\"'' (\"City of the Discovery\") in reference to it being one of the possible places where [[Christopher Columbus]] entered the island. Other nicknames are ''\"El Pueblo Playero\"'' (\"The Beach Town\") for its many beaches, and ''\"La Ciudad del Vaticano\"'' (\"The Vatican City\") for being considered the \"capital of [[Catholicism]]\" in the island.<ref>[http://www.filirealty.com/Pueblos/Aguada/Datos.htm Aguada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416030343/http://www.filirealty.com/Pueblos/Aguada/Datos.htm |date=April 16, 2009 }} on FiliRealty</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pr.gov/Directorios/Pages/DirectoriodeMunicipios.aspx|title=Directorio de Municipios de Puerto Rico|website=pr.gov|access-date=2019-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315093910/http://www2.pr.gov/directorios/pages/directoriodemunicipios.aspx|archive-date=2019-03-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Anthem===\n\nThe [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Himno_de_Aguada_(Puerto_Rico) anthem] of Aguada was written by Rolando Acevedo Lorenzo.<ref>[http://www.salonhogar.com/est_soc/pr/pueblos/aguada/ Aguada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008095548/http://www.salonhogar.com/est_soc/pr/pueblos/aguada/ |date=2011-10-08 }} on Salon Hogar</ref>\n\n== Notable \"Aguade\u00f1os\" ==\n*[[Ismael Miranda]] -

The Spanish had increased their offer to 3 bars of Spanish gold. In the morning, as the shark came into the bay, the spectators who were gathered on the beach screamed and yelled in anticipation. Encouraged and unable to stop himself he jumped into the sea pursuing the shark and fought the shark with his bare hands, as he had done so many times before.

It is also called ''\"Villa de San Francisco de As\u00eds de la Aguada\"'', which was the name given to the region when the Franciscan friars took control of it. Aguada is also called ''\"La Ciudad del Descubrimiento\"'' (\"City of the Discovery\") in reference to it being one of the possible places where [[Christopher Columbus]] entered the island. Other nicknames are ''\"El Pueblo Playero\"'' (\"The Beach Town\") for its many beaches, and ''\"La Ciudad del Vaticano\"'' (\"The Vatican City\") for being considered the \"capital of [[Catholicism]]\" in the island.<ref>[http://www.filirealty.com/Pueblos/Aguada/Datos.htm Aguada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416030343/http://www.filirealty.com/Pueblos/Aguada/Datos.htm |date=April 16, 2009 }} on FiliRealty</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pr.gov/Directorios/Pages/DirectoriodeMunicipios.aspx|title=Directorio de Municipios de Puerto Rico|website=pr.gov|access-date=2019-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315093910/http://www2.pr.gov/directorios/pages/directoriodemunicipios.aspx|archive-date=2019-03-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Anthem===\n\nThe [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Himno_de_Aguada_(Puerto_Rico) anthem] of Aguada was written by Rolando Acevedo Lorenzo.<ref>[http://www.salonhogar.com/est_soc/pr/pueblos/aguada/ Aguada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008095548/http://www.salonhogar.com/est_soc/pr/pueblos/aguada/ |date=2011-10-08 }} on Salon Hogar</ref>\n\n== Notable \"Aguade\u00f1os\" ==\n*[[Ismael Miranda]] - Salsa Singer\n*[[Willie Hern\u00e1ndez|Guillermo \"Willie\" Hernandez]] - former [[Major League Baseball]](MLB) pitcher and winner of the 1984 American League MVP and Cy Young Awards.\n*[[Andr\u00e9s Torres]] - Major League Baseball Player (San Francisco Giants World Champions)\n*[[Zoilo Cajigas Sotomayor]] - [[Wood carving]] artist, especially religious figurines<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museodelossantos.org/santeros/espirituales-spiritual-1750-1970/cajigas-zoilo/ |title=Museo de Tallas de Santos |access-date=2018-08-05 |language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805083317/http://museodelossantos.org/santeros/espirituales-spiritual-1750-1970/cajigas-zoilo/ |archive-date=2018-08-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*Carlos Gonzalez, MD.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico|Geography}}\n*[[List of Puerto Ricans]]\n*[[History of Puerto Rico]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Aguada, Puerto Rico]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://pr.gov/Directorios//Pages/InfoMunicipio.aspx?PRIFA=M003 Puerto Rico Government Directory - Aguada]\n*[http://aguada.gov.pr/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/HISTORIA-DE-AGUADA.pdf Aguada Municipality Brochure (Spanish)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140717092734/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Link%20P.R/www.linktopr.com/aguada.html Proyecto Sal\u00f3n Hogar sobre Aguada (Spanish)]\n* [https://enciclopediapr.org/encyclopedia/municipio-de-aguada/ Photos of Aguada]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/municipiodeaguada Aguada Municipality on Facebook]\n\n{{Puerto Rico subdivisions}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Aguada, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1508]]\n[[Category:Aguadilla\u2013Isabela\u2013San Sebasti\u00e1n metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:1508 establishments in the Spanish Empire]]\n[[Category:Caribbean culture]]\n[[Category:North American folklore]]\n[[Category:Folklore by country]]\n[[Category:Latin American folklore]]\n[[Category:Folklore by region]]\n", "name_user": "The Eloquent Peasant", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCulture:lang temp +", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguada,_Puerto_Rico"}

It joined the [[World Figure Skating Championships]] in 1952, and became a [[Winter Olympic Games]] medal sport in 1976.  According to the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU), an ice dance team consists of \"one Lady and one Man\".<ref>S&P/ID 2018, p. 9</ref>{{refn|group=note|Women are referred to as ladies in ISU regulations and communications.}}\n\nIn the early 1900s, ice dancing was primarily a recreational sport in England, Europe, and the United States.  British ice dance teams dominated the sport throughout the 1950s and 1960s, then Soviet teams up until the 1990s.  In the 1980s and 1990s, there was an attempt by ice dancers, their coaches, and choreographers to move ice dance away from its ballroom origins to more theatrical performances, but the ISU pushed back by tightening rules and definitions of ice dance to emphasize its connection to ballroom dancing.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, ice dance lost much of its integrity as a sport after a series of judging scandals.  There were calls to suspend the sport for a year to deal with the dispute, which seemed to impact ice dance teams from North America the most.  Teams from North America began to dominate the sport starting in the early 2000s.\n\nBefore the [[2010\u201311 figure skating season]], there were three segments in ice dance competitions: the [[compulsory dance]] (CD), the [[original dance]] (OD), and the [[Free dance (ice dance)|free dance]] (FD). In 2010, the ISU voted to change the competition format by eliminating the CD and the OD and adding the new [[short dance]] (SD) segment to the competition schedule.  In 2018, the ISU voted to re-name the SD to the [[rhythm dance]] (RD).  Ice dance has required elements that ice dancers must perform during a competition and that make up a well-balanced skating program.  They include: the dance [[Figure skating lifts|lift]], the dance [[Figure skating spins|spin]], the [[step sequence]], [[Twizzle|twizzles]], and choreographic elements.  They must be performed in specific ways, as described in published communications by the ISU, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe ISU publishes violations and their points values yearly.  Deductions in ice dance include falls and interruptions, and violations in time, music, and clothing.\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Jackson Haines2.jpg|thumb|Jackson Haines, the \"father of figure skating\"]]\n\nThe roots of ice dance, like [[pairs skating]], are in the \"combined skating\" developed in the 19th century by skating clubs and organizations and by recreational social skating between couples and friends, who would skate [[waltzes]], marches, and other social dances together.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. xiv, p. 102</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, \"Ice dancing derives from the turn-of-the-century Viennese and English attempts to translate the waltz and other ballroom dances to the ice and to devise ballroom-style performances suitable for skates\".<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 221</ref>  Figure skating historian James Hines states that ice dance had its beginnings in hand-in-hand skating, a short-lived but popular disciple of figure skating in England in the 1890s; many of the positions used in ice dance today can be traced back to hand-in-hand skating.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 36</ref>  In 1836, the Oxford Skating Society published a simple program of figures for hand-in-hand skating.<ref name=\"hines2006-119\">Hines (2006), p. 119</ref>  The first steps in ice dance were similar to those used in ballroom dancing, so unlike modern ice dance, skaters tended to keep both feet on the ice most of the time, without the \"long and flowing edges associated with graceful figure skating\".<ref name=\"hines2006-120\">Hines (2006), p. 120</ref>  \n\nIn the late 1800s, American [[Jackson Haines]], known as \"the Father of Figure Skating\",<ref name=\"blakemore\">{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=The Man Who Invented Figure Skating Was Laughed Out of America |url=https://www.history.com/news/the-man-who-invented-figure-skating-was-laughed-out-of-america |website=History.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |accessdate=11 January 2020 |date=12 December 2017}}</ref> brought his style of skating to Europe, and taught people in Vienna, where he capitalized on their \"obsession with waltzing\",<ref name=\"blakemore\"/> how to dance on the ice, both singly and with partners.<ref name=\"blakemore\"/>  Haines introduced the American waltz, a simple four-step sequence, each step lasting one beat of music, repeated as the partners moved in a circular pattern, to Vienna.  By the 1880s, it and the Jackson Haines waltz, a variation of the American waltz, were among the most popular ice dances.<ref name=\"hines2006-120\"/>  Other popular ice dance steps included the [[mazurka]], a version of the Jackson Haines waltz developed in Sweden, and the three-step waltz, which was created in Paris in 1894 and was called \"the direct predecessor of ice dancing in the modern sense\".<ref name=\"hines2006-120\"/>\n\nIn the 1890s in Paris, a three-step waltz called the English waltz, which ice dance historian Cheryl Elton called \"the direct predecessor of modern ice dancing, featuring the speed and flowing edges that we see today\"<ref name=\"elton-1\">Elton, p. 1</ref> was created.  The English waltz became the standard for waltz skating competitions and was at first popular with inexperienced skaters, although skilled skaters made it more challenging by introducing more difficult steps such as [[Mohawk turn|mohawks]] and [[3 turn]]s.<ref name=\"hines2006-121\">Hines (2006), p. 121</ref><ref name=\"elton-1\"/>  Other early ice dances included the European waltz, inventor unknown, before the turn of the 20th century, and the ten-step, a precursor of the fourteen-step, both of which are still used in ice dance competitions today.<ref>Elton, p. 1-2</ref>  The killian, first skated in 1909 by Austrian [[Karl Schreiter]], was the last ice dance invented before [[World War I]] still being done today.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 123</ref>  According to Hines, the ten-step is the basis of the fourteen-step, the oldest dance still done in the sport.  The ten-step was created by Austrian champion [[Max Bohatsch]] in Vienna.<ref name=\"hines2006-122\">Hines (2006), p. 122</ref>  Also in the 1890s, combined and hand-in-hand skating moved skating away from \"the static confines of basic figures to continuous movement around a rink\".<ref name=\"hines2006-119\"/>  Hines insisted that the popularity of skating waltzes, which depended upon the speed and flow across the ice of couples in dance positions and not just on holding hands with a partner, \"dealt a death knell to hand-in-hand skating\".<ref name=\"hines2006-119\"/>  By the end of the 19th century, waltzing competitions became popular throughout the world.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 121</ref>  According to Hines, Vienna was \"the dancing capital of Europe, both on and off skates\" in the 19th century.<ref name=\"hines2006-122\"/>\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Eva Romanov\u00e1 and Pavel Roman 1965.jpg|upright=1.0|thumb|left|[[Eva Romanov\u00e1]] and [[Pavel Roman]] in 1965]]\n\nBy the early 1900s, ice dancing was popular around the world and was primarily a recreational sport, although during the 1920s, local clubs in Britain and the U.S. conducted informal dance contests in waltzes and in marches such as the ten-step, the fourteen-step, and the killian, which were the only three dances used in competition until the 1930s.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 221</ref><ref>Hines (2006), p. 124</ref>  Recreational skating became more popular during the 1930s in England, and new and more difficult set-pattern dances, which later were used in compulsory dances during competitions, were developed.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 222</ref>  Hines stated that the development of new ice dances was necessary to expand upon the three dances already developed; three British teams\u2014[[Erik van der Wyden]] and [[Eva Keats]], [[Reginald Wilkie]] and [[Daphne B. Wallis]], and [[Robert Dench]] and [[Rosemarie Stewart]]\u2014created one-fourth of the dances used in [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) competitions by 2006.  In 1933, the Westminster Skating Club conducted a competition encouraging the creation of new dances.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 123\u2014124</ref>  Beginning in the mid-1930s, national organizations began to introduce skating proficiency tests in set-pattern dances, improve the judging of dance tests, and oversee competitions.  The first national competitions occurred in England in 1934, Canada in 1935, the U.S. in 1936, and Austria in 1937.  These competitions included one or more compulsory dances, the original dance, and the free dance.<ref name=\"elton-2\">Elton, p. 2</ref><ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 222</ref><ref name=\"hines2011-102\">Hines (2011), p. 102</ref>  By the late 1930s, ice dancers swelled memberships in skating clubs throughout the world, and as Hines stated, \"became the backbone of skating clubs\".<ref>Hines (2006), p. 124</ref>\n\nThe ISU began to develop rules, standards, and international tests for ice dance in the 1950s.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\">Kestnbaum, p. 223</ref>  The first international ice dancing competition occurred as a special event at the [[1950 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships in 1950]] in London; [[Lois Waring]] and [[Michael McGean]] of the U.S. won the event, much to the embarrassment of the British, who considered themselves the best ice dancers in the world.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 173\u2014174</ref>  A second event was planned the following year, at the [[1951 World Figure Skating Championships|1951 World Championships]] in Milan; [[Jean Westwood (figure skater)|Jean Westwood]] and [[Lawrence Demmy]] of Great Britain came in first place.<ref name=\"hines2006-174\" />  Ice dance, with the CD and FD segments, was formally added to the [[1952 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships in 1952]].<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\"/>  Westwood and Demmy won the first championship; they went on to dominate ice dancing and win the next four World Championships.<ref name=\"hines2011-102\"/><ref name=\"hines2006-174\">Hines (2006), p. 174</ref>  British teams dominated ice dance throughout the 1950s and the 1960s; they won 12 out of the first 16 championships;<ref name=\"elton-2\"/> however, in 1962, [[Eva Romanova]] and [[Pavel Roman]] of Czechoslovakia were the first non-British ice dancers to win a world title.<ref>Hines (2011), p.xxxi</ref>\n\n===1970s to 1990s===\nIce dance became an Olympic sport in 1976; [[Lyudmila Pakhomova]] and [[Aleksandr Gorshkov (figure skater)|Alexandr Gorshkov]] from the Soviet Union were the first gold medalists.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\"/><ref name=\"hines2011-xxvi\">Hines (2011), p. xxvi</ref><ref name=\"russell\">{{cite news |last1=Russell |first1=Susan D. |title=Lyudmila Pakhomova and Aleksandr Gorshkov: The Heroes of Olympic Ice Dance |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234703/http://www.ifsmagazine.com/articles/32605-lyudmila-pakhomova-and-aleksandr-gorshkov |accessdate=20 August 2018 |work=International Figure Skating |date=5 January 2013}}</ref>  The Soviets dominated ice dancing during most of the 1970s; as they did in pair skating, they won every Worlds and Olympic title between 1970 and 1978, and won medals at every competition between 1976 and 1982.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 217, 218</ref>  In 1984, British dancers [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]], who Hines called \"the greatest ice dancers in the history of the sport\",<ref>Hines (2006), p. 240</ref> briefly interrupted Soviet domination of ice dance by \"famously winning the Olympic gold medal\"<ref name=\"elton-2\"/> at the [[1984 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games in Sarajevo]], with their free dance to [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'',<ref name=\"elton-2\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=1984: British ice couple score Olympic gold |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_4156000/4156053.stm |accessdate=11 January 2020 |work=BBC |date=14 February 1984}}</ref> which has been called \"probably the most well known single program in the history of ice dance\".<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\">Kestnbaum, p. 228</ref>  Hines stated, about Torvill and Dean, that they dramatically altered \"established concepts of ice dancing\"<ref>Hines (2006), p. 239</ref> with their innovative choreography.\n\n[[File:Jayne_Torvill_and_Christopher_Dean_-_Dancing_on_Ice_2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|[[Torvill and Dean]] performing in 2011]]\n\nThroughout the 1970s, there was a movement in ice dance away from its ballroom roots to a more theatrical style.

It joined the [[World Figure Skating Championships]] in 1952, and became a [[Winter Olympic Games]] medal sport in 1976.  According to the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU), an ice dance team consists of \"one Lady and one Man\".<ref>S&P/ID 2018, p. 9</ref>{{refn|group=note|Women are referred to as ladies in ISU regulations and communications.}}\n\nIn the early 1900s, ice dancing was primarily a recreational sport in England, Europe, and the United States.  British ice dance teams dominated the sport throughout the 1950s and 1960s, then Soviet teams up until the 1990s.  In the 1980s and 1990s, there was an attempt by ice dancers, their coaches, and choreographers to move ice dance away from its ballroom origins to more theatrical performances, but the ISU pushed back by tightening rules and definitions of ice dance to emphasize its connection to ballroom dancing.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, ice dance lost much of its integrity as a sport after a series of judging scandals.  There were calls to suspend the sport for a year to deal with the dispute, which seemed to impact ice dance teams from North America the most.  Teams from North America began to dominate the sport starting in the early 2000s.\n\nBefore the [[2010\u201311 figure skating season]], there were three segments in ice dance competitions: the [[compulsory dance]] (CD), the [[original dance]] (OD), and the [[Free dance (ice dance)|free dance]] (FD). In 2010, the ISU voted to change the competition format by eliminating the CD and the OD and adding the new [[short dance]] (SD) segment to the competition schedule.  In 2018, the ISU voted to re-name the SD to the [[rhythm dance]] (RD).  Ice dance has required elements that ice dancers must perform during a competition and that make up a well-balanced skating program.  They include: the dance [[Figure skating lifts|lift]], the dance [[Figure skating spins|spin]], the [[step sequence]], [[Twizzle|twizzles]], and choreographic elements.  They must be performed in specific ways, as described in published communications by the ISU, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe ISU publishes violations and their points values yearly.  Deductions in ice dance include falls and interruptions, and violations in time, music, and clothing.\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Jackson Haines2.jpg|thumb|Jackson Haines, the \"father of figure skating\"]]\n\nThe roots of ice dance, like [[pairs skating]], are in the \"combined skating\" developed in the 19th century by skating clubs and organizations and by recreational social skating between couples and friends, who would skate [[waltzes]], marches, and other social dances together.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. xiv, p. 102</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, \"Ice dancing derives from the turn-of-the-century Viennese and English attempts to translate the waltz and other ballroom dances to the ice and to devise ballroom-style performances suitable for skates\".<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 221</ref>  Figure skating historian James Hines states that ice dance had its beginnings in hand-in-hand skating, a short-lived but popular disciple of figure skating in England in the 1890s; many of the positions used in ice dance today can be traced back to hand-in-hand skating.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 36</ref>  In 1836, the Oxford Skating Society published a simple program of figures for hand-in-hand skating.<ref name=\"hines2006-119\">Hines (2006), p. 119</ref>  The first steps in ice dance were similar to those used in ballroom dancing, so unlike modern ice dance, skaters tended to keep both feet on the ice most of the time, without the \"long and flowing edges associated with graceful figure skating\".<ref name=\"hines2006-120\">Hines (2006), p. 120</ref>  \n\nIn the late 1800s, American [[Jackson Haines]], known as \"the Father of Figure Skating\",<ref name=\"blakemore\">{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=The Man Who Invented Figure Skating Was Laughed Out of America |url=https://www.history.com/news/the-man-who-invented-figure-skating-was-laughed-out-of-america |website=History.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |accessdate=11 January 2020 |date=12 December 2017}}</ref> brought his style of skating to Europe, and taught people in Vienna, where he capitalized on their \"obsession with waltzing\",<ref name=\"blakemore\"/> how to dance on the ice, both singly and with partners.<ref name=\"blakemore\"/>  Haines introduced the American waltz, a simple four-step sequence, each step lasting one beat of music, repeated as the partners moved in a circular pattern, to Vienna.  By the 1880s, it and the Jackson Haines waltz, a variation of the American waltz, were among the most popular ice dances.<ref name=\"hines2006-120\"/>  Other popular ice dance steps included the [[mazurka]], a version of the Jackson Haines waltz developed in Sweden, and the three-step waltz, which was created in Paris in 1894 and was called \"the direct predecessor of ice dancing in the modern sense\".<ref name=\"hines2006-120\"/>\n\nIn the 1890s in Paris, a three-step waltz called the English waltz, which ice dance historian Cheryl Elton called \"the direct predecessor of modern ice dancing, featuring the speed and flowing edges that we see today\"<ref name=\"elton-1\">Elton, p. 1</ref> was created.  The English waltz became the standard for waltz skating competitions and was at first popular with inexperienced skaters, although skilled skaters made it more challenging by introducing more difficult steps such as [[Mohawk turn|mohawks]] and [[3 turn]]s.<ref name=\"hines2006-121\">Hines (2006), p. 121</ref><ref name=\"elton-1\"/>  Other early ice dances included the European waltz, inventor unknown, before the turn of the 20th century, and the ten-step, a precursor of the fourteen-step, both of which are still used in ice dance competitions today.<ref>Elton, p. 1-2</ref>  The killian, first skated in 1909 by Austrian [[Karl Schreiter]], was the last ice dance invented before [[World War I]] still being done today.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 123</ref>  According to Hines, the ten-step is the basis of the fourteen-step, the oldest dance still done in the sport.  The ten-step was created by Austrian champion [[Max Bohatsch]] in Vienna.<ref name=\"hines2006-122\">Hines (2006), p. 122</ref>  Also in the 1890s, combined and hand-in-hand skating moved skating away from \"the static confines of basic figures to continuous movement around a rink\".<ref name=\"hines2006-119\"/>  Hines insisted that the popularity of skating waltzes, which depended upon the speed and flow across the ice of couples in dance positions and not just on holding hands with a partner, \"dealt a death knell to hand-in-hand skating\".<ref name=\"hines2006-119\"/>  By the end of the 19th century, waltzing competitions became popular throughout the world.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 121</ref>  According to Hines, Vienna was \"the dancing capital of Europe, both on and off skates\" in the 19th century.<ref name=\"hines2006-122\"/>\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Eva Romanov\u00e1 and Pavel Roman 1965.jpg|upright=1.0|thumb|left|[[Eva Romanov\u00e1]] and [[Pavel Roman]] in 1965]]\n\nBy the early 1900s, ice dancing was popular around the world and was primarily a recreational sport, although during the 1920s, local clubs in Britain and the U.S. conducted informal dance contests in waltzes and in marches such as the ten-step, the fourteen-step, and the killian, which were the only three dances used in competition until the 1930s.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 221</ref><ref>Hines (2006), p. 124</ref>  Recreational skating became more popular during the 1930s in England, and new and more difficult set-pattern dances, which later were used in compulsory dances during competitions, were developed.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 222</ref>  Hines stated that the development of new ice dances was necessary to expand upon the three dances already developed; three British teams\u2014[[Erik van der Wyden]] and [[Eva Keats]], [[Reginald Wilkie]] and [[Daphne B. Wallis]], and [[Robert Dench]] and [[Rosemarie Stewart]]\u2014created one-fourth of the dances used in [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) competitions by 2006.  In 1933, the Westminster Skating Club conducted a competition encouraging the creation of new dances.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 123\u2014124</ref>  Beginning in the mid-1930s, national organizations began to introduce skating proficiency tests in set-pattern dances, improve the judging of dance tests, and oversee competitions.  The first national competitions occurred in England in 1934, Canada in 1935, the U.S. in 1936, and Austria in 1937.  These competitions included one or more compulsory dances, the original dance, and the free dance.<ref name=\"elton-2\">Elton, p. 2</ref><ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 222</ref><ref name=\"hines2011-102\">Hines (2011), p. 102</ref>  By the late 1930s, ice dancers swelled memberships in skating clubs throughout the world, and as Hines stated, \"became the backbone of skating clubs\".<ref>Hines (2006), p. 124</ref>\n\nThe ISU began to develop rules, standards, and international tests for ice dance in the 1950s.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\">Kestnbaum, p. 223</ref>  The first international ice dancing competition occurred as a special event at the [[1950 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships in 1950]] in London; [[Lois Waring]] and [[Michael McGean]] of the U.S. won the event, much to the embarrassment of the British, who considered themselves the best ice dancers in the world.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 173\u2014174</ref>  A second event was planned the following year, at the [[1951 World Figure Skating Championships|1951 World Championships]] in Milan; [[Jean Westwood (figure skater)|Jean Westwood]] and [[Lawrence Demmy]] of Great Britain came in first place.<ref name=\"hines2006-174\" />  Ice dance, with the CD and FD segments, was formally added to the [[1952 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships in 1952]].<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\"/>  Westwood and Demmy won the first championship; they went on to dominate ice dancing and win the next four World Championships.<ref name=\"hines2011-102\"/><ref name=\"hines2006-174\">Hines (2006), p. 174</ref>  British teams dominated ice dance throughout the 1950s and the 1960s; they won 12 out of the first 16 championships;<ref name=\"elton-2\"/> however, in 1962, [[Eva Romanova]] and [[Pavel Roman]] of Czechoslovakia were the first non-British ice dancers to win a world title.<ref>Hines (2011), p.xxxi</ref>\n\n===1970s to 1990s===\nIce dance became an Olympic sport in 1976; [[Lyudmila Pakhomova]] and [[Aleksandr Gorshkov (figure skater)|Alexandr Gorshkov]] from the Soviet Union were the first gold medalists.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\"/><ref name=\"hines2011-xxvi\">Hines (2011), p. xxvi</ref><ref name=\"russell\">{{cite news |last1=Russell |first1=Susan D. |title=Lyudmila Pakhomova and Aleksandr Gorshkov: The Heroes of Olympic Ice Dance |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234703/http://www.ifsmagazine.com/articles/32605-lyudmila-pakhomova-and-aleksandr-gorshkov |accessdate=20 August 2018 |work=International Figure Skating |date=5 January 2013}}</ref>  The Soviets dominated ice dancing during most of the 1970s; as they did in pair skating, they won every Worlds and Olympic title between 1970 and 1978, and won medals at every competition between 1976 and 1982.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 217, 218</ref>  In 1984, British dancers [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]], who Hines called \"the greatest ice dancers in the history of the sport\",<ref>Hines (2006), p. 240</ref> briefly interrupted Soviet domination of ice dance by \"famously winning the Olympic gold medal\"<ref name=\"elton-2\"/> at the [[1984 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games in Sarajevo]], with their free dance to [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'',<ref name=\"elton-2\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=1984: British ice couple score Olympic gold |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_4156000/4156053.stm |accessdate=11 January 2020 |work=BBC |date=14 February 1984}}</ref> which has been called \"probably the most well known single program in the history of ice dance\".<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\">Kestnbaum, p. 228</ref>  Hines stated, about Torvill and Dean, that they dramatically altered \"established concepts of ice dancing\"<ref>Hines (2006), p. 239</ref> with their innovative choreography.\n\n[[File:Jayne_Torvill_and_Christopher_Dean_-_Dancing_on_Ice_2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|[[Torvill and Dean]] performing in 2011]]\n\nThroughout the 1970s, there was a movement in ice dance away from its ballroom roots to a more theatrical style.  As Kestnbaum stated, \"The top Soviet teams pioneered an emphasis on the dramatic qualities of ice dancing, choreographing programs around a single ballroom theme and incorporating elements of [[ballet]] and theatrical performances into their performances\".<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\"/>  Dance teams from all over the world were influenced by ballet techniques, especially \"the classic ballet ''[[pas de deux]]'' of the high-art instance of a man and woman dancing together\".<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\"/> They began to move ice dance away from its social dance origins, towards art dance, by performing as predictable characters, choreographing into their routines body positions that were no longer rooted in traditional ballroom holds, and using music with less predictable rhythms.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\"/><ref name=\"russell\"/> \n\nThe ISU pushed back during the 1980s and 1990s by tightening rules and definitions of ice dance to emphasize its connection to ballroom dancing, especially in the FD.
