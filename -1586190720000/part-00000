{"title_page": "Titles of Mary", "text_new": "[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], 19th century.]]\n[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), [[epithet]]s ([[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], [[Queen of Heaven]], Cause of Our Joy), invocations (''[[Theotokos]]'', ''[[Panagia]]'', Mother of Mercy) and other names ([[Our Lady of Loreto]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]).HHII\n{{Mary}}\nAll of these titles refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]] (in the [[New Testament]]) and are used variably by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].  (Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but which form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several stories on the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g. through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], help of the sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g. via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (Divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as [[Irenaeus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and others.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false [[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults'', Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}]</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De AnDA (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor.

Furthermore, she is interested by four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuosly receives and that only her is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]] are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

(Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but which form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several stories on the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g. through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], help of the sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g. via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (Divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as [[Irenaeus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and others.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false [[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults'', Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}]</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De AnDA (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=150| English !! width=100| Latin !! width=100| Greek !!

Furthermore, she is interested by four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuosly receives and that only her is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]] are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

It is divided into six [[District of the People's Republic of China|districts]]: [[Huli District|Huli]], [[Siming District|Siming]], [[Jimei District|Jimei]], [[Tong'an]], [[Haicang District|Haicang]], and [[Xiang'an]]. All together, these cover an area of {{convert|1699.39|km2|sp=us}} with a population of 3,531,347 as of [[2010 Chinese census|2010]]. The [[urbanization in China|urbanized]] area of the city has spread from its original island to include parts of all six of its [[District of the People's Republic of China|districts]], with a total population of 1,861,289. This area connects to [[Quanzhou]] in the north and [[Zhangzhou]] in the west, making up a metropolis of more than five million people. The [[Kinmen]] Islands (Quemoy) administered by the [[Republic of China]] lie less than {{convert|6|km|sp=us|0}} away.\n\n[[Xiamen Island]] possessed a natural harbor in Yundang Bay, but Fujian's international trade was [[Sea Ban|long restricted]] to [[Quanzhou]] or to [[Guangzhou]] in Guangdong. Due to the [[siltification]] of Quanzhou's harbor, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] insisted that Xiamen be [[treaty ports|opened to foreign trade]] in the [[Treaty of Nanking|treaty]] that ended the [[First Opium War]] in 1842. Under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], both before and after the war, there was a large-scale [[Chinese diaspora|emigration of Chinese]] from southern Fujian who spread [[Hokkien]]-speaking communities to Singapore, [[Malaysia]] (especially in [[Penang]]), [[Indonesia]] ([[Medan]] and [[Riau Province]]) and the [[Philippines]].

The [[Gaoji Causeway]] built from 1955 to 1957 notionally transformed Xiamen Island into a peninsula, and so it was termed in the [[Great Leap Forward|heady propaganda]] of the time.

As a legacy of the color sculpture of the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907), it was inspired by the thread sculpture technology of the Song and Yuan dynasties (960\u20131368), especially the process of leaching powder and clay thread sculpture.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe lacquer thread sculpture technique was formed in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties (1368\u20131911). It has four major steps: sculpture, foundation coating, lacquer thread decoration and gilding the surface. It focuses on the aesthetic characteristics of the lacquer thread itself, and demonstrates the evolution of the use of line in Chinese arts and crafts.\n\n==== Bead embroidery (\u73e0\u7ee3) ====\nThe bead embroidery in Xiamen has small pearls, glass beads and jewels embroidered on the cloth, creating the shining glory, colorful decorations, clear layout and a strong sense of art with stereoscopic impression.\n\nThe craftsmanship has a history of nearly 100 years.

In 2007, the art was included in the Fujian Provincial Intangible Cultural Heritage List.\n\n=== Belief ===\n\n==== Nanputuo Temple (\u5357\u666e\u9640\u5bfa) ====\nLike most of the temples in China, [[South Putuo Temple|Nanputuo Temple]] has seen its share of violence and destruction. The temple's original construction was built more than a millennium ago, then it was destroyed and later rebuilt during the [[Tang dynasty]], only to repeat the process during the [[Ming dynasty]] and yet again during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Later, the temple was renovated yet again during the early 1980s left the temple as it is today.\n\nThe temple consists of four separate halls of worship, monks quarters and some of the finest maintained grounds and landscapes you're likely to find in any Chinese temple.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Stone carvings, lotus filled ponds and secluded caves are scattered around the grounds. If you're after a bit of good luck, try tossing a coin on the rock behind the main temple, which is said to bring good luck your way. Behind the smoky courtyards, libraries, monk's digs, temples and statues of laughing Buddha Milefo is Wulao Feng, \"the peak of five old men,\" which overlooks the South China Sea, offering a scenic view of Xiamen University campus and the sprawling urban metropolis of Xiamen.\n\nTake a bus or cab to the temple which sits very close to Xiamen University on Siming Nanlu. The temple and the university gates are within 100 meters of each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Brahma Temple (\u68b5\u5929\u5bfa) ====\nBrahma Temple is located at the southern foot of Dalun Mountain (\u5927\u8f6e\u5c71), which was established in the first year of Kaihuang of the [[Sui dynasty]] (581). Its primitive name is Xingjiao Temple, which is one of the earliest Buddhist temples in Fujian. Both of Miaoshi Temple in Xiamen Island and Sunlight Rock Temple in Gulangyu Island are its branches.\n\nEven though Brahma Temple has experienced many vicissitudes of life, it cultivated many eminent monks, attracted refined scholars, gathered unceasing burning incense and enjoyed a widespread reputation. The distinguished Master Hong Yi and the Master Yinshun who is the leading authority in the Buddhist studies in Taiwan have once stayed in the temple. There is a Brahman pagoda of the Song Dynasty in the temple, which has been included in the first group of cultural relics in Fujian province.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Belief in Life Protection Emperor (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d\u4fe1\u4fd7) ====\nLife Protection Emperor, commonly referred to as \"Dadaogong\" (\u5927\u9053\u516c), \"Wuzhenren\" (\u5434\u771f\u4eba) or \"Huajiaogong\" (\u82b1\u6865\u516c), is the god worshiped by people across South Fujian and the Chaozhou-Jieyang-Shantou region (a region in Guangdong province). He is believed to be an immortal who mastered medical science. Temples in his name have been built across the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Among them, the Qingjiao Tzu Chi Temple and Baijiao Tzu Chi Temple are recognized as the ancestral shrines of Life Protection Emperor.\n\nLife Protection Emperor, originally named Wu Tao, was born in Tongan county in the Song Dynasty. He studied medicine since childhood and practiced medicine. He saved numerous people throughout his life. His proficient skill and benevolent heart won him enormous admiration and love.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Belief in God Chi (\u6c60\u738b\u4fe1\u4fd7) ====\nGod Chi, or Chi Ran, is a [[Nanjing]] local. He is very upright in disciplining himself and fulfilling his official responsibilities. It is said that in the era of Emperor Wanli of the Ming Dynasty, Chi was called by the imperial court to be magistrate of Zhangzhou, Fujian province. He met two envoys when he passed Small Yingling Mountain, which is in present Xiang'an district. After he talked with them, he knew that they were on the imperial order from the [[Jade Emperor]] (the Supreme Deity of Heaven) and were going to spread drugs that could cause plague to cut down the population in Zhangzhou. Chi tried to cheat them and swallowed the plague medicine himself to spare all troubles later on. When he arrived at Maxiang, he was poisoned and his face turned black, then he died under a big banyan tree. Jade Emperor thought Chi was generous and kind, who loved the people as his children, so Chi was remitted and titled \"the general imperial inspector representing the heaven\", and was promoted as the royal highness and appointed as the God of Maxiang.\n\nAfter [[Koxinga|Zheng Chenggong]] took back Taiwan, belief in God Chi has been transmitted to Taiwan and Southeast Asia. It has a history of over 300 years and God Chi has become the divinity worshiped by the public in Taiwan.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Belief in Fude (\u798f\u5fb7\u6587\u5316) ====\nBelief in Fude is the belief in the God of Earth. In the folk lore of China, God of Earth is also regarded as God of Wealth and Blessing, because people believe that \"land can bring wealth\".\n\nEvery year, the second day of the second month on the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese lunar calendar]] is regarded the birthday of the God of Earth. The first day and the fifteenth day, or the second day and the sixteenth day of every month of the lunar calendar are the monthly sacrifice day. Every 16th day of the 12th month of the lunar calendar is the sacrifice day of the \"year-end dinner\". Folk activities include the ceremony to light the first incense to invite the ruler of heaven, holding the sacrifice ceremony, sending stoves, and offering incenses to Buddha. Among these activities, meeting the deities, dancing performances, and opera performed to show gratitude for gods are all cultural events.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Media===\nXiamen is served by [[Xiamen Media Group]], which broadcasts news and entertainment such as movies and television series by AM/FM radio, close circuit television, and satellite television.

It is divided into six [[District of the People's Republic of China|districts]]: [[Huli District|Huli]], [[Siming District|Siming]], [[Jimei District|Jimei]], [[Tong'an]], [[Haicang District|Haicang]], and [[Xiang'an]]. All together, these cover an area of {{convert|1699.39|km2|sp=us}} with a population of 3,531,347 as of [[2010 Chinese census|2010]]. The [[urbanization in China|urbanized]] area of the city has spread from its original island to include parts of all six of its [[District of the People's Republic of China|districts]], with a total population of 1,861,289. This area connects to [[Quanzhou]] in the north and [[Zhangzhou]] in the west, making up a metropolis of more than five million people. The [[Kinmen]] Islands (Quemoy) administered by the [[Republic of China]] lie less than {{convert|6|km|sp=us|0}} away.\n\n[[Xiamen Island]] possessed a natural harbor in Yundang Bay, but Fujian's international trade was [[Sea Ban|long restricted]] to [[Quanzhou]] or to [[Guangzhou]] in Guangdong. Due to the [[siltification]] of Quanzhou's harbor, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] insisted that Xiamen be [[treaty ports|opened to foreign trade]] in the [[Treaty of Nanking|treaty]] that ended the [[First Opium War]] in 1842. Under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], both before and after the war, there was a large-scale [[Chinese diaspora|emigration of Chinese]] from southern Fujian who spread [[Hokkien]]-speaking communities to Singapore, [[Malaysia]] (especially in [[Penang]]), [[Indonesia]] ([[Medan]] and [[Riau Province]]) and the [[Philippines]]. The [[overseas Chinese]] continue to support Xiamen's educational and cultural institutions. As part of the [[Opening Up Policy]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]], Xiamen became one of China's original four [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|special economic zones]] opened to foreign investment and trade in the early 1980s. Its former harbor [[land reclamation|was enclosed]] using land excavated during the city's expansion, however, the city remains an island connected by bridges to the rest of mainland China.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hot Terms in China's Reform |url=http://english.cri.cn/3126/2008/10/31/53s419804.htm |accessdate=17 August 2018 |publisher=CRI English |date=31 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817124848/http://english.cri.cn/3126/2008/10/31/53s419804.htm |archive-date=17 August 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe city is well known for its mild climate, Hokkien culture and [[Gulangyu Island]], as well as its relatively low pollution. In 2006, Xiamen was ranked as China's second-\"most suitable city for living\", as well as China's \"most romantic leisure city\" in 2011. \n{{TOClimit|3}}\n{{anchor|Etymology|Names}}\n\n==Name==\n[[File:Zheng Chenggong.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The statue of [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong) on [[Gulangyu Island]].]]\nThe area around [[Xiamen Bay]] appears as '''Tong'an''' in some [[Han dynasty|Han]] records. [[Xiamen Island]] was described as '''Jiahe Islet''' during the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279). It received its present name from the Xiamen Castle erected on the island by [[Zhou Dexing]] in 1387 during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] to meet the needs of coastal defense.<ref name=zgddc>''Zhongguo Gujin Diming Da Cidian'' \u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4eca\u5730\u540d\u5927\u8bcd\u5178, 2855.</ref> The name was formerly written using the [[Chinese characters]] meaning \"Lower Gate\" and then changed into \"\u53a6\u95e8\", meaning \"Mansion Gate\" or \"Gate of China\".\n\nBy the end of Ming Dynasty, [[Koxinga|Zheng Chenggong]], or Koxinga, a Ming loyalist, occupied Xiamen as an anti-[[Qing dynasty|Qing]] base. In 1650, the seventh year of Emperor Shunzhi of the Qing Dynasty, Zheng set a military base in Xiamen and changed its name into \"\u601d\u660e\u5dde\", or \"Siming\", meaning \"Remembering the Ming\".\n\nWhen its port prospered under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], especially during the reign of Emperor Kangxi, the name was changed to \"\u53a6\u95e8\", or \"Xiamen\", again.\n\nThe name of Siming was in return restored after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] that inaugurated the [[Republic of China (mainland)|republic]] in 1912.\n\nThe name of Xiamen was restored in 1933, along with Xiamen being administratively planned as a city, the first of its kind in Fujian province. Siming continues to be used as the name of one of its districts.\n\nXiamen is the [[Chinese tones|atonal]] [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the characters' pronunciation in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]].

The same year, Xiamen became a provincially administered city ({{lang|zh|\u7701\u8f96\u5e02}}).\n\nIn 1955 and 1958, mainland China escalated [[Cold War]] political tensions by shelling nearby islands from Xiamen in what became known as the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|First]] and [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. The Nationalists responded by reinforcing Kinmen (Quemoy) and shelling Xiamen. The [[Gaoji Causeway]] built from 1955 to 1957 notionally transformed Xiamen Island into a peninsula, and so it was termed in the [[Great Leap Forward|heady propaganda]] of the time. Due to political tensions, the eastern half of Xiamen Island and much of the Fujian Coast facing the offshore islands remained undeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s.

There is a Brahman pagoda of the Song Dynasty in the temple, which has been included in the first group of cultural relics in Fujian province.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Belief in Life Protection Emperor (\u4fdd\u751f\u5927\u5e1d\u4fe1\u4fd7) ====\nLife Protection Emperor, commonly referred to as \"Dadaogong\" (\u5927\u9053\u516c), \"Wuzhenren\" (\u5434\u771f\u4eba) or \"Huajiaogong\" (\u82b1\u6865\u516c), is the god worshiped by people across South Fujian and the Chaozhou-Jieyang-Shantou region (a region in Guangdong province). He is believed to be an immortal who mastered medical science. Temples in his name have been built across the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Among them, the Qingjiao Tzu Chi Temple and Baijiao Tzu Chi Temple are recognized as the ancestral shrines of Life Protection Emperor.\n\nLife Protection Emperor, originally named Wu Tao, was born in Tongan county in the Song Dynasty. He studied medicine since childhood and practiced medicine. He saved numerous people throughout his life. His proficient skill and benevolent heart won him enormous admiration and love.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Belief in God Chi (\u6c60\u738b\u4fe1\u4fd7) ====\nGod Chi, or Chi Ran, is a [[Nanjing]] local. He is very upright in disciplining himself and fulfilling his official responsibilities. It is said that in the era of Emperor Wanli of the Ming Dynasty, Chi was called by the imperial court to be magistrate of Zhangzhou, Fujian province. He met two envoys when he passed Small Yingling Mountain, which is in present Xiang'an district. After he talked with them, he knew that they were on the imperial order from the [[Jade Emperor]] (the Supreme Deity of Heaven) and were going to spread drugs that could cause plague to cut down the population in Zhangzhou. Chi tried to cheat them and swallowed the plague medicine himself to spare all troubles later on. When he arrived at Maxiang, he was poisoned and his face turned black, then he died under a big banyan tree. Jade Emperor thought Chi was generous and kind, who loved the people as his children, so Chi was remitted and titled \"the general imperial inspector representing the heaven\", and was promoted as the royal highness and appointed as the God of Maxiang.\n\nAfter [[Koxinga|Zheng Chenggong]] took back Taiwan, belief in God Chi has been transmitted to Taiwan and Southeast Asia. It has a history of over 300 years and God Chi has become the divinity worshiped by the public in Taiwan.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Belief in Fude (\u798f\u5fb7\u6587\u5316) ====\nBelief in Fude is the belief in the God of Earth. In the folk lore of China, God of Earth is also regarded as God of Wealth and Blessing, because people believe that \"land can bring wealth\".\n\nEvery year, the second day of the second month on the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese lunar calendar]] is regarded the birthday of the God of Earth. The first day and the fifteenth day, or the second day and the sixteenth day of every month of the lunar calendar are the monthly sacrifice day. Every 16th day of the 12th month of the lunar calendar is the sacrifice day of the \"year-end dinner\". Folk activities include the ceremony to light the first incense to invite the ruler of heaven, holding the sacrifice ceremony, sending stoves, and offering incenses to Buddha. Among these activities, meeting the deities, dancing performances, and opera performed to show gratitude for gods are all cultural events.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Media===\nXiamen is served by [[Xiamen Media Group]], which broadcasts news and entertainment such as movies and television series by AM/FM radio, close circuit television, and satellite television.

This was Wigan's only notable effort in the first half as errors, such as this one, from both teams cost them opportunities.\n\nHowever, in the 21st minute, Warrington did score, thanks to a try from [[Declan Patton]], who was only making his 9th appearance of the season. He then converted his own try to give his team a 6\u20132 lead, which they'd hold onto until half-time.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/rugby-league/super-league-grand-final-wigan-warriors-vs-warrington-wolves-match-report-josh-charnley-a7352246.html|title=Super League Grand Final: Josh Charnley signs off in style as Wigan Warriors defeat Warrington Wolves|date=8 October 2016|work=The Independent|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Second Half===\nIn the 54th minute, [[Ryan Atkins]] made his way over the try-line for Warrington. However, referee Robert Hicks sent the final decision to [[Television Match Official|Video Referee]] [[Ben Thaler]], as he couldn't see whether or not the ball was grounded on the try-line, after 5 Wigan players were tackling Atkins. Eventually after a short delay, Hicks' initial TRY decision was overturned by video referee, Ben Thaler, due to Atkins seen losing control of the ball before he could get it down.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-league/2016/10/08/josh-charnley-signs-off-with-wigan-winner-in-super-league-grand|title=Josh Charnley signs off with Wigan winner in Super League Grand Final|date=8 October 2016|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nA minute later, [[Liam Farrell]] broke Warrington's defensive line, and then gave a pass off to [[Oliver Gildart]], who'd go on to score the 100th Super League Grand Final try. After kicking from a wide angle, [[Matty Smith]] was unable to convert and the scores remained level.\n\nIn the 63rd minute, [[Josh Charnley]] wasn't denied this time around, scoring after grounding the departing team member [[Dan Sarginson]]'s grubber in the in-goal area. Matty Smith again had to convert from out wide, but he again failed to capitalise on the extra 2 points.\n\nSmith then finally added another two points, courtesy of a penalty goal, conceded by [[Daryl Clark]]. The penalty-goal made the score 12\u20136 to Wigan with only 6 minutes remaining. After this moment, all the chances belonged to Warrington, but Wigan's defence stood up when it mattered most, tackling players out of play and tackling them on the 5th tackle, to create a turnover each time. Wigan held on to win their 4th Super League title.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/08/super-league-grand-final-warrington-wigan-live|title=Warrington 6-12 Wigan: Super League Grand Final \u2013 as it happened!|date=8 October 2016|work=Guardian|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Post-match===\nWigan's victory was their fourth Super League title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/warrington-wigan-super-league-grand-final-match-report|title=Wigan\u2019s Josh Charnley downs Warrington in Super League Grand Final|date=8 October 2016|work=theguardian|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nLiam Farrell won the [[Harry Sunderland Trophy]]/ Man of the Match award \n\nThe match was also the last for SkySports commentator, and former Great Britain international, [[Mike Stephenson|Stevo]], after 26 years of commentating the sport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/rugby-league/news/12198/10607868/farewell-to-stevo-sky-sports-pundits-pay-tribute-to-mike-stephenson|title=Farewell to Stevo: Sky Sports pundits pay tribute to Mike Stephenson|date=7 October 2016|work=skySPORTS|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==World Club Series==\n{{main|2017 World Club Series}}\nBy winning this match Wigan had qualified for the [[World Club Challenge|World Club Series]] Final, to be played at [[DW Stadium]] against the winners of the [[2016 NRL Grand Final]], the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]].

However, referee Robert Hicks sent the final decision to [[Television Match Official|Video Referee]] [[Ben Thaler]], as he couldn't see whether or not the ball was grounded on the try-line, after 5 Wigan players were tackling Atkins.

After kicking from a wide angle, [[Matty Smith]] was unable to convert and the scores remained level.\n\nIn the 63rd minute, [[Josh Charnley]] wasn't denied this time around, scoring after grounding the departing team member [[Dan Sarginson]]'s grubber in the in-goal area. Matty Smith again had to convert from out wide, but he again failed to capitalise on the extra 2 points.\n\nSmith then finally added another two points, courtesy of a penalty goal, conceded by [[Daryl Clark]]. The penalty-goal made the score 12\u20136 to Wigan with only 6 minutes remaining. After this moment, all the chances belonged to Warrington, but Wigan's defence stood up when it mattered most, tackling players out of play and tackling them on the 5th tackle, to create a turnover each time.

Every time an individual sleeps, he or she goes through various sequences of non-REM and REM sleep. Anxiety and fatigue are often connected with sleepwalking. For adults, alcohol, sedatives, medications, medical conditions and mental disorders are all associated with sleepwalking. Sleep walking may involve sitting up and looking awake when the individual is actually asleep, and getting up and walking around, moving items or undressing themselves.

All attempts to console the individual are futile and may prolong or intensify the victim's confused state. Usually the victim experiences [[amnesia]] after the event but it may not be complete amnesia. Up to 3% of adults suffer from sleep terrors and exhibited behavior of this parasomnia can range from mild to extremely violent.

Parasomnias are dissociated sleep states which are partial arousals during the transitions between wakefulness, [[NREM]] sleep, and [[REM sleep]], and their combinations.\n\n== Classification ==\nThe newest version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, 3rd. Ed.) uses State Dissociation as the paradigm for parasomnias.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Unlike before, where wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were considered exclusive states, research has shown that combinations of these states are possible and thus, may result in unusual unstable states that could eventually manifest as parasomnias or as altered levels of awareness.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=International Classification of Sleep Disorders|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Sleep Medicine|year=2014|isbn=|location=Darien, IL|pages=}}</ref><ref>Mahowald MW, Schenk CH.

Every time an individual sleeps, he or she goes through various sequences of non-REM and REM sleep. Anxiety and fatigue are often connected with sleepwalking. For adults, alcohol, sedatives, medications, medical conditions and mental disorders are all associated with sleepwalking. Sleep walking may involve sitting up and looking awake when the individual is actually asleep, and getting up and walking around, moving items or undressing themselves.

All attempts to console the individual are futile and may prolong or intensify the victim\u2019s confused state. Usually the victim experiences [[amnesia]] after the event but it may not be complete amnesia. Up to 3% of adults suffer from sleep terrors and exhibited behavior of this parasomnia can range from mild to extremely violent.

Tyvek is often used as [[housewrap]], a synthetic material used to protect buildings during construction. The material is difficult to tear, but can easily be cut with [[scissor]]s or a knife. [[Water vapor]] can pass through Tyvek, but liquid water cannot. All of these properties have led to Tyvek being used in a variety of applications.\n\n==History==\nTyvek is a [[Nonwoven fabric|nonwoven]] product consisting of spun bond [[olefin fiber]]. It was first discovered in 1955 by a researcher for the DuPont [[textile]] company working in an experimental lab, who noticed a type of white fluff coming out of a pipe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/brands/tyvek.html|title=Tyvek\u00ae brand - For Greater Good\u2122|author=admin|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207232132/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek/en_US/products/about_pgs/history.html|archivedate=2007-12-07}}</ref> That fluff was a form of [[polyethylene]], which DuPont requested a patent for within a year of the discovery. After technologies improved during the next few years, in 1959 DuPont discovered that when the fluff was spun at high speeds it produced a durable fabric that was able to be cut with a blade. While the product Tyvek was used since 1959, DuPont did not trademark the actual brand until 1965, making it available for  commercial purposes in April 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/brands/tyvek/tyvek-media-center.html|title=DuPont\u2122 Tyvek\u00ae Marks 40 Years of Energy Efficiency and Protection|publisher=[[DuPont]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209122333/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek/en_US/news_events/article20070619.html|archivedate=2008-02-09}}</ref>  As of 1970, Tyvek had reached the mainstream construction industry on both a national and global scale, and is often used for the construction of houses due to its ability to keep out liquid, while allowing vapor through.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Building_Innovations/en_CN/knowledgeCenter/kc_tyvekhistory.html|title=History of Weather Barrier|website=www2.dupont.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> In 1972, DuPont released Tyvek packaging for sterile instruments that were to be used by surgeons and doctors in the medical field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/content/dam/dupont/products-and-services/packaging-materials-and-solutions/medical-and-pharmaceutical-packaging-materials/documents/MPP_Introduction_to_DuPont_Tyvek.pdf|website=www.dupont.com|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2017, the DuPont company merged with another chemical company, [[Dow Chemical Company|The Dow Chemical Company]] to form [[DowDuPont]].

Tyvek is often used as [[housewrap]], a synthetic material used to protect buildings during construction. The material is difficult to tear, but can easily be cut with [[scissor]]s or a knife. [[Water vapor]] can pass through Tyvek, but liquid water cannot. All of these properties have led to Tyvek being used in a variety of applications.\n\n==History==\nTyvek is a [[Nonwoven fabric|nonwoven]] product consisting of spun bond [[olefin fiber]]. It was first discovered in 1955 by a researcher for the DuPont [[textile]] company working in an experimental lab, who noticed a type of white fluff coming out of a pipe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/brands/tyvek.html|title=Tyvek\u00ae brand - For Greater Good\u2122|author=admin|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207232132/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek/en_US/products/about_pgs/history.html|archivedate=2007-12-07}}</ref> That fluff was a form of [[polyethylene]], which DuPont requested a patent for within a year of the discovery. After technologies improved during the next few years, in 1959 DuPont discovered that when the fluff was spun at high speeds it produced a durable fabric that was able to be cut with a blade. While the product Tyvek was used since 1959, DuPont did not trademark the actual brand until 1965, making it available for  commercial purposes in April 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/brands/tyvek/tyvek-media-center.html|title=DuPont\u2122 Tyvek\u00ae Marks 40 Years of Energy Efficiency and Protection|publisher=[[DuPont]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209122333/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek/en_US/news_events/article20070619.html|archivedate=2008-02-09}}</ref>  As of 1970, Tyvek had reached the mainstream construction industry on both a national and global scale, and is often used for the construction of houses due to its ability to keep out liquid, while allowing vapor through.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Building_Innovations/en_CN/knowledgeCenter/kc_tyvekhistory.html|title=History of Weather Barrier|website=www2.dupont.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> In 1972, DuPont released Tyvek packaging for sterile instruments that were to be used by surgeons and doctors in the medical field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/content/dam/dupont/products-and-services/packaging-materials-and-solutions/medical-and-pharmaceutical-packaging-materials/documents/MPP_Introduction_to_DuPont_Tyvek.pdf|website=www.dupont.com|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2017, the DuPont company merged with another chemical company, [[Dow Chemical Company|The Dow Chemical Company]] to form [[DowDuPont]].

He is saddened that all those attending are businessmen interested only in moneymaking. He attempts to speak, but no-one is interested and he sits down. He thinks back to his early pioneering days.\n\nYoung \"Willie\" works as an assistant to photographer Maurice Guttenberg, who will not let him take portraits his way. He leaves and, with his new wife, a client of his former employer, he opens a studio. After a slow start, he does well and opens other studios, but he is more interested in developing moving pictures and colour films. He single-mindedly works on his ideas, spending more and more money, and is eventually declared bankrupt. With the coming of World War I, their sons (one under age) enlist in the army to relieve their parents of the burden of providing for them.\n\nIn partnership with a businessman, he develops his ideas, but the partnership sours and he's on his own, bankrupt, again. Nevertheless, he perseveres and, late one night, he projects the short film he has taken in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that afternoon. Excited, he rushes out and drags in a passing policeman, portrayed by Laurence Olivier (credited as Larry Oliver), to witness the success of the film. The policeman is dumbfounded, not quite comprehending what he has just seen.\n\nBack at the conference, Friese-Greene again stands up to speak, but becomes incoherent and is forced to sit down. He collapses. A doctor is called, but it is too late. Examining the contents of his pockets in an attempt to identify him, the doctor comments that all the money he could find was just enough for a ticket to the cinema.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Donat]] as [[William Friese-Greene]]\n* [[Margaret Johnston]] as Edith Harrison\n* [[Maria Schell]] as Helena Friese-Greene\n* David Oake as [[Claude Friese-Greene]]\n* [[Janette Scott]] as Ethel Friese-Greene\n* [[John Howard Davies]] as Maurice Friese-Greene\n* [[Robert Beatty]] as [[Lord Beaverbrook]]\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as Jack Carter\n* [[Basil Sydney]] as [[William Fox Talbot]]\n* [[Bernard Miles]] as Cousin Alfred\n* [[Eric Portman]] as Arthur Collings\n* [[Mary Ellis]] as Mrs Collings\n* [[Muir Mathieson]] as Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]]\n* [[Joyce Grenfell]] as Mrs Claire\n* [[Dennis Price]] as Harold\n* [[Margaret Rutherford]] as Lady Pond\n* [[Mervyn Johns]] as Goitz\n* [[Glynis Johns]] as May Jones\n* [[Frederick Valk]] as Maurice Guttenberg\n* [[Ronald Shiner]] as the Fairground Barker\n* [[Peter Reynolds (actor)|Peter Reynolds]] as Bridegroom\n}}\n\n=== Cameos ===\n{{castlist|\n* [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] as a doctor\n* [[Bessie Love]] as wedding group member\n* [[Cecil Parker]] at the Connaught Rooms\n* [[Cecil Trouncer]] as [[John Arthur Roebuck Rudge|John Rudge]]\n* [[David Tomlinson (actor)|David Tomlinson]] as a Lab Assistant\n* [[Emlyn Williams]] as a Bank Manager\n* [[Ernest Thesiger]] as \"man\"\n* [[Kay Walsh]] as a receptionist\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Jack Hulbert]] as police officers\n* [[Leo Genn]] as a doctor\n* [[Marius Goring]] as an estate agent\n* [[Michael Denison]] as a reporter\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as the Official Receiver\n* [[Miles Malleson]] as an orchestra conductor\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as an \"industry man\"\n* [[Sheila Sim]] as a nursemaid\n* [[Sid James]] as an army sergeant in storeroom\n* [[Stanley Holloway]] as a broker's man\n* [[Thora Hird]] as a housekeeper\n* [[William Hartnell]] as a [[Recruiting sergeant]]\n* [[Googie Withers]], [[A.

That doesn't say, however, that it is not expertly done and that it doesn't deserve the attention of all who are interested in the craft of the screen. In the principal role, Robert Donat does a superlative job of conveying both the vigor of a young man and the fragile dignity of old age\u2014a role highly reminiscent of his unforgettable \"[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Mr. Chips]].\" As his two wives, Margaret Johnston and Maria {{sic|Schnell|expected=Schell}} are excellent, and a host of the best British performers are all fine in smaller roles. An idea of the extravagance may be had in the fact that the distinguished Laurence Olivier plays a policeman \"bit.\" While Eric Ambler's script, based on a biography of Friese-Greene by Ray Allister, is understandably vague and extended, it is quaintly eventful and literate, and John Boulting's direction is finished and polished to the nines. Excellent color (by [[Technicolor]]) and superb setting and costuming all around add to the lustre of a picture that has everything but a major theme.\"<ref>{{cite

London. He is saddened that all those attending are businessmen interested only in moneymaking. He attempts to speak, but no-one is interested and he sits down. He thinks back to his early pioneering days.\n\nYoung \"Willie\" works as an assistant to photographer Maurice Guttenberg, who will not let him take portraits his way. He leaves and, with his new wife, a client of his former employer, he opens a studio. After a slow start, he does well and opens other studios, but he is more interested in developing moving pictures and colour films. He single-mindedly works on his ideas, spending more and more money, and is eventually declared bankrupt. With the coming of World War I, their sons (one under age) enlist in the army to relieve their parents of the burden of providing for them.\n\nIn partnership with a businessman, he develops his ideas, but the partnership sours and he's on his own, bankrupt, again. Nevertheless, he perseveres and, late one night, he projects the short film he has taken in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that afternoon. Excited, he rushes out and drags in a passing policeman, portrayed by Laurence Olivier (credited as Larry Oliver), to witness the success of the film. The policeman is dumbfounded, not quite comprehending what he has just seen.\n\nBack at the conference, Friese-Greene again stands up to speak, but becomes incoherent and is forced to sit down. He collapses. A doctor is called, but it is too late. Examining the contents of his pockets in an attempt to identify him, the doctor comments that all the money he could find was just enough for a ticket to the cinema.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Donat]] as [[William Friese-Greene]]\n* [[Margaret Johnston]] as Edith Harrison\n* [[Maria Schell]] as Helena Friese-Greene\n* David Oake as [[Claude Friese-Greene]]\n* [[Janette Scott]] as Ethel Friese-Greene\n* [[John Howard Davies]] as Maurice Friese-Greene\n* [[Robert Beatty]] as [[Lord Beaverbrook]]\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as Jack Carter\n* [[Basil Sydney]] as [[William Fox Talbot]]\n* [[Bernard Miles]] as Cousin Alfred\n* [[Eric Portman]] as Arthur Collings\n* [[Mary Ellis]] as Mrs Collings\n* [[Muir Mathieson]] as Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]]\n* [[Joyce Grenfell]] as Mrs Claire\n* [[Dennis Price]] as Harold\n* [[Margaret Rutherford]] as Lady Pond\n* [[Mervyn Johns]] as Goitz\n* [[Glynis Johns]] as May Jones\n* [[Frederick Valk]] as Maurice Guttenberg\n* [[Ronald Shiner]] as the Fairground Barker\n* [[Peter Reynolds (actor)|Peter Reynolds]] as Bridegroom\n}}\n\n=== Cameos ===\n{{castlist|\n* [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] as a doctor\n* [[Bessie Love]] as wedding group member\n* [[Cecil Parker]] at the Connaught Rooms\n* [[Cecil Trouncer]] as [[John Arthur Roebuck Rudge|John Rudge]]\n* [[David Tomlinson (actor)|David Tomlinson]] as a Lab Assistant\n* [[Emlyn Williams]] as a Bank Manager\n* [[Ernest Thesiger]] as \"man\"\n* [[Kay Walsh]] as a receptionist\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Jack Hulbert]] as police officers\n* [[Leo Genn]] as a doctor\n* [[Marius Goring]] as an estate agent\n* [[Michael Denison]] as a reporter\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as the Official Receiver\n* [[Miles Malleson]] as an orchestra conductor\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as an \"industry man\"\n* [[Sheila Sim]] as a nursemaid\n* [[Sid James]] as an army sergeant in storeroom\n* [[Stanley Holloway]] as a broker's man\n* [[Thora Hird]] as a housekeeper\n* [[William Hartnell]] as a [[Recruiting sergeant]]\n* [[Googie Withers]], [[A.

That doesn't say, however, that it is not expertly done and that it doesn't deserve the attention of all who are interested in the craft of the screen. In the principal role, Robert Donat does a superlative job of conveying both the vigor of a young man and the fragile dignity of old age\u2014a role highly reminiscent of his unforgettable \"[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Mr. Chips]].\" As his two wives, Margaret Johnston and Maria {{sic|Schnell|expected=Schell}} are excellent, and a host of the best British performers are all fine in smaller roles. An idea of the extravagance may be had in the fact that the distinguished Laurence Olivier plays a policeman \"bit.\" While Eric Ambler's script, based on a biography of Friese-Greene by Ray Allister, is understandably vague and extended, it is quaintly eventful and literate, and John Boulting's direction is finished and polished to the nines. Excellent color (by [[Technicolor]]) and superb setting and costuming all around add to the lustre of a picture that has everything but a major theme.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1952/09/24/archives/the-screen-in-review-the-magic-box-british-film-on-early-movie.html|title=THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; ' The Magic Box,' British Film on Early Movie Experimenter, Arrives at the Normandie|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|date=24 September 1952|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n== Nominations ==\nThe film was nominated for two [[BAFTA]] Awards in 1952\u2014[[BAFTA Award for Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1952/film/film-and-british-film|title=1952 Film Film And British Film \u2013 BAFTA Awards|website=awards.bafta.org}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n* {{cite book|editor-last=Pym|editor-first=John|title=TimeOut Film Guide|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-029395-1|year=2001|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/timeoutfilmguide00john_0|page=[https://archive.org/details/timeoutfilmguide00john_0/page/710 710]|edition=10th}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0043769}}\n* {{AllMovie title|100913}}\n* {{Screenonline title|453725}}\n* [https://friesegreene.com/ William Friese-Greene & Me] \u2013 Research on William Friese-Greene\n\n{{Boulting brothers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magic Box, The}}\n[[Category:1951 films]]\n[[Category:1950s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:1950s historical films]]\n[[Category:British historical films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:British black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about filmmaking]]\n[[Category:Films about technology]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1870s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1880s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1890s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1900s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1910s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1921]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Boulting]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ronald Neame]]\n[[Category:Films scored by William Alwyn]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Box"}

He was among the pioneers of the [[first national architectural movement]].\n\nHis lifetime saw intense and important changes for Turkish history and culture.\n\n==Early years==\nAhmet Kemalettin was born 1870 in a middle-class family to Ali Bey, a naval [[captain (naval)|captain]], and his wife Sadberk Han\u0131m at [[Ac\u0131badem, Kad\u0131k\u00f6y|Ac\u0131badem]] neighborhood of [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] district in [[Istanbul]]. In 1875, he began with his primary education at \"\u0130brahim A\u011fa \u0130btidai Mektebi\". He continued his secondary education in 1881 on [[Crete]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) due to his father's assignment. Returned soon after to Istanbul, he finished the high school.<ref name=\"tcmb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/tlkampanya/download/ozgecmisler.pdf |publisher=TCMB |title=Mimar Kemaleddin (1870 \u0130stanbul - 1927 \u0130stanbul) |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114223430/http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/tlkampanya/download/ozgecmisler.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1887 at the age of 17, he entered the School of Civil Engineering ({{lang-ota|Hendese-i M\u00fclkiye Mektebi}}, today's [[Istanbul Technical University]]). Ahmet Kemalettin graduated as an engineer with honours in 1891. He then remained at his [[alma mater]] and worked as an assistant for four years. During this time, he created his own works in his office he had opened outside the university.<ref name=\"tcmb\"/>\n\nIn 1895, promoted by his scholar [[Germany|German]] architect August Jachmund, designer of the [[Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Railway Terminal]] in Istanbul, and supported by a state scholarship, he went to Germany, where he was educated two years in architecture at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg]] in [[Berlin]]. Afterwards, he worked two-and-half years in various architecture offices gaining professional experience.<ref name=\"tcmb\"/>\n\nIn 1900, Ahmet Kemalettin returned home and resumed work at the university. Following the departure of August Jachmund, he assumed his post as lecturer. In 1908, he played a pioneering role in the formation of the first vocational organization for engineers and architects in the Ottoman Empire, the \"Society of Ottoman Architects and Engineers\".<ref name=\"tcmb\"/><ref name=\"m\"/>\n\n== Designing and building ==\nWhilst still a student at the Hendese-i Mulk\u0131ye (State School of Engineering) where he commenced his studies in 1887 he received the Medal for Industry. He must have been hardworking and creative. These personal attributes may have been related to his greater interest in the lessons of Prof. Jasmund on architecture than in engineering and to the fact that Prof. Jasmund chose him as his assistant.\n\nKemalettin shows himself to be a designer open to learning and experimentation and is also a portrayal of a self-reliant architect.\n\nHowever great an influence Jasmund and the [[Germany|German]] connections are on his perception of design, the wide scope of his references is also important. The Art Nouveau of Ratip Pasha Mansion, a building of the early era, or the connection of Harikzedegan Apartments with French public housing, the Orientalist flavour in the design of the Evkaf-\u0131 Humayun Nezareti (Ministry of Imperial Foundations), the eclectic style of the 3rd Foundation Han or the [[Empire line]] of the Husnu Pasha Tomb cannot be ignored.\n\nA Kemaleddin work doubtless presents an image overflowing with ideological connections. Only here his creativity also feeds his ideology. The transformation of his ideology into a school of architecture is essentially down to his creative talent and self-confidence, if also fed by his industriousness and organisational expertise or teaching skill/teaching discipline. \nHis life was already over when he ascertained the eventuality of this confidence being shaken. \nHis architecture was a tale that prevented the hero from experiencing a tragic end, from an untimely death.\n\n==Restorer with principles==\nOn 27 Rebi-\u00fcl ahir 1327/18 May 1909, he was appointed head of architecture at the Imperial Ministry of Foundations. \nThe possibility of designing and bringing to fruition new building projects is an irresistible passion for an architect, but running maintenance and restoration works on historical buildings, the basic and traditional function of the Ministry, was also a very special learning opportunity. Kemalettin took the intelligent approach of evaluating the two fields together and allowing each to foster the other. Restoration was an opportunity for productivity in which he drew on and applied information that was the source for the experimentation that differentiates architectural language.\n\nWhilst perceiving restoration as a method of interpreting traditional architecture and making the linguistic infrastructure for its renewal, he attempted to manage and give direction to a field whose principles were as yet not clearly defined.\n\nHe knew that restoration was not an ordinary repairs job. He taught it.\n\nHe pioneered in the field by restoring a great number of Ottoman monumental structures employing for the first time a scientific approach.\n\nHe restored the Yeni Cami Hunkar Gathering Place with passionate enthusiasm. But his principal performance was certainly the Mescid-i Aksa and Harem-i Serif project. The skill he demonstrated in the restoration of the Mescid-i Aksa won him international acclaim and an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects.\n\n==Teaching and organizing==\nOn graduation from the Hendese-i M\u00fclkiye he was appointed to the teaching staff of Technology and Architecture at the same school and as Prof. Jasmund's assistant. On his return from Germany where he went to gain knowledge and experience he took up his post at the Hendese-i Mulkiye again. And from that point on he continued to teach. He educated hundreds of students at Sanayi-i Nefise Mekteb-i Alisi (the Academy of Fine Arts), Konduktor Mekteb-i Alisi (the Conductor School) and Muhendis Mekteb-i Alis (the Academy of Engineering).\n\nThey were the years when the school of civil engineering was founded and developed as part of the Muhendishane-i Berri-i Humayun (the Military School of Engineering). At the stage when the curriculum of the school was being developed Kemalettin Bey was running a large number of different courses. It was an open field ranging from Technology and Architecture to Pen and Ink and Shadow Drawing and from Calligraphy to Iron Works. But what is certain is that he transmitted his enthusiasm to the students.\n\nWhen he was appointed to the Evkaf Nezareti, he took his students to the Building and Reparation Technological Assembly to meet the anticipated demand for intensive and fast production. This permanent staff composed of the talented architects and engineers he had chosen was to turn into a school and its office was to become a production centre, as it were, of the design concept given the name of national architecture.\n\nBut that was not all.\n\nIt was Kemalettin Bey who pioneered the founding of the Ottoman Society of Architects and Engineers, and who personally penned the call to the meetings of the Foundation through the Tanin newspaper.\n\nHis final role was membership, and subsequently the presidency, of the Council of Fine Arts founded by the Ministry of Education in 1926.\n\n==Thinking and writing==\nThe writing of Turkish architecture and the history of architecture is a field that opened up late and has not yet accumulated enough strength. Even today it does not appear to have reached the necessary level. \nKemalettin Bey is an unrivalled pioneer on this subject. \nHis thoughts on living and professional models are also incomparable. On the one hand there is his identity as an architect and professional experience in that he designed many buildings, most of which he built; on the other hand there is the duty that is obligatory for the teaching profession of transferring information and experience within specific systematics; a writing function arising from the synergy of this dichotomy and a realisation of the need for questioning, evaluation and historical contextualisation. \nWhen research and thought of the genetic codes of a work and profession are perceived as a mission, the first or earliest written account of our history of architecture has begun. Of course the content and the approach can be debated. But not his pioneering.\n\n==1870-1891==\nThe availability of information and documentation of the first years of Kemalettin's life is very limited. All that is known is that he started at the Ibrahim Aga primary school near his home in 1875 and that he learned French and Arabic at the special school, to which his father was appointed, opened for children of army officers in Crete in 1881.\n\nWhen he returned to \u0130stanbul he continued his education at the Numune-i Terakki school, which provided a model education. He graduated from this school, where the most well known teachers of the era gave lessons such as the mathematician Mehmed Nadir or the astronomer Huseyin Efendi. In 1887, he was accepted into the second class of the Hendese-i Mulkiye. He was awarded the Medal for Industry while he was still a student and graduated in 1891.\n\n==1870-1909==\nStructural engineering and architecture are taught together at the historical Muhendishane (Hendese-i Mulkiye) in Hal\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu, which Kemalettin starts attending in the second class. Kemalettin shows more interest in Prof. Jasmund's architecture classes than in engineering classes. Nevertheless, his training as an engineer makes itself felt in all his designs.\n\n==1909-1919==\nOn 18 May 1909, he was appointed head of architecture at the Imperial Ministry of Foundations (or, the General Directorate of Foundations, as it is now known). The years of this period of office, 1909-1919, were the most productive era for Kemalettin Bey from the perspective of architectural design and applications.\n\nAs well as running maintenance and repair works on historical structures, the traditional role of the ministry, he also designed and built new construction projects.\n\nThe restoration works that made it possible to become acquainted with and examine Ottoman architecture directly and in a concrete manner were his field of reference for new building designs. He took the information source of trials that distinguish the language of architecture experimentation from these works and applied it. His restoration works are the least well known and least documented of Kemalettin Bey's works. We can find out about the restoration of the Yeni Cami Hunkar imperial gathering place from written documents, and the restoration of Fatih Mosque and its rest house and Nuruosmaniye Mosque from the drawings in the archive of the General Directorate of Foundations.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Edirne Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 Tren \u0130stasyonu.jpg|thumb|Edirne Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 Tren \u0130stasyonu (Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 Railroad Station in Edirne) designed by Mimar Kemalettin Bey]]\nAfter the proclamation of the [[Second Constitutional Era|Second Constitutional Monarchy]] in 1908, Ahmet Kemaleddin Bey was appointed director of the Construction and Restoration Department at the Ministry of Foundations ({{lang-ota|Evkaf Nezareti}}).<ref name=\"tcmb\"/><ref name=\"m\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mimarizm.com/Haberler/HaberDetay.aspx?id=47700 |publisher=Mimarizm |title=Art\u0131k Mimar Kemaleddin Bey'in de Bir Dikili Ta\u015f\u0131 Var |author=Tufan, Mesut |date=2007-07-16 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-26 }}</ref>\n\nHe designed four railway stations for the [[Oriental Railway Company]].

He rendered the characteristics of Ottoman and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] structures so that they reflect the Turkish national identity. He put [[arch]]es, [[coping (architecture)|coping]]s and tiles on the facade of his buildings in foreground, emphasized symmetry and highlighted conventional style with [[turret]]s and [[cornice]]s.<ref name=\"tcmb\"/>\n\n==Final years==\nRegrettably Kemalettin Bey's dazzling career crowned by his restoration of the [[Dome of the Rock]]{{dubious|More likely: Al-Aqsa - ? Maybe both, or entire Haram?|date=August 2016}} in Jerusalem and the RIBA award he won for it did not have a happy ending. The cool stance developing towards the end of the 1920s on the National Architecture comprising Ottoman forms he represented in Ankara, the city he went to on an official call and where he built important structures, led to his alienation and solitude.\n\nHowever, at that time such alienation was nothing unique either to him or to Turkey. In the 1920s with the emergence of modern architecture that offered a whole new world of shapes countless architects of the generation of Kemalettin Bey, who could not break free from the forms of old, shared the same fate around the same time almost all over the world.\n\nHe lived in a time segment that was as full of joy and ebullience as it was of traumatic disappointments. And his life ended in a hotel room in Ankara on 12 July 1927.{{dubious|Not 13th?|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Mimar Kemaleddin Tomb.jpg|thumb|280px|Grave of Mimar Kemalettin Bey at the cemetery of the [[Bayezid II Mosque, Istanbul|Bayezid II Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nAhmet Kemalettin died on July 13, 1927, in Ankara at the building site of [[Ankara Palas]] as a result of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], at the age of 57. He was survived by his wife Sabiha and son [[\u0130lhan Mimaro\u011flu]], who became a renowned composer. His corpse was transferred to Istanbul, and was laid to rest at the [[Karacaahmet Cemetery]].

The hotel was designed in 1924 by Architect Vedad Bey, but when he left the project the hotel was built according to Kemalettin Bey's new design and opened for business in the autumn of 1927.\n\nThe hotel was the setting for Ankara's important political and social meetings, particularly during the early years of the Republic, and was a venue for welcoming all the important guests of the state.\n\nThe large balcony with pointed arches on the axially planned rectangular mass' axis, the raised mass and its domed entrance emphasize its orientalist appearance and monumental aspect. There is a magnificent ballroom receiving daylight from above.\n\nThe limitation of traditional decoration to balcony parapets and console stones balances the Orientalist emphasis.\n\n===Main building of [[Turkish State Railways]], Ankara (1928)===\nThis is Kemalettin Bey's last design. The foundations of the building were made a month after the architect's death and construction was completed in 1928. These multi storey residences that were actually designed for railway employees were used temporarily and then permanently by the administration.\n\nAccording to available documents the building that is identified together with the 19th May Square in front of Ankara Station and the station itself was designed as an apartment built around a spacious inner courtyard. However, only one third of the section in the station direction was completed. In spite of the projections made on each axis for axial emphasis, the central corridor plan and texture of the facade with flat square windows is austere. The decorative ironwork of the high gate opening into the courtyard and the large rosace patterned ironwork in the half circle arch above it is incomparable.\n\n===Gazi Institute of Education, Ankara (1930)===\nThe building of [[Gazi E\u011fitim Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc|Gazi Institute of Education]] ({{lang-tr|Gazi E\u011fitim Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc}}) is one of Kemalettin Bey's last works. Its design was completed in 1927 and its construction in 1930; the same year in which the school began its educational programme .\n\nThe building consists of four storeys including the basement and occupies a large rectangular area. Two inner courtyards symmetrically aligned with the entrance axis are surrounded with a corridor system in the axial plan. The midsection on the axis is five storeys high with a sixth floor over the entrance used as an observatorium.\n\nThe entrance porch accessed by wide steps is indicated with colossal columns and high arches. On the upper veranda a distinctive balance and decorative accent pattern is achieved with the lintels of pairs of flat arched dwarf.\n\nThe classicist fiction of the 'losenge' patterned colonnades in the entrances allow the magnificence of the building to be sensed on a human scale.\n\n==Honours==\n* A street across [[Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Railway Terminal]] and crossing Hamidiye Cad., on which his masterpiece [[Istanbul 4th Vak\u0131f Han]] is situated, is named in his honour.\n* In 2009, a new series of [[Turkish lira]] banknotes went into circulation. The reverse side of the 20-lira banknote depicts Mimar Kemalettin, together with one of his major works, the rectorate building of [[Gazi University]] in [[Ankara]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVgJAQAAIAAJ&dq=related:OCLC9595498&hl=tr&source=gbs_book_similarbooks |title=Mimar Kemalettin ve birinci ulusal mimarl\u0131k d\u00f6nemi |author=Yavuz, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m |publisher=ODT\u00dc Mimarl\u0131k Fak\u00fcltesi Bas\u0131m \u0130\u015fli\u011fi |year=1981 |pages=372 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-28 }}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAJIQwAACAAJ&dq=related:OCLC9595498&redir_esc=y |title=Mimar A.

He was among the pioneers of the [[first national architectural movement]].\n\nHis lifetime saw intense and important changes for Turkish history and culture.\n\n==Early years==\nAhmet Kemalettin was born 1870 in a middle-class family to Ali Bey, a naval [[captain (naval)|captain]], and his wife Sadberk Han\u0131m at [[Ac\u0131badem, Kad\u0131k\u00f6y|Ac\u0131badem]] neighborhood of [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] district in [[Istanbul]]. In 1875, he began with his primary education at \"\u0130brahim A\u011fa \u0130btidai Mektebi\". He continued his secondary education in 1881 on [[Crete]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) due to his father's assignment. Returned soon after to Istanbul, he finished the high school.<ref name=\"tcmb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/tlkampanya/download/ozgecmisler.pdf |publisher=TCMB |title=Mimar Kemaleddin (1870 \u0130stanbul - 1927 \u0130stanbul) |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114223430/http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/tlkampanya/download/ozgecmisler.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1887 at the age of 17, he entered the School of Civil Engineering ({{lang-ota|Hendese-i M\u00fclkiye Mektebi}}, today's [[Istanbul Technical University]]). Ahmet Kemalettin graduated as an engineer with honours in 1891. He then remained at his [[alma mater]] and worked as an assistant for four years. During this time, he created his own works in his office he had opened outside the university.<ref name=\"tcmb\"/>\n\nIn 1895, promoted by his scholar [[Germany|German]] architect August Jachmund, designer of the [[Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Railway Terminal]] in Istanbul, and supported by a state scholarship, he went to Germany, where he was educated two years in architecture at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg]] in [[Berlin]]. Afterwards, he worked two-and-half years in various architecture offices gaining professional experience.<ref name=\"tcmb\"/>\n\nIn 1900, Ahmet Kemalettin returned home and resumed work at the university. Following the departure of August Jachmund, he assumed his post as lecturer. In 1908, he played a pioneering role in the formation of the first vocational organization for engineers and architects in the Ottoman Empire, the \"Society of Ottoman Architects and Engineers\".<ref name=\"tcmb\"/><ref name=\"m\"/>\n\n== Designing and building ==\nWhilst still a student at the Hendese-i Mulk\u0131ye (State School of Engineering) where he commenced his studies in 1887 he received the Medal for Industry. He must have been hardworking and creative. These personal attributes may have been related to his greater interest in the lessons of Prof. Jasmund on architecture than in engineering and to the fact that Prof. Jasmund chose him as his assistant.\n\nKemalettin shows himself to be a designer open to learning and experimentation and is also a portrayal of a self-reliant architect.\n\nHowever great an influence Jasmund and the [[Germany|German]] connections are on his perception of design, the wide scope of his references is also important. The Art Nouveau of Ratip Pasha Mansion, a building of the early era, or the connection of Harikzedegan Apartments with French public housing, the Orientalist flavour in the design of the Evkaf-\u0131 Humayun Nezareti (Ministry of Imperial Foundations), the eclectic style of the 3rd Foundation Han or the [[Empire line]] of the Husnu Pasha Tomb cannot be ignored.\n\nA Kemaleddin work doubtless presents an image overflowing with ideological connections. Only here his creativity also feeds his ideology. The transformation of his ideology into a school of architecture is essentially down to his creative talent and self-confidence, if also fed by his industriousness and organisational expertise or teaching skill/teaching discipline. \nHis life was already over when he ascertained the eventuality of this confidence being shaken. \nHis architecture was a tale that prevented the hero from experiencing a tragic end, from an untimely death.\n\n==Restorer with principles==\nOn 27 Rebi-\u00fcl ahir 1327/18 May 1909, he was appointed head of architecture at the Imperial Ministry of Foundations. \nThe possibility of designing and bringing to fruition new building projects is an irresistible passion for an architect, but running maintenance and restoration works on historical buildings, the basic and traditional function of the Ministry, was also a very special learning opportunity. Kemalettin took the intelligent approach of evaluating the two fields together and allowing each to foster the other. Restoration was an opportunity for productivity in which he drew on and applied information that was the source for the experimentation that differentiates architectural language.\n\nWhilst perceiving restoration as a method of interpreting traditional architecture and making the linguistic infrastructure for its renewal, he attempted to manage and give direction to a field whose principles were as yet not clearly defined.\n\nHe knew that restoration was not an ordinary repairs job. He taught it.\n\nHe pioneered in the field by restoring a great number of Ottoman monumental structures employing for the first time a scientific approach.\n\nHe restored the Yeni Cami Hunkar Gathering Place with passionate enthusiasm. But his principal performance was certainly the Mescid-i Aksa and Harem-i Serif project. The skill he demonstrated in the restoration of the Mescid-i Aksa won him international acclaim and an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects.\n\n==Teaching and organizing==\nOn graduation from the Hendese-i M\u00fclkiye he was appointed to the teaching staff of Technology and Architecture at the same school and as Prof. Jasmund's assistant. On his return from Germany where he went to gain knowledge and experience he took up his post at the Hendese-i Mulkiye again. And from that point on he continued to teach. He educated hundreds of students at Sanayi-i Nefise Mekteb-i Alisi (the Academy of Fine Arts), Konduktor Mekteb-i Alisi (the Conductor School) and Muhendis Mekteb-i Alis (the Academy of Engineering).\n\nThey were the years when the school of civil engineering was founded and developed as part of the Muhendishane-i Berri-i Humayun (the Military School of Engineering). At the stage when the curriculum of the school was being developed Kemalettin Bey was running a large number of different courses. It was an open field ranging from Technology and Architecture to Pen and Ink and Shadow Drawing and from Calligraphy to Iron Works. But what is certain is that he transmitted his enthusiasm to the students.\n\nWhen he was appointed to the Evkaf Nezareti, he took his students to the Building and Reparation Technological Assembly to meet the anticipated demand for intensive and fast production. This permanent staff composed of the talented architects and engineers he had chosen was to turn into a school and its office was to become a production centre, as it were, of the design concept given the name of national architecture.\n\nBut that was not all.\n\nIt was Kemalettin Bey who pioneered the founding of the Ottoman Society of Architects and Engineers, and who personally penned the call to the meetings of the Foundation through the Tanin newspaper.\n\nHis final role was membership, and subsequently the presidency, of the Council of Fine Arts founded by the Ministry of Education in 1926.\n\n==Thinking and writing==\nThe writing of Turkish architecture and the history of architecture is a field that opened up late and has not yet accumulated enough strength. Even today it does not appear to have reached the necessary level. \nKemalettin Bey is an unrivalled pioneer on this subject. \nHis thoughts on living and professional models are also incomparable. On the one hand there is his identity as an architect and professional experience in that he designed many buildings, most of which he built; on the other hand there is the duty that is obligatory for the teaching profession of transferring information and experience within specific systematics; a writing function arising from the synergy of this dichotomy and a realisation of the need for questioning, evaluation and historical contextualisation. \nWhen research and thought of the genetic codes of a work and profession are perceived as a mission, the first or earliest written account of our history of architecture has begun. Of course the content and the approach can be debated. But not his pioneering.\n\n==1870-1891==\nThe availability of information and documentation of the first years of Kemalettin's life is very limited. All that is known is that he started at the Ibrahim Aga primary school near his home in 1875 and that he learned French and Arabic at the special school, to which his father was appointed, opened for children of army officers in Crete in 1881.\n\nWhen he returned to \u0130stanbul he continued his education at the Numune-i Terakki school, which provided a model education. He graduated from this school, where the most well known teachers of the era gave lessons such as the mathematician Mehmed Nadir or the astronomer Huseyin Efendi. In 1887, he was accepted into the second class of the Hendese-i Mulkiye. He was awarded the Medal for Industry while he was still a student and graduated in 1891.\n\n==1870-1909==\nStructural engineering and architecture are taught together at the historical Muhendishane (Hendese-i Mulkiye) in Hal\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu, which Kemalettin starts attending in the second class. Kemalettin shows more interest in Prof. Jasmund's architecture classes than in engineering classes. Nevertheless, his training as an engineer makes itself felt in all his designs.\n\n==1909-1919==\nOn 18 May 1909, he was appointed head of architecture at the Imperial Ministry of Foundations (or, the General Directorate of Foundations, as it is now known). The years of this period of office, 1909-1919, were the most productive era for Kemalettin Bey from the perspective of architectural design and applications.\n\nAs well as running maintenance and repair works on historical structures, the traditional role of the ministry, he also designed and built new construction projects.\n\nThe restoration works that made it possible to become acquainted with and examine Ottoman architecture directly and in a concrete manner were his field of reference for new building designs. He took the information source of trials that distinguish the language of architecture experimentation from these works and applied it. His restoration works are the least well known and least documented of Kemalettin Bey's works. We can find out about the restoration of the Yeni Cami Hunkar imperial gathering place from written documents, and the restoration of Fatih Mosque and its rest house and Nuruosmaniye Mosque from the drawings in the archive of the General Directorate of Foundations.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Edirne Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 Tren \u0130stasyonu.jpg|thumb|Edirne Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 Tren \u0130stasyonu (Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 Railroad Station in Edirne) designed by Mimar Kemalettin Bey]]\nAfter the proclamation of the [[Second Constitutional Era|Second Constitutional Monarchy]] in 1908, Ahmet Kemaleddin Bey was appointed director of the Construction and Restoration Department at the Ministry of Foundations ({{lang-ota|Evkaf Nezareti}}).<ref name=\"tcmb\"/><ref name=\"m\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mimarizm.com/Haberler/HaberDetay.aspx?id=47700 |publisher=Mimarizm |title=Art\u0131k Mimar Kemaleddin Bey'in de Bir Dikili Ta\u015f\u0131 Var |author=Tufan, Mesut |date=2007-07-16 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-26 }}</ref>\n\nHe designed four railway stations for the [[Oriental Railway Company]].

The cool stance developing towards the end of the 1920s on the National Architecture comprising Ottoman forms he represented in Ankara, the city he went to on an official call and where he built important structures, led to his alienation and solitude.\n\nHowever, at that time such alienation was nothing unique either to him or to Turkey. In the 1920s with the emergence of modern architecture that offered a whole new world of shapes countless architects of the generation of Kemalettin Bey, who could not break free from the forms of old, shared the same fate around the same time almost all over the world.\n\nHe lived in a time segment that was as full of joy and ebullience as it was of traumatic disappointments.

He was survived by his wife Sabiha and son [[\u0130lhan Mimaro\u011flu]], who became a renowned composer. His corpse was transferred to Istanbul, and was laid to rest at the [[Karacaahmet Cemetery]]. Some years later, without the knowledge of his family his grave was moved to the graveyard of [[Bayezid II Mosque]], due to the construction of a road between [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar]], which went through the cemetery on the spot of his grave. Reburied at the new site without a headstone, his grave was discovered in the 1990s. In 2007, his burial place was restored.<ref name=\"m\"/><ref name=\"a\">{{cite web |url=http://v3.arkitera.com/h24340-mimar-kemaleddin-tarihin-donum-noktalarinda-bir-mimar.html |publisher=arkitera |title=Mimar Kemaleddin: Tarihin d\u00f6n\u00fcm noktalar\u0131nda bir mimar |date=2008-01-25 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalDetayV3&ArticleID=985106&CategoryID=40 |newspaper=[[Radikal]] |title=Ulusal mimarl\u0131k hazinesi Kemalettin |date=2010-03-12 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-28 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable works==\nHe designed among others the [[Tayyare Apartments]], built between 1919-1922 in [[Istanbul]], which were redeveloped in 1985 into luxury hotel premises.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2006/03/12/eko109.html |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] Ekonomi |title=Tayyare Apartmanlar\u0131 Crowne Plaza oldu |date=2006-03-12 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-26 }}</ref> His another work [[Istanbul 4th Vak\u0131f Han]] was converted into a five-star World Park Hotel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=4820894 |newspaper=[[H\u00fcrriyet]] |title=Tarihi yar\u0131madada yeni bir adres Vak\u0131f Han 94 y\u0131l sonra otel oldu |author=Ba\u015faran, Duygu |date=2006-07-28 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-26 }}</ref>\n\nNotable works of him include:<ref name=\"m\"/>\n* [[Ey\u00fcp]] Anadolu High School, Istanbul\n* \u00c7apa Anadolu Teachers' High School, Istanbul\n* [[\u015eemsipa\u015fa \u0130lk\u00f6\u011fretim Okulu|\u015eemsi Pasha Primary School]]\n* \u00c7aml\u0131ca Girls' High School\n* [[Bostanc\u0131]] Mosque, Istanbul\n* [[Ye\u015filk\u00f6y]] Mosque, Istanbul\n* Re\u015fadiye School (today's [[Ey\u00fcp]] Middle School), Istanbul\n* Tomb of [[Mehmed V|Sultan Reshad]]\n* Tomb of [[Osman Nuri Pasha|Gazi Osman Pasha]]\n* Tomb of [[Mahmud Shevket Pasha]]\nThe tomb made for Mahmut \u015eevket Pasha, one of the last Ottoman grand viziers, and his aide Ibrahim Hal\u0131l Bey and his footman Kaz\u0131m Efendi is in the Hurriyet-i Ebediye War Cemetery to commemorate those who lost their lives in the events of 31 March 1909.

The hotel was designed in 1924 by Architect Vedad Bey, but when he left the project the hotel was built according to Kemalettin Bey's new design and opened for business in the autumn of 1927.\n\nThe hotel was the setting for Ankara's important political and social meetings, particularly during the early years of the Republic, and was a venue for welcoming all the important guests of the state.\n\nThe large balcony with pointed arches on the axially planned rectangular mass' axis, the raised mass and its domed entrance emphasize its orientalist appearance and monumental aspect. There is a magnificent ballroom receiving daylight from above.\n\nThe limitation of traditional decoration to balcony parapets and console stones balances the Orientalist emphasis.\n\n===Main building of [[Turkish State Railways]], Ankara (1928)===\nThis is Kemalettin Bey's last design. The foundations of the building were made a month after the architect's death and construction was completed in 1928. These multi storey residences that were actually designed for railway employees were used temporarily and then permanently by the administration.\n\nAccording to available documents the building that is identified together with the 19th May Square in front of Ankara Station and the station itself was designed as an apartment built around a spacious inner courtyard. However, only one third of the section in the station direction was completed. In spite of the projections made on each axis for axial emphasis, the central corridor plan and texture of the facade with flat square windows is austere. The decorative ironwork of the high gate opening into the courtyard and the large rosace patterned ironwork in the half circle arch above it is incomparable.\n\n===Gazi Institute of Education, Ankara (1930)===\nThe building of [[Gazi E\u011fitim Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc|Gazi Institute of Education]] ({{lang-tr|Gazi E\u011fitim Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc}}) is one of Kemalettin Bey's last works. Its design was completed in 1927 and its construction in 1930; the same year in which the school began its educational programme .\n\nThe building consists of four storeys including the basement and occupies a large rectangular area. Two inner courtyards symmetrically aligned with the entrance axis are surrounded with a corridor system in the axial plan. The midsection on the axis is five storeys high with a sixth floor over the entrance used as an observatorium.\n\nThe entrance porch accessed by wide steps is indicated with colossal columns and high arches. On the upper veranda a distinctive balance and decorative accent pattern is achieved with the lintels of pairs of flat arched dwarf.\n\nThe classicist fiction of the 'losenge' patterned colonnades in the entrances allow the magnificence of the building to be sensed on a human scale.\n\n==Honours==\n* A street across [[Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Railway Terminal]] and crossing Hamidiye Cad., on which his masterpiece [[Istanbul 4th Vak\u0131f Han]] is situated, is named in his honour.\n* In 2009, a new series of [[Turkish lira]] banknotes went into circulation. The reverse side of the 20-lira banknote depicts Mimar Kemalettin, together with one of his major works, the rectorate building of [[Gazi University]] in [[Ankara]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVgJAQAAIAAJ&dq=related:OCLC9595498&hl=tr&source=gbs_book_similarbooks |title=Mimar Kemalettin ve birinci ulusal mimarl\u0131k d\u00f6nemi |author=Yavuz, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m |publisher=ODT\u00dc Mimarl\u0131k Fak\u00fcltesi Bas\u0131m \u0130\u015fli\u011fi |year=1981 |pages=372 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-28 }}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAJIQwAACAAJ&dq=related:OCLC9595498&redir_esc=y |title=Mimar A.
