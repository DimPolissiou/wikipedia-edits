Courtesy [[NASA]].]]\nThe inhabitants of the Duff Islands are [[Polynesians]], and their language, [[Vaeakau-Taumako language|Vaeakau-Taumako]], is a member of the [[Samoic languages|Samoic]] branch of [[Polynesian languages]].\nOn the Duff Islands live about 439 people (1999 census). The islands were settled at least as early as 900 BC, by people who made pottery known as Lapita. Archaeological research has shown that this pottery was made using local clay and sand from the island. These Lapita people spread far as wide from the coastal area of Papua New Guinea to the islands of Tonga and Samoa; that is, throughout islands known as both Melanesia and Polynesia. Consequently, the people of Taumako experienced wide-ranging influences, and could be said to have been both Melanesian and Polynesian throughout their long history.\n\nThe way of life is traditional by subsistence gardening and fishing. Taumako has no roads, airport, telephones, or electricity. Contact with outsiders comes by battery-powered marine radio and the regular monthly inter-island ship from Honiara.\n\n==Traditional navigation==\nStudies of [[David Henry Lewis|David Lewis]] and Marianne (Mimi) George uncovered that full traditional Polynesian navigational technique is still preserved in these islands (Finney and Lowe, 2006, p163). The people of Taumako are the builders of one of the oldest documented [[proa]] sailing canoe, called Te Puke and known to westerners as [[Tepukei]].\n\n==Prehistory==\nPeople have been living in the Duff Islands for 3,000 years. The first people on these islands made pottery using clay and sand [[Temper (pottery)|temper]] which was available locally. A small amount of this pottery was decorated in the distinctive [[Lapita]] style with dentate stamping. These first inhabitants made stone tools using high quality chert which was also local. This same chert has been found in archaeological sites in the nearby [[Reef Islands]], dating at least two centuries before the first known evidence in the Duff Islands.<ref>Leach, B.F. and Davidson, J.M. 2008.

Horton</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This is the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. For many years you have seen us as lights in the skies. We speak to you now in peace and wisdom as we have done to your brothers and sisters all over this, your planet Earth. We come to warn you of the destiny of your race and your world so that you may communicate to your fellow beings the course you must take to avoid the disaster which threatens your world, and the beings on our worlds around you. This is in order that you may share in the great awakening, as the planet passes into the New Age of Aquarius. The New Age can be a time of great peace and evolution for your race, but only if your rulers are made aware of the evil forces that can overshadow their judgments. Be still now and listen, for your chance may not come again. All your weapons of evil must be removed. The time for conflict is now past and the race of which you are a part may proceed to the higher stages of its evolution if you show yourselves worthy to do this. You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace and goodwill. Small groups all over the planet are learning this, and exist to pass on the light of the dawning New Age to you all. You are free to accept or reject their teachings, but only those who learn to live in peace will pass to the higher realms of spiritual evolution. Hear now the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. Be aware also that there are many false prophets and guides at present operating on your world. They will suck your energy from you \u2013 the energy you call money and will put it to evil ends and give you worthless dross in return. Your inner divine self will protect you from this. You must learn to be sensitive to the voice within that can tell you what is truth, and what is confusion, chaos and untruth. Learn to listen to the voice of truth which is within you and you will lead yourselves onto the path of evolution. This is our message to our dear friends. We have watched you growing for many years as you too have watched our lights in your skies. You know now that we are here, and that there are more beings on and around your Earth than your scientists admit. We are deeply concerned about you and your path towards the light and will do all we can to help you. Have no fear, seek only to know yourselves, and live in harmony with the ways of your planet Earth. We here at the Ashtar Galactic Command thank you for your attention. We are now leaving the planes of your existence. May you be blessed by the supreme love and truth of the cosmos.</blockquote>\n\nThe Winter 1977 issue of ''[[Fortean Times]]'' (issue #24)<ref>{{cite book\n\n|title=Diary of a Mad Planet: Fortean Times Issues 16\u201325\n|publisher=John Brown Publishing Ltd\n|date=1995\n|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=06m7AAAACAAJ&dq=diary+of+a+mad+planet&ei=9X2uSvuDB5qEkASfoISXAw\n|isbn=1-870021-25-8}}</ref> magazine featured a transcript of what they described as the 'short message' that was broadcast:\n\n<blockquote>This is the voice of Asteron.

As a consequence it was open to this kind of signal intrusion, as even a relatively low-powered transmission very close to the rebroadcast receiver could overwhelm its reception of the intended signal, resulting in the unauthorised transmission being amplified and rebroadcast across a far wider area.
