The battalion formed part of the [[Indian Corps]], which was sent to [[France]] in 1914, to shore up the British forces fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the [[First World War]].\n\nIn October 1914, the Germans launched a major offensive in northern [[Belgium]], in order to capture the vital ports of [[Boulogne]] in France and [[Nieuport]] in Belgium. In what came to be known as the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the newly arrived 129th Baluchis were rushed to the frontline to support the hard-pressed British troops. On 31 October, two companies of the Baluchis bore the brunt of the main German attack near the village of Gheluvelt in [[Hollebeke]] Sector. The out-numbered Baluchis fought gallantly but were overwhelmed after suffering heavy casualties. Sepoy Khudadad Khan\u2019s machine-gun team, along with one other, kept their guns in action throughout the day; preventing the Germans from making the final breakthrough. The other gun was disabled by a shell and eventually Khudadad Khan\u2019s own team was overrun. All the men were killed by bullets or bayonets except Khudadad Khan who, despite being badly wounded, had continued working his gun. He was left for dead by the enemy but despite his wounds he managed to crawl back to his regiment during the night. Thanks to his bravery, and that of his fellow Baluchis, the Germans were held up just long enough for Indian and British reinforcements to arrive. They strengthened the line, and prevented the German Army from reaching the vital ports. For his matchless feat of courage and gallantry, Sepoy Khudadad Khan was awarded the Victoria Cross.{{sfnp|Thatcher|1932|pp=13\u201317}}{{sfnp|Ahmed|1998|pp=173\u2013178}}\n\nKhudadad Khan retired as a [[Subedar]].

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 24th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled for release in the United States on November 6, 2020. Its release was delayed from an original May 2020 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> In early April, Disney announced that ''Black Widow'' would now be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their Phase Four slate of films were shifted back to accommodate this change.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was believed to be composing music for the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed to the November 2020 date because of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /><ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

Widow (Natasha Romanova)|of the same name]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 24th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled for release in the United States on November 6, 2020. Its release was delayed from an original May 2020 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> In early April, Disney announced that ''Black Widow'' would now be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their Phase Four slate of films were shifted back to accommodate this change.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was believed to be composing music for the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 6, 2020.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed to the November 2020 date because of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /><ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite
