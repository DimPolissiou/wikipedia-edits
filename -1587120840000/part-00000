According to Byzantine sources, the Muslims planned to launch their attack on a feast day. The local Byzantine [[Vicarius]] learned of their plans and collected the garrisons of the fortresses. Seeing the great number of the enemy forces, the Muslims withdrew to the south where the fighting started at the village of Mu'ta and they were routed.{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}}{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=67}} According to Muslim sources, after three of their leaders were killed, the command was given to [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] and he succeeded in saving the rest of the force.{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}}\n\n==Background==\nThe Byzantines were reoccupying territory following the peace accord between Emperor [[Heraclius]] and the [[Shahrbaraz|Sasanid general Shahrbaraz]] in July 629.{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=72-73}} The Byzantine ''[[sakellarios]]'' Theodore,{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=35}} was placed in command of the army, and while in the area of Balqa, Arab tribes were also employed.{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=72-73}}\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad had sent his emissary to the ruler of Bosra.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}} While on his way to Bosra, he was executed in the village of Mu'tah by the orders of a Ghassanid official.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}}\n\n==Mobilization of the armies==\nMuhammad dispatched 3,000 of his troops in the month of [[Jumada al-Awwal]] 7 (AH), 629 (CE), for a quick expedition to attack and punish the tribes for the murder of his emissary by the Ghassanids.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}} The army was led by [[Zayd ibn Harithah]]; the second-in-command was [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]] and the third-in-command was [[Abd Allah ibn Rawahah]]. When the Muslim troops arrived at the area to the east of Jordan and learned of the size of the Byzantine army, they wanted to wait and send for reinforcements from [[Medina]]. 'Abdullah ibn Rawahah reminded them about their desire for martyrdom and questioned the move to wait when what they desire was awaiting them, so they continued marching towards the waiting army.\n\n==The battle==\nThe Muslims engaged the Byzantines at their camp by the village of Musharif and then withdrew towards Mu'tah. It was here that the two armies fought. Some Muslim sources report that the battle was fought in a valley between two heights, which negated the Byzantines' numerical superiority. During the battle, all three Muslim leaders fell one after the other as they took command of the force: first, Zayd, then Ja'far, then 'Abdullah. After the death of the latter, some of the Muslim soldiers began to rout. Thabit ibn Al-Arqam, seeing the desperate state of the Muslim forces, took up the banner and rallied his comrades thus saving the army from complete destruction. After the battle, Al-Arqam took the banner, before asking [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] to take the lead.<ref name=\"Al-Islam Ja'far\">{{citation |publisher=[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|Al-Islam.org]] |title=Jafar al-Tayyar |url=http://www.al-islam.org/jafar-al-tayyar-kamal-al-sayyid/jafar-al-tayyar/ |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nKhalid bin Walid reported that the fighting at Mu'tah was so intense that he used nine swords which broke during the battle. Khalid, seeing that the situation was hopeless, prepared to withdraw. He continued to engage the Byzantines in skirmishes, but avoided pitched battle.\n\n==Muslim losses==\nThe casualties of slain of the Muslim side were recorded as the four of them from [[Muhajireen]] while eight the rest from [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]. Their names were:\n# [[Zayd ibn Harithah]]\n# [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]] \n# [[Abd Allah ibn Rawahah]] \n# Masoud bin Al-Aswad\n# Wahab bin Saad \n# Abbad bin Qais \n# Amr ibn Saad (not [[Umar ibn Sa'ad|Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas's son]])\n# Harith bin Nu'man\n# Saraqah bin Amr \n# Abu Kulaib bin Amr\n# Jabir ibn 'Amr \n# Amer bin Saad\n\nDaniel C. Peterson, Professor of Islamic Studies at Brigham Young University, finds the ratio of casualties among the leaders suspiciously high compared to the losses suffered by ordinary soldiers.{{sfn|Peterson|2007|p=142}} David Powers, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Cornell, also mentions this curiosity concerning the minuscule casualties recorded by Muslim historians.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nIt is reported that when the Muslim force arrived at Medina, they were berated for withdrawing and accused of fleeing.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=81}} Salamah ibn Hisham, brother of [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]] (Abu Jahl) was reported to have prayed at home rather than going to the mosque to avoid having to explain himself. Muhammad ordered them to stop, saying that they would return to fight the Byzantines again.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=81}} It would not be until the third century AH that Sunni Muslim historians would state that Muhammad bestowed upon Khalid the title of 'Saifullah' meaning 'Sword of Allah'.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}}\n\nToday, Muslims who fell at the battle are considered [[martyr]]s (''[[shahid|shuhad\u0101\u02be]]'').{{cn|date=January 2020}} A [[mausoleum]] was later built at Mu'tah over their graves.{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}}\n\n==Historiography ==\nAccording to [[al-Waqidi]] and [[Ibn Ishaq]], the Muslims were informed that 100,000<ref name=waqidi /> or 200,000<ref name=ishaq/> enemy troops were encamped at [[Balqa]]'.<ref name=waqidi />{{sfn|Haykal|1976|p=419}} Consequently, modern historians refute this stating the figure to be exaggerated.{{sfn|Haldon|2010|p=188}}{{sfn|Peters|1994|p=231}}{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}} According to Walter Emil Kaegi, professor of Byzantine history at the [[University of Chicago]], the size of the entire Byzantine army during the 7th century might have totaled 100,000, possibly even half this number.{{sfn|Kaegi|2010|p=99}} While the Byzantine forces at Mu'tah are unlikely to have numbered more than 10,000.{{efn|The Byzantines do not appear to have used many Greek, Armenian, or other non-Arab soldiers at Mu'ta, even though the overall commander was the ''vicarius'' Theodore. The number that the Byzantines raised are, of course, uncertain, but unlikely to have exceeded 10,000.{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=79}}}}{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=79}}\n\nMuslim accounts of the battle differ over the result.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}} In the earliest Muslim sources, the battle is recorded as a humiliating defeat. (''haz\u012bma'').{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}} Later Muslim historians reworked the early source material to reflect the Islamic view of God's plan.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}} Subsequent sources present the battle as a Muslim victory given that most of the Muslim soldiers returned safely.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Battle of Mu'tah}}\n*[[Military career of Muhammad]]\n*[[List of expeditions of Muhammad]]\n*[[History of Islam]]\n*[[Military career of Muhammad]]\n*[[Jihad]]\n*[[Muhammad's views on Christians]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |title=The Different Aspects of Islam Culture: Volume 3, The Spread of Islam throughout the World |last1=El Hareir |first1=Idris |last2=M'Baye |first2=El Hadji Ravane |publisher=UNESCO publishing |year=2011 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia | editor =H.

According to Byzantine sources, the Muslims planned to launch their attack on a feast day. The local Byzantine [[Vicarius]] learned of their plans and collected the garrisons of the fortresses. Seeing the great number of the enemy forces, the Muslims withdrew to the south where the fighting started at the village of Mu'ta and they were routed.{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}}{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=67}} According to Muslim sources, after three of their leaders were killed, the command was given to [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] and he succeeded in saving the rest of the force.{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}}\n\n==Background==\nThe Byzantines were reoccupying territory following the peace accord between Emperor [[Heraclius]] and the [[Shahrbaraz|Sasanid general Shahrbaraz]] in July 629.{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=72-73}} The Byzantine ''[[sakellarios]]'' Theodore,{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=35}} was placed in command of the army, and while in the area of Balqa, Arab tribes were also employed.{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=72-73}}\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad had sent his emissary to the ruler of Bosra.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}} While on his way to Bosra, he was executed in the village of Mu'tah by the orders of a Ghassanid official.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}}\n\n==Mobilization of the armies==\nMuhammad dispatched 3,000 of his troops in the month of [[Jumada al-Awwal]] 7 (AH), 629 (CE), for a quick expedition to attack and punish the tribes for the murder of his emissary by the Ghassanids.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}} The army was led by [[Zayd ibn Harithah]]; the second-in-command was [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]] and the third-in-command was [[Abd Allah ibn Rawahah]]. When the Muslim troops arrived at the area to the east of Jordan and learned of the size of the Byzantine army, they wanted to wait and send for reinforcements from [[Medina]]. 'Abdullah ibn Rawahah reminded them about their desire for martyrdom and questioned the move to wait when what they desire was awaiting them, so they continued marching towards the waiting army.\n\n==The battle==\nThe Muslims engaged the Byzantines at their camp by the village of Musharif and then withdrew towards Mu'tah. It was here that the two armies fought. Some Muslim sources report that the battle was fought in a valley between two heights, which negated the Byzantines' numerical superiority. During the battle, all three Muslim leaders fell one after the other as they took command of the force: first, Zayd, then Ja'far, then 'Abdullah. After the death of the latter, some of the Muslim soldiers began to rout. Thabit ibn Al-Arqam, seeing the desperate state of the Muslim forces, took up the banner and rallied his comrades thus saving the army from complete destruction. After the battle, Al-Arqam took the banner, before asking [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] to take the lead.<ref name=\"Al-Islam Ja'far\">{{citation |publisher=[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|Al-Islam.org]] |title=Jafar al-Tayyar |url=http://www.al-islam.org/jafar-al-tayyar-kamal-al-sayyid/jafar-al-tayyar/ |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nKhalid bin Walid reported that the fighting at Mu'tah was so intense that he used nine swords which broke during the battle. Khalid, seeing that the situation was hopeless, prepared to withdraw. He continued to engage the Byzantines in skirmishes, but avoided pitched battle.\n\n==Muslim losses==\nThe casualties of slain of the Muslim side were recorded as the four of them from [[Muhajireen]] while eight the rest from [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]. Their names were:\n# [[Zayd ibn Harithah]]\n# [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]] \n# [[Abd Allah ibn Rawahah]] \n# Masoud bin Al-Aswad\n# Wahab bin Saad \n# Abbad bin Qais \n# Amr ibn Saad (not [[Umar ibn Sa'ad|Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas's son]])\n# Harith bin Nu'man\n# Saraqah bin Amr \n# Abu Kulaib bin Amr\n# Jabir ibn 'Amr \n# Amer bin Saad\n\nDaniel C. Peterson, Professor of Islamic Studies at Brigham Young University, finds the ratio of casualties among the leaders suspiciously high compared to the losses suffered by ordinary soldiers.{{sfn|Peterson|2007|p=142}} David Powers, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Cornell, also mentions this curiosity concerning the minuscule casualties recorded by Muslim historians.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nIt is reported that when the Muslim force arrived at Medina, they were berated for withdrawing and accused of fleeing.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=81}} Salamah ibn Hisham, brother of [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]] (Abu Jahl) was reported to have prayed at home rather than going to the mosque to avoid having to explain himself. Muhammad ordered them to stop, saying that they would return to fight the Byzantines again.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=81}} It would not be until the third century AH that Sunni Muslim historians would state that Muhammad bestowed upon Khalid the title of 'Saifullah' meaning 'Sword of Allah'.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}}\n\nToday, Muslims who fell at the battle are considered [[martyr]]s (''[[shahid|shuhad\u0101\u02be]]'').{{cn|date=January 2020}} A [[mausoleum]] was later built at Mu'tah over their graves.{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}}\n\n==Historiography ==\nAccording to [[al-Waqidi]] and [[Ibn Ishaq]], the Muslims were informed that 100,000<ref name=waqidi /> or 200,000<ref name=ishaq/> enemy troops were encamped at [[Balqa]]'.<ref name=waqidi />{{sfn|Haykal|1976|p=419}} Consequently, modern historians refute this stating the figure to be exaggerated.{{sfn|Haldon|2010|p=188}}{{sfn|Peters|1994|p=231}}{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}} According to Walter Emil Kaegi, professor of Byzantine history at the [[University of Chicago]], the size of the entire Byzantine army during the 7th century might have totaled 100,000, possibly even half this number.{{sfn|Kaegi|2010|p=99}} While the Byzantine forces at Mu'tah are unlikely to have numbered more than 10,000.{{efn|The Byzantines do not appear to have used many Greek, Armenian, or other non-Arab soldiers at Mu'ta, even though the overall commander was the ''vicarius'' Theodore. The number that the Byzantines raised are, of course, uncertain, but unlikely to have exceeded 10,000.{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=79}}}}{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=79}}\n\nMuslim accounts of the battle differ over the result.{{sfn|Powers|2009|p=80}} In the earliest Muslim sources, the battle is recorded as a humiliating defeat.

If the force of the impact is excessive, the [[bone]] may fracture at or near the site of the impact and cause damage to the underlying structures within the skull such as the [[Meninges|membranes]], [[blood vessel]]s, and [[Human brain|brain]].\n\nWhile an uncomplicated skull fracture can occur without associated  physical or [[neurological]] damage and is in itself usually not clinically significant, a fracture in healthy bone indicates that a substantial amount of force has been applied and increases the possibility of associated [[traumatic brain injury|injury]]. Any significant blow to the head results in a [[concussion]], with or without loss of [[consciousness]].\n\nA fracture in conjunction with an overlying [[laceration]] that tears the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the [[meninges]], or runs through the [[paranasal sinuses]] and the [[middle ear]] structures, bringing the outside environment into contact with the cranial cavity is called a compound fracture. Compound fractures can either be clean or contaminated.\n\nThere are four major types of skull fractures: linear, depressed, diastatic, and basilar. Linear fractures are the most common, and usually require no intervention for the fracture itself. Depressed fractures are usually [[Bone fracture|comminuted]], with broken portions of bone displaced inward\u2014and may require surgical intervention to repair underlying tissue damage. Diastatic fractures widen the sutures of the skull and usually affect children under three. Basilar fractures are in the bones at the base of the skull.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Types==\n\n===Linear fracture===\nLinear skull fractures are breaks in the bone that transverse the full thickness of the skull from the outer to inner table. They are usually fairly straight with no bone displacement. The common cause of injury is blunt force trauma where the impact energy transferred over a wide area of the skull.\n\nLinear skull fractures are usually of little clinical significance unless they parallel in close proximity or transverse a [[Suture (joint)|suture]], or they involve a venous sinus groove or vascular channel. The resulting complications may include suture [[diastasis (pathology)|diastasis]], [[venous sinus thrombosis]], and [[epidural hematoma]].

Thus the traumatic impact required to cause a fracture depends on the impact site. The skull is thick at the [[glabella]], the [[external occipital protuberance]], the [[mastoid process]]es, and the external angular process. Areas of the skull that are covered with muscle have no underlying diplo\u00eb formation between the internal and external lamina, which results in thin bone more susceptible to fractures.\n\nSkull fractures occur more easily at the thin squamous [[Squama temporalis|temporal]] and [[parietal bone]]s, the [[sphenoid sinus]], the [[foramen magnum]] (the opening at the base of the skull that the spinal cord passes through), the [[Petrous part of the temporal bone|petrous temporal ridge]], and the inner portions of the [[Greater wing of sphenoid bone|sphenoid wings]] at the base of the skull. The [[middle cranial fossa]], a depression at the base of the cranial cavity forms the thinnest part of the skull and is thus the weakest part.

If the force of the impact is excessive, the [[bone]] may fracture at or near the site of the impact and cause damage to the underlying structures within the skull such as the [[Meninges|membranes]], [[blood vessel]]s, and [[Human brain|brain]]. \n\nWhile an uncomplicated skull fracture can occur without associated  physical or [[neurological]] damage and is in itself usually not clinically significant, a fracture in healthy bone indicates that a substantial amount of force has been applied and increases the possibility of associated [[traumatic brain injury|injury]]. Any significant blow to the head results in a [[concussion]], with or without loss of [[consciousness]].\n\nA fracture in conjunction with an overlying [[laceration]] that tears the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the [[meninges]], or runs through the [[paranasal sinuses]] and the [[middle ear]] structures, bringing the outside environment into contact with the cranial cavity is called a compound fracture. Compound fractures can either be clean or contaminated.\n\nThere are four major types of skull fractures: linear, depressed, diastatic, and basilar. Linear fractures are the most common, and usually require no intervention for the fracture itself. Depressed fractures are usually [[Bone fracture|comminuted]], with broken portions of bone displaced inward\u2014and may require surgical intervention to repair underlying tissue damage. Diastatic fractures widen the sutures of the skull and usually affect children under three. Basilar fractures are in the bones at the base of the skull.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Types==\n\n===Linear fracture===\nLinear skull fractures are breaks in the bone that transverse the full thickness of the skull from the outer to inner table. They are usually fairly straight with no bone displacement. The common cause of injury is blunt force trauma where the impact energy transferred over a wide area of the skull.\n\nLinear skull fractures are usually of little clinical significance unless they parallel in close proximity or transverse a [[Suture (joint)|suture]], or they involve a venous sinus groove or vascular channel. The resulting complications may include suture [[diastasis (pathology)|diastasis]], [[venous sinus thrombosis]], and [[epidural hematoma]]. In young children, although rare, the possibility exists of developing a growing skull fracture especially if the fracture occurs in the [[parietal bone]].<ref>Haar FL.

It can also be caused the skull rotating while being struck in a case of blunt force trauma, the skull rotating while striking an inanimate object as in a fall, or it may occur during transfer of a patient after an initial compound head injury.<ref>Elevated skull fracture[www.ijntonline.com/Dec07/abstracts/abs12.PDF]</ref><ref>Adeolu AA, Shokunbi MT, Malomo AO, ''et al.''

Thus the traumatic impact required to cause a fracture depends on the impact site. The skull is thick at the [[glabella]], the [[external occipital protuberance]], the [[mastoid process]]es, and the external angular process. Areas of the skull that are covered with muscle have no underlying diplo\u00eb formation between the internal and external lamina, which results in thin bone more susceptible to fractures.\n\nSkull fractures occur more easily at the thin squamous [[Squama temporalis|temporal]] and [[parietal bone]]s, the [[sphenoid sinus]], the [[foramen magnum]] (the opening at the base of the skull that the spinal cord passes through), the [[Petrous part of the temporal bone|petrous temporal ridge]], and the inner portions of the [[Greater wing of sphenoid bone|sphenoid wings]] at the base of the skull. The [[middle cranial fossa]], a depression at the base of the cranial cavity forms the thinnest part of the skull and is thus the weakest part. This area of the cranial floor is weakened further by the presence of multiple [[Foramina of the skull|foramina]] as a result this section is at higher risk for basilar skull fractures to occur. Other areas more susceptible to fractures are the [[cribriform plate]], the roof of orbits in the [[anterior cranial fossa]], and the areas between the mastoid and [[dural sinus]]es in the [[posterior cranial fossa]].<ref>[[Medscape]]: Ali Nawaz Khan: Imaging in Skull Fractures [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/343764-overview]</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nChildren with a simple skull fracture without other concerns are at low risk of a bad outcome and rarely require aggressive treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bressan|first1=S|last2=Marchetto|first2=L|last3=Lyons|first3=TW|last4=Monuteaux|first4=MC|last5=Freedman|first5=SB|last6=Da Dalt|first6=L|last7=Nigrovic|first7=LE|title=A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Management and Outcomes of Isolated Skull Fractures in Children|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=71|issue=6|pages=714\u2013724.e2|date=23 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.10.014|pmid=29174834}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of a concussion or skull fracture in people after trauma without intracranial [[hemorrhage]] or [[Focal neurologic signs|focal neurologic deficits]] was indicated in long term cognitive impairments and emotional lability at nearly double the rate as those patients without either complication.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17215737 | doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e31802ce9bd | volume=62 | title=Long-term cognitive, emotional, and functional outcomes in trauma intensive care unit survivors without intracranial hemorrhage | date=January 2007 | author=Jackson JC, Obremskey W, Bauer R | display-authors = etal | journal=J Trauma | pages=80\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThose with a skull fracture were shown to have \"neuropsychological dysfunction, even in the absence of intracranial pathology or more severe disturbance of consciousness on the GCS\".<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9058000 | volume=11 | title=Impact of skull fracture on neuropsychological functioning following closed head injury | date=March 1997 | author=Smith-Seemiller L, Lovell MR, Smith S, Markosian N, Townsend RN | journal=Brain Inj | pages=191\u20136 | doi=10.1080/026990597123638}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Le Fort fracture of skull|Le Fort facial fracture]]\n*[[Facial trauma|Facial fracture]]\n*[[Mandibular fracture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Forensic Neuropathology By Jan E.
