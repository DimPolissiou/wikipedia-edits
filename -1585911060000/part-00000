She was the second of a quartet of ships over 20,000 tons, dubbed [[Big Four (White Star Line)|The Big Four]], and was the largest vessel in the world at the time of her launch.<ref name=\"Roberts1901\">* {{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Chalmers |authorlink=  |date=August 1901 |title=The Biggest Ship |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |issue= |pages=1176\u20131179 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&pg=PA1176|accessdate=2009-07-09 |quote= }}</ref>{{not in source|date=September 2019}} After her maiden voyage in 1903, she was in service until 1932.\n\n==History==\n===Construction===\n''Cedric'' was laid down in 1902 at the shipyard of [[Harland and Wolff]], [[Belfast]]. She was the second of [[White Star Line|White Star]]'s series known as the \"[[Big Four (White Star Line)|Big Four]]\", the other three being {{RMS|Celtic|1901|6}}, {{RMS|Baltic|1903|2}} and {{RMS|Adriatic|1906|2}}. ''Celtic'' was the first ship to exceed [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] {{SS|Great Eastern||6}} in overall tonnage, which was quite an accomplishment, considering Brunel's giant ship held the size record for almost 40 years. Except for the ''Adriatic'' all of these in turn, when built, would be the largest ship in the world for a short time. RMS ''Cedric'' was a 21,035-gross register ton ship, {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|75|ft|3.6|in|m|abbr=on}} abeam, with two funnels, four masts, two propellers and a service speed of {{convert|16|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=on}}. There was accommodation for 365 first-, 160 second- and 2352 third-class passengers, and a crew of about 350. She was launched in Belfast on 21 August 1902, in a private ceremony which included several guests, amongst others [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|William Pirrie]], the chairman of Harland and Wolff and [[Bruce Ismay]], chairman of White Star Line.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Launch of the Cedric|day_of_week=Friday |date=22 August 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36853| }}</ref> RMS ''Cedric'' commenced her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York on 11 February 1903. This was the only route on which she was ever used, although ''Cedric'' was also sometimes used for winter cruises to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].\n\n===Trans-Atlantic service===\n[[File:RMS Cedric ship log 21 October 1903.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A transcribed copy of the ship's log dated 21 October 1903]]\nFor the next 11 years the ship plied the [[Atlantic]] crossing without any major incident. When the {{RMS|Titanic||6}} sank in April 1912, ''Cedric'' was in [[New York City]] and the ship's departure was delayed until the {{RMS|Carpathia||6}} arrived with survivors, including crew members not required for the court of inquiry, who wished to travel back to [[Liverpool]]. However, ''Cedric'' had to sail without any of ''Titanic''{{'}}s survivors or crew due to their mandated appearances for testimony at the U.S. inquiry. Her last voyage on the Liverpool-New York service started on 21 October 1914, after which she was requisitioned for war service, and she was then converted to an armed merchant cruiser. ''Cedric'' was decommissioned in 1916, and then she was converted into a troopship for operation initially to [[Egypt]] and then to the U.S. In April 1917, her operation came under the auspices of the Liner Requisition Scheme. On 1 July 1917 Cedric collided with and sank the French schooner Yvonne-Odette with 24 crew drowned from the schooner. On 29 January 1918, ''Cedric'' collided with and sank the [[Canadian Pacific]] ship ''Montreal'' off Morecambe Bay. ''Montreal'' was taken in tow, but she sank the next day {{convert|14|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the Mersey Bar [[Lightvessel|lightship]]. ''Cedric'' was returned to her owner in September 1919 and refitted by [[Harland & Wolff]]. She was refitted to accommodate 347 first-, 250 second- and 1000 third-class passengers. She resumed Liverpool\u2013New York voyages. On 30 September 1923, ''Cedric'' collided with the {{RMS|Scythia||6}} of the [[Cunard Line]] in [[Queenstown, Ireland|Queenstown]] ([[Cobh]]) [[harbour]] during dense [[fog]]. Neither vessel was seriously damaged. On 23 October 1926, she was again altered to cabin, tourist and third class. Her last Liverpool\u2013New York sailing commenced on 5 September 1931 and she was sold later the same year, for \u00a322,150 to [[Thos W Ward]] and scrapped at [[Inverkeithing]] in 1932.\n\n===Notable passengers===\nThe leader of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]], traveled on the R.M.S.

The theme was a traditional one for [[refectory|refectories]], although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it. The main church building had only recently been completed (in 1498). Leonardo's patron, [[Ludovico Sforza]]  planned that the church should be remodeled as a family mausoleum, and to this end, changes were made, perhaps to plans by [[Bramante]]. The entire plan was not carried out. and a smaller mortuary chapel was constructed, adjacent to the cloister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/milan/attractions/venue/1:7329/santa-maria-delle-grazie-the-last-supper |title=Santa Maria delle Grazie & The Last Supper |publisher=Timeout.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329015213/http://www.timeout.com/milan/attractions/venue/1:7329/santa-maria-delle-grazie-the-last-supper|archivedate=29 March 2013|accessdate=30 June 2019}}</ref>\nThe painting was commissioned by Sforza to decorate the wall of the mausoleum. The [[lunette]]s above the main painting, formed by the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] [[Coat of arms|coats-of-arms]]. The opposite wall of the refectory is covered by the [[Crucifixion]] fresco by [[Giovanni Donato da Montorfano]], to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in [[tempera]]; these figures have deteriorated in much the same way as has ''The Last Supper''.<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Ross |title=Leonardo and the Last Supper |date=2012 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=New York |isbn=9781620403082 |page=271}}</ref>  \n\nLeonardo worked on ''The Last Supper'' from about 1495 to 1498, but did not work it continuously. The beginning date is not certain, as the archives of the convent for the period have been destroyed. A document dated 1497 indicates that the painting was nearly completed at that date.<ref>Kenneth Clark. ''Leonardo da Vinci'', Penguin Books 1939, 1993, p. 144.</ref>\nOne story goes that a prior from the monastery complained to Leonardo about its delay, enraging him. He wrote to the head of the monastery, explaining he had been struggling to find the perfect villainous face for Judas, and that if he could not find a face corresponding with what he had in mind, he would use the features of the prior who had complained.<ref name=\"lair\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/leonardo/supper.html |title=The Last Supper |publisher=lairweb.org.nz |accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"steel\">{{cite episode |title=DaVinci |series=The Mark Steel Lectures |network=[[BBC]] |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/body-mind/ou-on-the-bbc-mark-steel-lectures-da-vinci-the-lecture |publisher=The Open University |airdate=7 October 2003 |seriesno=2 |number=2 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref> \n\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"200px\"> \nFile:\"The Last Supper\" by Leonardo da Vinci - Joy of Museums.jpg|The painting as it appears on the refectory wall\nFile:Montorfano, crocifissione, 1497, con interventi di leonardo nei ritratti dei duchi.jpg|Crucifixion, opposite Leonardo's ''Last Supper''\n</gallery>\n\n===Medium===\nLeonardo, as a painter, favoured [[oil painting]], a medium which allows the artist to work slowly and make changes with ease. [[Fresco]] painting does not facilitate either of these things. Leonardo also sought a greater luminosity and intensity of light and shade ([[chiaroscuro]]) than could be achieved with fresco.<ref name=smart>{{cite web |url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/leonardo-last-supper.html |title=Leonardo's Last Supper |website=Smart history presented by the Khan Academy |accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> Instead of painting with water-soluble paints onto wet [[plaster]], laid freshly each day in sections, Leonardo painted ''The Last Supper'' on a wall sealed with a double layer of [[gesso]], pitch, and mastic.{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=83}} Then, borrowing from [[panel painting]], he added an undercoat of [[white lead]] to enhance the brightness of the oil and tempera that was applied on top. This was a method that had been described previously, by [[Cennino Cennini]] in the 14th century. However, Cennini described the technique as being more risky than fresco painting, and recommended the use of \"a secco\" painting (on dry plaster) for the final touches alone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hellomilano.it/hm/sights/the-last-supper/ |title=The Last Supper |website=The Last Supper |accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> \n\n===Subject=== \n<imagemap>\nImage:The Last Supper - Leonardo Da Vinci - High Resolution 32x16.jpg|thumb|700px|alt=''The Last Supper'' by Leonardo da Vinci - Clickable Image|''The Last Supper'' by Leonardo da Vinci. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\n\npoly 550 2550 750 2400 1150 2300 1150 2150 1200 2075 1500 2125 1525 2300 1350 2800 1450 3000 1700 3300 1300 3475 650 3500 550 3300 450 3000 [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] \npoly 1575 2300 1625 2150 1900 2150 1925 2500 1875 2600 1800 2750 1600 3250 1425 3100 1400 2800 1375 2600 [[James, son of Alphaeus|James Minor]]\npoly 1960 2150 2200 2150 2350 2500 2450 2575 2375 2725 2375 2900 2225 3100 2225 3225 1600 3225 1825 2700 1975 2450 1925 2300 [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\npoly 2450 2575 2775 2500 2700 2650 2800 2700 2600 3000 2600 3250 2300 3250 2200 3200 2300 3000 [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\npoly 2750 2500 2950 2400 3125 2600 3175 2700 3300 2850 3700 3200 3750 3200 3650 3350 3400 3200 3000 3350 2600 3325 2750 2800 2900 2700 2700 2650 [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]\npoly 3000 2350 3300 2350 3350 2660 3560 2600 3565 2690 3250 2800 3125 2575 [[Saint Peter|Peter]]                                     \npoly 3332 2338 3528 2240 4284 3024 4074 3332 3864 3290 3780 3150 3668 3192 3598 3024 3374 2870 3388 2772 3542 2800 3668 2702 3542 2590 3430 2604 3350 2600 3300 2500[[John the Apostle|John]]\npoly 4775 2184 4915 2128 5055 2212 5083 2352 5111 2464 5181 2604 5307 2744 5573 3052 5615 3192 5657 3290 5573 3402 5461 3332 5335 3248 4495 3248 4439 3388 4243 3388 4075 3360 4173 3136 4327 3010 4509 2730 4663 2520 4733 2394 [[Jesus]]\npoly 5900 2100 5900 2150 5800 2400 5800 2500 5675 2589 5480 2671 5438 2507 5425 2301 5589 2452 5630 2301 5650 2100 [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\npoly 5918 2150 6041 2109 6137 2246 6192 2411 6110 2589 6110 2726 6192 2822 6302 2740 6589 3109 5658 3178 5575 2918 5300 2698 5233 2589 5274 2438 5370 2507 5521 2685 5617 2671 5712 2575 5822 2507 5808 2287 5822 2175 [[James, son of Zebedee|James Greater]]\npoly 6137 2013 6439 2013 6863 2260 7110 2515 6726 2675 6507 2548 6425 2630 6356 2753 6548 2849 6699 2781 7082 2794 7178 3109 6699 3178 6548 2986 6397 2835 6165 2775 6110 2589 6233 2438 6302 2383 6151 2287 6096 2164 [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\npoly 7635 2123 7800 2013 8000 2055 8025 2287 7950 2438 8000 2698 8055 2918 7959 3164 7233 3164 7124 2972 7124 2794 6548 2794 6384 2781 6384 2671 6493 2575 6750 2650 7075 2550 7219 2400 7625 2300 [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]]\npoly 8325 2096 8600 2109 8635 2493 8615 2726 8439 2781 8274 2740 8125 2835 8151 2931 8400 2975 8411 3068 8589 3041 8617 3205 7987 3260 8124 3027 7987 2644 7904 2493 7959 2425 8096 2356 [[Judas Thaddaeus|Jude]]\npoly 8800 2150 8900 2125 9055 2150 9125 2397 9400 2475 9550 2931 9625 3301 9151 3397 8535 3219 8726 3014 8466 3068 8411 2918 8178 2931 8124 2835 8329 2753 8535 2794 8726 2603 8725 2342 [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]]\n</imagemap>\n''The Last Supper'' portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him.

Judas is wearing red, blue, and green and is in shadow, looking withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role as a treasurer.<ref name=\"Gospel\">Cfr. {{bibleref2|Matthew|26:15|NKJV}} and {{bibleref2|John|12:6;13:29|NKJV}}.</ref> He is also tipping over the salt cellar, which may be related to the near-Eastern expression to \"betray the salt\" meaning to betray one's master. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table and his head is also vertically the lowest of anyone in the painting. Peter wears an expression of anger and appears to be holding a knife, foreshadowing his violent reaction in [[Gethsemane]] during the [[arrest of Jesus]]. Peter is leaning towards John and touching him on the shoulder, in reference to John's Gospel where he signals the \"beloved disciple\" to ask Jesus who is to betray him.{{efn|{{bibleref2|John|11:23-24}}}} The youngest apostle, John, appears to swoon and lean towards Peter. \n* [[Jesus]]\n* [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[James the Greater]], and [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] are the next group of three. Thomas is clearly upset; the raised index finger foreshadows his [[Doubting Thomas|incredulity]] of the Resurrection. James the Greater looks stunned, with his arms in the air. Meanwhile, Philip appears to be requesting some explanation.\n* [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude Thaddeus]], and [[Simon the Zealot]] are the final group of three. Both Thaddeus and Matthew are turned toward Simon, perhaps to find out if he has any answer to their initial questions.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal \n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = Leonardo, testa di cristo, 1494 circa, pinacoteca di brera.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = <center> A study of the [[Head of Christ (Leonardo)|head of Christ]] by Leonardo \n | image2    = Leonardo da vinci, Study for the Last Supper 2.jpg \n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = <center>Silverpoint study of an apostle, most likely [[Saint Peter]]{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=86}}\n }}\n\nIn common with other depictions of the Last Supper from this period, Leonardo seats the diners on one side of the table, so that none of them has his back to the viewer. Most previous depictions excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus, or placing halos around all the disciples except Judas.\nLeonardo instead has Judas lean back into shadow. Jesus is predicting that his betrayer will take the bread at the same time he does to Saints Thomas and James the Greater to his left, who react in horror as Jesus points with his left hand to a piece of bread before them. Distracted by the conversation between John and Peter, Judas reaches for a different piece of bread not noticing Jesus too stretching out with his right hand towards it (Matthew 26: 23). The angles and lighting draw attention to Jesus, whose turned right cheek is located at the [[vanishing point]] for all perspective lines.<ref name=\"DLDV\">White, Susan D. (2006).

The convent's prior complained to Sforza of Leonardo's \"laziness\" as he wandered the streets to find a criminal to base Judas on. Leonardo responded that if he could find no one else, the prior would make a suitable model.{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=81}}\nWhile the painting was being executed, Leonardo's friend, the mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]], called it \"a symbol of man's burning desire for salvation\".{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=82}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Important copies===\nTwo early copies of ''The Last Supper'' are known to exist, presumed to be work by Leonardo's assistants.

It is believed, through early copies, that Jesus' feet were in a position symbolizing the forthcoming crucifixion. In 1768, a curtain was hung over the painting for the purpose of protection; it instead trapped moisture on the surface, and whenever the curtain was pulled back, it scratched the flaking paint.\n\nA first restoration was attempted in 1726 by [[Michelangelo Bellotti]], who filled in missing sections with [[oil paint]] then [[varnish]]ed the whole mural. This repair did not last well and another restoration was attempted in 1770 by an otherwise unknown artist named Giuseppe Mazza. Mazza stripped off Bellotti's work then largely repainted the painting; he had redone all but three faces when he was halted due to public outrage. In 1796, French revolutionary anti-clerical troops used the refectory as an [[armory (military)|armory]] and [[stable]];<ref name=notebook>{{cite book |last=Da Vinci|first=Leonardo |editor-last=Taylor |editor-first=Pamela |title=The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=New American Library|year=1971|p=xvii}}</ref> they threw stones at the painting and climbed ladders to scratch out the Apostles' eyes. [[Goethe]] wrote that in 1800, the room was flooded with two feet of water after a heavy rainstorm.{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=83}} The refectory was used as a prison;{{when|date=October 2019}} it is not known if any of the prisoners may have damaged the painting. In 1821, Stefano Barezzi, an expert in removing whole frescoes from their walls intact, was called in to remove the painting to a safer location; he badly damaged the center section before realizing that Leonardo's work was not a fresco. Barezzi then attempted to reattach damaged sections with [[adhesive|glue]]. From 1901 to 1908, [[Luigi Cavenaghi]] first completed a careful study of the structure of the painting, then began cleaning it. In 1924, [[Oreste Silvestri]] did further cleaning, and stabilised some parts with [[stucco]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], on 15 August 1943, the refectory was struck by Allied bombing; protective [[sandbag]]ging prevented the painting from being struck by bomb splinters,<ref>{{cite web |last=Traverso |first=V.

From 1978 to 1999, Pinin Brambilla Barcilon guided a major restoration project which undertook to stabilize the painting, and reverse the damage caused by dirt and pollution.  The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century restoration attempts were also reversed.  Since it had proved impractical to move the painting to a more controlled environment, the refectory was instead converted to a sealed, [[HVAC|climate-controlled]] environment, which meant bricking up the windows.  Then, detailed study was undertaken to determine the painting's original form, using scientific tests (especially [[infrared]] reflectoscopy and microscopic core-samples), and original [[cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]]s preserved in the Royal Library at [[Windsor Castle]].  Some areas were deemed unrestorable.  These were {{nowrap|re-painted}} using [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] in subdued colors intended to indicate they were not original work, while not being too distracting.\n\nThis restoration took 21 years and, on 28 May 1999, the painting was returned to display.  Intending visitors were required to book ahead and could only stay for 15 minutes.  When it was unveiled, considerable controversy was aroused by the dramatic changes in colors, tones, and even some facial shapes.

The painting represents the scene of the [[Last Supper]] of [[Jesus]] with his apostles, as it is told in the [[Gospel of John]], 13:21.<ref>{{cite web|last1=The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci \u2013|title=Santa Maria delle Grazie \u2013 Milan|url=https://www.inexhibit.com/mymuseum/last-supper-leonardo-da-vinci-santa-maria-delle-grazie-milan/|website=Inexhibit|accessdate=10 November 2017}}</ref> Leonardo has depicted the consternation that occurred among the [[Apostle (Christian)|Twelve Apostles]] when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.\n\nDue to the methods used, a variety of environmental factors, and intentional damage, little of the original painting remains today despite numerous restoration attempts, the last being completed in 1999.\n\n==Painting== \n===Commission and creation===\n''The Last Supper'' measures {{convert|460|\u00d7|880|cm|abbr=on}} and covers an end wall of the dining hall at the monastery of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] in Milan, Italy. The theme was a traditional one for [[refectory|refectories]], although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it. The main church building had only recently been completed (in 1498). Leonardo's patron, [[Ludovico Sforza]]  planned that the church should be remodeled as a family mausoleum, and to this end, changes were made, perhaps to plans by [[Bramante]]. The entire plan was not carried out. and a smaller mortuary chapel was constructed, adjacent to the cloister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/milan/attractions/venue/1:7329/santa-maria-delle-grazie-the-last-supper |title=Santa Maria delle Grazie & The Last Supper |publisher=Timeout.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329015213/http://www.timeout.com/milan/attractions/venue/1:7329/santa-maria-delle-grazie-the-last-supper|archivedate=29 March 2013|accessdate=30 June 2019}}</ref>\nThe painting was commissioned by Sforza to decorate the wall of the mausoleum. The [[lunette]]s above the main painting, formed by the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] [[Coat of arms|coats-of-arms]]. The opposite wall of the refectory is covered by the [[Crucifixion]] fresco by [[Giovanni Donato da Montorfano]], to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in [[tempera]]; these figures have deteriorated in much the same way as has ''The Last Supper''.<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Ross |title=Leonardo and the Last Supper |date=2012 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=New York |isbn=9781620403082 |page=271}}</ref>  \n\nLeonardo worked on ''The Last Supper'' from about 1495 to 1498, but did not work it continuously. The beginning date is not certain, as the archives of the convent for the period have been destroyed. A document dated 1497 indicates that the painting was nearly completed at that date.<ref>Kenneth Clark.

He wrote to the head of the monastery, explaining he had been struggling to find the perfect villainous face for Judas, and that if he could not find a face corresponding with what he had in mind, he would use the features of the prior who had complained.<ref name=\"lair\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/leonardo/supper.html |title=The Last Supper |publisher=lairweb.org.nz |accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"steel\">{{cite episode |title=DaVinci |series=The Mark Steel Lectures |network=[[BBC]] |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/body-mind/ou-on-the-bbc-mark-steel-lectures-da-vinci-the-lecture |publisher=The Open University |airdate=7 October 2003 |seriesno=2 |number=2 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref> \n\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"200px\"> \nFile:\"The Last Supper\" by Leonardo da Vinci - Joy of Museums.jpg|The painting as it appears on the refectory wall\nFile:Montorfano, crocifissione, 1497, con interventi di leonardo nei ritratti dei duchi.jpg|Crucifixion, opposite Leonardo's ''Last Supper''\n</gallery>\n\n===Medium===\nLeonardo, as a painter, favoured [[oil painting]], a medium which allows the artist to work slowly and make changes with ease. [[Fresco]] painting does not facilitate either of these things. Leonardo also sought a greater luminosity and intensity of light and shade ([[chiaroscuro]]) than could be achieved with fresco.<ref name=smart>{{cite web |url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/leonardo-last-supper.html |title=Leonardo's Last Supper |website=Smart history presented by the Khan Academy |accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> Instead of painting with water-soluble paints onto wet [[plaster]], laid freshly each day in sections, Leonardo painted ''The Last Supper'' on a wall sealed with a double layer of [[gesso]], pitch, and mastic.{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=83}} Then, borrowing from [[panel painting]], he added an undercoat of [[white lead]] to enhance the brightness of the oil and tempera that was applied on top. This was a method that had been described previously, by [[Cennino Cennini]] in the 14th century. However, Cennini described the technique as being more risky than fresco painting, and recommended the use of \"a secco\" painting (on dry plaster) for the final touches alone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hellomilano.it/hm/sights/the-last-supper/ |title=The Last Supper |website=The Last Supper |accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> \n\n===Subject=== \n<imagemap>\nImage:The Last Supper - Leonardo Da Vinci - High Resolution 32x16.jpg|thumb|700px|alt=''The Last Supper'' by Leonardo da Vinci - Clickable Image|''The Last Supper'' by Leonardo da Vinci. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\n\npoly 550 2550 750 2400 1150 2300 1150 2150 1200 2075 1500 2125 1525 2300 1350 2800 1450 3000 1700 3300 1300 3475 650 3500 550 3300 450 3000 [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] \npoly 1575 2300 1625 2150 1900 2150 1925 2500 1875 2600 1800 2750 1600 3250 1425 3100 1400 2800 1375 2600 [[James, son of Alphaeus|James Minor]]\npoly 1960 2150 2200 2150 2350 2500 2450 2575 2375 2725 2375 2900 2225 3100 2225 3225 1600 3225 1825 2700 1975 2450 1925 2300 [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\npoly 2450 2575 2775 2500 2700 2650 2800 2700 2600 3000 2600 3250 2300 3250 2200 3200 2300 3000 [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\npoly 2750 2500 2950 2400 3125 2600 3175 2700 3300 2850 3700 3200 3750 3200 3650 3350 3400 3200 3000 3350 2600 3325 2750 2800 2900 2700 2700 2650 [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]\npoly 3000 2350 3300 2350 3350 2660 3560 2600 3565 2690 3250 2800 3125 2575 [[Saint Peter|Peter]]                                     \npoly 3332 2338 3528 2240 4284 3024 4074 3332 3864 3290 3780 3150 3668 3192 3598 3024 3374 2870 3388 2772 3542 2800 3668 2702 3542 2590 3430 2604 3350 2600 3300 2500[[John the Apostle|John]]\npoly 4775 2184 4915 2128 5055 2212 5083 2352 5111 2464 5181 2604 5307 2744 5573 3052 5615 3192 5657 3290 5573 3402 5461 3332 5335 3248 4495 3248 4439 3388 4243 3388 4075 3360 4173 3136 4327 3010 4509 2730 4663 2520 4733 2394 [[Jesus]]\npoly 5900 2100 5900 2150 5800 2400 5800 2500 5675 2589 5480 2671 5438 2507 5425 2301 5589 2452 5630 2301 5650 2100 [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\npoly 5918 2150 6041 2109 6137 2246 6192 2411 6110 2589 6110 2726 6192 2822 6302 2740 6589 3109 5658 3178 5575 2918 5300 2698 5233 2589 5274 2438 5370 2507 5521 2685 5617 2671 5712 2575 5822 2507 5808 2287 5822 2175 [[James, son of Zebedee|James Greater]]\npoly 6137 2013 6439 2013 6863 2260 7110 2515 6726 2675 6507 2548 6425 2630 6356 2753 6548 2849 6699 2781 7082 2794 7178 3109 6699 3178 6548 2986 6397 2835 6165 2775 6110 2589 6233 2438 6302 2383 6151 2287 6096 2164 [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\npoly 7635 2123 7800 2013 8000 2055 8025 2287 7950 2438 8000 2698 8055 2918 7959 3164 7233 3164 7124 2972 7124 2794 6548 2794 6384 2781 6384 2671 6493 2575 6750 2650 7075 2550 7219 2400 7625 2300 [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]]\npoly 8325 2096 8600 2109 8635 2493 8615 2726 8439 2781 8274 2740 8125 2835 8151 2931 8400 2975 8411 3068 8589 3041 8617 3205 7987 3260 8124 3027 7987 2644 7904 2493 7959 2425 8096 2356 [[Judas Thaddaeus|Jude]]\npoly 8800 2150 8900 2125 9055 2150 9125 2397 9400 2475 9550 2931 9625 3301 9151 3397 8535 3219 8726 3014 8466 3068 8411 2918 8178 2931 8124 2835 8329 2753 8535 2794 8726 2603 8725 2342 [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]]\n</imagemap>\n''The Last Supper'' portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him.

(Before this, only Judas, Peter, John and Jesus had been positively identified.) From left to right, according to the apostles' heads:\n\n* [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]], [[James, son of Alphaeus]], and [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] form a group of three; all are surprised.\n* [[Judas Iscariot]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] form another group of three. Judas is wearing red, blue, and green and is in shadow, looking withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role as a treasurer.<ref name=\"Gospel\">Cfr. {{bibleref2|Matthew|26:15|NKJV}} and {{bibleref2|John|12:6;13:29|NKJV}}.</ref> He is also tipping over the salt cellar, which may be related to the near-Eastern expression to \"betray the salt\" meaning to betray one's master. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table and his head is also vertically the lowest of anyone in the painting. Peter wears an expression of anger and appears to be holding a knife, foreshadowing his violent reaction in [[Gethsemane]] during the [[arrest of Jesus]]. Peter is leaning towards John and touching him on the shoulder, in reference to John's Gospel where he signals the \"beloved disciple\" to ask Jesus who is to betray him.{{efn|{{bibleref2|John|11:23-24}}}} The youngest apostle, John, appears to swoon and lean towards Peter. \n* [[Jesus]]\n* [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[James the Greater]], and [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] are the next group of three. Thomas is clearly upset; the raised index finger foreshadows his [[Doubting Thomas|incredulity]] of the Resurrection. James the Greater looks stunned, with his arms in the air. Meanwhile, Philip appears to be requesting some explanation.\n* [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude Thaddeus]], and [[Simon the Zealot]] are the final group of three. Both Thaddeus and Matthew are turned toward Simon, perhaps to find out if he has any answer to their initial questions.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal \n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = Leonardo, testa di cristo, 1494 circa, pinacoteca di brera.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = <center> A study of the [[Head of Christ (Leonardo)|head of Christ]] by Leonardo \n | image2    = Leonardo da vinci, Study for the Last Supper 2.jpg \n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = <center>Silverpoint study of an apostle, most likely [[Saint Peter]]{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=86}}\n }}\n\nIn common with other depictions of the Last Supper from this period, Leonardo seats the diners on one side of the table, so that none of them has his back to the viewer. Most previous depictions excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus, or placing halos around all the disciples except Judas.\nLeonardo instead has Judas lean back into shadow. Jesus is predicting that his betrayer will take the bread at the same time he does to Saints Thomas and James the Greater to his left, who react in horror as Jesus points with his left hand to a piece of bread before them. Distracted by the conversation between John and Peter, Judas reaches for a different piece of bread not noticing Jesus too stretching out with his right hand towards it (Matthew 26: 23). The angles and lighting draw attention to Jesus, whose turned right cheek is located at the [[vanishing point]] for all perspective lines.<ref name=\"DLDV\">White, Susan D. (2006).

The convent's prior complained to Sforza of Leonardo's \"laziness\" as he wandered the streets to find a criminal to base Judas on. Leonardo responded that if he could find no one else, the prior would make a suitable model.{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=81}}\nWhile the painting was being executed, Leonardo's friend, the mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]], called it \"a symbol of man's burning desire for salvation\".{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=82}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Important copies===\nTwo early copies of ''The Last Supper'' are known to exist, presumed to be work by Leonardo's assistants.

It is believed, through early copies, that Jesus' feet were in a position symbolizing the forthcoming crucifixion. In 1768, a curtain was hung over the painting for the purpose of protection; it instead trapped moisture on the surface, and whenever the curtain was pulled back, it scratched the flaking paint.\n\nA first restoration was attempted in 1726 by [[Michelangelo Bellotti]], who filled in missing sections with [[oil paint]] then [[varnish]]ed the whole mural. This repair did not last well and another restoration was attempted in 1770 by an otherwise unknown artist named Giuseppe Mazza. Mazza stripped off Bellotti's work then largely repainted the painting; he had redone all but three faces when he was halted due to public outrage. In 1796, French revolutionary anti-clerical troops used the refectory as an [[armory (military)|armory]] and [[stable]];<ref name=notebook>{{cite book |last=Da Vinci|first=Leonardo |editor-last=Taylor |editor-first=Pamela |title=The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=New American Library|year=1971|p=xvii}}</ref> they threw stones at the painting and climbed ladders to scratch out the Apostles' eyes. [[Goethe]] wrote that in 1800, the room was flooded with two feet of water after a heavy rainstorm.{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=83}} The refectory was used as a prison;{{when|date=October 2019}} it is not known if any of the prisoners may have damaged the painting. In 1821, Stefano Barezzi, an expert in removing whole frescoes from their walls intact, was called in to remove the painting to a safer location; he badly damaged the center section before realizing that Leonardo's work was not a fresco. Barezzi then attempted to reattach damaged sections with [[adhesive|glue]]. From 1901 to 1908, [[Luigi Cavenaghi]] first completed a careful study of the structure of the painting, then began cleaning it. In 1924, [[Oreste Silvestri]] did further cleaning, and stabilised some parts with [[stucco]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], on 15 August 1943, the refectory was struck by Allied bombing; protective [[sandbag]]ging prevented the painting from being struck by bomb splinters,<ref>{{cite web |last=Traverso |first=V.

From 1978 to 1999, Pinin Brambilla Barcilon guided a major restoration project which undertook to stabilize the painting, and reverse the damage caused by dirt and pollution.  The eighteenth- and nineteenth-century restoration attempts were also reversed.  Since it had proved impractical to move the painting to a more controlled environment, the refectory was instead converted to a sealed, [[HVAC|climate-controlled]] environment, which meant bricking up the windows.  Then, detailed study was undertaken to determine the painting's original form, using scientific tests (especially [[infrared]] reflectoscopy and microscopic core-samples), and original [[cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]]s preserved in the Royal Library at [[Windsor Castle]].  Some areas were deemed unrestorable.  These were {{nowrap|re-painted}} using [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] in subdued colors intended to indicate they were not original work, while not being too distracting.\n\nThis restoration took 21 years and, on 28 May 1999, the painting was returned to display.  Intending visitors were required to book ahead and could only stay for 15 minutes.  When it was unveiled, considerable controversy was aroused by the dramatic changes in colors, tones, and even some facial shapes.

The various doctors, all in surgical scrubs, pose in imitation of the painting.

No limit upon the permitted number of refugees was ever publicly announced. Initially, the Jewish refugee agencies considered 5,000 as a realistic target goal. However, after the [[British Colonial Office]] turned down the Jewish agencies' separate request to allow the admission of 10,000 children to British-controlled [[Mandate Palestine|Palestine]], the Jewish agencies then increased their planned target number to 15,000 unaccompanied children to enter Great Britain in this way.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:1939 issued Identity Document for travelling to the UK, used by a child on the Kindertransport.jpg|thumb|1939 issued Identity Document for travelling to the UK, used by a child on the Kindertransport]]\n\nOn the eve of a major [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on refugees on 21 November 1938, [[Home Secretary]] [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] met a large delegation representing Jewish, as well as Quaker and other non-Jewish groups, working on behalf of refugees.

This ship was the very last to leave the country freely.\n\nAs the Netherlands was under attack by German forces totalling 750,000 men from May 10, and bombings had been going on, there was no opportunity to confer with the parents of the children. At the time of this evacuation, these parents knew nothing of the evacuation of their children: according to unnamed sources, some of the parents were initially even very upset about this action and told Wijsmuller-Meijer she should not have done this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} After May 15, there was no more opportunity to leave the Netherlands, as the country's borders were closed by the Nazis.\n\n==Trauma suffered by the children==\n\nThe children went through extreme trauma during their extensive Kindertransport experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holocaust.org.uk/kindertransport|title=Kindertransport|website=The National Holocaust Centre and Museum|language=en|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> This is often presented in very personal terms. The exact details of this trauma, and how it was felt by the child, depended both on the child's age at separation, and on the details of his or her total experience until the end of the war, and even after that.\n\nThe primary trauma was the actual parting from the parents, bearing in mind the child's age. How this parting was explained was very important: for example, \"you are going on an exciting adventure\", or \"you are going on a short trip and we will see you soon.\"  Younger children, perhaps six and younger, would generally not accept such an explanation and would demand to stay with their parents. There are many records of tears and screaming at the various railway stations where the actual parting took place. Even for older children, \"more willing to accept the parents' explanation\", at some point that child realised that he or she would be separated from his or her parents for a long and indefinite time. The younger children had no developed sense of time, and for them the trauma of separation was total from the very beginning.\n\nHaving to learn a new language, in a country where the child's native German or Czech was not understood, was another cause of stress. To have to learn to live with strangers, who only spoke English, and accept them as \"pseudo-parents\", was a trauma. At school, the English children would often view the Kinder as \"enemy Germans\" instead of as \"Jewish refugees\".\n\nBefore the war started on September 1, 1939, and even during the first part of the war, some parents were able to escape from Hitler and reach England and then reunite with their children. But this was the exception; most of the parents were murdered by the Nazis.\n \nThe older ones became fully aware of the war in Europe during 1939-1945 and its details, and they would understand and become concerned for their parents. During the later part of the war, they may have become aware of the [[Holocaust]] and the actual direct threat to their Jewish parents and extended family. After the war ended in 1945, nearly all the children learned sooner or later that their parents had been murdered.<ref>[[Dawidowicz, Lucy|Lucy Dawidowicz]] (1986), ''The War Against the Jews.''

He warned the British government, through Lord Samuel, of the impending Kristallnacht in November 1938. Through a British agent, [[Frank Foley]], passport officer at the Berlin consulate, he kept British intelligence informed of Nazi activities. Speaking on behalf of the ''{{lang|de|Reichsvertretung}}'' (the German Jewish communal organisation) and the ''{{lang|de|Hilfsverein}}'' (the self-help body), he urged a plan of rescue on the Foreign Office and helped British [[Quaker]]s to visit Jewish communities all over Germany to prove to the British government that Jewish parents were indeed prepared to part with their children.<ref>Naomi Shepherd: ''A Refuge from Darkness'' Pantheon books, New York, 1984.

He housed many of them in his London home for a while. During the Blitz he found for them in the countryside often non-Jewish foster homes. In order to assure the children follow Jewish dietary laws (Kosher) he instructed them to say to the foster parents that they are fish eating vegetarians. He also saved large numbers of Jews with South American protection papers. He brought over to England several thousand young people, rabbis, teachers, ritual slaughterers and other religious functionaries.<ref>See the entry [[Solomon Schonfeld]], and the book ''Holocaust Hero: Solomon Schonfeld'', by Dr. Kranzler (Ktav Publishing House, New Jersey, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Internment and war service==\nIn 1940, the British government ordered the internment of all male 16- to 70-year-old refugees from enemy countries&nbsp;\u2013 so-called ''friendly [[enemy aliens]]''. Many of the children who had arrived in earlier years were now young men, and so they were also interned. Approximately 1,000 of these ''prior-kinder'' were interned in these makeshift [[List of concentration and internment camps|internment camps]], many on the [[Isle of Man]]. Around 400 were transported overseas to Canada and Australia (see [[HMT Dunera|HMT ''Dunera'']]).\n\nAs the camp internees reached the age of 18, they were offered the chance to do war work or to enter the Army Auxiliary [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]]. About 1,000 German and Austrian ''prior-kinder'' who reached adulthood went on to serve in the British armed forces, including in combat units. Several dozen joined elite formations such as the [[Special forces#Britain|Special Forces]], where their language skills were put to good use during the [[D-Day Invasion]] and afterwards as the Allies progressed into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].\n\nThe British internment period for ''friendly enemy aliens'' generally lasted only a few months, until they were processed by the government and released.\n\n==\"American Kindertransport\"==\n{{main|One Thousand Children}}\nThe One Thousand Children (OTC) was a similar but much less organised effort to transport unaccompanied children, mostly Jewish, to the United States. The programme brought about 1,400 children aged between 14 months and 16 years to the United States between November 1934 and May 1945. Like the ''kinder'', these OTC children were forced to leave their parents behind in Europe; many of them were later murdered by the Nazis.\n\nIn contrast to the Kindertransport, where the British Government waived immigration visa requirements, these OTC children received no United States Government visa immigration assistance. Furthermore, it is documented that the State Department deliberately made it very difficult for any Jewish refugee to get an entrance visa.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941\u20131945]] |last= Wyman |first= David S. | authorlink= David Wyman |edition= |origyear= |year= 1984 |publisher= [[Pantheon Books]] |location= New York |isbn= 0-394-42813-7 |pages= 124\u2013142 }}</ref> And it was even harder to secure the appropriate papers for their parents, hence most had to remain in Europe.\n\nIn 1939 Sen.

The train, consisting of an original locomotive and carriages used in the 1930s, headed to London via the original ''Kindertransport'' route. On board the train were several surviving ''Winton children'' and their descendants, who were to be welcomed by the now hundred-year-old Sir [[Nicholas Winton]] in London. The occasion marked the 70th anniversary of the intended last Kindertransport, which was due to set off on 3 September 1939 but did not because of the outbreak of the Second World War. At the train's departure, Sir Nicholas Winton's statue was unveiled at the railway station.<ref>{{cite web|last=\u010cTK |title=Train in honour of Jewish children rescuer Winton leaves Prague |url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/train-in-honour-of-jewish-children-rescuer-winton-leaves-prague/395346 |date=1 September 2009 |work=\u010cesk\u00e9 noviny |publisher=Neris s.r.o. |accessdate=1 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904103942/http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/train-in-honour-of-jewish-children-rescuer-winton-leaves-prague/395346 |archivedate=4 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Academic debate ==\nJessica Reinisch notes how the British media and politicians alike allude to the Kindertransport in contemporary debates on refugee and migration crises. She argues that \"the Kindertransport\" is used as evidence of Britain's \"proud tradition\" of taking in refugees; but that such allusions are problematic as the Kinderstransport model is taken out of context and thus subject to [[nostalgia]]. She points out that countries such as Britain and the United States did much to prevent immigration by turning desperate people away; at the [[\u00c9vian Conference]] in 1938, participant nations failed to reach agreement about accepting Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-matters-but-which-one-every-refugee-crisis-has-a-context|title=History matters\u2026 but which one?

'''''Kindertransport''''' (German for \"children's transport\") was an organised rescue effort that took place during the nine months prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. The [[United Kingdom]] took in nearly 10,000 predominantly [[Jewish]] children from [[Nazi Germany]], Nazi-occupied [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]], [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and the [[Free City of Danzig]]. The children were placed in British [[foster homes]], [[hostels]], schools and farms. Often they were the only members of their families who survived [[the Holocaust]]. The programme was supported, publicised and encouraged by the British government. Importantly the British government waived all those visa immigration requirements which were not within the ability of the British Jewish community to fulfil.<ref name=KinderJuly2009>{{cite web |url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/kindertransport.htm |title=Kindertransport |date=July 2009 |publisher=History Learning Site |accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=NHC1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holocaust.org.uk/kindertransport-overview|title=Kindertransport; Organising and Rescue|website=The National Holocaust Centre and Museum|language=en|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> The British government put no number limit on the programme \u2013 it was the start of World War II that brought the programme to an end, at which time about 10,000 kindertransport children had been brought to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe term \"kindertransport\" is also sometimes used for the rescue of mainly Jewish children, but without their parents, from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An example is the 1,000 [[Chateau de La Hille]] children who went to Belgium.<ref name=NHC1/><ref name=\"NYT1938\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/12/06/archives/600-child-refugees-taken-from-vienna-100-jewish-youngsters-going-to.html|title=600 Child Refugees Taken From Vienna; 100 Jewish Youngsters Going to Netherlands, 500 to England|last=|first=|date=6 December 1938|work=The New York Times|access-date=29 March 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> However, often, the \"kindertransport\" is used to refer to the organised programme to the United Kingdom.\n\n[[World Jewish Relief]] (then called the Central British Fund for German Jewry) was established in 1933 to support in whatever way possible the needs of Jews both in Germany and Austria. Records for many of the children who arrived in the UK through the ''Kindertransports'' are maintained by World Jewish Relief.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe British Kindertransport programme was unique \u2013 no other country had a similar programme. In the United States, the [[Wagner\u2013Rogers Bill]] was introduced in Congress, but due to much opposition, it never left committee.\n\n==Policy==\n[[File:1939 visa issued to a Jewish woman who was accompanying a Kindertransport from Danzig to the UK.jpg|thumb|left|1939 visa issued to a Jewish woman who was accompanying a Kindertransport from Danzig to the UK.]]\nOn 15 November 1938, five days after the devastation of \"[[Kristallnacht]]\", the \"Night of Broken Glass\", in Germany and Austria, a delegation of British, Jewish, and Quaker leaders appealed, in person, to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Among other measures, they requested that the British government permit the temporary admission of unaccompanied Jewish children, without their parents.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]] debated the issue the next day and subsequently prepared a bill to present to the United Kingdom's Parliament. That bill stated that the government would waive certain immigration requirements so as to allow the entry into Great Britain of unaccompanied children ranging from infants up to the age of 17, under conditions as outlined in the next paragraph. No limit upon the permitted number of refugees was ever publicly announced. Initially, the Jewish refugee agencies considered 5,000 as a realistic target goal. However, after the [[British Colonial Office]] turned down the Jewish agencies' separate request to allow the admission of 10,000 children to British-controlled [[Mandate Palestine|Palestine]], the Jewish agencies then increased their planned target number to 15,000 unaccompanied children to enter Great Britain in this way.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:1939 issued Identity Document for travelling to the UK, used by a child on the Kindertransport.jpg|thumb|1939 issued Identity Document for travelling to the UK, used by a child on the Kindertransport]]\n\nOn the eve of a major [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on refugees on 21 November 1938, [[Home Secretary]] [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] met a large delegation representing Jewish, as well as Quaker and other non-Jewish groups, working on behalf of refugees.

Hoare declared that he (and the Home Office) would have no objection to speeding up the immigration process: for instance for travel documents to be issued on the basis of group lists rather than individual applications.<ref name=\"hansard1\"/>\n\nThe agencies promised to find homes for all the children. They also promised to fund the operation and to ensure that none of the refugees would become a financial burden on the public. Every child would have a guarantee of \u00a350 sterling to finance his or her eventual re-emigration, as it was expected the children would stay in the country only temporarily.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Baruch Tenenbaum]] |title=Nicholas Winton, British savior |url=http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/saviors/others/nicholas-winton-british-savior.5011016.htm |publisher=The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation and management==\n[[Image:F\u00fcrdaskindvienna.JPG|thumb|right|''F\u00fcr Das Kind''<br/>[[Wien Westbahnhof|Vienna, Westbahnhof Station]] 2008, a tribute to the British people for saving the lives of thousands of children from Nazi terror through the Kindertransports.]]\n[[File:Czech Jewish children evacuated via airplane (1939).webm|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Jewish children leave Prague for Britain by flight organised by the [[Barbican Mission to the Jews]], 11 January 1939<ref name=videoflightprague>{{Cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn1000675|title=Kindertransport, Jewish children leave Prague \u2013 Collections Search \u2013 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=collections.ushmm.org|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref>]]\n\nWithin a very short time, the Movement for the Care of Children from Germany, later known as the Refugee Children's Movement (RCM), sent representatives to Germany and Austria to establish the systems for choosing, organising, and transporting the children.

Soon there were 500 offers, and RCM volunteers started visiting possible foster homes and reporting on conditions. They did not insist that the homes for Jewish children should be Jewish homes. Nor did they probe too carefully into the motives and character of the families: it was sufficient for the houses to look clean and the families to seem respectable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/holocaust/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_holocausts/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_the_nazi_holocaust/kindertrasport.htm|title=Kindertransport|website=Holocaust Website|publisher=East Renfrewshire Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021030926/http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/holocaust/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_holocausts/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_the_nazi_holocaust/kindertrasport.htm|archivedate=21 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn Germany, a network of organisers was established, and these volunteers worked around the clock to make priority lists of those most in peril: teenagers who were in concentration camps or in danger of arrest, Polish children or teenagers threatened with deportation, children in Jewish orphanages, children whose parents were too impoverished to keep them, or children with a parent in a concentration camp. Once the children were identified or grouped by list, their guardians or parents were issued a travel date and departure details.

This ship was the very last to leave the country freely.\n\nAs the Netherlands was under attack by German forces totalling 750,000 men from May 10, and bombings had been going on, there was no opportunity to confer with the parents of the children. At the time of this evacuation, these parents knew nothing of the evacuation of their children: according to unnamed sources, some of the parents were initially even very upset about this action and told Wijsmuller-Meijer she should not have done this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} After May 15, there was no more opportunity to leave the Netherlands, as the country's borders were closed by the Nazis.\n\n==Trauma suffered by the children==\n\nThe children went through extreme trauma during their extensive Kindertransport experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holocaust.org.uk/kindertransport|title=Kindertransport|website=The National Holocaust Centre and Museum|language=en|access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> This is often presented in very personal terms. The exact details of this trauma, and how it was felt by the child, depended both on the child's age at separation, and on the details of his or her total experience until the end of the war, and even after that.\n\nThe primary trauma was the actual parting from the parents, bearing in mind the child's age. How this parting was explained was very important: for example, \"you are going on an exciting adventure\", or \"you are going on a short trip and we will see you soon.\"  Younger children, perhaps six and younger, would generally not accept such an explanation and would demand to stay with their parents. There are many records of tears and screaming at the various railway stations where the actual parting took place. Even for older children, \"more willing to accept the parents' explanation\", at some point that child realised that he or she would be separated from his or her parents for a long and indefinite time. The younger children had no developed sense of time, and for them the trauma of separation was total from the very beginning.\n\nHaving to learn a new language, in a country where the child's native German or Czech was not understood, was anoter cause of stress. To have to learn to live with strangers, who only spoke English, and accept them as \"pseudo-parents\", was a trauma. At school, the English children would often view the Kinder as \"enemy Germans\" instead of as \"Jewish refugees\".\n\nBefore the war started on September 1, 1939, and even during the first part of the war, some parents were able to escape from Hitler and reach England and then reunite with their children. But this was the exception; most of the parents were murdered by the Nazis.\n \nThe older ones became fully aware of the war in Europe during 1939-1945 and its details, and they would understand and become concerned for their parents. During the later part of the war, they may have become aware of the [[Holocaust]] and the actual direct threat to their Jewish parents and extended family. After the war ended in 1945, nearly all the children learned sooner or later that their parents had been murdered.<ref>[[Dawidowicz, Lucy|Lucy Dawidowicz]] (1986), ''The War Against the Jews.''

She went to Vienna with the purpose of negotiating with [[Adolf Eichmann]] directly, but was initially turned away. She persevered however, until finally, as she wrote in her biography, Eichmann suddenly \"gave\" her 600 children with the clear intent of overloading her and making a transport on such short notice impossible.

They were run on communal lines. About 120 of the Kindertransport children grew up during the war years at these hostels at Exmouth, Dawlish, and South Devon. Bnei Akiva ran a number of hostels including at Gwrych Castle in North Wales, Bromsgrove and Farnham. The hostels themselves were large family mansions that were made available by their owners and helped by both the British government and the Jewish social and charitable organizations. Some of the Habonim members also participated with the older children in helping to farm and to grow agricultural produce to aid the war effort.

Speaking on behalf of the ''{{lang|de|Reichsvertretung}}'' (the German Jewish communal organisation) and the ''{{lang|de|Hilfsverein}}'' (the self-help body), he urged a plan of rescue on the Foreign Office and helped British [[Quaker]]s to visit Jewish communities all over Germany to prove to the British government that Jewish parents were indeed prepared to part with their children.<ref>Naomi Shepherd: ''A Refuge from Darkness'' Pantheon books, New York, 1984.

In order to assure the children follow Jewish dietary laws (Kosher) he instructed them to say to the foster parents that they are fish eating vegetarians. He also saved large numbers of Jews with South American protection papers. He brought over to England several thousand young people, rabbis, teachers, ritual slaughterers and other religious functionaries.<ref>See the entry [[Solomon Schonfeld]], and the book ''Holocaust Hero: Solomon Schonfeld'', by Dr. Kranzler (Ktav Publishing House, New Jersey, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Internment and war service==\nIn 1940, the British government ordered the internment of all male 16- to 70-year-old refugees from enemy countries&nbsp;\u2013 so-called ''friendly [[enemy aliens]]''. Many of the children who had arrived in earlier years were now young men, and so they were also interned. Approximately 1,000 of these ''prior-kinder'' were interned in these makeshift [[List of concentration and internment camps|internment camps]], many on the [[Isle of Man]]. Around 400 were transported overseas to Canada and Australia (see [[HMT Dunera|HMT ''Dunera'']]).\n\nAs the camp internees reached the age of 18, they were offered the chance to do war work or to enter the Army Auxiliary [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]]. About 1,000 German and Austrian ''prior-kinder'' who reached adulthood went on to serve in the British armed forces, including in combat units. Several dozen joined elite formations such as the [[Special forces#Britain|Special Forces]], where their language skills were put to good use during the [[D-Day Invasion]] and afterwards as the Allies progressed into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].\n\nThe British internment period for ''friendly enemy aliens'' generally lasted only a few months, until they were processed by the government and released.\n\n==\"American Kindertransport\"==\n{{main|One Thousand Children}}\nThe One Thousand Children (OTC) was a similar but much less organised effort to transport unaccompanied children, mostly Jewish, to the United States. The programme brought about 1,400 children aged between 14 months and 16 years to the United States between November 1934 and May 1945. Like the ''kinder'', these OTC children were forced to leave their parents behind in Europe; many of them were later murdered by the Nazis.\n\nIn contrast to the Kindertransport, where the British Government waived immigration visa requirements, these OTC children received no United States Government visa immigration assistance. Furthermore, it is documented that the State Department deliberately made it very difficult for any Jewish refugee to get an entrance visa.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941\u20131945]] |last= Wyman |first= David S. | authorlink= David Wyman |edition= |origyear= |year= 1984 |publisher= [[Pantheon Books]] |location= New York |isbn= 0-394-42813-7 |pages= 124\u2013142 }}</ref> And it was even harder to secure the appropriate papers for their parents, hence most had to remain in Europe.\n\nIn 1939 Sen.

The train, consisting of an original locomotive and carriages used in the 1930s, headed to London via the original ''Kindertransport'' route. On board the train were several surviving ''Winton children'' and their descendants, who were to be welcomed by the now hundred-year-old Sir [[Nicholas Winton]] in London. The occasion marked the 70th anniversary of the intended last Kindertransport, which was due to set off on 3 September 1939 but did not because of the outbreak of the Second World War.

She argues that \"the Kindertransport\" is used as evidence of Britain's \"proud tradition\" of taking in refugees; but that such allusions are problematic as the Kinderstransport model is taken out of context and thus subject to [[nostalgia]]. She points out that countries such as Britain and the United States did much to prevent immigration by turning desperate people away; at the [[\u00c9vian Conference]] in 1938, participant nations failed to reach agreement about accepting Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-matters-but-which-one-every-refugee-crisis-has-a-context|title=History matters\u2026 but which one?

Initially used for carrying [[cargo]], in 1918 she was given accommodations for up to 3,000 troops. Her gross tonnage was listed at 24,547.

Additionally she was converted to oil-firing.<ref name=dieselduck /> Her tonnage was increased to over 27,000&nbsp;gross&nbsp;tons, making her Red Star\u2019s largest and most luxurious ship. She remained on her route for a decade, and occasionally spent time on extensive world and winter cruises.\n\nOn 4 December 1924 she embarked on a 133-day world cruise &mdash; one of the longest attempted by a luxury liner at the time - advertised as \"The Largest Ship to Circle the Globe\".\n\n[[File:Albert Einstein on the bord of ocean liner emigrates to America.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albert Einstein]] on board ''Belgenland'', 18 March 1933.]]\nOne of her most famous passengers was [[Albert Einstein]].  Returning to [[Germany]] on board her in 1933, he found out [[Adolf Hitler]] had become [[Chancellor]] of [[Germany]].  Einstein left the ship at [[Antwerp]] and renounced his German citizenship.

At first, she was reduced to sailing on short cruises and one day excursions from New York, charging $4 a passenger.  Laid up in the winter of 1932-33, she made only three voyages the following summer, and they were Mediterranean cruises.  The millionaires who took her lengthy and expensive cruises were now unable to do so.  Then she made a few more cruises from London, and then she was laid up again in September at the [[Port of London]].\n\nThe Atlantic Transport Company purchased her in January 1935 and renamed her ''Columbia''. She was then placed with their subsidiary, Panama Pacific Line and placed on their [[New York City]] &mdash; [[California]] service via the [[Panama Canal]]. This venture failed and another attempt was made to place her on the New York \u2013 [[West Indies]] route, stopping at Miami, Nassau, and Havana, but this too failed.  She was too large for either service and was once again laid up, this time permanently.\n\nOn 22 April 1936 she sailed from New York to the [[United Kingdom]], was sold for scrap, and her scrapping commenced on 4 May of that year at [[Bo'ness]] Scotland.<ref>Frank C.

Because she was needed for the war effort, she was hastily finished with only two smokestacks and a superstructure only one deck high. Initially used for carrying [[cargo]], in 1918 she was given accommodations for up to 3,000 troops. Her gross tonnage was listed at 24,547. The doomed liner [[SS Justicia|''Justicia'']] was a near identical sister ship, both being built at the same yard.\n\n==Conversion to luxury liner==\nOriginally ordered as the ''Bergenland'' for the Red Star Line but taken over during construction for use as a cargo vessel by the [[Shipping Controller]] and operated by the White Star Line who renamed her ''Belgic'', the fourth ship to carry the name. In 1918 she was converted for use as a troopship able to carry 3000 troops.  After the war she was employed returning US soldiers across the Atlantic until April 1921, when she was laid up at [[Liverpool]].<ref name=dieselduck>{{cite web |title=White Star Liners |url=http://www.dieselduck.info/historical/05%20documents/White%20Star%20Liners.pdf |website=Dieselduck.net |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> There were no berths available at any of the shipyards so that she could be rebuilt.
