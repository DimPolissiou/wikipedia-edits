However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency here within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Furthermore, American carriers had been using a multihub strategy, that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs (''very large aircraft'' with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-exec-reveals-why-company-doesnt-use-airbus-a380-2019-4]</ref> Consequently, the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.<ref>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/asian-airlines-changing-presence-at-london-heathrow-pt-1-cathay-and-sia-increase-capacity-96950 Asian Airlines' changing presence at London Heathrow]\", Centre for Aviation, 13 February 2013.</ref><ref name=guangzhou>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/china-southerns-a380-problems-may-not-be-solved-by-possible-air-china-partnership-103063 China Southern's A380 problems may not be solved by possible Air China partnership]\", CAPA: Centre for Aviation, 2 April 2013.</ref><ref name=spar>Sparaco, Pierre. \"[http://aviationweek.com/awin/opinion-mega-transports-hobbled-their-size Opinion: Mega-Transports Hobbled By Their Size]\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 3 March 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= United Airlines does not see a fit for Airbus A380 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/united-airlines-fleet-idUSL1N0YQ00Z20150604 |agency= Reuters |date= 4 June 2015 |last= Dastin|first= Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Airbus A380 cross section.svg|thumb|upright|The A380 cabin cross-section with [[economy-class]] seating]]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the ''A380-800'' and the ''A380F''.\n\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a [[travel class|three-class]] configuration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115419/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archivedate=25 August 2009|title=Airbus A380 Cabin|publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration.

Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the [[Airbus A330]] and ten across on the [[Airbus A350|A350]].<ref>Flottau, Jens, In a squeeze, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 April \u2013 10 May 2015, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===\n\n====Ground operations====\n[[File:Qatar Airways Airbus A380-800 at Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 before Flying to Doha, 6 Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft ground handling]] with separate [[jetway]]s for the main and upper deck, and [[ground support equipment]]]]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the [[Boeing 747]].

However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency here within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Furthermore, American carriers had been using a multihub strategy, that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs (''very large aircraft'' with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-exec-reveals-why-company-doesnt-use-airbus-a380-2019-4]</ref> Consequently, the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.<ref>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/asian-airlines-changing-presence-at-london-heathrow-pt-1-cathay-and-sia-increase-capacity-96950 Asian Airlines' changing presence at London Heathrow]\", Centre for Aviation, 13 February 2013.</ref><ref name=guangzhou>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/china-southerns-a380-problems-may-not-be-solved-by-possible-air-china-partnership-103063 China Southern's A380 problems may not be solved by possible Air China partnership]\", CAPA: Centre for Aviation, 2 April 2013.</ref><ref name=spar>Sparaco, Pierre. \"[http://aviationweek.com/awin/opinion-mega-transports-hobbled-their-size Opinion: Mega-Transports Hobbled By Their Size]\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 3 March 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= United Airlines does not see a fit for Airbus A380 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/united-airlines-fleet-idUSL1N0YQ00Z20150604 |agency= Reuters |date= 4 June 2015 |last= Dastin|first= Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Airbus A380 cross section.svg|thumb|upright|The A380 cabin cross-section with [[economy-class]] seating]]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the ''A380-800'' and the ''A380F''.\n\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a [[travel class|three-class]] configuration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115419/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archivedate=25 August 2009|title=Airbus A380 Cabin|publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration.

Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the [[Airbus A330]] and ten across on the [[Airbus A350|A350]].<ref>Flottau, Jens, In a squeeze, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 April \u2013 10 May 2015, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===\n\n====Ground operations====\n[[File:Qatar Airways Airbus A380-800 at Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 before Flying to Doha, 6 Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft ground handling]] with separate [[jetway]]s for the main and upper deck, and [[ground support equipment]]]]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the [[Boeing 747]].

The association has a number of regional [[mountain rescue]] teams, each of which is an independent charity. The team members are highly trained volunteers who are called out by the [[Policing in the United Kingdom|police]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountain.rescue.org.uk/|title=Mountain Rescue England & Wales|work=mountain.rescue.org|publisher=Mountain Rescue England & Wales|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nMREW is a member of the [[International Commission for Mountain Rescue]] ([[Internationale Kommission f\u00fcr Alpines Rettungswesen]] (IKAR-CISA)).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikar-cisa.org|title=ICAR-CISA|work=ikar-cisa.org|publisher=ICAR-CISA|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Battenburg-mountain.svg|thumb|right|The [[Battenburg markings]] used by mountain rescue]]\n\nVoluntary mountain rescue teams in England and Wales are independent charities whose members are highly trained volunteers who are called out by the [[Policing in the United Kingdom|police]]. The police are legally responsible for land based search and rescue but generally lack the resources to discharge this function effectively. Individual teams are normally known as an MRT (mountain rescue team) but some use the term SRT (search and rescue team) or MS&RT (mountain search and rescue team).\n\nIndividual teams are members both of the MREW and of their regional association (which is also represented at MREW). Neither MREW nor the regional associations have authority over the individual teams but provide an opportunity to discuss and agree standards, training and equipment. MREW does provide some equipment funding for MRTs both from its own funds and via a small government grant, but teams have to finance their own running costs through charity fund-raising or sponsorship. MRTs in England and Wales receive no direct government funding. The government provides access by teams to [[Ordnance Survey]] mapping.\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service]] has three teams \u2013 one in Scotland, one in England and one in Wales \u2013 and as part of the military is wholly government funded.

Wales''' ('''MREW'''), formerly called '''Mountain Rescue Council of England & Wales'''. The association has a number of regional [[mountain rescue]] teams, each of which is an independent charity. The team members are highly trained volunteers who are called out by the [[Policing in the United Kingdom|police]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountain.rescue.org.uk/|title=Mountain Rescue England & Wales|work=mountain.rescue.org|publisher=Mountain Rescue England & Wales|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nMREW is a member of the [[International Commission for Mountain Rescue]] ([[Internationale Kommission f\u00fcr Alpines Rettungswesen]] (IKAR-CISA)).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikar-cisa.org|title=ICAR-CISA|work=ikar-cisa.org|publisher=ICAR-CISA|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Battenburg-mountain.svg|thumb|right|The [[Battenburg markings]] used by mountain rescue]]\n\nVoluntary mountain rescue teams in England and Wales are independent charities whose members are highly trained volunteers who are called out by the [[Policing in the United Kingdom|police]]. The police are legally responsible for land based search and rescue but generally lack the resources to discharge this function effectively. Individual teams are normally known as an MRT (mountain rescue team) but some use the term SRT (search and rescue team) or MS&RT (mountain search and rescue team).\n\nIndividual teams are members both of the MREW and of their regional association (which is also represented at MREW). Neither MREW nor the regional associations have authority over the individual teams but provide an opportunity to discuss and agree standards, training and equipment. MREW does provide some equipment funding for MRTs both from its own funds and via a small government grant, but teams have to finance their own running costs through charity fund-raising or sponsorship. MRTs in England and Wales receive no direct government funding. The government provides access by teams to [[Ordnance Survey]] mapping.\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service]] has three teams \u2013 one in Scotland, one in England and one in Wales \u2013 and as part of the military is wholly government funded. They have primary responsibility for [[aircraft crash]]es on high ground, but also respond to civilian calls for assistance from hikers and climbers.\n\nAlthough the primary focus of mountain rescue is to locate and evacuate injured and/or lost persons in upland environments, teams also undertake a wide range of roles which may differ from team to team:\n\n* missing person searches in lowland areas where access or terrain is difficult;\n* support to [[National Health Service|NHS]] [[ambulance]] services for difficult casualty evacuation;\n* support to government agencies/emergency services in flood and heavy snowfall;\n* support to government agencies/emergency services at major incidents;\n* swift water rescue;\n* animal rescue.\n\nUrban search and rescue is currently undertaken by the [[fire and rescue]] services as part of their statutory enablement, but at least one mountain rescue team has chosen to train in this field.\n\nEach team has its own primary area of responsibility but frequently deploy outside these areas in support of other teams.\n\n[[Cave rescue]] had its own umbrella organisation, the [[British Cave Rescue Council]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caverescue.org.uk|title=British Cave Rescue Council|work=caverescue.org.uk|publisher=British Cave Rescue Council|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref> but some teams operate as both cave rescue teams and mountain rescue teams.\n\nThere are also regional organisations dedicated to the training of search dogs and their handlers.

{"title_page": "1997\u201398 OHL season", "text_new": "The '''1997\u201398 OHL season''' was the 18th season of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]. The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division. Due to the Majors joining the East, the OHL moved the [[North Bay Centennials]] from the East Division to the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] moved from the Central Division to the West Division. This created three six-team divisions in the 18 team league.\n\n==Regular Season==\n===Final standings===\n''Note: DIV = Division; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; OTL = Overtime Losses; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against; PTS = Points; x = clinched playoff berth; y = clinched division title; z = earned first round bye''\n\n=== East Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Ottawa 67's]] || 66 || 40 || 17 || 9 || '''89''' || 286 || 172\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Belleville Bulls]] || 66 || 41 || 22 || 3 || '''85''' || 315 || 239\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kingston Frontenacs]] || 66 || 35 || 27 || 4 || '''74''' || 330 || 275\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Oshawa Generals]] || 66 || 26 || 32 || 8 || '''60''' || 214 || 247\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Peterborough Petes]] || 66 || 20 || 36 || 10 || '''50''' || 212 || 273\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] || 66 || 15 || 42 || 9 || '''39''' || 154 || 265\n|}\n\n=== Central Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Guelph Storm]] || 66 || 42 || 18 || 6 || '''90''' || 263 || 189\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Barrie Colts]] || 66 || 38 || 23 || 5 || '''81''' || 236 || 215\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kitchener Rangers]] || 66 || 27 || 29 || 10 || '''64''' || 224 || 239\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Owen Sound Platers]] || 66 || 27 || 34 || 5 || '''59''' || 270 || 312\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Sudbury Wolves]] || 66 || 25 || 34 || 7 || '''57''' || 257 || 268\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[North Bay Centennials]] || 66 || 15 || 45 || 6 || '''36''' || 213 || 291\n|}\n\n=== West Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| y-[[London Knights]] || 66 || 40 || 21 || 5 || '''85''' || 301 || 238\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Plymouth Whalers]] || 66 || 37 || 22 || 7 || '''81''' || 279 || 223\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Sarnia Sting]] || 66 || 32 || 21 || 13 || '''77''' || 253 || 227\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Erie Otters]] || 66 || 33 || 28 || 5 || '''71''' || 261 || 252\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| [[Sault Ste.

The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division. Due to the Majors joining the East, the OHL moved the [[North Bay Centennials]] from the East Division to the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] moved from the Central Division to the West Division. This created three six-team divisions in the 18 team league.\n\n==Regular Season==\n===Final standings===\n''Note: DIV = Division; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; OTL = Overtime Losses; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against; PTS = Points; x = clinched playoff berth; y = clinched division title; z = earned first round bye''\n\n=== East Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Ottawa 67's]] || 66 || 40 || 17 || 9 || '''89''' || 286 || 172\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Belleville Bulls]] || 66 || 41 || 22 || 3 || '''85''' || 315 || 239\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kingston Frontenacs]] || 66 || 35 || 27 || 4 || '''74''' || 330 || 275\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Oshawa Generals]] || 66 || 26 || 32 || 8 || '''60''' || 214 || 247\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Peterborough Petes]] || 66 || 20 || 36 || 10 || '''50''' || 212 || 273\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] || 66 || 15 || 42 || 9 || '''39''' || 154 || 265\n|}\n\n=== Central Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Guelph Storm]] || 66 || 42 || 18 || 6 || '''90''' || 263 || 189\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Barrie Colts]] || 66 || 38 || 23 || 5 || '''81''' || 236 || 215\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kitchener Rangers]] || 66 || 27 || 29 || 10 || '''64''' || 224 || 239\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Owen Sound Platers]] || 66 || 27 || 34 || 5 || '''59''' || 270 || 312\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Sudbury Wolves]] || 66 || 25 || 34 || 7 || '''57''' || 257 || 268\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[North Bay Centennials]] || 66 || 15 || 45 || 6 || '''36''' || 213 || 291\n|}\n\n=== West Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| y-[[London Knights]] || 66 || 40 || 21 || 5 || '''85''' || 301 || 238\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Plymouth Whalers]] || 66 || 37 || 22 || 7 || '''81''' || 279 || 223\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Sarnia Sting]] || 66 || 32 || 21 || 13 || '''77''' || 253 || 227\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Erie Otters]] || 66 || 33 || 28 || 5 || '''71''' || 261 || 252\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| [[Sault Ste.

Under this \"consensus\", both governments \"agree\" that there is only one sovereign state encompassing both mainland China and Taiwan, but disagree about which of the two governments is the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] government of this state. An analogous situation existed with [[West Germany|West]] and [[East Germany]] in 1950\u20131970, [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], and [[Syrian Civil War|more recently]], the [[Syria|Syrian government]] and [[Syrian opposition]].\n\nThe One-China principle faces opposition from supporters of the [[Taiwan independence]] movement, which pushes to establish the \"Republic of Taiwan\" and cultivate a separate identity apart from China called \"[[Taiwanization]]\". Taiwanization's influence on the government of the ROC implies the change of self-identity among Taiwan citizens: after the [[Communist Party of China]] expelled the ROC in the [[Chinese Civil War]] from most of Chinese territory in 1949 and founded the PRC, the ROC's [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] government, which still held Taiwan, continued to claim [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] as the government of all of [[China]].

Only voters residing in the [[Free area of the Republic of China|free area]] are eligible to vote and be elected in ROC elections. The ROC's constitution still raises claims of sovereignty over [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]].\n\n== Evolution of the policy ==\n[[File:Washington Street, San Francisco (6453).JPG|thumb|280px|[[Flag of the Republic of China]] (right) and [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]] flying together in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], revealing different political views from [[overseas Chinese]]. ]]\nOne interpretation, which was adopted during the [[Cold War]], is that either the PRC or the ROC is the sole rightful government of all [[China]] and that the other government is illegitimate. While much of the [[western bloc]] maintained relations with the ROC until the 1970s under this policy, much of the [[eastern bloc]] maintained relations with the PRC. While the government of the ROC considered itself the remaining holdout of the legitimate government of a country overrun by what it thought of as [[Communist Party of China|Communist rebels]], the PRC claimed to have succeeded the ROC in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Though the ROC no longer portrays itself as the sole legitimate government of China, the position of the PRC remained unchanged until the early 2000s, when the PRC began to soften its position on this issue to promote [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]].\n\nThe revised position of the PRC was made clear in the [[Anti-Secession Law]] of 2005, which although stating that there is one China whose [[sovereignty]] is indivisible, does not explicitly identify this China with the PRC. Almost all PRC laws have a suffix \"of the People's Republic of China\" (prefix in Chinese grammar) in their official names, but the Anti-Secession Law is an exception. Beijing has made no major statements after 2004 which identify one China with the PRC and has shifted its definition of one China slightly to encompass a concept called the '[[1992 Consensus]]': both sides of the Taiwan strait recognize there is only one China\u2014both mainland China and Taiwan belong to the same China but agree to differ on the definition of which China.\n\nOne interpretation of one China is that only one geographical region of China exists, which was split between two Chinese governments during the [[Chinese Civil War]].  This is largely the position of current supporters of [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] in Mainland China, who believe that \"one China\" should eventually reunite under a single government. Starting in 2005, this position has become close enough to the position of the PRC, allowing high-level dialogue between the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] of the ROC.\n\n=== Policy position in the PRC ===\n[[File:Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents (front).jpg|thumb|[[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents|Special Travel document issued by PRC]], to ROC citizen who wants to enter Mainland China.]]\n\nIn practice, official sources and state-owned media never refer to the \"ROC government\", and seldom to the \"government of Taiwan\". Instead, the government in Taiwan is referred to as the \"Taiwan authorities\". The PRC does not accept or stamp [[Republic of China passport]]s. Instead, a Taiwan resident visiting [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] or [[Macau]] must use a [[Taiwan Compatriot Entry Permit]].\n\n=== Policy position in the ROC ===\n[[File:Republic of China Multiple Exit and Entry Permit (China Mainland Citizen).jpg|thumb|[[Exit & Entry Permit (Republic of China)|Exit and Entry Permit issued by ROC]], to PRC citizen who wants to enter Taiwan.]]\nThe only official statement of the ROC on its interpretation of the One-China Principle dates back to 1 August 1992. At that time, the [[National Unification Council]] of the ROC expressed the ROC's interpretation of the principle as:<ref>\nNational Unification Council, [http://www.mac.gov.tw/big5/rpir/2nda_4.htm Resolution of August 1, 1992 on the meaning of \"one China\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301061906/http://www.mac.gov.tw/big5/rpir/2nda_4.htm |date=2009-03-01 }}, 1 August 1992.\n</ref>\n# The two sides of the Strait have different opinions as to the meaning of \"one China.\" To Beijing, \"one China\" means \"the People's Republic of China (PRC),\" with Taiwan to become a \"Special Administrative Region\" after unification. Taipei, on the other hand, considers \"one China\" to mean the Republic of China (ROC), founded in 1912 and with de jure sovereignty over all of China. The modern-day ROC, however, has jurisdiction only over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. Taiwan is part of China, and the Chinese mainland is part of China as well.\n# Since 1949, China has been temporarily divided, and each side of the Taiwan Strait is administered by a separate political entity. This is an objective reality that no proposal for China's unification can overlook.\n# In February 1991, the government of the Republic of China, resolutely seeking to establish consensus and start the process of unification, adopted the \"[[Guidelines for National Unification]]\". This was done to enhance the progress and well-being of the people, and the prosperity of the nation. The ROC government sincerely hopes that the mainland authorities will adopt a pragmatic attitude, set aside prejudices, and cooperate in contributing its wisdom and energies toward the building of a free, democratic and prosperous China.\n\nHowever, political consensus and public opinion in Taiwan has evolved since 1992. There is significant difference between each faction's recognition for and understanding of the One China principle. The [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] parties, consisting of the [[Kuomintang]], the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]], and the [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]], accept the One China principle. In particular, former [[President of the Republic of China]], [[Ma Ying-jeou]], stated in 2006 when he was the Kuomintang chairman that \"One China is the Republic of China\". Until the 1990s, the government actively stated that the ROC is the only legitimate \"One China\" while the PRC is illegitimate.\n\nThe [[Pan-Green Coalition]] parties, consisting of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) and the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], are more hostile to the policy, as they view Taiwan as a country separate from China.  The former ROC President, [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the DPP, regards acceptance of the \"One China\" principle as capitulation to the PRC, and prefers to view it as nothing more than a topic for discussion, in opposition to the PRC's insistence that the \"One China\" principle is a prerequisite for any negotiation.\n\nWhen the Republic of China established diplomatic relations with [[Kiribati]] in 2003 the ROC officially declared that Kiribati could continue to have diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.  Despite the declaration, however, all countries maintaining official ties with Taipei continue to recognize the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China.<ref name=\"Nationalist Era Policy\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/03pol/c05s02.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Politics :: International Relations :: Nationalist Era Policy|work=ibiblio.org|access-date=2015-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194851/http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/03pol/c05s02.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nThe ROC does not recognize or stamp PRC passports. Instead, Chinese residents visiting Taiwan and other territory under ROC jurisdiction must use an [[Exit & Entry Permit (Republic of China)|Exit and Entry Permit]] issued by the ROC authorities.\n\n== Diplomatic relations ==\n[[File:Embassy of China2 in Kyiv.jpg|thumb|PRC embassy in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. Ukraine does not recognize the ROC.]]\n[[File:Embassy of China, Canberra.jpg|thumb|PRC embassy in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].

Japan recognizes the PRC, though it also has informal relations with the ROC.]]\n\nThe One-China Principle is also a requirement for any political entity to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.  The PRC has traditionally attempted to get nations to recognize that \"the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China ... and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.\"  However, many nations are unwilling to make this particular statement and there was often a protracted effort to find language regarding one China that is acceptable to both sides.  Some countries use terms such as \"respects\", \"acknowledge\", \"understand\", \"take note of\", while others explicitly use the term \"support\" or \"recognize\" for Beijing's position on the status of Taiwan. This [[strategic ambiguity]] in the language used provides the basis for countries to have formal ties with People's Republic China and maintain unofficial ties to the Republic of China.\n\nPRC government policy mandates that any country that wishes to establish diplomatic relationship with the PRC must first discontinue any formal relationship with the ROC. According to ''[[The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs]]'', \"non-recognition of the Taiwanese government is a prerequisite for conducting formal diplomatic relations with the PRC {{mdash}}in effect forcing other governments to choose between Beijing and Taipei.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | journal = [[The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs]] | volume = 31 | title = China, Taiwan, and the Battle for Latin America | first1 = Daniel P. | last1 = Erikson | first2 = Janice | last2 =  Chen | year = 2007 | issue = 2 | page = 71}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/taiwan/7956.htm | title = The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue | publisher = [[China Internet Information Center]] |accessdate=2014-04-09}}</ref> In order to compete for other countries' recognition, each Chinese government has given money to a certain few small countries.

Taiwan could also be used as shorthand for the Customs Union between Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.\nFor example, in [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) Declaration on the March 2007 elections, issued on behalf of the European Union and with support of 37 countries, express mention is made of \"Taiwan.\"\n\nMost countries that recognize Beijing circumvent the diplomatic language by establishing \"Trade Offices\" that represent their interests on Taiwanese soil, while the ROC government represents its interests abroad with TECRO, [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]. The United States (and any other nation having diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]]) does not have formal diplomatic relations with the ROC.  Instead, external relations are handled via nominally private organizations such as the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] or the [[Canadian Trade Office in Taipei]].\n\nAs for the [[Philippines]], the unofficial Embassy is called the [[Manila Economic and Cultural Office]]. Though it is a '''''cultural and economic''''' office, the website explicitly says that it is the '''''Philippine Representative Office in Taiwan'''''. It also offers various consular services, such as granting visa and processing passport.\n\n=== U.S. policy ===\n[[File:Mao Zedong, Zhang Yufeng et Richard Nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]] greets U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] during his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to China in 1972]]]]\nIn the case of the United States, the One-China Policy was first stated in the [[Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9]] of 1972: \"the United States acknowledges that Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States does not challenge that position.\" The United States has not expressed an explicitly immutable statement regarding whether it believes Taiwan is independent or not. Instead, Washington simply states that they understand the PRC's claims on Taiwan as its own. In fact, many scholars{{who|date=February 2019}} agree that U.S. One-China Policy was not intended to please the PRC government, but as a way for Washington to conduct international relations in the region, which Beijing fails to state.  A more recent study suggests that this wording reflected the Nixon administration's desire to shift responsibility for resolving the dispute to the \"people most directly involved\" - that is, China and Taiwan.  At the same time, the United States would avoid \"prejudic[ing] the ultimate outcome\" by refusing to explicitly support the claims of one side or the other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hilton|first=Brian|date=September 2018|title='Taiwan Expendable?'

In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] also saw that the [[Six Assurances]] were adopted, the fifth being that the United States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, United States policy has remained ambiguous.

He admitted the difficulty of defining the U.S.'s position: \"I didn\u2019t really define it, and I\u2019m not sure I very easily could define it.\" He added, \"I can tell you what it is not.

For example, in Premier [[Zhu Rongji]]'s statements prior to the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|2000 Presidential Election in Taiwan]], he stated that as long as any ruling power in Taiwan accepts the One China Principle, they can negotiate and discuss anything freely.\n\nHowever, the One-China Principle would apparently require that Taiwan formally give up any possibility of [[Taiwan independence|Taiwanese independence]], and would preclude any \"one nation, two states\" formula similar to ones used in German ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' or in [[Korean reunification]]. [[Chen Shui-bian]], president of the Republic of China between 2000 and 2008 repeatedly rejected the demands to accept the One China Principle and instead called for talks to discuss One China itself. With the [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|January]] and [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|March]] 2008 elections in Taiwan, and the election of [[Ma Ying-jeou]] as the President of the ROC, who was inaugurated on May 20, a new era of better relations between both sides of the Taiwan Strait was established.<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/jun2008/taiw-j04.shtml | title = Taiwan's new president makes immediate overtures to China | publisher = WSWS | date = 2008-06-04 | access-date = 2008-07-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080702143714/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/jun2008/taiw-j04.shtml | archive-date = 2008-07-02 | url-status = live }}\n</ref> KMT officials visited Mainland China, and the Chinese [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits|ARATS]] met in [[Beijing]] with its Taiwanese counterpart, the [[Straits Exchange Foundation]]. [[Cross-Strait charter|Direct charter flights]] were therefore established.\n\nOne China was the formulation held by the ROC government before the 1990s, but it was asserted that the one China was the Republic of China rather than PRC.  However, in 1991, President [[Lee Teng-hui]] indicated that he would not challenge the Communist authorities to rule mainland China.  This is a significant point in the history of [[Cross-Strait relations]] in that a president of the ROC no longer claims administrative authority over mainland China.  Henceforth, the [[Taiwan independence movement]] gained a political boost, and under Lee's administration the issue is no longer who rules mainland China, but who claims legitimacy over Taiwan and the surrounding islands.  Over the course of the 1990s, President Lee appeared to drift away from the One-China formulation, leading many to believe that he was actually sympathetic to Taiwan independence.  In 1999, Lee proposed a [[special state-to-state relations]] for mainland China\u2013Taiwan relations which was received angrily by [[Beijing]], which ended semi-official dialogue until June 2008, when ARATS and SEF met, and in which President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] reiterated the 1992 Consensus and the different interpretation on \"One China\".\n\nAfter the election of [[Chen Shui-bian]] in 2000, the policy of the ROC government was to propose negotiations without preconditions.  While Chen did not explicitly reject Lee's two states theory, he did not explicitly endorse it either.  Throughout 2001, there were unsuccessful attempts to find an acceptable formula for both sides, such as agreeing to \"abide by the 1992 consensus\".  Chen, after assuming the Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship in July 2002, moved to a somewhat less ambiguous policy, and stated in early August 2002 that \"it is clear that both sides of the straits are separate countries\".  This statement was strongly criticized by opposition [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] parties on Taiwan, which support a One-China Principle, but oppose defining this \"One China\" as the PRC.\n\nThe One China policy became an issue during the [[2004 ROC Presidential election]].  Chen Shui-bian abandoned his earlier ambiguity and publicly rejected the One-China Principle claiming it would imply that Taiwan is part of the PRC.  His opponent [[Lien Chan]] publicly supported a policy of \"one China, different interpretations\", as done in 1992. At the end of the 2004 election, Lien Chan and his running mate, [[James Soong]], later announced that they would not put ultimate unification as the goal for their cross-strait policy and would not exclude the possibility of an independent Taiwan in the future.  In an interview with Time Asia bureau prior to the 2004 presidential elections, Chen used the model of Germany and the European Union as examples of how countries may come together, and the Soviet Union as illustrating how a country may fragment.\n\nIn March 2005, the PRC passed an [[Anti-Secession Law]] which authorized the use of force to prevent a \"serious incident\" that breaks the One China policy, but which at the same time did not identify one China with the People's Republic and offered to pursue political solutions. At the same session of the PRC Congress, a large increase in military spending was also passed, leading blue team members to interpret those measures as forcing the ROC to adhere to the One China Policy or else the PRC would attack.\n\nIn April and May 2005, Lien Chan and [[James Soong]] made separate trips to Mainland China,<ref>\n{{cite news | url = http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=21298&CtNode=122 | title = People First Party leader visits China after KMT head's return | newspaper = Taiwan Journal | date = 2005-05-13 | access-date = 2008-07-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090301041957/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=21298&CtNode=122 | archive-date = 2009-03-01 | url-status = dead }}\n</ref> during which both explicitly supported the [[Consensus of 1992]] and the concept of one China and in which both explicitly stated their parties' opposition to [[Taiwan independence]].

Only voters residing in the [[Free area of the Republic of China|free area]] are eligible to vote and be elected in ROC elections. The ROC's constitution still raises claims of sovereignty over [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]].\n\n== Evolution of the policy ==\n[[File:Washington Street, San Francisco (6453).JPG|thumb|280px|[[Flag of the Republic of China]] (right) and [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]] flying together in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], revealing different political views from [[overseas Chinese]]. ]]\nOne interpretation, which was adopted during the [[Cold War]], is that either the PRC or the ROC is the sole rightful government of all [[China]] and that the other government is illegitimate. While much of the [[western bloc]] maintained relations with the ROC until the 1970s under this policy, much of the [[eastern bloc]] maintained relations with the PRC. While the government of the ROC considered itself the remaining holdout of the legitimate government of a country overrun by what it thought of as [[Communist Party of China|Communist rebels]], the PRC claimed to have succeeded the ROC in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Though the ROC no longer portrays itself as the sole legitimate government of China, the position of the PRC remained unchanged until the early 2000s, when the PRC began to soften its position on this issue to promote [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]].\n\nThe revised position of the PRC was made clear in the [[Anti-Secession Law]] of 2005, which although stating that there is one China whose [[sovereignty]] is indivisible, does not explicitly identify this China with the PRC. Almost all PRC laws have a suffix \"of the People's Republic of China\" (prefix in Chinese grammar) in their official names, but the Anti-Secession Law is an exception. Beijing has made no major statements after 2004 which identify one China with the PRC and has shifted its definition of one China slightly to encompass a concept called the '[[1992 Consensus]]': both sides of the Taiwan strait recognize there is only one China\u2014both mainland China and Taiwan belong to the same China but agree to differ on the definition of which China.\n\nOne interpretation of one China is that only one geographical region of China exists, which was split between two Chinese governments during the [[Chinese Civil War]].  This is largely the position of current supporters of [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] in Mainland China, who believe that \"one China\" should eventually reunite under a single government. Starting in 2005, this position has become close enough to the position of the PRC, allowing high-level dialogue between the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] of the ROC.\n\n=== Policy position in the PRC ===\n[[File:Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents (front).jpg|thumb|[[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents|Special Travel document issued by PRC]], to ROC citizen who wants to enter Mainland China.]]\n\nIn practice, official sources and state-owned media never refer to the \"ROC government\", and seldom to the \"government of Taiwan\". Instead, the government in Taiwan is referred to as the \"Taiwan authorities\". The PRC does not accept or stamp [[Republic of China passport]]s. Instead, a Taiwan resident visiting [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] or [[Macau]] must use a [[Taiwan Compatriot Entry Permit]].\n\n=== Policy position in the ROC ===\n[[File:Republic of China Multiple Exit and Entry Permit (China Mainland Citizen).jpg|thumb|[[Exit & Entry Permit (Republic of China)|Exit and Entry Permit issued by ROC]], to PRC citizen who wants to enter Taiwan.]]\nThe only official statement of the ROC on its interpretation of the One-China Principle dates back to 1 August 1992. At that time, the [[National Unification Council]] of the ROC expressed the ROC's interpretation of the principle as:<ref>\nNational Unification Council, [http://www.mac.gov.tw/big5/rpir/2nda_4.htm Resolution of August 1, 1992 on the meaning of \"one China\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301061906/http://www.mac.gov.tw/big5/rpir/2nda_4.htm |date=2009-03-01 }}, 1 August 1992.\n</ref>\n# The two sides of the Strait have different opinions as to the meaning of \"one China.\" To Beijing, \"one China\" means \"the People's Republic of China (PRC),\" with Taiwan to become a \"Special Administrative Region\" after unification. Taipei, on the other hand, considers \"one China\" to mean the Republic of China (ROC), founded in 1912 and with de jure sovereignty over all of China. The modern-day ROC, however, has jurisdiction only over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. Taiwan is part of China, and the Chinese mainland is part of China as well.\n# Since 1949, China has been temporarily divided, and each side of the Taiwan Strait is administered by a separate political entity. This is an objective reality that no proposal for China's unification can overlook.\n# In February 1991, the government of the Republic of China, resolutely seeking to establish consensus and start the process of unification, adopted the \"[[Guidelines for National Unification]]\". This was done to enhance the progress and well-being of the people, and the prosperity of the nation. The ROC government sincerely hopes that the mainland authorities will adopt a pragmatic attitude, set aside prejudices, and cooperate in contributing its wisdom and energies toward the building of a free, democratic and prosperous China.\n\nHowever, political consensus and public opinion in Taiwan has evolved since 1992. There is significant difference between each faction's recognition for and understanding of the One China principle. The [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] parties, consisting of the [[Kuomintang]], the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]], and the [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]], accept the One China principle. In particular, former [[President of the Republic of China]], [[Ma Ying-jeou]], stated in 2006 when he was the Kuomintang chairman that \"One China is the Republic of China\". Until the 1990s, the government actively stated that the ROC is the only legitimate \"One China\" while the PRC is illegitimate.\n\nThe [[Pan-Green Coalition]] parties, consisting of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) and the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], are more hostile to the policy, as they view Taiwan as a country separate from China.  The former ROC President, [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the DPP, regards acceptance of the \"One China\" principle as capitulation to the PRC, and prefers to view it as nothing more than a topic for discussion, in opposition to the PRC's insistence that the \"One China\" principle is a prerequisite for any negotiation.\n\nWhen the Republic of China established diplomatic relations with [[Kiribati]] in 2003 the ROC officially declared that Kiribati could continue to have diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.  Despite the declaration, however, all countries maintaining official ties with Taipei continue to recognize the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China.<ref name=\"Nationalist Era Policy\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/03pol/c05s02.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Politics :: International Relations :: Nationalist Era Policy|work=ibiblio.org|access-date=2015-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194851/http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/03pol/c05s02.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nThe ROC does not recognize or stamp PRC passports. Instead, Chinese residents visiting Taiwan and other territory under ROC jurisdiction must use an [[Exit & Entry Permit (Republic of China)|Exit and Entry Permit]] issued by the ROC authorities.\n\n== Diplomatic relations ==\n[[File:Embassy of China2 in Kyiv.jpg|thumb|PRC embassy in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. Ukraine does not recognize the ROC.]]\n[[File:Embassy of China, Canberra.jpg|thumb|PRC embassy in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].

Japan recognizes the PRC, though it also has informal relations with the ROC.]]\n\nThe One-China Principle is also a requirement for any political entity to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.  The PRC has traditionally attempted to get nations to recognize that \"the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China ... and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.\"  However, many nations are unwilling to make this particular statement and there was often a protracted effort to find language regarding one China that is acceptable to both sides.  Some countries use terms such as \"respects\", \"acknowledge\", \"understand\", \"take note of\", while others explicitly use the term \"support\" or \"recognize\" for Beijing's position on the status of Taiwan. This [[strategic ambiguity]] in the language used provides the basis for countries to have formal ties with People's Republic China and maintain unofficial ties to the Republic of China.\n\nPRC government policy mandates that any country that wishes to establish diplomatic relationship with the PRC must first discontinue any formal relationship with the ROC. According to ''[[The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs]]'', \"non-recognition of the Taiwanese government is a prerequisite for conducting formal diplomatic relations with the PRC {{mdash}}in effect forcing other governments to choose between Beijing and Taipei.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | journal = [[The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs]] | volume = 31 | title = China, Taiwan, and the Battle for Latin America | first1 = Daniel P. | last1 = Erikson | first2 = Janice | last2 =  Chen | year = 2007 | issue = 2 | page = 71}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/taiwan/7956.htm | title = The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue | publisher = [[China Internet Information Center]] |accessdate=2014-04-09}}</ref> In order to compete for other countries' recognition, each Chinese government has given money to a certain few small countries. Both the PRC and ROC governments have accused each other of [[monetary diplomacy]]. Several small African and Caribbean countries have established and discontinued diplomatic relationships with both sides several times in exchange for huge financial support from each side.<ref>\n{{Cite web | title = China and Taiwan in Africa | publisher = HiiDunia | url = http://www.hiidunia.com/2010/04/china-and-taiwan-in-africa/ | accessdate = 2014-04-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124423/http://www.hiidunia.com/2010/04/china-and-taiwan-in-africa/ | archive-date = 2014-04-13 | url-status = live }}\n</ref>\n\nThe name \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\" is used in some international arenas since \"Taiwan\" suggests that Taiwan is a separate country and \"Republic of China\" suggests that there are [[two Chinas]], and thus both violate the One-China Principle. Taiwan could also be used as shorthand for the Customs Union between Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.\nFor example, in [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) Declaration on the March 2007 elections, issued on behalf of the European Union and with support of 37 countries, express mention is made of \"Taiwan.\"\n\nMost countries that recognize Beijing circumvent the diplomatic language by establishing \"Trade Offices\" that represent their interests on Taiwanese soil, while the ROC government represents its interests abroad with TECRO, [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]. The United States (and any other nation having diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]]) does not have formal diplomatic relations with the ROC.  Instead, external relations are handled via nominally private organizations such as the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] or the [[Canadian Trade Office in Taipei]].\n\nAs for the [[Philippines]], the unofficial Embassy is called the [[Manila Economic and Cultural Office]]. Though it is a '''''cultural and economic''''' office, the website explicitly says that it is the '''''Philippine Representative Office in Taiwan'''''. It also offers various consular services, such as granting visa and processing passport.\n\n=== U.S. policy ===\n[[File:Mao Zedong, Zhang Yufeng et Richard Nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]] greets U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] during his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to China in 1972]]]]\nIn the case of the United States, the One-China Policy was first stated in the [[Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9]] of 1972: \"the United States acknowledges that Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States does not challenge that position.\" The United States has not expressed an explicitly immutable statement regarding whether it believes Taiwan is independent or not. Instead, Washington simply states that they understand the PRC's claims on Taiwan as its own. In fact, many scholars{{who|date=February 2019}} agree that U.S. One-China Policy was not intended to please the PRC government, but as a way for Washington to conduct international relations in the region, which Beijing fails to state.  A more recent study suggests that this wording reflected the Nixon administration's desire to shift responsibility for resolving the dispute to the \"people most directly involved\" - that is, China and Taiwan.  At the same time, the United States would avoid \"prejudic[ing] the ultimate outcome\" by refusing to explicitly support the claims of one side or the other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hilton|first=Brian|date=September 2018|title='Taiwan Expendable?'

In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] also saw that the [[Six Assurances]] were adopted, the fifth being that the United States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, United States policy has remained ambiguous. In the [[U.S. House Committee on International Relations|House International Relations Committee]] on April 21, 2004, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, [[James A. Kelly]], was asked by Rep. [[Grace Napolitano]] (D-CA) whether the United States government's commitment to Taiwan's democracy conflicted with the so-called One-China Policy. He admitted the difficulty of defining the U.S.'s position: \"I didn\u2019t really define it, and I\u2019m not sure I very easily could define it.\" He added, \"I can tell you what it is not. It is not the One-China principle that Beijing suggests.\"<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/AsiaandthePacific/wm597.cfm|title=Secretary Powell Must Not Change U.S. Policy on Taiwan|work=heritage.org|access-date=2005-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215152550/http://www.heritage.org/Research/AsiaandthePacific/wm597.cfm|archive-date=2004-12-15|url-status=dead}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:President Barack Obama offers a toast to President Xi Jinping of China during a State Banquet at the Great Hall of People in Beijing, China, Nov. 12, 2014.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]].

For example, in Premier [[Zhu Rongji]]'s statements prior to the [[2000 Taiwan presidential election|2000 Presidential Election in Taiwan]], he stated that as long as any ruling power in Taiwan accepts the One China Principle, they can negotiate and discuss anything freely.\n\nHowever, the One-China Principle would apparently require that Taiwan formally give up any possibility of [[Taiwan independence|Taiwanese independence]], and would preclude any \"one nation, two states\" formula similar to ones used in German ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' or in [[Korean reunification]]. [[Chen Shui-bian]], president of the Republic of China between 2000 and 2008 repeatedly rejected the demands to accept the One China Principle and instead called for talks to discuss One China itself. With the [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|January]] and [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|March]] 2008 elections in Taiwan, and the election of [[Ma Ying-jeou]] as the President of the ROC, who was inaugurated on May 20, a new era of better relations between both sides of the Taiwan Strait was established.<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/jun2008/taiw-j04.shtml | title = Taiwan's new president makes immediate overtures to China | publisher = WSWS | date = 2008-06-04 | access-date = 2008-07-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080702143714/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/jun2008/taiw-j04.shtml | archive-date = 2008-07-02 | url-status = live }}\n</ref> KMT officials visited Mainland China, and the Chinese [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits|ARATS]] met in [[Beijing]] with its Taiwanese counterpart, the [[Straits Exchange Foundation]]. [[Cross-Strait charter|Direct charter flights]] were therefore established.\n\nOne China was the formulation held by the ROC government before the 1990s, but it was asserted that the one China was the Republic of China rather than PRC.  However, in 1991, President [[Lee Teng-hui]] indicated that he would not challenge the Communist authorities to rule mainland China.  This is a significant point in the history of [[Cross-Strait relations]] in that a president of the ROC no longer claims administrative authority over mainland China.  Henceforth, the [[Taiwan independence movement]] gained a political boost, and under Lee's administration the issue is no longer who rules mainland China, but who claims legitimacy over Taiwan and the surrounding islands.  Over the course of the 1990s, President Lee appeared to drift away from the One-China formulation, leading many to believe that he was actually sympathetic to Taiwan independence.  In 1999, Lee proposed a [[special state-to-state relations]] for mainland China\u2013Taiwan relations which was received angrily by [[Beijing]], which ended semi-official dialogue until June 2008, when ARATS and SEF met, and in which President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] reiterated the 1992 Consensus and the different interpretation on \"One China\".\n\nAfter the election of [[Chen Shui-bian]] in 2000, the policy of the ROC government was to propose negotiations without preconditions.  While Chen did not explicitly reject Lee's two states theory, he did not explicitly endorse it either.  Throughout 2001, there were unsuccessful attempts to find an acceptable formula for both sides, such as agreeing to \"abide by the 1992 consensus\".  Chen, after assuming the Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship in July 2002, moved to a somewhat less ambiguous policy, and stated in early August 2002 that \"it is clear that both sides of the straits are separate countries\".  This statement was strongly criticized by opposition [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] parties on Taiwan, which support a One-China Principle, but oppose defining this \"One China\" as the PRC.\n\nThe One China policy became an issue during the [[2004 ROC Presidential election]].  Chen Shui-bian abandoned his earlier ambiguity and publicly rejected the One-China Principle claiming it would imply that Taiwan is part of the PRC.  His opponent [[Lien Chan]] publicly supported a policy of \"one China, different interpretations\", as done in 1992. At the end of the 2004 election, Lien Chan and his running mate, [[James Soong]], later announced that they would not put ultimate unification as the goal for their cross-strait policy and would not exclude the possibility of an independent Taiwan in the future.  In an interview with Time Asia bureau prior to the 2004 presidential elections, Chen used the model of Germany and the European Union as examples of how countries may come together, and the Soviet Union as illustrating how a country may fragment.\n\nIn March 2005, the PRC passed an [[Anti-Secession Law]] which authorized the use of force to prevent a \"serious incident\" that breaks the One China policy, but which at the same time did not identify one China with the People's Republic and offered to pursue political solutions. At the same session of the PRC Congress, a large increase in military spending was also passed, leading blue team members to interpret those measures as forcing the ROC to adhere to the One China Policy or else the PRC would attack.\n\nIn April and May 2005, Lien Chan and [[James Soong]] made separate trips to Mainland China,<ref>\n{{cite news | url = http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=21298&CtNode=122 | title = People First Party leader visits China after KMT head's return | newspaper = Taiwan Journal | date = 2005-05-13 | access-date = 2008-07-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090301041957/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=21298&CtNode=122 | archive-date = 2009-03-01 | url-status = dead }}\n</ref> during which both explicitly supported the [[Consensus of 1992]] and the concept of one China and in which both explicitly stated their parties' opposition to [[Taiwan independence]].

Once the ARATS-SEF dialogue is resumed, priority should be given to issues including cross-Strait weekend chartered flights and approval for mainland China residents traveling to Taiwan, which are of the biggest concern to people on both sides of the Strait. \"The KMT has won two important elections in Taiwan recently,\" Wu said, \"which showed that the mainstream opinion of the Taiwan people identified with what the KMT stood for, and most of the Taiwan people agree that the two sides on the strait can achieve peaceful development and a win-win situation\".<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://lcbackerblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/kmt-retruns-to-china.html | title = KMT Returns to China | publisher = Lc Backer Blog | date = 2008-05-31 | access-date = 2008-07-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708050200/http://lcbackerblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/kmt-retruns-to-china.html | archive-date = 2011-07-08 | url-status = live }}\n</ref> Wu also told reporters that he had stressed to Hu that Taiwan needed an international presence. \"The Taiwanese people need a sense of security, respect and a place in the international community\", Wu said.
