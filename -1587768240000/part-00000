It then intersects [[K-103 (Kansas highway)|K-103]] roughly {{convert|2|mi|km}} north of Scammon before intersecting [[U.S. Route 400 in Kansas|US-400]] at [[Cherokee, Kansas|Cherokee]]. Five miles north of Cherokee, it intersects [[K-126 (Kansas highway)|K-126]] and then intersects [[K-47 (Kansas highway)|K-47]] at [[Girard, Kansas|Girard]]. It then continues north from Girard, passing just west of [[Farlington, Kansas|Farlington]]. Near [[Hiattville, Kansas|Hiattville]], it intersects [[K-39 (Kansas highway)|K-39]] and turns east, then northeast. Five miles south of [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]], K-7 intersects US-69 at a freeway interchange, and K-7 overlaps with US-69 into Fort Scott.\n\n===Fort Scott to Olathe===\n[[File:US 54 in Fort Scott, Kansas.jpg|thumb|right|View of US-54 east from under US-69 / K-7 overpass, showing sign for northbound K-7 on-ramp]]\nWhile in Fort Scott, K-7 and US-69 intersect [[U.S. Route 54 in Kansas|US-54]] and K-7 overlaps with US-54 west for four miles (6&nbsp;km). It then turns north again, and alternates between going north and going west before entering [[Devon, Kansas|Devon]]. It continues north to [[K-31 (Kansas highway)|K-31]], with which it overlaps for a mile going east. It then turns north and goes through [[Mound City, Kansas|Mound City]], intersecting [[K-52 (Kansas highway)|K-52]] there. It goes north-northwesterly for {{convert|16|mi|km}} and intersects [[K-152 (Kansas highway)|K-152]] east of [[Parker, Kansas|Parker]]. It goes north, then west for {{convert|9|mi|km}}, then at [[Beagle, Kansas|Beagle]], turns north and intersects [[U.S. Route 169 in Kansas|US-169]] south of [[Osawatomie, Kansas|Osawatomie]]. While overlapping US-169, it follows a freeway alignment that bypasses Osawatomie and [[Paola, Kansas|Paola]] before meeting [[K-68 (Kansas highway)|K-68]]. After K-68, the freeway bypasses [[Hillsdale, Kansas|Hillsdale]] and [[Spring Hill, Kansas|Spring Hill]] before turning into expressway. The overlap with US-169 ends at its intersection with [[Interstate 35 in Kansas|I-35]], [[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|US-50]] and [[U.S. Route 56 in Kansas|US-56]] at [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]].\n\n===Olathe to Leavenworth===\n[[File:K-7 (Kansas highway) northbound at junction with K-10.jpg|thumb|left|K-7 northbound at interchange with K-10]]\nIn Olathe, K-7 alternates between northbound and westbound routings before turning north and becoming freeway. On the border between Olathe and [[Lenexa, Kansas|Lenexa]], K-7 intersects the [[K-10 (Kansas highway)|K-10]] freeway. It continues north, then turns northwest to cross the [[Kansas River]] and enter [[Bonner Springs, Kansas|Bonner Springs]], where it immediately intersects [[K-32 (Kansas highway)|K-32]]. It turns north to intersect [[Interstate 70 in Kansas|I-70]], the [[Kansas Turnpike]], then turns northwest to intersect [[U.S. Route 24 in Kansas|US-24]], [[U.S. Route 40 in Kansas|US-40]], and [[U.S. Route 73 in Kansas|US-73]]. At this point, which is on the border between Bonner Springs and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], an overlap with US-73 begins. K-7 and US-73 then go north along the western city limits of Kansas City before entering [[Lansing, Kansas|Lansing]]. They continue north through Lansing and upon entering [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]], intersect [[K-5 (Kansas highway)|K-5]]. Also in Leavenworth, they intersect [[K-92 (Kansas highway)|K-92]] and they briefly run concurrent with K-92 before separating and turning west to leave Leavenworth.\n\n===Leavenworth to Nebraska===\nK-7 and US-73 leave Leavenworth going west until intersecting [[K-192 (Kansas highway)|K-192]], then turn north, intersecting [[K-74 (Kansas highway)|K-74]] near [[Potter, Kansas|Potter]]. At [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], K-7's overlap with US-73 ends at its intersection with [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59]]. After winding its way through Atchison, K-7 continues north and intersects [[K-20 (Kansas highway)|K-20]] near [[Bendena, Kansas|Bendena]] and [[U.S. Route 36 in Kansas|US-36]] west of [[Troy, Kansas|Troy]]. The highway turns northwest along an alignment closely parallelling the [[Missouri River]] and after passing through [[White Cloud, Kansas|White Cloud]], ends at the Nebraska border northwest of White Cloud. No corresponding state highway in Nebraska continues from K-7, although a county road continues northwest to [[Rulo, Nebraska]].\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nK-7 is one of the original State Highways that was designated in 1927 and at that time extended from the Oklahoma border to US-40 and US-73E west of Kansas City.<ref name=1927rm/> Then by 1936 K-7 had been extended north to US-36 in Troy and US-73E was renumbered as US-73 and truncated to US-40 and US-24 west of Kansas City.

K-7 and US-69 split at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 160 in Kansas|US-160]] in Columbus. K-7 then goes north to [[Scammon, Kansas|Scammon]], where it meets [[K-102 (Kansas highway)|K-102]]. It then intersects [[K-103 (Kansas highway)|K-103]] roughly {{convert|2|mi|km}} north of Scammon before intersecting [[U.S. Route 400 in Kansas|US-400]] at [[Cherokee, Kansas|Cherokee]]. Five miles north of Cherokee, it intersects [[K-126 (Kansas highway)|K-126]] and then intersects [[K-47 (Kansas highway)|K-47]] at [[Girard, Kansas|Girard]]. It then continues north from Girard, passing just west of [[Farlington, Kansas|Farlington]]. Near [[Hiattville, Kansas|Hiattville]], it intersects [[K-39 (Kansas highway)|K-39]] and turns east, then northeast. Five miles south of [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]], K-7 intersects US-69 at a freeway interchange, and K-7 overlaps with US-69 into Fort Scott.\n\n===Fort Scott to Olathe===\n[[File:US 54 in Fort Scott, Kansas.jpg|thumb|right|View of US-54 east from under US-69 / K-7 overpass, showing sign for northbound K-7 on-ramp]]\nWhile in Fort Scott, K-7 and US-69 intersect [[U.S. Route 54 in Kansas|US-54]] and K-7 overlaps with US-54 west for four miles (6&nbsp;km). It then turns north again, and alternates between going north and going west before entering [[Devon, Kansas|Devon]]. It continues north to [[K-31 (Kansas highway)|K-31]], with which it overlaps for a mile going east. It then turns north and goes through [[Mound City, Kansas|Mound City]], intersecting [[K-52 (Kansas highway)|K-52]] there. It goes north-northwesterly for {{convert|16|mi|km}} and intersects [[K-152 (Kansas highway)|K-152]] east of [[Parker, Kansas|Parker]]. It goes north, then west for {{convert|9|mi|km}}, then at [[Beagle, Kansas|Beagle]], turns north and intersects [[U.S. Route 169 in Kansas|US-169]] south of [[Osawatomie, Kansas|Osawatomie]]. While overlapping US-169, it follows a freeway alignment that bypasses Osawatomie and [[Paola, Kansas|Paola]] before meeting [[K-68 (Kansas highway)|K-68]]. After K-68, the freeway bypasses [[Hillsdale, Kansas|Hillsdale]] and [[Spring Hill, Kansas|Spring Hill]] before turning into expressway. The overlap with US-169 ends at its intersection with [[Interstate 35 in Kansas|I-35]], [[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|US-50]] and [[U.S. Route 56 in Kansas|US-56]] at [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]].\n\n===Olathe to Leavenworth===\n[[File:K-7 (Kansas highway) northbound at junction with K-10.jpg|thumb|left|K-7 northbound at interchange with K-10]]\nIn Olathe, K-7 alternates between northbound and westbound routings before turning north and becoming freeway. On the border between Olathe and [[Lenexa, Kansas|Lenexa]], K-7 intersects the [[K-10 (Kansas highway)|K-10]] freeway. It continues north, then turns northwest to cross the [[Kansas River]] and enter [[Bonner Springs, Kansas|Bonner Springs]], where it immediately intersects [[K-32 (Kansas highway)|K-32]]. It turns north to intersect [[Interstate 70 in Kansas|I-70]], the [[Kansas Turnpike]], then turns northwest to intersect [[U.S. Route 24 in Kansas|US-24]], [[U.S. Route 40 in Kansas|US-40]], and [[U.S. Route 73 in Kansas|US-73]]. At this point, which is on the border between Bonner Springs and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], an overlap with US-73 begins. K-7 and US-73 then go north along the western city limits of Kansas City before entering [[Lansing, Kansas|Lansing]]. They continue north through Lansing and upon entering [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]], intersect [[K-5 (Kansas highway)|K-5]]. Also in Leavenworth, they intersect [[K-92 (Kansas highway)|K-92]] and they briefly run concurrent with K-92 before separating and turning west to leave Leavenworth.\n\n===Leavenworth to Nebraska===\nK-7 and US-73 leave Leavenworth going west until intersecting [[K-192 (Kansas highway)|K-192]], then turn north, intersecting [[K-74 (Kansas highway)|K-74]] near [[Potter, Kansas|Potter]]. At [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], K-7's overlap with US-73 ends at its intersection with [[U.S. Route 59 in Kansas|US-59]]. After winding its way through Atchison, K-7 continues north and intersects [[K-20 (Kansas highway)|K-20]] near [[Bendena, Kansas|Bendena]] and [[U.S. Route 36 in Kansas|US-36]] west of [[Troy, Kansas|Troy]]. The highway turns northwest along an alignment closely parallelling the [[Missouri River]] and after passing through [[White Cloud, Kansas|White Cloud]], ends at the Nebraska border northwest of White Cloud. No corresponding state highway in Nebraska continues from K-7, although a county road continues northwest to [[Rulo, Nebraska]].\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nK-7 is one of the original State Highways that was designated in 1927 and at that time extended from the Oklahoma border to US-40 and US-73E west of Kansas City.<ref name=1927rm/> Then by 1936 K-7 had been extended north to US-36 in Troy and US-73E was renumbered as US-73 and truncated to US-40 and US-24 west of Kansas City.

The cathedral site has been home to a church for over a thousand years and the first stone church was built there in [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] times.\n\n==History==\nWith the creation of the [[Diocese of Blackburn]] in 1926 (taken from the [[Anglican Diocese of Manchester|Diocese of Manchester]]) the impressive parish church of St Mary the Virgin was raised to [[cathedra]]l status.

By 1938, enough money had been raised and work began on enlarging the new cathedral. Although work was interrupted by [[World War II|the war]], it was resumed afterwards and continued through the 1950s and into the early 1960s. After the death of architect W.A. Forsyth in 1950, architect Laurence King joined the project and designed the distinctive [[lantern tower]]. The lantern tower, which consists of 56 different panes of coloured glass, with a [[Modern architecture|modernist]] slender [[aluminium]] spire, was completed in 1967.\n\nThe cathedral was finally completed in 1977 and what had been built over the past decades was finally consecrated as Blackburn Cathedral that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scalapublishers.com/title.aspx?category=&subcategory=&id=3603 |title=Blackburn Cathedral &#124; Scala |publisher=Scalapublishers.com |date= |accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe North transept contains eight [[misericords]] dating from the 15th century. It is not known at what time they arrived at the Cathedral, but they are believed to have originated at [[Whalley Abbey]]. This could mean that they were removed to a builder's yard after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution]], but with the cathedral not being built until the 19th century, this allows for the possibility that they had lain unused for some 300 years.\n\nOn 17 April 2014 the Cathedral hosted the [[Royal Maundy]] service. In keeping with tradition, [[Elizabeth II]] handed out [[Royal Maundy#Maundy coinage|Maundy money]] to 88 men and 88 women. It was the Queen's first visit to the Cathedral.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-27052583 |title=Maundy Thursday: Queen hands out money at Blackburn Cathedral - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Dean and chapter==\n[[File:Blackburn Cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|The exterior, with the rebuilt lantern tower and distinctive aluminium spire]]\nAs of 21 December 2018:<ref>[http://www.blackburncathedral.com/about-the-cathedral/whos-who/ Blackburn Cathedral \u2014 Who's Who] (Accessed 21 December 2018)</ref>\n*[[Dean of Blackburn|Dean]] \u2014 [[Peter Howell-Jones]] (since 25 March 2017 installation)\n*Vice Dean & Canon Missioner \u2014 [[Rowena Pailing]] (since 5 May 2018 installation)<ref>https://www.blackburncathedral.com/event/evening-prayer-2018-05-05/</ref>\n*[[Bishop of Burnley]] and Residentiary Canon \u2014 [[Philip North]] (Acting Dean, June 2016{{snd}}March 2017; residentiary canon since 2016/17)\n*Co-ordinating Chaplain, [[East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust|East Lancs Hospitals]] and Residentiary Canon \u2014 [[Andrew Horsfall]] (canon since 13 March 2016 installation)<ref>[http://www.elht.nhs.uk/news/Welcoming-Spring-Chief-Executive-Blog.htm East Lancashire Hospitals \u2014 Welcoming Spring] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120065815/http://www.elht.nhs.uk/news/Welcoming-Spring-Chief-Executive-Blog.htm |date=20 January 2018 }} (Accessed 19 January 2018)</ref>\n*Canon [[Sacristan|Sacrist]] \u2014 [[Andrew Hindley]] (since 1996) (though currently suspended owing to a safeguarding issue)<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/6252041.stm BBC News \u2014 Canon suspended after complaint] (Accessed 5 January 2013)</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe Organist and Director of Music is [[John Robinson (church musician)|John Robinson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackburncathedral.com/levels.asp?level_id=192 |title=Director of Music |publisher=Blackburncathedral.com |accessdate=6 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709083335/http://www.blackburncathedral.com/levels.asp?level_id=192 |archive-date=9 July 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the Assistant Director of Music is Shaun Turnbull.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackburncathedral.com/levels.asp?level_id=211 |title=Shaun Turnbull |publisher=Blackburncathedral.com |accessdate=6 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708152303/http://www.blackburncathedral.com/levels.asp?level_id=211 |archive-date=8 July 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Choir===\nThe cathedral has seven choirs&nbsp;\u2014 Cathedral Choir of Boys and Men, Girls, Children's, Lantern Voices, YPC (Young Peoples' Choir), Renaissance Singers (Formally the Bach Choir) and Cathedral Consort (alternate Thursday Evensongs). On Sundays the Parish Communion is sung by the YPC and the Eucharist and Evensong by the Cathedral Choir (Boys and Men).\n\n===Organ===\nA scheme for an organ in the west gallery was submitted, by John Gray and partner Frederick Davison, two years before the consecration of the new church. The organ was opened on 28 February 1828 with a concert which included works by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] - extracts from his ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[Israel in Egypt]]'' and his ''Occasional Overture'' played by the new organist Joseph John Harris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackburncathedral.com/UserFiles/File/The%20Organs%20of%20Blackburn%20Cathedral.pdf |title=The Organs of Blackburn Cathedral |author=John Bertalot and Richard Tanner |publisher=blackburncathedral.com/ |accessdate=19 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225200920/http://www.blackburncathedral.com/UserFiles/File/The%20Organs%20of%20Blackburn%20Cathedral.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nBlackburn Cathedral is blessed with a world-class Organ, built by JW Walker and rebuilt by Wood of Huddersfield. This is not only showcased to great effect through its use as an inspirational liturgical instrument, but also through the many recordings that have been made and in the regular lunchtime concerts and organ meditations that have taken place throughout the year.<ref>http://www.blackburncathedral.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Organs-of-Blackburn-Cathedral.pdf</ref>\n\n===Organists===\n{{See also|List of musicians at English cathedrals}}\nSince 2019 the organist and director of music has been [[John Robinson (church musician)|John Robinson]]. Previous organists have included [[Richard Henry Coleman]], [[Charles Hylton Stewart]], [[Herman Brearley]], [[Thomas Lucas Duerden]], [[John Bertalot]], [[David Anthony Cooper]], [[Gordon Stewart (organist)|Gordon Stewart]] and Richard Tanner.\n\n==Recent developments==\nIn 1998 the lantern tower underwent restoration, being rebuilt in natural stone. The original 1960s tower had been constructed in concrete. The windows were also replaced.\n\nFurther work was carried out in 2000\u201301 to re-build the east end roofs and parapets and blend them into the existing structures. Upon completion of this work the cathedral was finally deemed to be finished after over 70 years of construction.\n\t\nAs well as this rebuilding a new piece of art was commissioned for the exterior of the building. The sculpture by Mark Jalland, ''The Healing of The Nations'', measuring {{convert|35x26|feet|m}}, is an abstract steel and copper circular piece containing thousands of interwoven [[fibre optics]] that create ever-changing patterns of light at night. It is deemed by many to be one of the most innovative pieces of modern sculpture at any English cathedral.\n\nIn 2009 the flagpole on the tower was renewed and topped with an ornate [[Mitre|bishop's mitre]] [[finial]] painted and gilded in [[gold leaf]] by Mark Bridges of Sussex and bearing the [[Red Rose of Lancaster|Lancashire Rose]] emblem<ref>[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/4668204.New_ornate_mitre_tops_off_tower_at_Blackburn_Cathedral/?action=complain&cid=8024084 \"New ornate mitre tops off tower at Blackburn Cathedral\" at ancashiretelegraph.co.uk/]</ref>\n\nThe cathedral still forms an important part of the community. It is open to visitors and has a gift shop and caf\u00e9 as well as hosting numerous events. In February 2011 the Cathedral exhibited the [[Quaker Tapestry]] from Kendal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.visitlancashire.com/site/whats-on/search/quaker-tapestry-exhibition-p606840#ProductList-/site/whats-on/search/quaker-tapestry-exhibition-p606840 |title=Quaker Tapestry Exhibition at visitlancashire.com |access-date=16 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717215624/http://www.visitlancashire.com/site/whats-on/search/quaker-tapestry-exhibition-p606840#ProductList-/site/whats-on/search/quaker-tapestry-exhibition-p606840 |archive-date=17 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral Nave.jpg|The Nave, looking east\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral Nave 2, Blackburn, Lancashire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The Nave, looking west\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral Sanctuary, Blackburn, Lancashire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The Sanctuary\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral Organ, Blackburn, Lancashire, UK - Diliff.jpg|View of Transept and Sanctuary, showing the organ\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral 05.JPG|Interior view of the Lantern\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral 03.JPG|East end: [[Rood]] by [[Advent Hunstone]], seen beyond the hanging corona by John Hayward\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral 09.JPG|West end: ''Worker Christ'' by John Hayward\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral - Mark Jalland sculpture.jpg|Sculpture: ''The Healing of The Nations'' by Mark Jalland\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral.jpg|The tower, 2011\nFile:Blackburn cathedral interior.jpg|Part of the ceiling in the South [[transept]]\nFile:Misericord in Blackburn Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1357427.jpg|One of the misericords\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Listed buildings in Blackburn]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{cite book |author=Canon Chris Chivers |title= Blackburn Cathedral |publisher=Scala Arts Publishers |year= |isbn=978-1-85759-645-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Blackburn Cathedral}}\n*[http://www.blackburncathedral.com/ Blackburn Cathedral Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110213033203/http://www.simonet.com/pages/cathedral/index.php A church was first recorded on this site in AD596]\n\n{{Provosts and Deans of Blackburn}}\n{{Cathedrals of the Church of England}}\n{{Lancashire churches}}\n{{Blackburn with Darwen buildings}}\n{{Blackburn with Darwen culture}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Anglican cathedrals in England|Blackburn]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Blackburn|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Church of England church buildings in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Blackburn|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Diocese of Blackburn|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Provosts and Deans of Blackburn|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Grade II* listed cathedrals]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2015}}\n{{Infobox church\n| denomination           = [[Church of England]]\n| name                   = Blackburn Cathedral\n| fullname               = Cathedral Church of<br />St Mary the Virgin with St Paul\n| image                  = Blackburn Cathedral from the northwest 2.jpg\n| imagesize              = \n| imagealt               = \n| caption                = The Cathedral from the west\n| pushpin map            = United Kingdom Blackburn central\n| pushpin label position = \n| pushpin map alt        = \n| pushpin mapsize        = \n| map caption            = Shown within Blackburn town centre\n| coordinates            = {{coord|53.7473|-2.4813|region:GB|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| country                = United Kingdom\n\n| osgridref              = <!-- {{gbmappingsmall|TEXT}} -->\n| osgraw                 = <!-- TEXT -->\n| location               = Blackburn, Lancashire\n| tradition              = \n| membership             = \n| website                = [http://www.blackburncathedral.com/ www.blackburncathedral.com/]\n| former name            = \n| bull date              = \n| consecrated date       = 1977\n| people                 = \n| status                 = \n| functional status      = \n| heritage designation   = \n| designated date        = \n| previous cathedrals    = \n| architect              = John Palmer <br /> W.A.

This could mean that they were removed to a builder's yard after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution]], but with the cathedral not being built until the 19th century, this allows for the possibility that they had lain unused for some 300 years.\n\nOn 17 April 2014 the Cathedral hosted the [[Royal Maundy]] service. In keeping with tradition, [[Elizabeth II]] handed out [[Royal Maundy#Maundy coinage|Maundy money]] to 88 men and 88 women. It was the Queen's first visit to the Cathedral.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-27052583 |title=Maundy Thursday: Queen hands out money at Blackburn Cathedral - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Dean and chapter==\n[[File:Blackburn Cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|The exterior, with the rebuilt lantern tower and distinctive aluminium spire]]\nAs of 21 December 2018:<ref>[http://www.blackburncathedral.com/about-the-cathedral/whos-who/ Blackburn Cathedral \u2014 Who's Who] (Accessed 21 December 2018)</ref>\n*[[Dean of Blackburn|Dean]] \u2014 [[Peter Howell-Jones]] (since 25 March 2017 installation)\n*Vice Dean & Canon Missioner \u2014 [[Rowena Pailing]] (since 5 May 2018 installation)<ref>https://www.blackburncathedral.com/event/evening-prayer-2018-05-05/</ref>\n*[[Bishop of Burnley]] and Residentiary Canon \u2014 [[Philip North]] (Acting Dean, June 2016{{snd}}March 2017; residentiary canon since 2016/17)\n*Co-ordinating Chaplain, [[East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust|East Lancs Hospitals]] and Residentiary Canon \u2014 [[Andrew Horsfall]] (canon since 13 March 2016 installation)<ref>[http://www.elht.nhs.uk/news/Welcoming-Spring-Chief-Executive-Blog.htm East Lancashire Hospitals \u2014 Welcoming Spring] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120065815/http://www.elht.nhs.uk/news/Welcoming-Spring-Chief-Executive-Blog.htm |date=20 January 2018 }} (Accessed 19 January 2018)</ref>\n*Canon [[Sacristan|Sacrist]] \u2014 [[Andrew Hindley]] (since 1996) (though currently suspended owing to a safeguarding issue)<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/6252041.stm BBC News \u2014 Canon suspended after complaint] (Accessed 5 January 2013)</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe Organist and Director of Music is [[John Robinson (church musician)|John Robinson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackburncathedral.com/levels.asp?level_id=192 |title=Director of Music |publisher=Blackburncathedral.com |accessdate=6 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709083335/http://www.blackburncathedral.com/levels.asp?level_id=192 |archive-date=9 July 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the Assistant Director of Music is Shaun Turnbull.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackburncathedral.com/levels.asp?level_id=211 |title=Shaun Turnbull |publisher=Blackburncathedral.com |accessdate=6 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708152303/http://www.blackburncathedral.com/levels.asp?level_id=211 |archive-date=8 July 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Choir===\nThe cathedral has seven choirs&nbsp;\u2014 Cathedral Choir of Boys and Men, Girls, Children's, Lantern Voices, YPC (Young Peoples' Choir), Renaissance Singers (Formally the Bach Choir) and Cathedral Consort (alternate Thursday Evensongs).

The organ was opened on 28 February 1828 with a concert which included works by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] - extracts from his ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[Israel in Egypt]]'' and his ''Occasional Overture'' played by the new organist Joseph John Harris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackburncathedral.com/UserFiles/File/The%20Organs%20of%20Blackburn%20Cathedral.pdf |title=The Organs of Blackburn Cathedral |author=John Bertalot and Richard Tanner |publisher=blackburncathedral.com/ |accessdate=19 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225200920/http://www.blackburncathedral.com/UserFiles/File/The%20Organs%20of%20Blackburn%20Cathedral.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nBlackburn Cathedral is blessed with a world-class Organ, built by JW Walker and rebuilt by Wood of Huddersfield. This is not only showcased to great effect through its use as an inspirational liturgical instrument, but also through the many recordings that have been made and in the regular lunchtime concerts and organ meditations that have taken place throughout the year.<ref>http://www.blackburncathedral.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Organs-of-Blackburn-Cathedral.pdf</ref>\n\n===Organists===\n{{See also|List of musicians at English cathedrals}}\nSince 2019 the organist and director of music has been [[John Robinson (church musician)|John Robinson]]. Previous organists have included [[Richard Henry Coleman]], [[Charles Hylton Stewart]], [[Herman Brearley]], [[Thomas Lucas Duerden]], [[John Bertalot]], [[David Anthony Cooper]], [[Gordon Stewart (organist)|Gordon Stewart]] and Richard Tanner.\n\n==Recent developments==\nIn 1998 the lantern tower underwent restoration, being rebuilt in natural stone. The original 1960s tower had been constructed in concrete. The windows were also replaced.\n\nFurther work was carried out in 2000\u201301 to re-build the east end roofs and parapets and blend them into the existing structures. Upon completion of this work the cathedral was finally deemed to be finished after over 70 years of construction.\n\t\nAs well as this rebuilding a new piece of art was commissioned for the exterior of the building. The sculpture by Mark Jalland, ''The Healing of The Nations'', measuring {{convert|35x26|feet|m}}, is an abstract steel and copper circular piece containing thousands of interwoven [[fibre optics]] that create ever-changing patterns of light at night. It is deemed by many to be one of the most innovative pieces of modern sculpture at any English cathedral.\n\nIn 2009 the flagpole on the tower was renewed and topped with an ornate [[Mitre|bishop's mitre]] [[finial]] painted and gilded in [[gold leaf]] by Mark Bridges of Sussex and bearing the [[Red Rose of Lancaster|Lancashire Rose]] emblem<ref>[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/4668204.New_ornate_mitre_tops_off_tower_at_Blackburn_Cathedral/?action=complain&cid=8024084 \"New ornate mitre tops off tower at Blackburn Cathedral\" at ancashiretelegraph.co.uk/]</ref>\n\nThe cathedral still forms an important part of the community. It is open to visitors and has a gift shop and caf\u00e9 as well as hosting numerous events. In February 2011 the Cathedral exhibited the [[Quaker Tapestry]] from Kendal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.visitlancashire.com/site/whats-on/search/quaker-tapestry-exhibition-p606840#ProductList-/site/whats-on/search/quaker-tapestry-exhibition-p606840 |title=Quaker Tapestry Exhibition at visitlancashire.com |access-date=16 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717215624/http://www.visitlancashire.com/site/whats-on/search/quaker-tapestry-exhibition-p606840#ProductList-/site/whats-on/search/quaker-tapestry-exhibition-p606840 |archive-date=17 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral Nave.jpg|The Nave, looking east\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral Nave 2, Blackburn, Lancashire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The Nave, looking west\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral Sanctuary, Blackburn, Lancashire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The Sanctuary\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral Organ, Blackburn, Lancashire, UK - Diliff.jpg|View of Transept and Sanctuary, showing the organ\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral 05.JPG|Interior view of the Lantern\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral 03.JPG|East end: [[Rood]] by [[Advent Hunstone]], seen beyond the hanging corona by John Hayward\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral 09.JPG|West end: ''Worker Christ'' by John Hayward\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral - Mark Jalland sculpture.jpg|Sculpture: ''The Healing of The Nations'' by Mark Jalland\nFile:Blackburn Cathedral.jpg|The tower, 2011\nFile:Blackburn cathedral interior.jpg|Part of the ceiling in the South [[transept]]\nFile:Misericord in Blackburn Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1357427.jpg|One of the misericords\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Listed buildings in Blackburn]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{cite book |author=Canon Chris Chivers |title= Blackburn Cathedral |publisher=Scala Arts Publishers |year= |isbn=978-1-85759-645-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Blackburn Cathedral}}\n*[http://www.blackburncathedral.com/ Blackburn Cathedral Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110213033203/http://www.simonet.com/pages/cathedral/index.php A church was first recorded on this site in AD596]\n\n{{Provosts and Deans of Blackburn}}\n{{Cathedrals of the Church of England}}\n{{Lancashire churches}}\n{{Blackburn with Darwen buildings}}\n{{Blackburn with Darwen culture}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Anglican cathedrals in England|Blackburn]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Blackburn|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Church of England church buildings in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Blackburn|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Diocese of Blackburn|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Provosts and Deans of Blackburn|Cathedral]]\n[[Category:Grade II* listed cathedrals]]\n", "name_user": "L17CP", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Cathedral"}
