The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8\u201312&nbsp;inches (20\u201330&nbsp;cm), lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of [[Mustard (condiment)#Yellow mustard|yellow mustard]] is spread on the bread. Then sliced [[roast]] [[pork]], [[glazed ham]], [[Swiss cheese (North America)|Swiss cheese]], and thinly sliced [[dill pickle]]s are added in layers. Sometimes the pork is marinated in [[mojo (sauce)|mojo]] and slow roasted.<ref name=\"GreatSandwich\" />\n\nThe main regional disagreement about the sandwich\u2019s recipe is whether or not to include salami. In Tampa, [[Genoa salami]] is traditionally layered with the other meats, probably due to the influence of [[Italian Americans|Italian immigrants]] who lived side-by-side with Cubans and [[Spanish-Americans|Spaniards]] in Ybor City.<ref name=\"OttoCubanTampa\" /><ref name=\"ThreeGuysSandwich\" /><ref name=\"TobinEachOwn\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/18/TampaBay/To_each__his_own_sand.shtml |title=To each, his own sandwich |last=Thomas C.

Tens of thousands of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian workers moved to the area over following decades, jumpstarting the growth of Tampa from a village to a bustling city. The first recorded mentions of a distinct Cuban sandwich survive in descriptions of workers' caf\u00e9s in [[History of Ybor City|Ybor City]] and nearby [[West Tampa]] from around 1900, leading other historians to theorize that the sandwich as now constituted first appeared there.<ref name=\"OttoCubanTampa\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGBQAS0758F.html |title=Cuban Is Ours, Any Way You Try To Slice It |last=Otto |first=Steve |date=24 October 2007 |publisher=The Tampa Tribune |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507190125/http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGBQAS0758F.html |archive-date=7 May 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"BreadMaker\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bread-maker.net/Bread-Types/Cuban-Bread.htm |title=Cuban Bread: A History |website=Bread-Maker website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224091847/http://www.bread-maker.net/Bread-Types/Cuban-Bread.htm |archive-date=2008-12-24 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"KennedyViva\">{{Cite web |url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A1907 |title=Viva El Cubano |last=Sara Kennedy |date=14 August 2002 |website=Creative Loafing Tampa}}</ref><ref>[http://www2.tbo.com/lifestyles/flavor/2010/jun/03/cuban-sandwiches-feed-history-lovers-ar-37914/ \"Tampa history is traced in its sandwich\" - The Tampa Tribune]</ref><ref name=\"FernandezSearchSandwich\" /> A travel article published by the ''[[Globe Gazette|Mason City Globe Gazette]]'' in 1934 said that Tampa's cooking was \"much more distinctive than elsewhere in the state\" and lists Cuban sandwiches (along with Cuban bread) among the city's \"signature foods\".<ref name=\"News1934\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/38188214 |title=Jeannette Beyer Discovers Many Charms of Florida |last=Beyer, Jeanette |date=18 October 1934 |work=Mason City Globe Gazette |access-date=9 September 2016}}</ref> Researcher Andrew Huse states that \"the old 'mixtos' coalesced into something more distinct \u2013 the Cuban sandwiches we know and love \u2013 an original Tampa creation.\"<ref name=\"HuseSandwichCity\" />\n \nBy the 1960s, Cuban sandwiches were also common on Miami [[cafeteria]] and restaurant menus, as the city had gained a large influx of Cuban residents after [[Fidel Castro|Fidel Castro's]] 1959 [[Cuban Revolution|rise to power]] in their native land.<ref name=\"FernandezSearchSandwich\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.landlmarketbistro.com/i/events/Herald_Tropical_Life_08-2007_article.pdf |title=Our search for a good Cuban sandwich takes a surprising turn |last=Enrique Fernandez |date=9 August 2007 |website=[[The Miami Herald]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731030814/http://www.landlmarketbistro.com/i/events/Herald_Tropical_Life_08-2007_article.pdf |archive-date=2009-07-31 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Communist Revolution caused a wave of Cuban expatriates to settle in other locations as well, and they brought their culture and cuisine with them.

The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8\u201312&nbsp;inches (20\u201330&nbsp;cm), lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of [[Mustard (condiment)#Yellow mustard|yellow mustard]] is spread on the bread. Then sliced [[roast]] [[pork]], [[glazed ham]], [[Swiss cheese]], and thinly sliced [[dill pickle]]s are added in layers. Sometimes the pork is marinated in [[mojo (sauce)|mojo]] and slow roasted.<ref name=\"GreatSandwich\" />\n\nThe main regional disagreement about the sandwich\u2019s recipe is whether or not to include salami. In Tampa, [[Genoa salami]] is traditionally layered with the other meats, probably due to the influence of [[Italian Americans|Italian immigrants]] who lived side-by-side with Cubans and [[Spanish-Americans|Spaniards]] in Ybor City.<ref name=\"OttoCubanTampa\" /><ref name=\"ThreeGuysSandwich\" /><ref name=\"TobinEachOwn\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/18/TampaBay/To_each__his_own_sand.shtml |title=To each, his own sandwich |last=Thomas C.
