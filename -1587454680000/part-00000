This scenario changed, however, when the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] arrived in India and started monopolizing and controlling trade on the western coast of the continent. Chhatrapati Shivaji realized the importance of a strong navy; the first keel of a  Maratha naval vessel was laid down in a creek near [[Kalyan]] circa 1654.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naravane|first1=M.

Around this time, the Maratha Navy's strength was around 5,000 men and 57 warships. During its expedition to [[Karwar]] (present-day [[Karnataka]]), the navy possessed around 85 assorted [[Gallivat (boat)|''Gallivats'']] (warboat) ranging from 30 to 150 tons and 3 three-masted [[Grab (ship)|''Gurabs/Grabs'']] (warship).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Jaswant|title=Defending India|publisher=MacMillan India Limited|isbn=978-0-333-93210-0|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0K_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=maratha+navy+portuguese+mercenaries&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=maratha%20navy%20portuguese%20mercenaries&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Maratha Navy under Sambhaji==\nMaratha Navy fought many battles during Sambhaji's reign.(1680-1689)\n\nIn the years 1678-79 Shivaji had started to build naval forts of Khanderi and Colaba near Mumbai to check the alliance between [[Siddis of Janjira]] and the British. The construction of these forts were incomplete at the time of Shivaji's death in April 1680. Sambhaji succeeded him and immediately completed the remaining construction on these forts. Sambhaji fortified these positions as his strongholds.\n\nThe Siddis of Janjira started to raid and pulverize Maratha villages in Konkan under the guidance of [[Aurangzeb]] in the year 1681. Aurangzeb had planned to surround Sambhaji's Maratha kingdom from all sides hence he ordered his subordinate Siddi to raid Maratha territories. Sambhaji was furious upon hearing this. But Sambhaji also knew the strategic importance of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] Fort. He wanted to capture Janjira to dominate trade in the Arabian Sea. Sambhaji decided to punish the Siddis and capture Janjira in late 1681. Sambhaji launched all an out amphibious siege on Janjira with 20,000 soldiers from army and navy. He was commanding the force personally. Sambhaji had planned to win the fort by deceiving Siddi. He had a sent a party led by senior Maratha Commander [[Kondaji Farzand]] to Siddi under the pretext of a fake quarrel with him. The real plan was that Kondaji and his men would explode the gunpowder storage on the fort causing great loss of soldiers, collapsing of the walls and panic so that the Maratha forces on shore will be able to attack and capture the shell shocked fort. However Siddi got to know about the plan from one of the female party members and he executed the party members along with Kondaji Farzand. Only two members of the party managed to make it back to shore to Sambhaji's camp. Sambhaji then launched a fierce attack on Janjira. Maratha artillery started to damage the fort walls. 300 ships of the Maratha navy were trying to attack the fort but the strong artillery of Siddis somehow managed to defend the fort. Both sides had suffered great losses and nobody was able to gain an upper hand. Sambhaji had maintained a constant pressure on Janjira and his artillery managed to inflict heavy damage to the fort walls. Maratha Navy had blockaded Janjira from three sides cutting of any supplies to the fort. Maratha forces started constructing a sea bridge from shoreline to the fort. The bridge had started to take shape. Siddis were caught in a dire situation and were battling a severe food shortage. The Siddis realised that if the same situation continues for a few days then Sambhaji will capture the fort. Hence they pleaded to Aurangzeb for help. Aurangzeb was well aware of the strategic importance of Janjira. He immediately sent his General Hasan Ali Khan to destroy [[Kalyan]] and [[Bhiwandi]] regions with a 35,000 strong force to divert Sambhaji's attack on Janjira. Hasan Ali Khan destroyed Kalyan and Bhiwandi was threatening to attack Raigad, the Maratha Capital. Sambhaji had almost captured Janjira but he was forced to retreat from Janjira to check Hasan Ali Khan's advance. In abscence of Sambhaji his naval commander Dadaji Raghunath Deshpande of Mahad took control of the siege. Sambhaji later on beat back Hasan Ali Khan to Ahmadnagar but Janjira was saved due to his advance on Kalyan-Bhiwandi. Nevertheless Sambhaji and Maratha navy managed to inflict severe losses on Siddis of Janjira and they never ventured against Marathas in rest of Sambhaji's reign. The political goal of Sambhaji to stop Siddis from helping Aurangzeb was achieved successfully, even though his military goal of capturing Janjira was not achieved.\n\nMughal sardars Rahullakhan and Ranmastakhan had captured Kalyan and Bhiwandi in the year 1682. They destroyed the Durgadi fort near Kalyan. Sambhaji immediately wanted to capture the cities back and arrived in the region quickly. He immediately ordered the construction of [[Parsik Hill|Parsik fort]]\ufffc at the Parsik hill overlooking the [[Thane Creek|Thane creek]] as the British ships were using the Thane Creek to supply the enemies. Sambhaji ordered his forces at Parsik to bombard any British supply ships crossing the Thane creek. Sambhaji later on defeated Rahullakhan and Ranmastakhan in the [[Battle of Kalyan-Dombivali]] and recaptured Kalyan and Bhiwandi. He immediately ordered repairs of the [[Durgadi Fort|Durgadi fort]] at Kalyan. Kalyan was an important naval base for Marathas.\n\nIn the year 1682 the Marathas defeated the Portuguese in many small battles along the Konkan coastline. Capturing Tarapur, and several other positions. Sambhaji was well aware of the strategic importance of  Goa. Sambhaji wanted to build a fort on [[Anjediva Island|Anjadiva island]] off the coast of Karnataka in order to block Portuguese naval activity in the Goa region. His forces from the Karwar region landed on the island with construction material to construct the fort. When Portuguese got the news they reached the island and ousted the Marathas. Sambhaji later on inflicted a crushing defeat on Portuguese in his Goa campaign of 1683. After this defeat, The Portuguese did not fight against the Marathas in rest of Sambhaji's reign.\n\nIn late 1683 Aurangzeb's had sent his son [[Bahadur Shah I|Muazzam]] to with a force of 1,00,000 troops, thousands of camels, elephants and horses to save the Portuguese from Sambhaji's fierce attack on Goa. He ordered him to descend via the Ramdara Ghat into Goa to help the Portuguese. Muazzam's primary objective was to attack Maratha territories in Konkan from the South. Aurangzeb ordered his navy at Surat to supply Muazzam's huge force in Goa. Maratha navy raided these supply ships and managed to capture a large portion of these supplies. This created a huge food shortage in Muazzam's forces. Consequently Muazzam's army had to retreat because of starvation, disease and constant guirella attacks by Maratha army.\n\nMaratha navy reportedly raided [[Bharuch]], an important trading center in Gujarat in 1687.\n\nSambhaji had purchased [[Elephanta Island|Elephanta island]] to check the influence of British near Mumbai. \n\nSambhaji wanted to modernize Maratha Navy. Hence he allied with the Arab Naval commander Jange Khan. Sambhaji invited him to Konkan to train the Maratha navy in quick ship building and usage of artillery. Jange Khan accepted the offer and stayed with his troops in Konkan for six months in 1681. His men trained the Maratha Navy in various aspects of shipbuilding and artillery usage.\n\nSambhaji died in the year 1689. In his nine year reign the Maratha Navy had increased in size. He continued Shivaji's policies to strengthen the navy. During his reign the Maratha navy firmly held the control of coastline from [[Tarapur, Maharashtra|Tarapur]] In North Konkan to [[Karwar]] in North Karnataka barring the regions of Mumbai, Janjira and Goa. He was well aware of importance of naval warfare and navy. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Indrajit|title=Marathyanche Swatantrayuddha Bhag - 1\nChhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Patil|first=Vishwas|title=Sambhaji|publisher=Mehta Publishing House|year=2016|isbn=9788177666519|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Shivaji|title=Chhava|publisher=Continental Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Jadhav|first=Namdevrao|title=Khara Sambhaji|publisher=Rajamata Prakashan|year=2014|isbn=978-8191098037|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref>.\n\n\n==Under Admiral Kanhoji Angre==\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg |thumb|right|A portrait of Admiral Kanhoji Angre]]\nAfter the death of [[Admiral]] Sidhoji Gujar around 1698, the Maratha Navy survived because of the extensive efforts of [[Koli People|Koli]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/opinion/as-nda-cadet-i-was-witness-to-vice-admiral-awatis-kindness/145378/|title=As NDA cadet, I was witness to Vice Admiral Awati\u2019s kindness|last=LT GEN K.

Kanhoji owed allegiance to  supreme Maratha ruler [[Chhatrapati Shahu]] and his first minister [[Balaji Vishwanath|Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath]]. He gained their support to develop naval facilities on the western coast of India, or  [[Konkan]]. Under the leadership of Kanhoji, the Maratha developed a naval base at ''[[Vijaydurg Port|Vijayadurg]]'' featuring dockyard facilities for building vessels, mounting guns, and making the ships sea-worthy. Their naval fleet consisted of ten [[grab (ship)|''gurabs/grabs'']] (warship) and fifty [[gallivat (boat)|''gallivats'']] (warboat). A gallivat had a displacement lower than 120 tons, while a grab could go as high as 400 tons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sridharan|first1=K|title=Sea: Our Saviour|publisher=New Age International (P) Ltd.|pages=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9PiwJF7V4EQC&pg=PA43&dq=kanhoji+angre&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=kanhoji%20angre&f=false}}</ref> \n\nAnother ship type used was the ''Pal'' (Maratha [[Man-of-war]]), which was a cannon-armed, three-masted vessel. The grabs had broadsides of 6- and 9-pounder guns, and carried two 9- or 12-pounders on their main decks. These guns pointed forward through port-holes cut in the bulkheads. The gallivats were mostly armed with light swivel guns, but some also mounted six or eight cannons, either 2- or 4-pounders. These boats were propelled by forty to fifty oars.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bombay Gazetteer, Volume 11|publisher=Bombay (India : State)|pages=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKJg1dQsk7oC&pg=PA147&dq=kanhoji+Angre+guns+boat+vijaydurg&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=kanhoji%20Angre%20guns%20boat%20vijaydurg&f=false}}</ref> Even during the reign of Kanhoji Angre, the Maratha Government signed a treaty of friendship with the Portuguese in 1703. As per the treaty, the Portuguese agreed to supply [[cannon]] and [[gunpowder]] to the Maratha, supplies which they needed as they had only a few cannon [[Foundry|foundries]] producing their own armaments. The Marathas signed a treaty with the Siddi as well, thus concentrating all their forces against the English East India Company.\n\nBy the beginning of the 18th century, Kanhoji Angre controlled the entire coastline from [[Sawantwadi]] to [[Mumbai]], which is the entire coastline of present-day [[Maharashtra]]. He built [[fortification]]s on almost all creeks, cove, and harbours, such as a fortress or [[citadel]] with navigational facilities. Any ship sailing through Maratha territorial waters was to pay a levy called ''Chouth'', which expressed Angre's dominance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sridharan|first1=K|title=Sea: Our Saviour|publisher=New Age International (P) Ltd.|pages=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9PiwJF7V4EQC&pg=PA43&dq=kanhoji+angre&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=kanhoji%20angre&f=false}}</ref> Between 1717 and 1720, the British made at least two attempts to defeat and destabilize the Maratha Navy, but were unsuccessful. In response to a British ship being captured by Kanhoji's seamen, the British attacked Vijayadurg and Khanderi, but they did not defeat them. The Maratha Navy repeatedly proved its strength against foreign powers. Till his death in 1729, Angre remained undefeated, despite repeated attacks by British and Portuguese. \n[[File:Sindhudurg Fort West wall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sindhudurg Fort]] near the [[Maharashtra]]-[[Goa]] border, one of the several [[Sea fort|naval fortifications]] built by the Maratha Navy]]\n\n==Limitations==\nThe Maratha Navy was primarily a coastal \"green water\" navy, compared to an ocean-going or \"blue water\" navy.

The Peshwas (under [[Balaji Baji Rao|Nanasaheb]]) (in concert with the British) engaged in a war against Tulaji, in which the British managed to get an opportunity to burn and destroy a portion of the Maratha naval fleet. The Peshwas tried to reconfigure and re-establish the navy under the leadership of the ''Dhulap family'', but the Navy could never regain its past glory.

This scenario changed, however, when the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] arrived in India and started monopolizing and controlling trade on the western coast of the continent. Chhatrapati Shivaji realized the importance of a strong navy; the first keel of a  Maratha naval vessel was laid down in a creek near [[Kalyan]] circa 1654.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naravane|first1=M.

During its expedition to [[Karwar]] (present-day [[Karnataka]]), the navy possessed around 85 assorted [[Gallivat (boat)|''Gallivats'']] (warboat) ranging from 30 to 150 tons and 3 three-masted [[Grab (ship)|''Gurabs/Grabs'']] (warship).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Jaswant|title=Defending India|publisher=MacMillan India Limited|isbn=978-0-333-93210-0|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0K_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=maratha+navy+portuguese+mercenaries&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=maratha%20navy%20portuguese%20mercenaries&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Maratha Navy under Sambhaji==\nMaratha Navy fought many battles during Sambhaji's reign.(1680-1689)\n\nIn the years 1678-79 Shivaji had started to build forts of Khanderi and Colaba near Mumbai to check the alliance between [[Siddis of Janjira]] and the British. \ufffcThese forts were incomplete at the time of Shivaji's death in April 1680. Sambhaji succeeded him and immediately completed the remaining construction on these forts. Sambhaji fortified these positions as his strongholds.\n\nThe Siddis of Janjira started to raid and pulverize Maratha villages in Konkan under the guidance of [[Aurangzeb]] in the year 1681. Aurangzeb had planned to surround Sambhaji's Maratha kingdom from all sides hence he ordered his subordinate Siddi to raid Maratha territories. Sambhaji was furious upon hearing this. But Sambhaji also knew the strategic importance of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] Fort. He wanted to capture Janjira to dominate trade in the Arabian Sea. Sambhaji decided to punish the Siddis and capture Janjira in late 1681. Sambhaji launched all an out amphibious siege on Janjira with 20,000 soldiers from army and navy. He was commanding the force personally. Sambhaji had planned to win the fort by deceiving Siddi. He had a sent a party led by senior Maratha Commander [[Kondaji Farzand]] to Siddi under the pretext of a fake quarrel with him. The real plan was that Kondaji and his men would explode the gunpowder storage on the fort causing great loss of soldiers, collapsing of the walls and panic so that the Maratha forces on shore will be able to attack and capture the shell shocked fort. However Siddi got to know about the plan from one of the female party members and he executed the party members along with Kondaji Farzand. Only two members of the party managed to make it back to shore to Sambhaji's camp. Sambhaji then launched a fierce attack on Janjira. Maratha artillery started to damage the fort walls. 300 ships of the Maratha navy were trying to attack the fort but the strong artillery of Siddis somehow managed to defend the fort. Both sides had suffered great losses and nobody was able to gain an upper hand. Sambhaji had maintained a constant pressure on Janjira and his artillery managed to inflict heavy damage to the fort walls. Maratha Navy had blockaded Janjira from three sides cutting of any supplies to the fort. Maratha forces started constructing a sea bridge from shoreline to the fort. The bridge had started to take shape. Siddis were caught in a dire situation and were battling a severe food shortage. The Siddis realised that if the same situation continues for a few days then Sambhaji will capture the fort. Hence they pleaded to Aurangzeb for help. Aurangzeb was well aware of the strategic importance of Janjira. He immediately sent his General Hasan Ali Khan to destroy [[Kalyan]] and [[Bhiwandi]] regions with a 35,000 strong force to divert Sambhaji's attack on Janjira. Hasan Ali Khan destroyed Kalyan and Bhiwandi was threatening to attack Raigad, the Maratha Capital. Sambhaji had almost captured Janjira but he was forced to retreat from Janjira to check Hasan Ali Khan's advance. In abscence of Sambhaji his naval commander Dadaji Raghunath Deshpande of Mahad took control of the siege. Sambhaji later on beat back Hasan Ali Khan to Ahmadnagar but Janjira was saved due to his advance on Kalyan-Bhiwandi. Nevertheless Sambhaji and Maratha navy managed to inflict severe losses on Siddis of Janjira and they never ventured against Marathas in rest of Sambhaji's reign. The political goal of Sambhaji to stop Siddis from helping Aurangzeb was achieved successfully, even though his military goal of capturing Janjira was not achieved.\n\nMughal sardars Rahullakhan and Ranmastakhan had captured Kalyan and Bhiwandi in the year 1682. They destroyed the Durgadi fort near Kalyan. Sambhaji immediately wanted to capture the cities back and arrived in the region quickly. He immediately ordered the construction of [[Parsik Hill|Parsik fort]]\ufffc on Parsik hill overlooking the [[Thane Creek|Thane]] creek\ufffc\ufffc as the British ships were using the Thane Creek to supply the enemies. Sambhaji ordered his forces at Parsik to bombard any British supply ships crossing the Thane creek. Sambhaji later on defeated Rahullakhan and Ranmastakhan in the [[Battle of Kalyan-Dombivali]] and recaptured Kalyan and Bhiwandi. He immediately ordered repairs of the [[Durgadi Fort|Durgadi fort]] at Kalyan. Kalyan was an important naval base for Marathas.\n\nIn the year 1682 the Marathas defeated the Portuguese in many small battles along the Konkan coastline. Capturing Tarapur, and several other positions. Sambhaji was well aware of the strategic importance of  Goa. Sambhaji wanted to build a fort on [[Anjediva Island|Anjadiva island]] off the coast of Karnataka in order to block Portuguese naval activity in the Goa region. His forces from the Karwar region landed on the island with construction material to construct the fort. When Portuguese got the news they reached the island and ousted the Marathas. Sambhaji later on inflicted a crushing defeat on Portuguese in his Goa campaign of 1683. After this defeat, The Portuguese did not fight against the Marathas in rest of Sambhaji's reign.\n\nIn late 1683 Aurangzeb's had sent his son [[Bahadur Shah I|Muazzam]] to with a force of 1,00,000 troops, thousands of camels, elephants and horses to save the Portuguese from Sambhaji's fierce attack on Goa. He ordered him to descend via the Ramdara Ghat into Goa to help the Portuguese. Muazzam's primary objective was to attack Maratha territories in Konkan from the South. Aurangzeb ordered his navy at Surat to supply Muazzam's huge force in Goa. Maratha navy raided these supply ships and managed to capture a large portion of these supplies. This created a huge food shortage in Muazzam's forces. Consequently Muazzam's army had to retreat because of starvation, disease and constant guirella attacks by Maratha army.\n\nMaratha navy reportedly raided [[Bharuch]], an important trading center in Gujarat in 1687.\n\nSambhaji had purchased [[Elephanta Island|Elephanta island]] to check the influence of British near Mumbai. \n\nSambhaji wanted to modernize Maratha Navy. Hence he allied with the Arab Naval commander Jange Khan. Sambhaji invited him to Konkan to train the Maratha navy in quick ship building and usage of artillery.\ufffc Jange Khan accepted the offer and stayed with his troops in Konkan for six months in 1681. His men trained the Maratha Navy in various aspects of shipbuilding and artillery usage.\n\nSambhaji died in the year 1689. In his nine year reign the Maratha Navy had increased in size. He continued Shivaji's policies to strengthen the navy. During his reign the Maratha navy firmly held the control of coastline from [[Tarapur, Maharashtra|Tarapur]] In North Konkan to [[Karwar]] in North Karnataka barring the regions of Mumbai, Janjira and Goa. He was well aware of importance of naval warfare and navy. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Indrajit|title=Marathyanche Swatantrayuddha Bhag - 1\nChhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Patil|first=Vishwas|title=Sambhaji|publisher=Mehta Publishing House|year=2016|isbn=9788177666519|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sawant|first=Shivaji|title=Chhava|publisher=Continental Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Jadhav|first=Namdevrao|title=Khara Sambhaji|publisher=Rajamata Prakashan|year=2014|isbn=978-8191098037|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref>.\n\n\n==Under Admiral Kanhoji Angre==\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg |thumb|right|A portrait of Admiral Kanhoji Angre]]\nAfter the death of [[Admiral]] Sidhoji Gujar around 1698, the Maratha Navy survived because of the extensive efforts of [[Koli People|Koli]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/opinion/as-nda-cadet-i-was-witness-to-vice-admiral-awatis-kindness/145378/|title=As NDA cadet, I was witness to Vice Admiral Awati\u2019s kindness|last=LT GEN K.

He gained their support to develop naval facilities on the western coast of India, or  [[Konkan]]. Under the leadership of Kanhoji, the Maratha developed a naval base at ''[[Vijaydurg Port|Vijayadurg]]'' featuring dockyard facilities for building vessels, mounting guns, and making the ships sea-worthy. Their naval fleet consisted of ten [[grab (ship)|''gurabs/grabs'']] (warship) and fifty [[gallivat (boat)|''gallivats'']] (warboat).

The Marathas signed a treaty with the Siddi as well, thus concentrating all their forces against the English East India Company.\n\nBy the beginning of the 18th century, Kanhoji Angre controlled the entire coastline from [[Sawantwadi]] to [[Mumbai]], which is the entire coastline of present-day [[Maharashtra]]. He built [[fortification]]s on almost all creeks, cove, and harbours, such as a fortress or [[citadel]] with navigational facilities. Any ship sailing through Maratha territorial waters was to pay a levy called ''Chouth'', which expressed Angre's dominance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sridharan|first1=K|title=Sea: Our Saviour|publisher=New Age International (P) Ltd.|pages=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9PiwJF7V4EQC&pg=PA43&dq=kanhoji+angre&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=kanhoji%20angre&f=false}}</ref> Between 1717 and 1720, the British made at least two attempts to defeat and destabilize the Maratha Navy, but were unsuccessful. In response to a British ship being captured by Kanhoji's seamen, the British attacked Vijayadurg and Khanderi, but they did not defeat them. The Maratha Navy repeatedly proved its strength against foreign powers. Till his death in 1729, Angre remained undefeated, despite repeated attacks by British and Portuguese. \n[[File:Sindhudurg Fort West wall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sindhudurg Fort]] near the [[Maharashtra]]-[[Goa]] border, one of the several [[Sea fort|naval fortifications]] built by the Maratha Navy]]\n\n==Limitations==\nThe Maratha Navy was primarily a coastal \"green water\" navy, compared to an ocean-going or \"blue water\" navy.

Sixteen wrestlers have only achieved it once, seven under the original format and nine under the modern format, while five wrestlers have achieved the Grand Slam under both formats, three of whom automatically became modern Grand Slam champions at the introduction of the modern format (with the same titles they won while becoming original Grand Slam champions), and two who became modern Grand Slam champions after the modern format was introduced (with different titles won to complete both formats).\n\n==== List of WWE Grand Slam winners ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" colspan=\"2\" | Text\n|-\n| Dates in '''bold'''\n| The date the wrestler completed the Grand Slam\n|-\n| Names in '''bold'''\n| Indicates Grand Slam winner under both formats\n|-\n| Championships in ''italics''\n| The title is an alternate title in the original Grand Slam format\n|-\n| Dates in ''italics''\n| The wrestler has won that title, but does not contribute to their Grand Slam because they had already won the Grand Slam or they had already won a title at the same level\n|-\n| -\n| Indicates future reigns are impossible due to retirement, death or title discontinuation\n|-\n! style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" colspan=\"2\" | Colors\n|-\n| style=\"background: gold | <br />\n| Won all Grand Slam eligible titles under either format\n|-\n| style=\"background: #FFBBBB;\" | <br />\n| Won title as a member of the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand\n|-\n| style=\"background: #BBBBFF;\" | <br />\n| Won title as a member of the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand\n|-\n| style=\"background: #BBBBCC;\" | <br />\n| Won title as a member of the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand\n|-\n| style=\"background: #FFFF80;\" | <br />\n| Won title as a member of the [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] brand\n|-\n|\n| Won title when the [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] was not in effect.\n|}\n\n===== Original format (established 1997) =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\" width=\"100%\"\n! rowspan=2 | Champion || colspan=2 | Primary championships || colspan=2 | Tag team championships || Secondary championship || colspan=2 | Tertiary championships\n|-\n!

There are currently four regions with associated leagues: Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, and Buffalo. Some games in the Albany and Rochester regions are broadcast on [[public-access television]].\n\n==Rules==\n\n===General===\nMasterminds uses NAQT A-Set questions. Two teams of four players face off answering questions on a wide variety of topics including literature, history, science, visual and auditory arts, philosophy, social science, geography, current events, and popular culture. Each team appoints a captain, denoted by a star on their nameplate. All players are provided with pens and a half sheet of paper for scratch work for math questions. \n\n===Length===\nGames consist of two eight-minute timed halves. If a tossup question or set of bonuses is in progress at the end of a half, that round of questioning will be allowed to finished.\n\n===Toss-Up Questions===\nToss-Up questions are worth 10 points.  They are asked, and any one person from either team can buzz in and give the answer. If they get the question correct, they earn 10 points for their team which then has the opportunity to answer a set of bonus questions.  If a player interrupts the question and supplies an incorrect answer, that player's team may not answer the question again. The opposing team may wait until the question finishes to answer. There is a certain point in each tossup question, typically just before an import clue, called the \"power mark\". If a player rings in on a toss-up before the \"power mark\" and answers correctly, they earn 15 points instead of 10. If, however, a player answers incorrectly before the question is over, their team is deducted 5 points. Players may not confer with their teammates during toss-up questions by verbal or nonverbal means. After ringing in to answer a question, players must wait for the adjudicator to verbally recognize them by saying their name and school. If a player does not wait to be recognized, it is treated as an incorrect answer, and the normal procedure for incorrect answers applies.\n\n===Bonus Questions===\nFollowing a correct answer to a toss-up question, a team is entitled to a set of three bonus questions centered around a single topic. Each question is worth 10 points, for a total of 30 points. Conferring is allowed and encouraged. Any person from the team may answer a bonus question, however if there are multiple contradicting answers, the adjudicator will ask the captain for a single answer. \n\n==Format==\n\n===Regular Season===\nDuring the Regular Season, the teams in each region are divided up into leagues. Most leagues have six teams, though some have five or seven. In the 2018-19 season, Albany had six leagues, Buffalo had five leagues, Rochester had ten, and Syracuse had two. The leagues are run with a double or triple [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] format, depending on the number of teams. All teams play twelve regular season games across six rotations, meaning that teams usually play two games each rotation, though they may play more if they were unable to go to an earlier one. There is generally one rotation each month, and they are held at schools in the league. Individual statistics, such as the number of questions answered correctly, the number answered incorrectly, the number of power marks or penalties earned, the number of games and halves played, and the player's average points per half, are kept.\n\nMany participating schools also have Junior Varsity teams, which are ostensibly for students in 10th grade and below. There are generally fewer Junior Varsity teams in each league than Varsity teams, so their tournaments are often quadruple or hextuple round robin. Junior Varsity games are run on the same questions as those for the Varsity division. There are no playoffs for Junior Varsity.\n\n===Playoffs===\nThe top half of Varsity teams (rounded up) by win-loss record from each league advance to the regional playoffs. The playoffs are run with a [[Double-elimination tournament|double elimination]] format. The playoffs for Albany, Buffalo, and Rochester are spread across multiple days, beginning in mid-to-late April and ending in late May. In the Albany and Buffalo playoffs, the teams that qualified for playoffs are separated into two groups, each of which plays the first four rounds of playoffs, and the teams that remain after those games (two undefeated and four once-defeated) play again at a later date to decide the regional champion. The Rochester league is similar, except that initially the teams are divided into four, and the final match takes place at a date after its competitors are determined, due to fact that there are many more teams in Rochester than in Albany or Buffalo. Correspondingly, Syracuse, the smallest region, concludes its playoffs on a single day. Individual stats are not kept in the playoffs, though an MVP and \"All Tournament Team\" are stated, presumably on the basis of total points obtained.\n\nThe winner of each of the Regional Championships advance to the State Championship in June. The State Championships usually take place at [[LeMoyne College]]. The State Championships are run in a round robin format: each team plays each other once, and a champion is decided based on win-loss record. Like in the regional playoffs, individual stats are not kept, but an MVP and \"All Tournament Team\" are named. The questions used in the regional and state playoffs are of the same difficulty as those used in the regular season.\n\n==Previous Winners==\n\n===Teams with the most State Qualifications (Not including those no longer in League)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!In the League currently\n!Of all time\n!Since 2010\n|-\n|1\n|[[Bethlehem Central High School|Bethlehem]]\n|[[Bethlehem Central High School|Bethlehem]]\n|[[Bethlehem Central High School|Bethlehem]]\n|-\n|2\n|[[Troy High School (New York)|Troy]]\n|[[Troy High School (New York)|Troy]]\n|[[Troy High School (New York)|Troy]]\n|-\n|3\n|[[Fayetteville\u2013Manlius High School|Fayetteville-Manlius]], [[Irondequoit High School|Irondequoit]], and [[City Honors]]\n|[[Fayetteville\u2013Manlius High School|Fayetteville-Manlius]], [[Irondequoit High School|Irondequoit]], and [[City Honors]]\n|[[Fayetteville\u2013Manlius High School|Fayetteville-Manlius]] and [[City Honors]]\n|}\n<br />\n===Teams with the most Regional Qualifications (Not including those no longer in League)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Albany League\n!Buffalo League\n!Rochester League\n!Syracuse League\n|-\n|1\n|[[Bethlehem Central High School|Bethlehem]]\n|[[Williamsville East High School|Williamsville East]]\n|[[McQuaid Jesuit High School|McQuaid]]\n|[[Fayetteville\u2013Manlius High School|Fayetteville-Manlius]] \n|-\n|2\n|[[Guilderland High School|Guilderland]] and [[Troy High School (New York)|Troy]]\n|[[Canisius High School|Canisius]], [[City Honors]], and [[St. Joseph High School (Brooklyn)|St. Joseph's]]\n|[[Brighton High School (Rochester, New York)|Brighton]]\n|[[Bishop Ludden Junior/Senior High School|Bishop Ludden]], [[East Syracuse-Minoa Central High School|East Syracuse-Minoa]], and [[Jordan-Elbridge High School|Jordan-Elbridge]]\n|-\n|3\n|Tie for Second\n|Three way tie for Second\n|[[School of the Arts (Rochester, New York)|School of the Arts]] and [[Arcadia High School (New York)|Greece Arcadia]] \n|Three way tie for Second\n|}\n\n=== League and Regional Qualifications (Regional Winners stated, State Winners bolded) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are currently four regions with associated leagues: Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, and Buffalo. Some games in the Albany and Rochester regions are broadcast on [[public-access television]].\n\n==Rules==\n\n===General===\nMasterminds uses NAQT A-Set questions. Two teams of four players face off answering questions on a wide variety of topics including literature, history, science, visual and auditory arts, philosophy, social science, geography, current events, and popular culture. Each team appoints a captain, denoted by a star on their nameplate. All players are provided with pens and a half sheet of paper for scratch work for math questions. \n\n===Length===\nGames consist of two eight-minute timed halves. If a tossup question or set of bonuses is in progress at the end of a half, that round of questioning will be allowed to finished.\n\n===Toss-Up Questions===\nToss-Up questions are worth 10 points.  They are asked, and any one person from either team can buzz in and give the answer. If they get the question correct, they earn 10 points for their team which then has the opportunity to answer a set of bonus questions.  If a player interrupts the question and supplies an incorrect answer, that player's team may not answer the question again. The opposing team may wait until the question finishes to answer. There is a certain point in each tossup question, typically just before an import clue, called the \"power mark\". If a player rings in on a toss-up before the \"power mark\" and answers correctly, they earn 15 points instead of 10. If, however, a player answers incorrectly before the question is over, their team is deducted 5 points. Players may not confer with their teammates during toss-up questions by verbal or nonverbal means. After ringing in to answer a question, players must wait for the adjudicator to verbally recognize them by saying their name and school. If a player does not wait to be recognized, it is treated as an incorrect answer, and the normal procedure for incorrect answers applies.\n\n===Bonus Questions===\nFollowing a correct answer to a toss-up question, a team is entitled to a set of three bonus questions centered around a single topic. Each question is worth 10 points, for a total of 30 points. Conferring is allowed and encouraged. Any person from the team may answer a bonus question, however if there are multiple contradicting answers, the adjudicator will ask the captain for a single answer. \n\n==Format==\n\n===Regular Season===\nDuring the Regular Season, the teams in each region are divided up into leagues. Most leagues have six teams, though some have five or seven. In the 2018-19 season, Albany had six leagues, Buffalo had five leagues, Rochester had ten, and Syracuse had two. The leagues are run with a double or triple [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] format, depending on the number of teams. All teams play twelve regular season games across six rotations, meaning that teams usually play two games each rotation, though they may play more if they were unable to go to an earlier one. There is generally one rotation each month, and they are held at schools in the league. Individual statistics, such as the number of questions answered correctly, the number answered incorrectly, the number of power marks or penalties earned, the number of games and halves played, and the player's average points per half, are kept.\n\nMany participating schools also have Junior Varsity teams, which are ostensibly for students in 10th grade and below. There are generally fewer Junior Varsity teams in each league than Varsity teams, so their tournaments are often quadruple or hextuple round robin. Junior Varsity games are run on the same questions as those for the Varsity division. There are no playoffs for Junior Varsity.\n\n===Playoffs===\nThe top half of Varsity teams (rounded up) by win-loss record from each league advance to the regional playoffs. The playoffs are run with a [[Double-elimination tournament|double elimination]] format. The playoffs for Albany, Buffalo, and Rochester are spread across multiple days, beginning in mid-to-late April and ending in late May. In the Albany and Buffalo playoffs, the teams that qualified for playoffs are separated into two groups, each of which plays the first four rounds of playoffs, and the teams that remain after those games (two undefeated and four once-defeated) play again at a later date to decide the regional champion. The Rochester league is similar, except that initially the teams are divided into four, and the final match takes place at a date after its competitors are determined, due to fact that there are many more teams in Rochester than in Albany or Buffalo. Correspondingly, Syracuse, the smallest region, concludes its playoffs on a single day. Individual stats are not kept in the playoffs, though an MVP and \"All Tournament Team\" are stated, presumably on the basis of total points obtained.\n\nThe winner of each of the Regional Championships advance to the State Championship in June. The State Championships usually take place at [[LeMoyne College]]. The State Champtionships are run in a round robin format: each team plays each other once, and a champion is decided based on win-loss record. Like in the regional playoffs, individual stats are not kept, but an MVP and \"All Tournament Team\" are named. The questions used in the regional and state playoffs are of the same difficulty as those used in the regular season.\n\n==Previous Winners==\n\n===Teams with the most State Qualifications (Not including those no longer in League)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!In the League currently\n!Of all time\n!Since 2010\n|-\n|1\n|[[Bethlehem Central High School|Bethlehem]]\n|[[Bethlehem Central High School|Bethlehem]]\n|[[Bethlehem Central High School|Bethlehem]]\n|-\n|2\n|[[Troy High School (New York)|Troy]]\n|[[Troy High School (New York)|Troy]]\n|[[Troy High School (New York)|Troy]]\n|-\n|3\n|[[Fayetteville\u2013Manlius High School|Fayetteville-Manlius]], [[Irondequoit High School|Irondequoit]], and [[City Honors]]\n|[[Fayetteville\u2013Manlius High School|Fayetteville-Manlius]], [[Irondequoit High School|Irondequoit]], and [[City Honors]]\n|[[Fayetteville\u2013Manlius High School|Fayetteville-Manlius]] and [[City Honors]]\n|}\n<br />\n===Teams with the most Regional Qualifications (Not including those no longer in League)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Albany League\n!Buffalo League\n!Rochester League\n!Syracuse League\n|-\n|1\n|[[Bethlehem Central High School|Bethlehem]]\n|[[Williamsville East High School|Williamsville East]]\n|[[McQuaid Jesuit High School|McQuaid]]\n|[[Fayetteville\u2013Manlius High School|Fayetteville-Manlius]] \n|-\n|2\n|[[Guilderland High School|Guilderland]] and [[Troy High School (New York)|Troy]]\n|[[Canisius High School|Canisius]], [[City Honors]], and [[St. Joseph High School (Brooklyn)|St. Joseph's]]\n|[[Brighton High School (Rochester, New York)|Brighton]]\n|[[Bishop Ludden Junior/Senior High School|Bishop Ludden]], [[East Syracuse-Minoa Central High School|East Syracuse-Minoa]], and [[Jordan-Elbridge High School|Jordan-Elbridge]]\n|-\n|3\n|Tie for Second\n|Three way tie for Second\n|[[School of the Arts (Rochester, New York)|School of the Arts]] and [[Arcadia High School (New York)|Greece Arcadia]] \n|Three way tie for Second\n|}\n\n=== League and Regional Qualifications (Regional Winners stated, State Winners bolded) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
