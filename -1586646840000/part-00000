The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

Argentine champion [[Roberto De Vicenzo]] signed his scorecard (attested by playing partner [[Tommy Aaron]]) incorrectly recording him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round. According to the rules of golf, if a player signs a scorecard (thereby attesting to its veracity) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole, the player receives the higher score for that hole.

The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

In 1954, they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe original trophy weighs over 130 pounds, and sits on a four-foot wide base. It resides permanently at Augusta National and depicts the clubhouse of the classic course. The replica, which is significantly smaller, stands just 6.5 inches tall and weighs 20 pounds. The champion and the runner-up both have their names engraved on the permanent trophy, solidifying themselves in golf history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/09/19/masters-trophy-facts-size-weight-history-97937 |title=The Masters Trophy facts: Size, weight, history and more |date=September 19, 2016 |website=GolfNewsNet.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Double Eagle trophy was introduced in 1967 when [[Bruce Devlin]] holed out for double eagle on number 8.

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot.

It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again.
