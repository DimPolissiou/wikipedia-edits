They are run by the governing body, [[USA Cycling]]. Until 2006 the race was open to all nationalities, the first American to finish being named the winner and given a distinctive jersey. Since the championship in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], in 2006, all riders have had to be American.\n\nBefore 1985, only the amateur champions were named.\nFrom 1921 to 1964, the Amateur Bicycle League of America [[United States National Road Race Championships#See also|(ABLA) National Championships]] were held as an omnium of track-style events for Men, Women, and Juniors, rather than as a road race. In 1964 the American Cycling Newsletter (later [[Bicycling (magazine)|Bicycling]]) reported the results of a Flemington, NJ race as the national road racing championships, but these results do not appear in the [[USA Cycling]] list of winners.\n\n==Men==\n\n===Amateur===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 60%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DDDDDD; font-weight:bold;

He played [[Prop (rugby union)|loosehead prop]] for [[Leicester Tigers]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]].  He was capped 54 times for England, despite having to compete for his position with the world's second most capped forward, [[Jason Leonard]].\n\nRowntree was born in [[Stockton-on-Tees]]. He was educated at [[John Cleveland College]], [[Hinckley]], [[Leicestershire]], which has also produced other rugby union players.\n\nIn 1988 he joined [[Leicester Tigers]] from [[Nuneaton R.F.C.|Nuneaton]] and made his first-team debut against Oxford University in 1990. For much of that time he was in harness with the famous \u2018ABC club\u2019 alongside [[Richard Cockerill]] and [[Darren Garforth]]. At Leicester Rowntree enjoyed great domestic success, and started both the [[2001 Heineken Cup Final|2001]]<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2000/heineken_cup/1339721.stm\n|title=European glory seals Leicester treble\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=19 May 2001 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> and [[2002 Heineken Cup Final|2002]]<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/european/2008245.stm\n|title=Tigers retain European Cup\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=25 May 2002 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> Heineken Cup finals.\n\nIn 1993 he made his England A, [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] and Midlands debuts, and on 18 March 1995 he gained his first full England cap against Scotland in the Five Nations tournament as a temporary replacement for Jason Leonard. He subsequently played in the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]]. He also made the [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa]], playing 6 games and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nAfter the 1999 World Cup Graham was not capped for almost 2 years until a series of fine performances for his club forced him back into international contention. He was prominent throughout the pre-[[2003 Rugby World Cup]] years. He was selected for the England squad to tour Canada and the US in 2001, participated in all that season's Autumn internationals \u2014 being named as man of the match in England's 21\u201315 Cook Cup victory over Australia \u2014 and started in each of the [[2002 Six Nations]] games. He started in England's 15\u201313 win over New Zealand in Wellington in 2003 and put in a particularly memorable performance against the [[All Blacks]] when England's pack was reduced to just 6 men. Despite playing in the 2003 pre-World Cup trial match in France, Rowntree was omitted from [[Clive Woodward]]'s squad, which won the tournament.

He played [[Prop (rugby union)|loosehead prop]] for [[Leicester Tigers]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]].  He was capped 54 times for England, despite having to compete for his position with the world's second most capped forward, [[Jason Leonard]].\n\nRowntree was born in [[Stockton-on-Tees]]. He was educated at [[John Cleveland College]], [[Hinckley]], [[Leicestershire]], which has also produced other rugby union players.\n\nIn 1988 he joined [[Leicester Tigers]] from [[Nuneaton R.F.C.|Nuneaton]] and made his first-team debut against Oxford University in 1990. For much of that time he was in harness with the famous \u2018ABC club\u2019 alongside [[Richard Cockerill]] and [[Darren Garforth]]. At Leicester Rowntree enjoyed great domestic success, and started both the [[2001 Heineken Cup Final|2001]]<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2000/heineken_cup/1339721.stm\n|title=European glory seals Leicester treble\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=19 May 2001 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> and [[2002 Heineken Cup Final|2002]]<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/european/2008245.stm\n|title=Tigers retain European Cup\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=25 May 2002 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> Heineken Cup finals.\n\nIn 1993 he made his England A, [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] and Midlands debuts, and on 18 March 1995 he gained his first full England cap against Scotland in the Five Nations tournament as a temporary replacement for Jason Leonard. He subsequently played in the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]]. He also made the [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa]], playing 6 games and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nAfter the 1999 World Cup Graham was not capped for almost 2 years until a series of fine performances for his club forced him back into international contention. He was prominent throughout the pre-[[2003 Rugby World Cup]] years. He was selected for the England squad to tour Canada and the US in 2001, participated in all that season's Autumn internationals \u2014 being named as man of the match in England's 21\u201315 Cook Cup victory over Australia \u2014 and started in each of the [[2002 Six Nations]] games. He started in England's 15\u201313 win over New Zealand in Wellington in 2003 and put in a particularly memorable performance against the [[All Blacks]] when England's pack was reduced to just 6 men.

As she weighed only 5 pounds and measured just 18&nbsp;inches at birth, she spent the first few weeks of her life in an [[Neonatal intensive care unit|incubator]], during which time her survival was somewhat doubtful. Her father, Russell C. Menzer (1916\u20131999), was an [[MGM]] and [[Warner Brothers]] commercial artist and art director. She had a younger brother, Stephen Menzer, and an older sister, Jean Coulter, a veteran [[Hollywood]] stuntwoman who doubled for [[Barbara Anderson (actress)|Barbara Anderson]] on ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', and [[Farrah Fawcett]] and [[Cheryl Ladd]] on ''[[Charlie's Angels]],'' sometimes [[Kate Jackson]] and [[Jaclyn Smith]].\n\nWhen Lori was six years old, her mother took her to an agent who specialized in child actors. She thought that acting might be a healthy outlet for Lori. When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, \"The best time in my life was when I was about four. Doree and I had to go live with my aunt in [[Ponca City, Oklahoma|Ponca City]], [[Oklahoma]]. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. That was when I decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately and my little brother was signed by the same agent, but he lacked my interest in acting. I just loved it.\"\n\nMartin auditioned so well that her parents soon allowed her to attend them by herself. Her mother recalled, \"I'll never forget the first interview she went on. It was for a [[Chrysler]] commercial, and my car broke down about six blocks from the studio. I had to stay with the car, but Lori was all for going on in herself. She got out of the car, walked six blocks, found the right office, told the receptionist who she was, went in for her interview and got the job. Since then I've usually waited outside in the car and she's handled everything herself.\" {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nAs well as appearing in several commercials, including one for which her father designed the set and a [[Milky Way (candy)|Milky Way]] candy commercial, she won parts in the films ''[[Machine-Gun Kelly (film)|Machine-Gun Kelly]]'' (1958), ''[[The FBI Story]]'' (1959), and ''[[Cash McCall]]'' (1959). She appeared in several [[television series]], including ''[[Medic (TV series)|Medic]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', and ''[[Whirlybirds]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==''National Velvet''==\nAt the age of 12, Martin was the 975th young hopeful to be auditioned for the role of Velvet Brown in the NBC television version of ''[[National Velvet (TV series)|National Velvet]]'', the role for which she is best remembered. After being included in the final three, she was interviewed ten more times before winning the part. [[Ann Doran]] played her mother, Martha Brown; [[Arthur Space]], her father, Herbert Brown. When she won the role, her name was changed from Dawn Menzer to \"Lori Martin\". On the change of name, Martin later said that, \"I didn't like the name Lori at first. But I like it now. The reason I like it now is I've been brainwashed!\" The show ran for fifty-eight episodes between 1960 and 1962.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==''Cape Fear''==\nIn 1962, Martin won the role of Nancy Bowden in the film ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'', which also starred [[Gregory Peck]], [[Polly Bergen]], and [[Robert Mitchum]]. Martin later said that she delivered her best performance as Nancy but had nightmares for weeks after the filming of the scene in which her character is stalked by Mitchum's character. The director of the film, [[J. Lee Thompson]], originally wanted [[Hayley Mills]] for Martin's part.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chibnall |first=Steve |title=J. Lee Thompson |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5ATIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA283&dq=Cape+Fear+lori+martin++mills&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwing9Toze_oAhWhqHEKHdTmDkIQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=Cape%20Fear%20lori%20martin%20%20mills&f=false |date=2000 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-6012-0 |page=283}}</ref> Because he could not get Mills, however, he later admitted to having deliberately given Martin a hard time during filming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Singing career==\nMartin released her only single on [[Bob Keane]]'s legendary [[Del-Fi Records]]. Recorded at Radio Recorders in Hollywood in September 1963, the girl group-styled \"The Home of the Boy I Love\", backed with \"Mine 'Til Monday\" (Del Fi 4201), was mistakenly released with songwriting credits given to the successful team of [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]] when in fact it was produced by Barry Mann and written by lesser known hit-man Sylvester Bradford. Bradford's claim to fame was his composition of \"[[Tears On My Pillow]]\", which was a #4 hit in 1958 for [[Little Anthony & The Imperials]]. Although Lori Martin's only record had limited popularity at the time it was released, it has now become quite collectable and sought after among girl group record collectors.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Later career==\nAfter ''Cape Fear'', Martin made guest appearances in such television series as ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Slattery's People]]'', ''[[Sam Benedict]]'', ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'', ''[[Please Don't Eat The Daisies]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', and ''[[Family Affair]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Later years==\nDuring the early 1970s, Martin decided to put her acting career on hold. She later recalled that her reasoning behind her decision was that \"I'd been in the business long enough to know I'd been stereotyped. My mother was in poor health and I felt I had worked from such an early age I could take some time off and get a college education.\" A few years later, she tried to reactivate her career but unfortunately she became \"discouraged by the many changes in casting and techniques\".\n\nMartin married Charles Breitenbucher, had a son, Brett, and moved to [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]], California, under her married name, Dawn Breitenbucher. She later moved to [[Oakhurst, California]]. She occasionally attended autograph signings and ran a medical supplies company with her husband until his death in 1999. In February 2008, she participated as an election worker when the people of Oakhurst voted on whether the community should become incorporated or not. During that campaign she gave an interview to the local ABC television station.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.\n\nIn an article which was written at the height of her fame, she was quoted as saying that what she wanted to be when she grew up was \"normal\". Martin later recalled after her acting career had finished that it \"was probably an accurate quote because that's what I wanted and as it turns out, that's what I am.\" <ref>{{cite book |last=Lamparski |first=Richard |date=1985 |title=Whatever became of ... ?

Her father, Russell C. Menzer (1916\u20131999), was an [[MGM]] and [[Warner Brothers]] commercial artist and art director. She had a younger brother, Stephen Menzer, and an older sister, Jean Coulter, a veteran [[Hollywood]] stuntwoman who doubled for [[Barbara Anderson (actress)|Barbara Anderson]] on ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', and  [[Farrah Fawcett]] and [[Cheryl Ladd]] on ''[[Charlie's Angels]],'' sometimes [[Kate Jackson]] and [[Jaclyn Smith]].\n\nWhen Lori was six years old, her mother took her to an agent who specialized in child actors. She thought that acting might be a healthy outlet for Lori. When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, \"The best time in my life was when I was about four. Doree and I had to go live with my aunt in [[Ponca City, Oklahoma|Ponca City]], [[Oklahoma]]. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. That was when I decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately and my little brother was signed by the same agent, but he lacked my interest in acting. I just loved it.\"\n\nMartin auditioned so well that her parents soon allowed her to attend them by herself. Her mother recalled, \"I'll never forget the first interview she went on. It was for a [[Chrysler]] commercial, and my car broke down about six blocks from the studio. I had to stay with the car, but Lori was all for going on in herself. She got out of the car, walked six blocks, found the right office, told the receptionist who she was, went in for her interview and got the job. Since then I've usually waited outside in the car and she's handled everything herself.\" {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nAs well as appearing in several commercials, including one for which her father designed the set and a [[Milky Way (candy)|Milky Way]] candy commercial, she won parts in the films ''[[Machine-Gun Kelly (film)|Machine-Gun Kelly]]'' (1958), ''[[The FBI Story]]'' (1959), and ''[[Cash McCall]]'' (1959). She appeared in several [[television series]], including ''[[Medic (TV series)|Medic]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'',  ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', and ''[[Whirlybirds]]''. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==''National Velvet''==\nAt the age of 12, Martin was the 975th young hopeful to be auditioned for the role of Velvet Brown in the NBC television version of ''[[National Velvet (TV series)|National Velvet]]'', the role for which she is best remembered. After being included in the final three, she was interviewed ten more times before winning the part. [[Ann Doran]] played her mother, Martha Brown; [[Arthur Space]], her father, Herbert Brown. When she won the role, her name was changed from Dawn Menzer to \"Lori Martin\". On the change of name, Martin later said that, \"I didn't like the name Lori at first. But I like it now. The reason I like it now is I've been brainwashed!\" The show ran for fifty-eight episodes between 1960 and 1962. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==''Cape Fear''==\nIn 1962, Martin won the role of Nancy Bowden in the film ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'', which also starred [[Gregory Peck]], [[Polly Bergen]], and [[Robert Mitchum]]. Martin later said that she delivered her best performance as Nancy but had nightmares for weeks after the filming of the scene in which her character is stalked by Mitchum's character. The director of the film, [[J. Lee Thompson]], originally wanted [[Hayley Mills]] for Martin's part.<ref>Steve Chibnall: J. Lee Thompson, p. 283 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4gTIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA283&lpg=PA283&dq=Cape+Fear+lori+martin+haylay+mills&source=bl&ots=Dpb3ZsPTwd&sig=Eg2qckbfIuNRHngYfW-CT68RSOo&hl=en&ei=U7LLTrzKN4eSOprA7K8P&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&sqi=2&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Cape%20Fear%20lori%20martin%20haylay%20mills&f=false Online]</ref> Because he could not get Mills, however, he later admitted to having deliberately given Martin a hard time during filming. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Singing career==\nMartin released her only single on [[Bob Keane]]'s legendary [[Del-Fi Records]].  Recorded at Radio Recorders in Hollywood in September 1963, the girl group-styled \"The Home of the Boy I Love\", backed with \"Mine 'Til Monday\" (Del Fi 4201), was mistakenly released with songwriting credits given to the successful team of [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]] when in fact it was produced by Barry Mann and written by lesser known hit-man Sylvester Bradford.  Bradford's claim to fame was his composition of \"[[Tears On My Pillow]]\", which was a #4 hit in 1958 for [[Little Anthony & The Imperials]]. Although Lori Martin's only record had limited popularity at the time it was released, it has now become quite collectable and sought after among girl group record collectors. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Later career==\nAfter ''Cape Fear'', Martin made guest appearances in such television series as ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Slattery's People]]'', ''[[Sam Benedict]]'', ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'', ''[[Please Don't Eat The Daisies]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', and ''[[Family Affair]]''. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Later years==\nDuring the early 1970s, Martin decided to put her acting career on hold. She later recalled that her reasoning behind her decision was that \"I'd been in the business long enough to know I'd been stereotyped. My mother was in poor health and I felt I had worked from such an early age I could take some time off and get a college education.\" A few years later, she tried to reactivate her career but unfortunately she became \"discouraged by the many changes in casting and techniques\".\n\nMartin married Charles Breitenbucher, had a son, Brett, and moved to [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]], California, under her married name, Dawn Breitenbucher. She later moved to [[Oakhurst, California]]. She occasionally attended autograph signings and ran a medical supplies company with her husband until his death in 1999. In February 2008, she participated as an election worker when the people of Oakhurst voted on whether the community should become incorporated or not. During that campaign she gave an interview to the local ABC television station. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.\n\nIn an article which was written at the height of her fame, she was quoted as saying that what she wanted to be when she grew up was \"normal\". Martin later recalled after her acting career had finished that it \"was probably an accurate quote because that's what I wanted and as it turns out, that's what I am.\" <ref>Whatever became of ... ?

She struggled with mental illness ([[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] [[schizophrenia]]) and illicit drug use in the years after her husband died. She is survived by her son, Brett Breitenbucher, and her siblings, Doree Thompson Kelly, Jean Marek and Stephen Menzer, as well as extended family.<ref>[http://www.sierrastar.com/2010/04/15/51978/dawn-breitenbucher.html ''The Sierra Star''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104060232/http://www.sierrastar.com/2010/04/15/51978/dawn-breitenbucher.html |date=2011-01-04 }}, April 15, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://filmnoirliveshere.ning.com Obituary], filmnoirliveshere.ning.com; accessed February 15, 2015.</ref><ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/53272328 Find-a-Grave profile]; accessed February 15, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Film\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!
