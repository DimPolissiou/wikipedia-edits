Common nickname is \"''papasha''\" ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0448\u0430}}), meaning \"daddy\".\n\nThe PPSh is a magazine-fed [[selective fire]] submachine gun using an [[open bolt]], [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]] action. Made largely of [[stamping (metalworking)|stamped steel]], it can be loaded with either a box or [[drum magazine]] and fires the [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev]] pistol round.\n\nThe PPSh saw extensive combat use during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. It was one of the major infantry weapons of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] during World War II. Around six million PPSh-41s were manufactured. In the form of the Chinese Type 50 (licensed copy), it was still being used by the [[Viet Cong]] as late as 1970. According to the 2002 edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II'' the PPSh was still in use with [[irregular military|irregular militaries]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bishop | first = Chris | title = The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II  | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. | year = 2002 | page = 261 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA261 | edition= Illustrated | isbn = 1-58663-762-2}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n[[File:PPSh-41 with box magazine 1942 001.jpg|thumb|left|A 1942 PPSh-41 with a box magazine]]\n\nThe impetus for the development of the PPSh came partly from the [[Winter War]] against Finland, where the Finnish Army employed the [[Suomi KP/-31]] submachine gun as a highly effective tool for close-quarter fighting in forests and built-up urban areas. Its 71-round [[drum magazine]] was later copied and adopted by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] for their [[PPD-40]] and [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns.<ref name=\"Suomi-KP History\">{{cite web |url=http://guns.connect.fi/gow/suomi2.html |title=Suomi Submachine Gun, KP/-31, part 2/2 |last=Kekkonen |first=P  |date= |website=Gunwriters |publisher= |access-date= 8 Nov 2019}} </ref> A submachine gun, the [[PPD-40]], was subsequently rushed into mass production in 1940, but it was expensive to manufacture, both in terms of materials and labor, because it used numerous [[milling (machining)|milled metal]] parts, particularly its receiver. Shpagin's main idea for cost reduction was to use metal stamping for the production of most parts; that concept was revolutionary in the Soviet Union at the time. Shpagin created a prototype PPSh in September 1940, which also featured a simple gas compensator designed to prevent the muzzle from rising during bursts; this improved [[shot grouping]] by about 70% relative to the PPD.<ref name=\"bolotin\">{{cite book|last=\u0411\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d|first=\u0414\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0434|script-title=ru:\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432|pages=109\u2013114|publisher=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043e\u043d|year=1995|isbn=5-85503-072-5|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nThe new weapon was produced in a network of factories in [[Moscow]], with high-level local [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party members]] made directly responsible for meeting production targets. A few hundred weapons were produced in November 1941 and another 155,000 were made during the next five months. By spring 1942, the PPSh factories were producing roughly 3,000 units a day.<ref>Rodric Braithwaite, ''Moscow 1941: A City and its People at War'', London: Profile Books, 2006, p. 236.</ref> Soviet production figures for 1942 indicate that almost 1.5 million units were produced.<ref name=\"bolotin\"/> The PPSh-41 is a classic example of a design adapted for mass production (other examples of such wartime design are the [[M3 submachine gun]], [[MP 40]], [[PPS submachine gun]], and the [[Sten]]). Its parts (excluding the barrel) could be produced by a relatively unskilled workforce with simple equipment available in an auto repair garage or tin shop, freeing more skilled workers for other tasks. The PPSh-41 uses 87 components compared to 95 for the [[PPD-40]] and the PPSh could be manufactured with an estimated 5.6 machining hours (later revised to 7.3 hours) compared with 13.7 hours for the PPD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cruffler.com/trivia-March01.html|title=Kalashnikov, Part 2: Soviet Political Economy and the Design Evolution of the Kalashnikov Avtomat|accessdate=2010-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=\u0411\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d|first=\u0414\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0434|script-title=ru:\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432|pages=111 for the early estimate vs. PPD and p. 119 comparison with PPS|publisher=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043e\u043d|year=1995|isbn=5-85503-072-5|language=ru}}</ref> Barrel production was often simplified by using barrels for the 7.62mm [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]]: the rifle barrel was cut in half and two PPSh barrels were made from it after machining the chamber for the [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev]] cartridge.<ref>Pauly, Roger (2004).

The ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' officially adopted the converted PPSh-41 as the \"MP41(r)\"; unconverted PPSh-41s were designated \"MP717(r)\" and supplied with [[7.63\u00d725mm Mauser]] ammunition (which is dimensionally identical to 7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev, but slightly less powerful). German-language manuals for the use of captured PPShs were printed and distributed in the ''Wehrmacht''.<ref name=\"ppsh41\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ppsh41.com/ppsh2.html|title=9 mm Conversion of the PPSh-41|accessdate=2010-03-21}}</ref> In addition to barrel replacement, converted PPSh-41s also had a magazine adapter installed, allowing them to use MP-40 magazines. The less powerful 9mm round generally reduces the cyclic rate of fire down to 800 to 750 RPM. Modern aftermarket conversion kits based on the original Wehrmacht one also exist using a variety of magazines, including Sten mags. Some enthusiasts have been able to make them work with the original Soviet drum and stick magazines, eliminating the adapter, as well as use of the more powerful [[9\u00d723mm Winchester]] ammo.\n\n[[File:PPSh-PPS-mags.jpg|PPSh vis-\u00e0-vis PPS box magazine|thumb|right]]\n\nAs standard each PPSh-41 came with two factory fitted drum magazines that were matched to the weapon with marked serial numbers.  If drum magazines were mixed and used with different serial numbered PPSh-41, a loose fitting could result in poor retention and failure to feed.  Drum magazines were superseded by a simpler PPS-42 box-type magazine holding 35 rounds, although an improved drum magazine made from 1&nbsp;mm thick steel was also introduced in 1944.<ref name=\"bolotin\"/>\n\nThe PPS submachine gun, an even simpler submachine gun, was later introduced in Soviet service in 1943, although it did not replace the PPSh-41 during the war.\n\nThe Soviet Union also experimented with the PPSh-41 in a [[close air support]] [[anti-personnel weapon|antipersonnel role]], mounting dozens of the submachine guns in forward fuselage racks on the Tu-2sh variant of the [[Tupolev Tu-2]] bomber.<ref name=\"xs4all\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ppsh41.com/index-2.html|title=Tu-2 Gunships!|accessdate=2010-11-23}}</ref>\n\nMore than five million PPSh submachine guns were produced by the end of the war. The Soviets would often equip platoons and sometimes entire companies with the weapon, giving them excellent short-range firepower.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|title=The encyclopedia of weapons of World War II|date=2002|publisher=MetroBooks|location=New York|isbn=9781586637620|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopedia_of_Weapons_of_World_War.html?id=MuGsf0psjvcC|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> Thousands more were dropped behind enemy lines in order to equip [[Soviet partisans]]  to disrupt German supply lines and communications.\n\n===Korean War===\nAfter the Second World War, the PPSh was supplied in large quantities to Soviet-aligned states and Communist guerrilla forces. The weapon was widely used during the [[Korean War]]. The [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) and the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA) fighting in Korea received massive numbers of the PPSh-41, in addition to the North Korean Type 49 and the Chinese Type 50, which were both licensed copies of the PPSh-41 with small mechanical revisions.{{sfn|McNab|2012|pp=22-23}}\n\nThough relatively inaccurate, the Chinese PPSh has a high rate of fire and was well-suited to the close-range firefights that typically occurred in that conflict, especially at night.<ref name=\"Halberstam447\">{{cite book\n|last=Halberstam\n|first=David\n|title=The Coldest Winter\n|publisher=Hyperion Press\n|year=2007\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/coldestwinterame00halb/page/447 447]\n|isbn=978-1-4013-0052-4\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/coldestwinterame00halb/page/447\n}}</ref> United Nations forces in defensive outposts or on patrol often had trouble returning a sufficient volume of fire when attacked by companies of infantry armed with the PPSh. Some U.S. infantry officers ranked the PPSh as the best combat weapon of the war: while lacking the accuracy of the U.S. [[M1 Garand]] and [[M1 carbine]], it provided more firepower at short distances.<ref name=\"Halberstam447\"/> As infantry Captain (later General) [[Hal Moore]], stated: \"on full automatic it sprayed a lot of bullets and most of the killing in Korea was done at very close ranges and it was done quickly \u2013 a matter of who responded faster.  In situations like that it outclassed and outgunned what we had.  A close-in patrol fight was over very quickly and usually we lost because of it.\"<ref name=\"Halberstam447\"/> U.S. servicemen, however, felt that their [[M2 carbine]]s were superior to the PPSh-41 at the typical engagement range of 100\u2013150 meters.<ref name=\"Thompson2011\">{{cite book|author=Leroy Thompson|title=The M1 Carbine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=km5XxecLeOkC&pg=PA56|year=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-619-6|page=56}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:M\u00e9morial uniforme sovi\u00e9tique WWII.JPG|thumb|right|A PPSh-41 on display]]\n\nThe PPSh-41 fires the standard Soviet pistol and submachine gun cartridge, the 7.62\u00d725mm (Tokarev). Weighing approximately 12 pounds (5.45&nbsp;kg) with a loaded 71-round drum and 9.5 pounds (4.32&nbsp;kg) with a loaded 35-round box magazine, the PPSh is capable of a rate of about 1000 rounds per minute, a very high [[rate of fire]] in comparison to most other military submachine guns of World War II.  It is a durable, low-maintenance weapon made of low-cost, easily obtained components, primarily stamped sheet metal and wood.  The final production PPShs have top ejection and an ''L'' type rear sight that can be adjusted for ranges of 100 and 200 meters.  A crude [[Muzzle brake|compensator]] is built into the barrel jacket, intended to reduce [[muzzle climb]] during automatic fire. The compensator was moderately successful in this respect, but it greatly increased the [[muzzle flash]] and report of the weapon. The PPSh also has a hinged receiver to facilitate field-stripping and cleaning the weapon.  A chrome-lined bore enables the PPSh to withstand both corrosive ammunition and long intervals between cleaning.  No forward grip or forearm was provided, and the operator generally has to grasp the weapon behind the drum magazine with the supporting hand, or else hold the lower edge of the drum magazine.  Though 35-round curved box [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]] were available from 1942, the average Soviet infantryman in World War II carried the PPSh with the original 71-round [[drum magazine]].<ref name=\"worldguns\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg02-e.htm|title=Shpagin PPSh-41 submachine gun (USSR)|accessdate=2010-03-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308033040/http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg02-e.htm|archivedate=2010-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe PPSh drum magazine holds 71 rounds.  In practice, misfeeding is likely to occur with more than about 65.<ref>Mosier, ''The Blitzkrieg Myth'', p.86.</ref>  In addition to feed issues, the drum magazine is slower and more complicated to load with ammunition than the later 35-round box magazine that increasingly supplemented the drum after 1942.  While holding fewer rounds, the box magazine does have the advantage of providing a superior hold for the supporting hand.  Although the PPSh is equipped with a sliding bolt safety, the weapon's open-bolt design still presents a risk of accidental discharge if the gun is dropped on a hard surface.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

A non-restricted firearm in [[.22LR]] ammunition. The box magazine holds 30 and the drum magazine holds 50.  It is cosmetically similar to the PPSh-41, although the two share no other features.\n* '''VPO-135''': A semi-automatic version of the PPSh-41 from Russia.\n* '''LTD PPSh-41''': A semi-automatic-only clone of the PPSh-41. This variant with its fixed wooden stock is manufactured by Luxembourg Defence Technology for the civilian European sport shooting market.\n* '''SKL-41''': A semi-automatic version of the PPSh-41 which became available on the German market in 2008. This version is converted to fire the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge. Aside from replicas of its original magazines, it also accepts [[MP 40]] magazines.\n* '''IO SR-41''': A semi-automatic version of the PPSh-41 sold by American company InterOrdnance and manufactured by [[A. A. Arms]]. The barrel on this version extends past the shroud and is non-removable. Most were made of surplus PPSh parts, however many enthusiasts criticized the gun for dubious quality.\n* Additional semi-auto versions for the American market made by Wiselite and TNW. They were similar to IO SR-41 but had the shroud extend along with the barrel and were much more well received quality wise.\n*'''\u0160okac''' : A Croatian version of the PPSH-41, produced in the 1990s for use in the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Using a metal folding stock and a square receiver, it doesn't look like a PPSH-41 appearance wise, but mechanically the gun is a copy of the PPSH-41. The \u0160okac was produced because of the lack of arms the Croatians were facing, and turned to producing simple small arms to fix this issue. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Heidler |first1=Michael

Common nickname is \"''papasha''\" ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0448\u0430}}), meaning \"daddy\".\n\nThe PPSh is a magazine-fed [[selective fire]] submachine gun using an [[open bolt]], [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]] action. Made largely of [[stamping (metalworking)|stamped steel]], it can be loaded with either a box or [[drum magazine]] and fires the [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev]] pistol round.\n\nThe PPSh saw extensive combat use during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. It was one of the major infantry weapons of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] during World War II. Around six million PPSh-41s were manufactured. In the form of the Chinese Type 50 (licensed copy), it was still being used by the [[Viet Cong]] as late as 1970. According to the 2002 edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II'' the PPSh was still in use with [[irregular military|irregular militaries]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bishop | first = Chris | title = The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II  | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. | year = 2002 | page = 261 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA261 | edition= Illustrated | isbn = 1-58663-762-2}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n[[File:PPSh-41 with box magazine 1942 001.jpg|thumb|left|A 1942 PPSh-41 with a box magazine]]\n\nThe impetus for the development of the PPSh came partly from the [[Winter War]] against Finland, where the Finnish Army employed the [[Suomi KP/-31]] submachine gun as a highly effective tool for close-quarter fighting in forests and built-up urban areas. Its 71-round [[drum magazine]] was later copied and adopted by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] for their [[PPD-40]] and [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns.<ref name=\"Suomi-KP History\">{{cite web |url=http://guns.connect.fi/gow/suomi2.html |title=Suomi Submachine Gun, KP/-31, part 2/2 |last=Kekkonen |first=P  |date= |website=Gunwriters |publisher= |access-date= 8 Nov 2019}} </ref> A submachine gun, the [[PPD-40]], was subsequently rushed into mass production in 1940, but it was expensive to manufacture, both in terms of materials and labor, because it used numerous [[milling (machining)|milled metal]] parts, particularly its receiver. Shpagin's main idea for cost reduction was to use metal stamping for the production of most parts; that concept was revolutionary in the Soviet Union at the time. Shpagin created a prototype PPSh in September 1940, which also featured a simple gas compensator designed to prevent the muzzle from rising during bursts; this improved [[shot grouping]] by about 70% relative to the PPD.<ref name=\"bolotin\">{{cite book|last=\u0411\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d|first=\u0414\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0434|script-title=ru:\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432|pages=109\u2013114|publisher=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043e\u043d|year=1995|isbn=5-85503-072-5|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nThe new weapon was produced in a network of factories in [[Moscow]], with high-level local [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party members]] made directly responsible for meeting production targets. A few hundred weapons were produced in November 1941 and another 155,000 were made during the next five months. By spring 1942, the PPSh factories were producing roughly 3,000 units a day.<ref>Rodric Braithwaite, ''Moscow 1941: A City and its People at War'', London: Profile Books, 2006, p. 236.</ref> Soviet production figures for 1942 indicate that almost 1.5 million units were produced.<ref name=\"bolotin\"/> The PPSh-41 is a classic example of a design adapted for mass production (other examples of such wartime design are the [[M3 submachine gun]], [[MP 40]], [[PPS submachine gun]], and the [[Sten]]). Its parts (excluding the barrel) could be produced by a relatively unskilled workforce with simple equipment available in an auto repair garage or tin shop, freeing more skilled workers for other tasks. The PPSh-41 uses 87 components compared to 95 for the [[PPD-40]] and the PPSh could be manufactured with an estimated 5.6 machining hours (later revised to 7.3 hours) compared with 13.7 hours for the PPD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cruffler.com/trivia-March01.html|title=Kalashnikov, Part 2: Soviet Political Economy and the Design Evolution of the Kalashnikov Avtomat|accessdate=2010-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=\u0411\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d|first=\u0414\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0434|script-title=ru:\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432|pages=111 for the early estimate vs. PPD and p. 119 comparison with PPS|publisher=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043e\u043d|year=1995|isbn=5-85503-072-5|language=ru}}</ref> Barrel production was often simplified by using barrels for the 7.62mm [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]]: the rifle barrel was cut in half and two PPSh barrels were made from it after machining the chamber for the [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev]] cartridge.<ref>Pauly, Roger (2004).

The ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' officially adopted the converted PPSh-41 as the \"MP41(r)\"; unconverted PPSh-41s were designated \"MP717(r)\" and supplied with [[7.63\u00d725mm Mauser]] ammunition (which is dimensionally identical to 7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev, but slightly less powerful). German-language manuals for the use of captured PPShs were printed and distributed in the ''Wehrmacht''.<ref name=\"ppsh41\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ppsh41.com/ppsh2.html|title=9 mm Conversion of the PPSh-41|accessdate=2010-03-21}}</ref> In addition to barrel replacement, converted PPSh-41s also had a magazine adapter installed, allowing them to use MP-40 magazines. The less powerful 9mm round generally reduces the cyclic rate of fire down to 800 to 750 RPM. Modern aftermarket conversion kits based on the original Wehrmacht one also exist using a variety of magazines, including Sten mags. Some enthusiasts have been able to make them work with the original Soviet drum and stick magazines, eliminating the adapter, as well as use of the more powerful [[9\u00d723mm Winchester]] ammo.\n\n[[File:PPSh-PPS-mags.jpg|PPSh vis-\u00e0-vis PPS box magazine|thumb|right]]\n\nAs standard each PPSh-41 came with two factory fitted drum magazines that were matched to the weapon with marked serial numbers.  If drum magazines were mixed and used with different serial numbered PPSh-41, a loose fitting could result in poor retention and failure to feed.  Drum magazines were superseded by a simpler PPS-42 box-type magazine holding 35 rounds, although an improved drum magazine made from 1&nbsp;mm thick steel was also introduced in 1944.<ref name=\"bolotin\"/>\n\nThe PPS submachine gun, an even simpler submachine gun, was later introduced in Soviet service in 1943, although it did not replace the PPSh-41 during the war.\n\nThe Soviet Union also experimented with the PPSh-41 in a [[close air support]] [[anti-personnel weapon|antipersonnel role]], mounting dozens of the submachine guns in forward fuselage racks on the Tu-2sh variant of the [[Tupolev Tu-2]] bomber.<ref name=\"xs4all\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ppsh41.com/index-2.html|title=Tu-2 Gunships!|accessdate=2010-11-23}}</ref>\n\nMore than five million PPSh submachine guns were produced by the end of the war. The Soviets would often equip platoons and sometimes entire companies with the weapon, giving them excellent short-range firepower.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|title=The encyclopedia of weapons of World War II|date=2002|publisher=MetroBooks|location=New York|isbn=9781586637620|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopedia_of_Weapons_of_World_War.html?id=MuGsf0psjvcC|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> Thousands more were dropped behind enemy lines in order to equip [[Soviet partisans]]  to disrupt German supply lines and communications.\n\n===Korean War===\nAfter the Second World War, the PPSh was supplied in large quantities to Soviet-aligned states and Communist guerrilla forces. The weapon was widely used during the [[Korean War]]. The [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) and the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA) fighting in Korea received massive numbers of the PPSh-41, in addition to the North Korean Type 49 and the Chinese Type 50, which were both licensed copies of the PPSh-41 with small mechanical revisions.{{sfn|McNab|2012|pp=22-23}}\n\nThough relatively inaccurate, the Chinese PPSh has a high rate of fire and was well-suited to the close-range firefights that typically occurred in that conflict, especially at night.<ref name=\"Halberstam447\">{{cite book\n|last=Halberstam\n|first=David\n|title=The Coldest Winter\n|publisher=Hyperion Press\n|year=2007\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/coldestwinterame00halb/page/447 447]\n|isbn=978-1-4013-0052-4\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/coldestwinterame00halb/page/447\n}}</ref> United Nations forces in defensive outposts or on patrol often had trouble returning a sufficient volume of fire when attacked by companies of infantry armed with the PPSh. Some U.S. infantry officers ranked the PPSh as the best combat weapon of the war: while lacking the accuracy of the U.S. [[M1 Garand]] and [[M1 carbine]], it provided more firepower at short distances.<ref name=\"Halberstam447\"/> As infantry Captain (later General) [[Hal Moore]], stated: \"on full automatic it sprayed a lot of bullets and most of the killing in Korea was done at very close ranges and it was done quickly \u2013 a matter of who responded faster.  In situations like that it outclassed and outgunned what we had.  A close-in patrol fight was over very quickly and usually we lost because of it.\"<ref name=\"Halberstam447\"/> U.S. servicemen, however, felt that their [[M2 carbine]]s were superior to the PPSh-41 at the typical engagement range of 100\u2013150 meters.<ref name=\"Thompson2011\">{{cite book|author=Leroy Thompson|title=The M1 Carbine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=km5XxecLeOkC&pg=PA56|year=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-619-6|page=56}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:M\u00e9morial uniforme sovi\u00e9tique WWII.JPG|thumb|right|A PPSh-41 on display]]\n\nThe PPSh-41 fires the standard Soviet pistol and submachine gun cartridge, the 7.62\u00d725mm (Tokarev). Weighing approximately 12 pounds (5.45&nbsp;kg) with a loaded 71-round drum and 9.5 pounds (4.32&nbsp;kg) with a loaded 35-round box magazine, the PPSh is capable of a rate of about 1000 rounds per minute, a very high [[rate of fire]] in comparison to most other military submachine guns of World War II.  It is a durable, low-maintenance weapon made of low-cost, easily obtained components, primarily stamped sheet metal and wood.  The final production PPShs have top ejection and an ''L'' type rear sight that can be adjusted for ranges of 100 and 200 meters.  A crude [[Muzzle brake|compensator]] is built into the barrel jacket, intended to reduce [[muzzle climb]] during automatic fire. The compensator was moderately successful in this respect, but it greatly increased the [[muzzle flash]] and report of the weapon. The PPSh also has a hinged receiver to facilitate field-stripping and cleaning the weapon.  A chrome-lined bore enables the PPSh to withstand both corrosive ammunition and long intervals between cleaning.  No forward grip or forearm was provided, and the operator generally has to grasp the weapon behind the drum magazine with the supporting hand, or else hold the lower edge of the drum magazine.  Though 35-round curved box [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]] were available from 1942, the average Soviet infantryman in World War II carried the PPSh with the original 71-round [[drum magazine]].<ref name=\"worldguns\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg02-e.htm|title=Shpagin PPSh-41 submachine gun (USSR)|accessdate=2010-03-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308033040/http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg02-e.htm|archivedate=2010-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe PPSh drum magazine holds 71 rounds.  In practice, misfeeding is likely to occur with more than about 65.<ref>Mosier, ''The Blitzkrieg Myth'', p.86.</ref>  In addition to feed issues, the drum magazine is slower and more complicated to load with ammunition than the later 35-round box magazine that increasingly supplemented the drum after 1942.  While holding fewer rounds, the box magazine does have the advantage of providing a superior hold for the supporting hand.  Although the PPSh is equipped with a sliding bolt safety, the weapon's open-bolt design still presents a risk of accidental discharge if the gun is dropped on a hard surface.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

A non-restricted firearm in [[.22LR]] ammunition. The box magazine holds 30 and the drum magazine holds 50.

Aside from replicas of its original magazines, it also accepts [[MP 40]] magazines.\n* '''IO SR-41''': A semi-automatic version of the PPSh-41 sold by American company InterOrdnance and manufactured by [[A. A. Arms]]. The barrel on this version extends past the shroud and is non-removable. Most were made of surplus PPSh parts, however many enthusiasts criticized the gun for dubious quality.\n* Additional semi-auto versions for the American market made by Wiselite and TNW. They were similar to IO SR-41 but had the shroud extend along with the barrel and were much more well received quality wise.\n*'''\u0160okac''' : A Croatian version of the PPSH-41, produced in the 1990s for use in the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Using a metal folding stock and a square receiver, it doesn't look like a PPSH-41 appearance wise, but mechanically the gun is a copy of the PPSH-41. The \u0160okac was produced because of the lack of arms the Croatians were facing, and turned to producing simple small arms to fix this issue. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Heidler |first1=Michael |title=\u0160okac |url=https://www.forgottenweapons.com/submachine-guns/sokac/ |website=forgottenweapons.com |accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|title=Soviet Submachine Guns of World War II: PPD-40, PPSh-41 and PPS|series=Weapon 33|first=Chris |last=McNab|date= 20 May 2014 |isbn=9781782007944|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=X8enCwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title= Jane's Guns Recognition Guide Second Edition|last= Hogg|first=Ian |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=Janes |location=Glasgow |isbn=0-00-472453-4 |url= |page= }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuSVmHxQJS8 Video of PPSh being fired with box and drum magazine]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ0YUd-sNLg Video of PPSh being fired in burst with 9 mm conversion]\n* [http://www.a-human-right.com/ppsh.html 17 photos of PPSh-41 and its parts]\n* [http://www.ppsh41.com/88ppsh.jpg Photograph of close air support anti-personnel mount]\n* [http://www.ppsh41.com/markings1.htm Photographs of the markings present on different variations of PPSH-41 guns and their clones.]\n\n{{WWIIUSSRInfWeapons}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ppsh-41}}\n[[Category:7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev submachine guns]]\n[[Category:Submachine guns of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Vyatskiye Polyany Machine-Building Plant products]]\n[[Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 1941]]\n[[Category:World War II infantry weapons of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:World War II submachine guns]]\n", "name_user": "UnTrueHistorian Corn REAL", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed the caliber)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPSh-41"}

Patel also criticized the iPhone 8's aging design, dating back to the iPhone 6 released in 2014; the most notable critique was of the thick bezels when compared to other 2017 smartphones, designed with nearly bezel-less faces to incorporate larger screens in a similar form factor.<ref>{{cite web |first=Nilay |last=Patel |title=iPhone 8 and 8 Plus review: the default option |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 19, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were also criticized for their durability, as drop tests performed showed that the rear glass is not \"the most durable glass ever in a smartphone\", as claimed by Apple.<ref>{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Glass-Bodied iPhone 8 Shatters Repeatedly in Drop Tests |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/25/iphone-8-shatters-in-drop-tests/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 25, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Zach |last=Epstein |title=Drop test confirms Apple totally lied about the glass back on the iPhone 8 |url=http://bgr.com/2017/09/25/iphone-8-plus-case-needed-drop-test-oof/ |website=[[Boy Genius Report|BGR]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=September 25, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nCamera testing company [[DxOMark]] gave the camera on the iPhone 8 a rating of 92 and 8 Plus a rating of 94, giving them the title of best smartphone cameras tested by the company.<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=DxO Labs Says iPhone 8 Plus Has Best Smartphone Camera They've Ever Tested |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/22/dxomark-iphone-8-plus-best-smartphone-camera/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 22, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Mayo |title=iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus top DxOMark smartphone camera rankings |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/22/iphone-8-8-plus-best-camera-dxomark-rankings/ |website=9to5Mac |date=September 22, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref> The [[Samsung Galaxy Note 8]] later matched the iPhone 8 Plus with an identical overall score of 94.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Fingas |title=Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus tie for top spot in camera test |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/03/galaxy-note-8-iphone-8-plus-tied-in-dxomark-camera-test/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=October 3, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Potuck |title=Samsung Galaxy Note 8 ties iPhone 8 Plus in DxOMark camera ranking |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/10/03/samsung-galaxy-note-8-ties-iphone-8-plus-camera-ranking/ |website=9to5Mac |date=October 3, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref> They were later overtaken by the Google [[Pixel 2]], which scored a 98 rating.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Potuck |title=iPhone X scores 97 on DxOMark camera ranking, just behind Google Pixel 2 |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/06/iphone-x-scores-97-dxomark/ |website=9to5Mac |date=November 6, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\nOn August 31, 2018, Apple announced that a \"very small percentage\" of iPhone 8 devices released between September 2017 and March 2018 contained a manufacturing defect in the logic board.
