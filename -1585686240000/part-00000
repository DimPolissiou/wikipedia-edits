Set in an alternative future where a [[Nordicism|Nordic supremacist]] and [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime has subjugated the [[United Kingdom]], the film centers on [[V (character)|V]] (portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]]), an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and masked freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, while [[Natalie Portman]] plays [[Evey Hammond|Evey]], a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission and [[Stephen Rea]] portrays a detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.\n\nProduced by [[Silver Pictures]], [[Virtual Studios]] and [[The Wachowskis#As film producers and comic book publishers|Anarchos Productions Inc.]], ''V for Vendetta'' was originally scheduled for release by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] on November 4, 2005 (a day before the 400th [[Guy Fawkes Night]]), but was delayed; it instead opened in the United States on March 17, 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. However, Alan Moore, having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works, ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001) and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] ''(2003), declined to watch the film and asked to be uncredited or not be paid royalties.\n\n''V for Vendetta'' has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; [[libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]] have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: \"The [[Guy Fawkes mask]] has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny \u2013 and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735|title=V for Vendetta masks: Who\u2019s behind them?|last=Waites|first=Rosie|date=October 20, 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2032, the world is in turmoil.

They watch his demolition of the [[Old Bailey]], accompanied by fireworks and the \"[[1812 Overture]]\". Inspector Finch of [[Scotland Yard]] investigates V's activities. V hijacks a BTN broadcast to claim responsibility for the destruction, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's [[Guy Fawkes Night]] outside the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious.\n\nV takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the [[Bishop of London]].<!-- Before claiming the bishop is a pedophile you need a citation. Pedophilia is sexual attraction primarily or exclusively towards prepubescents, typically around 13 years old. The dialogue from the aide says that Evey is \"a little older than usual\". Natalie Portman was about 24 during filming and cannot pass for a prepubescent girl. --> Evey offers to help, but escapes to the home of her boss, talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him, Gordon reveals subversive paintings, an antique [[Quran]], and homoerotic photographs. V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who experimented on him and other \"undesirables\" at [[Larkhill]] concentration camp; seeing her remorse, he kills her painlessly.\n\nAfter Gordon satirizes the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is tortured for information about V, her only solace being a note written by Valerie Page, a prisoner tortured and killed for being lesbian. Evey is to be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is released, finding herself in V's home. V captured her at Gordon's home, staging her imprisonment to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He informs her that Gordon was executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realizes she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.\n\nReading Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is targeting those who detained him. Finch searches for V's true identity, tracing him to a [[biological warfare|bioweapons]] program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him about the program. Fourteen years earlier, Sutler, [[Secretary of State for Defence|Secretary of Defence]] at the time, launched a secret project at Larkhill which resulted in the creation of the St. Mary's virus. Creedy, the current leader of the Norsefire Party, suggested releasing the virus onto the UK. Targeting St. Mary's School, a [[London Underground|tube station]] and a [[water treatment]] plant, the virus killed more than 100,000 people. The outbreak was blamed on a [[terrorist organisation]]. Norsefire used the wave of fear and chaos to elevate Sutler to the office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in [[British Parliament|Parliament]], taking control of the country, as well as profiting off the cure for the virus. Finch discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in Norsefire government is shaken.\n\nAs November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks, while the population questions government rule. The UK descends into anarchy, ignited when a Fingerman shoots and kills a girl painting graffiti, only to be killed in turn by enraged citizens. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her a train filled with [[ANFO]] explosives in the abandoned [[London Underground]], set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal, killing Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, V tells Evey he loves her before dying.\n\nAs Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train off. Thousands of citizens wearing Guy Fawkes masks march toward the Houses of Parliament. As Creedy and Sutler are both dead, the [[British Armed Forces|military]] receives no orders, and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, \"He was all of us.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n\n[[File:HugoWeavingMay2011.jpg|thumb|Hugo Weaving in 2012.

Also like Hitler, Sutler is a racial purist, although Jews have been replaced by Arabs and Muslims as the focus of Norsefire ethnoreligious propaganda and persecution. (This fact owes to the post-9/11 association of Islam and the Middle East with terrorism, combined with the fact that British Muslims far outnumber British Jews. The latter are certainly persecuted by Norsefire as well, since Norsefire is an Aryanist regime as well as a Christofascistic one.)

Much of the film was shot on [[sound stage]]s and indoor sets, with location work done in [[Berlin]] for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned [[London Underground]] were filmed at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]]. Filming began in early March 2005 and lasted through early June 2005.<ref name=\"vendettasite\" /> ''V for Vendetta'' is the final film shot by [[cinematographer]] [[Adrian Biddle]], who died of a heart attack on December 7, 2005, 4 days prior to its world debut.<ref>Guard, Howard\n[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/19/guardianobituaries.film Adrian Biddle obituary], www.guardian.co.uk, January 18, 2006.

However, the filmmakers denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal,<ref name=\"tony blair's son\">{{Cite news|work=The Guardian | title=How E got the V in Vendetta | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/23/news| date=March 23, 2006 | accessdate=May 13, 2006 | location=London}}</ref> stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies.<ref name=\"About the Production\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nThe film was designed to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an [[undercroft]].<ref name=\"Unmasked\">{{cite video | people=Warner Bros |year=2006 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775408 | title=V for Vendetta Unmasked | medium=TV-Special | location=United States|publisher=Warner Bros.}}</ref> The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], a ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' poster, ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' by [[Andrea Mantegna]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] and statues by [[Giacometti]].\nOne of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.<ref name=\"About the Production\">{{cite web| work=Official website | title=V for Vendetta&nbsp;\u2014 About the production | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_03.html | accessdate=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between the film and graphic novel==\nThe film's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel ''V for Vendetta''; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', and then reprinted and completed by DC. Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint and in the United Kingdom under [[Titan Books]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Itzcoff | first = Dave | title = The Vendetta Behind 'V for Vendetta | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date =March 12, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html | accessdate =April 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThere are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. For example, the comic is set in the 1990s, while the film is set in 2032: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern [[United States|US]] political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between [[liberalism (US)|liberalism]] and [[neo-conservatism]], and abandons the original anarchist\u2013fascist themes. Moore states that \"[t]here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial purity]] had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity.\" Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story.<ref name=\"official production\" /> All references to the \"Fate\" supercomputer were removed; as a result; Lewis Prothero was changed from \"the voice of Fate\", whose real identity was kept secret, to \"The Voice of London\", a celebrity akin to [[Rush Limbaugh]] or [[Bill O'Reilly]]. His obsession with dolls was cut from the film. Mister Almond, who dies and is replaced with Mister Creedy halfway through the novel, was removed from the film; parts of his death scene in the novel were re-used for Creedy's death scene in the film.\n\nThe plot was rearranged significantly. V's assault on the broadcasting tower occurs halfway through the novel but was moved to the beginning of the movie, while his attack on Lewis Prothero occurred near the beginning of the novel and was pushed back to roughly halfway through the film. Parliament was destroyed at the beginning of the novel but the end of the film. In both the graphic novel and the film, medical experiments were performed on political prisoners at Larkhill; however, in the graphic novel, these experiments involved a hormone cocktail that had no further relevance to the story, whereas the film added a subplot about the St. Mary's virus and the Viadoxic pharmaceutical company as an analog to 9/11 conspiracy theories. V's escape from the facility was simplified as well. In the novel, he is assigned to taking care of some gardens around Larkhill and proves to be an extremely talented and capable gardener. He uses his position of trust with the prison staff to requisition large amounts of grease, fertilizer, and other gardening supplies, and uses these, along with a deep understanding of chemistry, to orchestrate the series of explosions that destroy the facility and set him free. In the movie, the explosions that destroy the facility are never explained, leaving the viewer to assume that they were accidental.\n\nMany of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |title=V for Vendetta the Page Vs. The Screen |accessdate=June 26, 2010 | url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318221050/http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }}</ref> However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]] is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon Dietrich, a very minor character in the novel, is also drastically changed and his importance greatly amplified in both the story and the fictional universe in which it takes place. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang only 15 pages after being introduced. In the film, however, Gordon is a very famous TV show host like Prothero and a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by Fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later allegedly executed when a [[Quran]] is found in his possession.<ref name=\"IGN\" />. He is briefly seen again removing a Guy Fawkes mask in the crowd at the movie's end.\n\n==Release==\nThe film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]], in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the then Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England.<ref name=\"vendettasite\" /> The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of November 5, 2005, the Plot's 400th anniversary, with the tag line \"Remember, remember the 5th of November\", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to March 17, 2006. Many have speculated that the delay was caused by the London tube bombing on the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7]] and the failed [[21 July 2005 London bombings|July 21 bombing]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Scott|title=C is for controversy|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/|work=scifi.com|publisher=SCI FI|accessdate=January 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101022910/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/ |archivedate=January 1, 2008}}</ref> The filmmakers have denied this, saying that the delays were due to the need for more time to finish the visual effects production.<ref name=\"Postponed\">{{Cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Natalie Portman's 'V for Vendetta' Postponed | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?entry_id=452 | accessdate=April 25, 2006 | first=Karen | last=Reardanz | date=August 23, 2005}}</ref> ''V for Vendetta'' had its first major premiere on December 11, 2005, at [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]], followed by a premiere on February 13, 2006 at the [[Berlin Film Festival]].<ref name=numb /><ref name=\"v for vendetta interviews\" /> It opened for general release on March 17, 2006 in 3,365 cinemas in the United States, the United Kingdom and six other countries.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | title=V for Vendetta (2006) | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=vforvendetta.htm | accessdate=October 2, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion===\nThe cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message.

It was a response to living in [[Thatcherite]] Britain ... This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities.\" Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.<ref name=\"v for vendetta interviews\" />\n\n===Books===\nThe original graphic novel by Moore and Lloyd was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of November 5, 2005.<ref>{{ASIN|1401207928|title=V for Vendetta [Hardcover]}} {{ISBN|978-1-4012-0792-2}}</ref> The film renewed interest in Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States.<ref name=\"Televisionpoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410|title=V for Vendetta graphic novel is a US Bestseller|date=March 31, 2006|work=televisionpoint.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119122204/http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410|archivedate=November 19, 2006|accessdate=April 2, 2006}}</ref>\n\nA novelisation of the film, written by [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]] and based on the Wachowskis' script, was published by [[Pocket Star]] on January 31, 2006.<ref>{{ASIN|1416516999|title=V for Vendetta: a Novelization}} {{ISBN|978-1416516996}}</ref> Spencer Lamm, who has worked with the Wachowskis, created a \"[[Making-of|behind-the-scenes]]\" book.

Set in an alternative future where a [[Nordicism|Nordic supremacist]] and [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime has subjugated the [[United Kingdom]], the film centers on [[V (character)|V]] (portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]]), an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and masked freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, while [[Natalie Portman]] plays [[Evey Hammond|Evey]], a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission and [[Stephen Rea]] portrays a detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.\n\nProduced by [[Silver Pictures]], [[Virtual Studios]] and [[The Wachowskis#As film producers and comic book publishers|Anarchos Productions Inc.]], ''V for Vendetta'' was originally scheduled for release by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] on November 4, 2005 (a day before the 400th [[Guy Fawkes Night]]), but was delayed; it instead opened in the United States on March 17, 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. However, Alan Moore, having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works, ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001) and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] ''(2003), declined to watch the film and asked to be uncredited or not be paid royalties.\n\n''V for Vendetta'' has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; [[libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]] have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: \"The [[Guy Fawkes mask]] has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny \u2013 and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735|title=V for Vendetta masks: Who\u2019s behind them?|last=Waites|first=Rosie|date=October 20, 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2032, the world is in turmoil.

They watch his demolition of the [[Old Bailey]], accompanied by fireworks and the \"[[1812 Overture]]\". Inspector Finch of [[Scotland Yard]] investigates V's activities. V hijacks a BTN broadcast to claim responsibility for the destruction, encouraging the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on next year's [[Guy Fawkes Night]] outside the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape, but is knocked unconscious.\n\nV takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the [[Bishop of London]].<!-- Before claiming the bishop is a pedophile you need a citation. Pedophilia is sexual attraction primarily or exclusively towards prepubescents, typically around 13 years old. The dialogue from the aide says that Evey is \"a little older than usual\". Natalie Portman was about 24 during filming and cannot pass for a prepubescent girl. --> Evey offers to help, but escapes to the home of her boss, talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him, Gordon reveals subversive paintings, an antique [[Quran]], and homoerotic photographs. V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who experimented on him and other \"undesirables\" at [[Larkhill]] concentration camp; seeing her remorse, he kills her painlessly.\n\nAfter Gordon satirizes the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is tortured for information about V, her only solace being a note written by Valerie Page, a prisoner tortured and killed for being lesbian. Evey is to be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is released, finding herself in V's home. V captured her at Gordon's home, staging her imprisonment to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He informs her that Gordon was executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realizes she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.\n\nReading Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is targeting those who detained him. Finch searches for V's true identity, tracing him to a [[biological warfare|bioweapons]] program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him about the program. Fourteen years earlier, Sutler, [[Secretary of State for Defence|Secretary of Defence]] at the time, launched a secret project at Larkhill which resulted in the creation of the St. Mary's virus. Creedy, the current leader of the Norsefire Party, suggested releasing the virus onto the UK. Targeting St. Mary's School, a [[London Underground|tube station]] and a [[water treatment]] plant, the virus killed more than 100,000 people. The outbreak was blamed on a [[terrorist organisation]]. Norsefire used the wave of fear and chaos to elevate Sutler to the office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in [[British Parliament|Parliament]], taking control of the country, as well as profiting off the cure for the virus. Finch discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in Norsefire government is shaken.\n\nAs November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks, while the population questions government rule. The UK descends into anarchy, ignited when a Fingerman shoots and kills a girl painting graffiti, only to be killed in turn by enraged citizens. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her a train filled with [[ANFO]] explosives in the abandoned [[London Underground]], set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal, killing Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, V tells Evey he loves her before dying.\n\nAs Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train off. Thousands of citizens wearing Guy Fawkes masks march toward the Houses of Parliament. As Creedy and Sutler are both dead, the [[British Armed Forces|military]] receives no orders, and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, \"He was all of us.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n\n[[File:HugoWeavingMay2011.jpg|thumb|Hugo Weaving in 2012.

(This fact owes to the post-9/11 association of Islam and the Middle East with terrorism, combined with the fact that British Muslims far outnumber British Jews. The latter are certainly persecuted by Norsefire as well, since Norsefire is an Aryanist regime as well as a Christofascistic one.)

Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint and in the United Kingdom under [[Titan Books]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Itzcoff | first = Dave | title = The Vendetta Behind 'V for Vendetta | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date =March 12, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html | accessdate =April 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThere are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. For example, the comic is set in the 1990s, while the film is set in 2032: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern [[United States|US]] political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between [[liberalism (US)|liberalism]] and [[neo-conservatism]], and abandons the original anarchist\u2013fascist themes. Moore states that \"[t]here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial purity]] had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity.\" Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story.<ref name=\"official production\" /> Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the \"St. Mary's virus\", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMany of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |title=V for Vendetta the Page Vs. The Screen |accessdate=June 26, 2010 | url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318221050/http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }}</ref> However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]] is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by Fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a [[Quran]] is found in his possession.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]], in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the then Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England.<ref name=\"vendettasite\" /> The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of November 5, 2005, the Plot's 400th anniversary, with the tag line \"Remember, remember the 5th of November\", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to March 17, 2006. Many have speculated that the delay was caused by the London tube bombing on the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7]] and the failed [[21 July 2005 London bombings|July 21 bombing]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Scott|title=C is for controversy|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/|work=scifi.com|publisher=SCI FI|accessdate=January 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101022910/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/ |archivedate=January 1, 2008}}</ref> The filmmakers have denied this, saying that the delays were due to the need for more time to finish the visual effects production.<ref name=\"Postponed\">{{Cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Natalie Portman's 'V for Vendetta' Postponed | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?entry_id=452 | accessdate=April 25, 2006 | first=Karen | last=Reardanz | date=August 23, 2005}}</ref> ''V for Vendetta'' had its first major premiere on December 11, 2005, at [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]], followed by a premiere on February 13, 2006 at the [[Berlin Film Festival]].<ref name=numb /><ref name=\"v for vendetta interviews\" /> It opened for general release on March 17, 2006 in 3,365 cinemas in the United States, the United Kingdom and six other countries.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | title=V for Vendetta (2006) | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=vforvendetta.htm | accessdate=October 2, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion===\nThe cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message.

It was a response to living in [[Thatcherite]] Britain ... This is a response to the world in which we live today.

The climax of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' appears at the end of the track \"Knives and Bullets (and Cannons too)\". The Overture's ''[[Finale (music)|finale]]''  is played at key parts at the beginning and end of the film.\n\nThree songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the ''V for Vendetta'' soundtrack.<ref name=\"tillnes2006\"/> The first was \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\" by the [[Rolling Stones]]. The second was a special version of [[Ethan Stoller]]'s \"BKAB\". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from \"On Black Power\" (also in \"A Declaration of Independence\") by [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]], and from \"Address to the Women of America\" by feminist writer [[Gloria Steinem]] were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: \"This is no simple reform ... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends.\" The final song was \"[[Let It Come Down (Spiritualized album)|Out of Sight]]\" by [[Spiritualized]].\n\nAlso in the film were segments from two of [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]]'s classic [[bossa nova]] songs, \"[[The Girl from Ipanema|The Girl From Ipanema]]\" and \"[[Corcovado (song)|Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars]]\". These songs were played during the \"breakfast scenes\" with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together. [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's ''Symphony No.5'']] also plays an important role in the film, with the first four notes of the first movement signifying the letter \"V\" in [[Morse code]].<ref name=\"graphic novel\">{{Cite book|last= Moore |first= Alan |author2=David Lloyd  |title= V for Vendetta |quote=Inspector Finch recognises the background noise as Beethoven's Fifth, and states: \"It's Morse code for the letter \"V\"\" |publisher= Vertigo |date=November 2005|isbn= 1-4012-0792-8 |title-link= V for Vendetta }}</ref><ref name=\"BBC News\">{{Cite news|publisher=BBC News | title=Newswatch 1940s | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/newswatch/history/noflash/html/1940s.stm | accessdate=November 21, 2006}}</ref> Gordon Deitrich's [[Benny Hill]]-styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the \"[[Yakety Sax]]\" theme.

Boyle believed in what today is called 'monogenism', that is, that all races, no matter how diverse, came from the same source, [[Adam and Eve]]. He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured [[albinos]], so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that whites could give birth to different coloured races. Theories of [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] about color and light via [[optical dispersion]] in [[physics]] were also extended by [[Robert Boyle]] into discourses of [[polygenesis (biology)|polygenesis]],<ref name=\"Jen E. Boyle 2010 page 74\"/> speculating that maybe these differences were due to \"seminal impressions\".

The Frankish aristocracy dominated the Gauls by innate [[right of conquest]].\n\nIn his time, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]], a believer in the \"right of conquest\", did not understand \"race\" as biologically immutable, but as a contemporary cultural construct.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} His racialist account of French history was not entirely mythical: despite \"supporting\" [[hagiography|hagiographies]] and [[epic poetry]], such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' (''La Chanson de Roland'', c. 12th century), he sought [[scientific]] legitimation by basing his racialist distinction on the historical existence of genetically and linguistically distinguished Germanic and Latin-speaking peoples in France.

He believed that whites and Negroes were two different species. White was a believer in [[polygenism|polygeny]], the idea that different races had been created separately. His ''Account of the Regular Gradation in Man'' (1799) provided an empirical basis for this idea. White defended the theory of polygeny by rebutting French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]]'s interfertility argument, which said that only the same species can interbreed. White pointed to species hybrids such as foxes, wolves, and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed.

They also believed in the \"degeneration theory\" of racial origins. They both said that [[Adam and Eve]] were [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors, such as the sun and poor dieting. They believed that the degeneration could be reversed if proper environmental control was taken, and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite book|first=Marvin|last=Harris|title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture|year=2001|page=84|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThey thought Negroid [[pigmentation]] arose because of the heat of the tropical sun. They suggested cold wind caused the tawny colour of the [[Eskimos]]. They thought the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] relatively fair skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns and were protected from environmental factors. Buffon said that food and the mode of living could make races degenerate and differentiate them from the original Caucasian race.<ref name=Harris/> According to Blumenbach, there are five races, all belonging to a single species: [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]], [[Ethiopia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American]], and [[Malays (ethic group)|Malay]].

Many scientific racialists pointed out at the time that it would have been difficult for races to change so markedly in [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]] in such a short period of time. Believing in monogenism, Buffon thought that skin colour could change in a single lifetime, depending on the conditions of climate and diet.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=86}}</ref>\n\n====Benjamin Rush====\n[[Benjamin Rush]] (1745\u20131813), a [[Founding Father of the United States]] and a [[physician]], proposed that being black was a hereditary skin disease, which he called \"negroidism\", and that it could be cured. Rush believed non-whites were really white underneath but they were stricken with a non-contagious form of leprosy which darkened their skin color. Rush drew the conclusion that \"whites should not tyrannize over [blacks], for their disease should entitle them to a double portion of humanity. However, by the same token, whites should not intermarry with them, for this would tend to infect posterity with the 'disorder'... attempts must be made to cure the disease\".<ref>Rush, Benjamin (1799). \"Observations Intended to Favour a Supposition That the Black Color (As It Is Called) of the Negroes Is Derived from the Leprosy\".

Meiner studied the physical, mental and moral characteristics of each race, and built a race hierarchy based on his findings. Meiners split mankind into two divisions, which he labelled the \"beautiful [[white race]]\" and the \"ugly [[black race]]\". In Meiners's book ''The Outline of History of Mankind'', he said that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He thought only the white race to be beautiful. He considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral and animal-like. He said that the dark, ugly peoples were distinct from the white, beautiful peoples by their \"sad\" lack of virtue and their \"terrible vices\".<ref>{{harvnb|Isaac|2006|p=150}}</ref> According to Meiners,\n\n<blockquote>The more intelligent and noble people are by nature, the more adaptable, sensitive, delicate, and soft is their body; on the other hand, the less they possess the capacity and disposition towards virtue, the more they lack adaptability; and not only that, but the less sensitive are their bodies, the more can they tolerate extreme pain or the rapid alteration of heat and cold; when they are exposed to illnesses, the more rapid their recovery from wounds that would be fatal for more sensitive peoples, and the more they can partake of the worst and most indigestible foods ... without noticeable ill effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}</blockquote>\n\nMeiners said the Negro felt less pain than any other race and lacked in emotions. Meiners wrote that the Negro had thick nerves and thus was not sensitive like the other races. He went as far as to say that the Negro has \"no human, barely any animal, feeling\". He described a story where a Negro was condemned to death by being burned alive. Halfway through the burning, the Negro asked to smoke a pipe and smoked it like nothing was happening while he continued to be burned alive. Meiners studied the [[anatomy]] of the Negro and came to the conclusion that Negroes have bigger teeth and jaws than any other race, as Negroes are all [[carnivores]]. Meiners claimed the skull of the Negro was larger but the brain of the Negro was smaller than any other race. Meiners claimed the Negro was the most unhealthy race on Earth because of  its poor diet, mode of living and lack of morals.<ref name=\"Gupta07\">{{cite book|author=Das Gupta, Tania|title=Race and Racialization: Essential Readings|year=2007|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nMeiners also claimed the \"[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]]\" were an inferior stock of people. He said they could not adapt to different climates, types of food, or modes of life, and that when exposed to such new conditions, they lapse into a \"deadly melancholy\".\nMeiners studied the diet of the Americans and said they fed off any kind of \"foul offal\". He thought they consumed very much alcohol. He believed their skulls were so thick that the blades of Spanish swords shattered on them. Meiners also claimed the skin of an American is thicker than that of an ox.<ref name=Gupta07/>\n\nMeiners wrote that the noblest race was the [[Celts]]. They were able to conquer various parts of the world, they were more sensitive to heat and cold, and their delicacy is shown by the way they are selective about what they eat. Meiners claimed that [[Slavs]] are an inferior race, \"less sensitive and content with eating rough food\". He described stories of Slavs allegedly eating poisonous fungi without coming to any harm. He claimed that their medical techniques were also backward: he used as an example their heating sick people in ovens, then making them roll in the snow.<ref name=Gupta07/>\n\nIn Meiners's large work entitled ''Researches on the Variations in Human Nature'' (1815), he studied also the [[sexology]] of each race. He claimed that the African Negroids have unduly strong and perverted sex drives, whilst only the white Europeans have it just right.\n\n===Later thinkers===\n\n====Thomas Jefferson====\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743\u20131826) was an American politician, scientist,<ref>[Thomas Jefferson, Scientist by Travis Martin](https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/08/thomas-jefferson-scientist/)</ref><ref>[Thomas Jefferson: Founding Father of Science by Ross Pomeroy](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2012/02/thomas-jefferson-citizen-scientist.html)</ref> and slave owner. His contributions to scientific racism have been noted by many historians, scientists and scholars. According to an article published in the McGill Journal of Medicine: \"One of the most influential pre-Darwinian racial theorists, Jefferson\u2019s call for science to determine the obvious \u201cinferiority\u201d of African Americans is an extremely important stage in the evolution of scientific racism.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Garrod |first1=Joel Z.|title=A Brave Old World: An Analysis of Scientific Racism and BiDil |journal=McGill Journal of Medicine |volume=9|issue=1|pages=54\u201360|pmc=2687899|year=2006|pmid=19529811}}</ref> The historian [[Paul Finkelman]] described Jefferson in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as follows: \"A scientist, Jefferson nevertheless speculated that blackness might come \u201cfrom the color of the blood\u201d and concluded that blacks were \u201cinferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind.\u201d<ref>Paul Finkelman (November 12, 2012).

''The New York Times''.</ref> In his \"[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]\" Jefferson described black people as follows:\n\n<blockquote>They seem to require less sleep. A black, after hard labor through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the morning. They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome. But this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present. When present, they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness than the whites. They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection... Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me, that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one [black] could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid; and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous... I advance it therefore as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.<ref>[[Thomas Jefferson]], ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, by 1791, Jefferson had to reassess his earlier suspicions of whether blacks were capable of intelligence when he was presented with a letter and almanac from [[Benjamin Banneker]], an educated black mathematician. Delighted to have discovered scientific proof for the existence of black intelligence, Jefferson wrote to Banneker:\n\n<blockquote>No body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colors of men, & that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa & America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body & mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. <ref> (Jefferson\u2019s Letter to Benjamin Banneker, August 30, 1791.

Cuvier believed there were three distinct races: the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] (white), [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] (yellow) and the [[Ethiopia]]n (black). He rated each for the beauty or ugliness of the skull and quality of their civilizations. Cuvier wrote about Caucasians: \"The white race, with oval face, straight hair and nose, to which the civilised people of Europe belong and which appear to us the most beautiful of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage and activity\".<ref>Georges Cuvier, ''Tableau elementaire de l'histoire naturelle des animaux'' (Paris, 1798) p. 71</ref>\n\nRegarding Negroes, Cuvier wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The Negro race ... is marked by black complexion, crisped or woolly hair, compressed cranium and a flat nose. The projection of the lower parts of the face, and the thick lips, evidently approximate it to the monkey tribe: the hordes of which it consists have always remained in the most complete state of barbarism.<ref>Georges Cuvier, ''The Animal Kingdom: Arranged in Conformity with its Organization,'' Translated from the French by H.M. Murtrie, p. 50.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe thought [[Adam and Eve]] were Caucasian and hence the original race of mankind. The other two races arose by survivors' escaping in different directions after a major catastrophe hit the earth 5,000 years ago.

All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention, because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers, and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want, and misery, which, in their many forms, were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] of nature, and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>[[Schopenhauer]], ''Parerga and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Franz Ignaz Pruner====\n[[Franz Ignaz Pruner]] (1808\u20131882) was a medical doctor who studied the racial structure of Negroes in Egypt. In a book which he wrote in 1846 he claimed that Negro blood had a negative influence on the Egyptian moral character. He published a monograph on Negroes in 1861. He claimed that the main feature of the Negro's skeleton is [[prognathism]], which he claimed was the Negro's relation to the ape. He also claimed that Negroes had very similar brains to apes and that Negroes have a shortened big toe, which is a characteristic connecting Negroes closely to apes.<ref>[[Gustav Jahoda]], ''Images of Savages: Ancients [sic] Roots of Modern Prejudice in Western Culture'', 1999, p. 82</ref>\n\n==Racial theories in physical anthropology, 1850\u20131918==\n{{Further|Historical definitions of race}}\n[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|a late-19th-century illustration by H.

Breaks often occur in all parts of the series, some being wide, sharp and defined, others less so in various degrees; as between the [[Orangutan|orang]] and its nearest allies\u2014between the [[Tarsius]] and the other [[Lemuridae]] between the elephant, and in a more striking manner between the [[Ornithorhynchus]] or [[Echidna]], and all other mammals. But these breaks depend merely on the number of related forms which have become extinct. At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as [[Hermann Schaaffhausen|Professor Schaaffhausen]] has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a [[baboon]], instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the [[gorilla]].|''The Descent of Man'' (1871), Volume I, Chapter VI: \"On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man\", pp. 200\u201301}}\n\nIn the Chapter \"''On the Development of the Intellectual and Moral Faculties during Primeval and Civilised Times''\" Darwin claimed that \"the western nations of Europe, who now so immeasurably surpass their former savage progenitors, and stand at the summit of civilisation, owe little or none of their superiority to direct inheritance from the old Greeks\".<ref>The Descent of Man, (Second edition, 1874) p. 141</ref>\n\nWhile proposing a sole human species, Darwin contrasted the \"civilized races\" with the \"savage races\". Like most of his contemporaries, except the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], he did not distinguish \"biological race\" from \"cultural race\".

But it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of structural difference. The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation, and in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual, faculties. Every one who has had the opportunity of comparison, must have been struck with the contrast between the taciturn, even morose, aborigines of S. America and the light-hearted, talkative negroes. There is a nearly similar contrast between the Malays and the Papuans, who live under the same physical conditions, and are separated from each other only by a narrow space of sea.<ref>''The Descent of Man'', (First edition, 1871) pp. 216\u201317</ref>}}\n\n===Arthur de Gobineau===\n[[File:Arthur de Gobineau.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] by the Comtesse de la Tour, 1876]]\nThe French aristocrat and writer [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816\u20131882), is best known for his book ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853\u201355) which proposed three human races (black, white and yellow) were natural barriers and claimed that [[miscegenation|race mixing]] would lead to the collapse of culture and civilization. He claimed that \"The white race originally possessed the monopoly of beauty, intelligence and strength\" and that any positive accomplishments or thinking of blacks and Asians were due to an admixture with whites. His works were praised by many white supremacist American pro-slavery thinkers such as Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze.\n\nGobineau believed that the different races originated in different areas, the white race had originated somewhere in Siberia, the Asians in the Americas and the blacks in Africa. He believed that the white race was superior, writing:\n{{quote|I will not wait for the friends of equality to show me such and such passages in books written by missionaries or sea captains, who declare some Wolof is a fine carpenter, some Hottentot a good servant, that a Kaffir dances and plays the violin, that some Bambara knows arithmetic\u2026 Let us leave aside these puerilities and compare together not men, but groups.<ref>D'Souza, Dinesh \"Is Racism a Western Idea?\" pp. 517\u201339 from The American Scholar, Vol. 64, No. 4 Autumn 1995, p.538</ref>}}\n\nGobineau later used the term \"[[Aryan race|Aryans]]\" to describe the Germanic peoples (''la race germanique'').<ref>A.

These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction.<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|Weidman|2005|p=87}}</ref> Haeckel was also an advocate of the [[out of Asia theory]] by writing that the origin of humanity was to be found in [[Asia]]; he believed that [[Hindustan]] (South Asia) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved.

Such institutional racism was effected via [[Phrenology]], telling character from physiognomy; [[craniometry|craniometric]] skull and skeleton studies; thus skulls and skeletons of black people and other colored ''volk'', were displayed between apes and white men.\n\nIn 1906, [[Ota Benga]], a [[Pygmies|Pygmy]], was displayed as the \"Missing Link\", in the [[Bronx Zoo]], New York City, alongside apes and animals. The most influential theorists included the anthropologist [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854\u20131936) who proposed \"anthroposociology\"; and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744\u20131803), who applied \"race\" to [[nationalist]] theory, thereby developing the first conception of [[ethnic nationalism]]. In 1882, [[Ernest Renan]] contradicted Herder with a nationalism based upon the \"will to live together\", not founded upon ethnic or racial prerequisites. Scientific racist discourse posited the historical existence of \"national races\" such as the ''[[German people|Deutsche Volk]]'' in Germany, and the \"French race\" being a branch of the basal \"[[Aryan race]]\" extant for millennia, to advocate for [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] borders parallel to the racial ones.\n\n===Craniometry and physical anthropology===\n{{Further|Craniometry |physical anthropology}}\n[[File:Petrus-Camper-(professor).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Pieter Camper]]\n\nThe Dutch scholar [[Pieter Camper]] (1722\u201389), an early craniometric theoretician, used \"craniometry\" (interior skull-volume measurement) to scientifically justify racial differences. In 1770, he conceived of the [[facial angle]] to measure intelligence among species of men. The facial angle was formed by drawing two lines: a horizontal line from nostril to ear; and a vertical line from the upper-jawbone prominence to the forehead prominence. Camper's craniometry reported that antique statues (the Gr\u00e6co\u2013Roman ideal) had a 90-degree facial angle, whites an 80-degree angle, blacks a 70-degree angle, and the [[orangutan]] a 58-degree facial angle\u2014thus he established a racist biological hierarchy for mankind, per the [[decadence|Decadent]] conception of history. Such scientific racist researches were continued by the naturalist [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1772\u20131844) and the anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] (1824\u20131880).\n\n====Samuel George Morton====\n[[File:Morton drawing.png|right|thumb|Racialist differences: \"a Negro head ... a Caucasian skull ... a Mongol head\", [[Samuel George Morton]], 1839.]]\n\nIn the 19th century, an early American [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]], physician and polygenist [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799\u20131851), collected human skulls from worldwide, and attempted a logical classification scheme. Influenced by contemporary racialist theory, Dr Morton said he could judge racial intellectual capacity by measuring the interior [[cranial capacity]], hence a large skull denoted a large brain, thus high [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] capacity. Conversely, a small skull denoted a small brain, thus low intellectual capacity; superior and inferior established. After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since interpretations of the bible indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]] only a thousand years earlier, Morton claimed that Noah's sons could not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.<ref name=\"DavidHurst\">David Hurst Thomas, ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, And The Battle For Native American Identity'', 2001, pp. 38\u201341</ref>\n\nIn Morton's ''Crania Americana'', his claims were based on [[Craniometry]] data, that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Native Americans were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches.<ref name=\"DavidHurst\" />\n\nIn ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), the [[History of science|historian of science]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that Samuel Morton had falsified the craniometric data, perhaps inadvertently over-packing some skulls, to so produce results that would legitimize the racist presumptions he was attempting to prove.

Furthermore, he proposed that the concept of \"race\" was ambiguous, and in its stead proposed the compound word \"[[ethnic group]]\", which later prominently featured in the works of [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Alfred C.

Having adopted Ripley's three-race European populace model, but disliking the \"Teuton\" race name, he transliterated ''la race nordique'' into \"The Nordic race\", the acme of the concocted racial hierarchy, based upon his racial classification theory, popular in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\n[[Statens Institut f\u00f6r Rasbiologi]] and its director [[Herman Lundborg]] in [[Sweden]] were active in racist research.  Furthermore, much of early research on [[Ural-Altaic languages]] was coloured by attempts at justifying the view that European peoples east of Sweden were Asian and thus of inferior race, justifying colonialism, eugenics and racial hygiene.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The book ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (Or, The Racial Basis of European History) by American eugenicist, lawyer, and amateur anthropologist [[Madison Grant]] was published in 1916. Though influential, the book was largely ignored when it first appeared, and it went through several revisions and editions. Nevertheless, the book was used by people who advocated restricted immigration as justification for what became known as [[scientific racism]].<ref>Lindsay, J.A. (1917).

Cartwright]] (1793\u20131863) wrote of slave escape attempts as \"[[drapetomania]]\", a treatable [[mental illness]], that \"with proper medical advice, strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many Negroes have of running away can be almost entirely prevented\". The term ''drapetomania'' (mania of the runaway slave) derives from the Greek \u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (''drapetes'', \"a runaway [slave]\") and \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 (''mania'', \"madness, frenzy\")<ref>Samual A.

The [[1840 United States Census]] claimed that Northern, free blacks suffered mental illness at higher rates than did their Southern, enslaved counterparts. Though the census was later found to have been severely flawed by the [[American Statistical Association]], to [[John Quincy Adams]] and others it became a political weapon against [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]]. Southern slavers concluded that escaping Negroes were suffering from \"mental disorders\".<ref name=\"Higgins, 1994\">Higgins, 1994</ref><ref>See also the article + references for [[John Wingate Thornton]]</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365), the matter of [[miscegenation]] prompted studies of ostensible physiological differences between [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] and [[Negro]]es. Early [[anthropology|anthropologists]], such as [[Josiah Clark Nott]], [[George Robins Gliddon]], [[Robert Knox]], and [[Samuel George Morton]], aimed to scientifically prove that Negroes were a human species different from the white people species; that the rulers of [[Ancient Egypt]] were not [[Africa]]n; and that mixed-race offspring (the product of miscegenation) tended to physical weakness and infertility. After the Civil War, Southern (Confederacy) physicians wrote textbooks of scientific racism based upon studies claiming that black freemen (ex-slaves) were becoming extinct, because they were inadequate to the demands of being a free man\u2014implying that black people benefited from enslavement.\n\nIn ''Medical Apartheid'', Harriet A. Washington noted the prevalence of two different views on blacks in the 19th century: the belief that they were inferior and \"riddled with imperfections from head to toe\", and the idea that they didn't know true pain and suffering because of their primitive nervous systems (and that slavery was therefore justifiable). Washington noted the failure of scientists to accept the inconsistency between these two viewpoints, writing that \"in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scientific racism was simply science, and it was promulgated by the very best minds at the most prestigious institutions of the nation. Other, more logical medical theories stressed the equality of Africans and laid poor black health at the feet of their abusers, but these never enjoyed the appeal of the medical philosophy that justified slavery and, along with it, our nation's profitable way of life.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apGhwRt6A7QC&pg=PA42|title=Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present|page=42|last=Washington|first=Harriet A.|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|date=2008|isbn=978-0767929394}}</ref>\n\nEven after the end of the Civil War, some scientists continued to justify the institution of slavery by citing the effect of topography and climate on racial development. [[Nathaniel Shaler]], a prominent geologist at [[Harvard University]] from 1869-1906, published the book ''Man and the Earth'' in 1905 describing the physical geography of different continents and linking these geologic settings to the intelligence and strength of human races that inhabited these spaces.

In South Africa, white scientists, like Dudly Kidd, who published ''The essential Kafir'' in 1904, sought to \"understand the African mind\". They believed that the cultural differences between whites and blacks in South Africa might be caused by physiological differences in the brain. Rather than suggesting that Africans were \"overgrown children\", as early white explorers had, Kidd believed that Africans were \"misgrown with a vengeance\".

[[Alfred Ploetz]] (1860\u20131940) coined the term ''Rassenhygiene'' in ''Racial Hygiene Basics'' (1895), and founded the [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]] in 1905. The movement advocated [[selective breeding]], [[compulsory sterilization]], and a close alignment of [[public health]] with [[eugenics]].\n\nRacial hygiene was historically tied to traditional notions of [[public health]], but with emphasis on [[heredity]]\u2014what philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]] has called [[state racism]]. In 1869, [[Francis Galton]] (1822\u20131911) proposed the first social measures meant to preserve or enhance biological characteristics, and later coined the term \"eugenics\". Galton, a [[statistics|statistician]], introduced [[correlation]] and [[regression analysis]] and discovered [[regression toward the mean]]. He was also the first to study human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]] with statistical methods. He introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|surveys]] to collect data on [[population]] sets, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies. Galton also founded [[psychometrics]], the science of measuring mental faculties, and [[differential psychology]], a branch of psychology concerned with psychological differences between people rather than common traits.\n\nLike scientific racism, eugenics grew popular in the early 20th century, and both ideas influenced [[Nazi racial policies]] and [[Nazi eugenics]]. In 1901, Galton, [[Karl Pearson]] (1857\u20131936) and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter F.R. Weldon]] (1860\u20131906) founded the ''[[Biometrika]]'' scientific journal, which promoted [[biometrics]] and statistical analysis of [[heredity]]. [[Charles Davenport]] (1866\u20131944) was briefly involved in the review. In ''Race Crossing in Jamaica'' (1929), he made statistical arguments that biological and cultural degradation followed white and black [[miscegenation|interbreeding]]. Davenport was connected to [[Nazi Germany]] before and during [[World War II]]. In 1939 he wrote a contribution to the ''festschrift'' for [[Otto Reche]] (1879\u20131966), who became an important figure within the plan to remove populations considered \"inferior\" from eastern Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|K\u00fchl|1994}}</ref>\n\n==Interbellum to World War II==\nScientific racism continued through the early 20th century, and soon [[intelligence testing]] became a new source for racial comparisons. Before [[World War II]] (1939\u201345), scientific racism remained common to [[anthropology]], and was used as justification for [[eugenics]] programs, [[compulsory sterilization]], [[anti-miscegenation laws]], and [[immigration law|immigration restrictions]] in Europe and the United States. The [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] of [[Nazi Germany]] (1933\u201345) discredited scientific racism in academia,{{citation needed| date=July 2016}} but racist legislation based upon it remained in some countries until the late 1960s.\n\n===Early intelligence testing and the Immigration Act of 1924===\n\nBefore the 1920s, social scientists agreed that whites were superior to blacks, but they needed a way to prove this in order to back social policy in favor of whites.

Franco contested the findings of Snyderman and Herrnstein. Franco stated that even though Snyderman and Herrnstein reported that the data collected from the results of the intelligence tests were in no way used to pass The Immigration Act of 1924, the IQ test results were still taken into consideration by legislators. As suggestive evidence, Franco pointed to the following fact: Following the passage of the immigration act, information from the 1890 census was used to set quotas based on percentages of immigrants coming from different countries. Based on these data, the legislature restricted the entrance of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe into the United States and allowed more immigrants from northern and Western Europe into the country. The use of the 1900, 1910 or 1920 census data sets would have resulted in larger numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe being allowed into the U.S. However, Franco pointed out that using the 1890 census data allowed congress to exclude southern and eastern Europeans (who performed worse on IQ tests of the time than did western and northern Europeans) from the U.S. Franco argued that the work Snyderman and Herrnstein conducted on this matter neither proved or disproved that intelligence testing influenced immigration laws.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Franco, J.N.|title=Intelligence tests and social policy|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=64|issue=4|pages=278\u20139|year=1985|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1985.tb01101.x}}</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:Dean's house Uppsala Sweden 001.JPG|thumb|180px|The Swedish [[Statens institut f\u00f6r rasbiologi|''State institute for racial biology'']], founded in 1922, was the world's first government-funded institute performing research into racial biology.

Proponents of these quotas, who sought to block \"undesirable\" immigrants, justifying restrictions by invoking scientific racism.<ref>Christa Wirth, ''Memories of Belonging: Descendants of Italian Migrants to the United States, 1884\u2013Present'' ([[Brill Publishers]], 2015), pp. 190, 198.</ref>\n\n[[Lothrop Stoddard]] published many racialist books on what he saw as the peril of immigration, his most famous being ''The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy'' in 1920. In this book he presented a view of the world situation pertaining to race focusing concern on the coming population explosion among the \"colored\" peoples of the world and the way in which \"white world-supremacy\" was being lessened in the wake of World War I and the collapse of colonialism.\n\nStoddard's analysis divided world politics and situations into \"white\", \"yellow\", \"black\", \"Amerindian\", and \"brown\" peoples and their interactions. Stoddard argued race and heredity were the guiding factors of history and civilization, and that the elimination or absorption of the \"white\" race by \"colored\" races would result in the destruction of Western civilization. Like Madison Grant, Stoddard divided the white race into three main divisions: Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. He considered all three to be of good stock, and far above the quality of the colored races, but argued that the Nordic was the greatest of the three and needed to be preserved by way of eugenics. Unlike Grant, Stoddard was less concerned with which varieties of European people were superior to others (Nordic theory), but was more concerned with what he called \"bi-racialism\", seeing the world as being composed of simply \"colored\" and \"white\" races. In the years after the Great Migration and World War I, Grant's racial theory would fall out of favor in the U.S. in favor of a model closer to Stoddard's.{{citation needed| date=July 2016}}\n\nAn influential publication was ''[[The Races of Europe (1939 book)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1939) by [[Carleton S.

Scientific racism was common during the period from [[17th century|1600s]] to the end of [[World War II]]. Since the second half of the 20th century, scientific racism has been criticized as obsolete and discredited, yet historically has persistently been used to support or validate racist world-views, based upon belief in the existence and significance of racial categories and a hierarchy of superior and inferior races.<ref>Cf. Patricia Hill Collins, ''Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment'' (2nd ed., 2000), Glossary, p. 300: \"Scientific racism was designed to prove the inferiority of people of color\"; Simon During, ''Cultural studies: a critical introduction'' (2005), p. 163: \"It [''sc. scientific racism''] became such a powerful idea because ... it helped legitimate the domination of the globe by whites\"; David Brown and Clive Webb, ''Race in the American South: From Slavery to Civil Rights'' (2007), p. 75: \"...the idea of a hierarchy of races was driven by an influential, secular, scientific discourse in the second half of the eighteenth century and was rapidly disseminated during the nineteenth century\".</ref>\n\nAfter the end of World War II, scientific racism in theory and action was formally denounced, especially in [[UNESCO]]'s early [[Anti-racism#Scientific anti-racism|antiracist]] statement \"[[The Race Question]]\" (1950): \"The biological fact of race and the myth of 'race' should be distinguished.

[[Monogenism]] contends that all races have a single origin, while [[polygenism]] is the idea that each race has a separate origin. Until the 18th century, the words \"race\" and \"species\" were interchangeable.<ref name=\"Jen E. Boyle 2010 page 74\">Jen E. Boyle (2010), \"Anamorphosis in Early Modern Literature: Mediation and Affect\", Ashgate, p. 74</ref>\n\n====Robert Boyle vs. Henri de Boulainvilliers====\n\nAn early scientist who studied race was [[Robert Boyle]] (1627\u20131691), an Anglo-Irish [[natural philosopher]], [[chemist]], [[physicist]], and [[inventor]]. Boyle believed in what today is called 'monogenism', that is, that all races, no matter how diverse, came from the same source, [[Adam and Eve]]. He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured [[albinos]], so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that whites could give birth to different coloured races. Theories of [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] about color and light via [[optical dispersion]] in [[physics]] were also extended by [[Robert Boyle]] into discourses of [[polygenesis (biology)|polygenesis]],<ref name=\"Jen E. Boyle 2010 page 74\"/> speculating that maybe these differences were due to \"seminal impressions\". However, Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for \"European Eyes\", beauty was not measured so much in [[colour]], but in \"stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face\".<ref>Robert Boyle (1664), \"Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours\", Henry Herringman, London, pp. 160\u201361</ref> Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as \"disturbing\" or \"amusing\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Palmeri, Frank|title=Humans And Other Animals in Eighteenth-Century British Culture: Representation, Hybridity, Ethics|year=2006|pages=49\u201367}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, historian [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]] (1658\u20131722) divided the French as two races: (i) the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] \"French race\" descended from the invader Germanic [[Franks]], and (ii) the indigenous [[Gallo-Roman]] race (the political [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] populace). The Frankish aristocracy dominated the Gauls by innate [[right of conquest]].\n\nIn his time, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]], a believer in the \"right of conquest\", did not understand \"race\" as biologically immutable, but as a contemporary cultural construct.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} His racialist account of French history was not entirely mythical: despite \"supporting\" [[hagiography|hagiographies]] and [[epic poetry]], such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' (''La Chanson de Roland'', c. 12th century), he sought [[scientific]] legitimation by basing his racialist distinction on the historical existence of genetically and linguistically distinguished Germanic and Latin-speaking peoples in France. His theoretic racialism was distinct from the biologic facts manipulated in 19th-century scientific racism.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} (''cf.'' [[Cultural relativism]])\n\n====Lord Kames====\nThe Scottish lawyer [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]] (1696\u20131782) was a [[polygenist]]: he believed God had created different races on Earth in separate regions. In his 1734 book ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.<ref name=\"Jackson05_39\">{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John P.|last2=Weidman|first2=Nadine M.|title=Race, Racism, and Science: Social Impact and Interaction|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|pages=39\u201341|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n====Carl Linnaeus====\n[[File:Urville-Patagonians3.jpg|thumb|upright|''Homo monstrosus'', or Patagonian giants, from ''Voyage au pole sud et dans l'Oc\u00e9anie'' (''Voyage to the South Pole, and in Oceania''), by [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]]]\n\n[[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707\u20131778), the Swedish physician, botanist, and zoologist, modified the established [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] bases of [[binomial nomenclature]] for fauna and flora, and was a pioneer researcher in biologically defining ''human race''.

On the one hand, the harshest critics say that the classification not only was ethnocentric but seemed to be based upon skin-color.

It would be unfair to ascribe racist motives to this effort.\"''</ref> Paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1994) argued that the taxa was ''\"not in the ranked order favored by most Europeans in the racist tradition\"'', and that Linnaeus' division was influenced by the medical [[Humorism|theory of humors]] which said that a person's temperament may be related to biological fluids.<ref>Gould, S.J.

He thought that over time because of the sun, the people turned dark skinned, or \"black\".

He believed that whites and Negroes were two different species. White was a believer in [[polygenism|polygeny]], the idea that different races had been created separately. His ''Account of the Regular Gradation in Man'' (1799) provided an empirical basis for this idea. White defended the theory of polygeny by rebutting French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]]'s interfertility argument, which said that only the same species can interbreed. White pointed to species hybrids such as foxes, wolves, and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed. For White, each race was a separate species, divinely created for its own geographical region.<ref name=Jackson05_39/>\n\n[[File:Johann Friedrich Blumenbach.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]\n\n====Buffon and Blumenbach====\nThe French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] (1707\u20131788) and the German anatomist [[Johann Blumenbach]] (1752\u20131840) were believers in [[monogenism]], the concept that all races have a single origin. They also believed in the \"degeneration theory\" of racial origins. They both said that [[Adam and Eve]] were [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors, such as the sun and poor dieting. They believed that the degeneration could be reversed if proper environmental control was taken, and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite book|first=Marvin|last=Harris|title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture|year=2001|page=84|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThey thought Negroid [[pigmentation]] arose because of the heat of the tropical sun. They suggested cold wind caused the tawny colour of the [[Eskimos]]. They thought the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] relatively fair skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns and were protected from environmental factors. Buffon said that food and the mode of living could make races degenerate and differentiate them from the original Caucasian race.<ref name=Harris/> According to Blumenbach, there are five races, all belonging to a single species: [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]], [[Ethiopia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American]], and [[Malays (ethic group)|Malay]]. Blumenbach said:\n\n<blockquote>\"I have allotted the first place to the Caucasian for the reasons given below which make me esteem it the primeval one.\"<ref>Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, ''Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader,'' 1997, p. 84</ref></blockquote>\n\nBuffon believed [[human]]ity was only 6000 years old (the time since [[Adam]]). Many scientific racialists pointed out at the time that it would have been difficult for races to change so markedly in [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]] in such a short period of time. Believing in monogenism, Buffon thought that skin colour could change in a single lifetime, depending on the conditions of climate and diet.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=86}}</ref>\n\n====Benjamin Rush====\n[[Benjamin Rush]] (1745\u20131813), a [[Founding Father of the United States]] and a [[physician]], proposed that being black was a hereditary skin disease, which he called \"negroidism\", and that it could be cured. Rush believed non-whites were really white underneath but they were stricken with a non-contagious form of leprosy which darkened their skin color. Rush drew the conclusion that \"whites should not tyrannize over [blacks], for their disease should entitle them to a double portion of humanity. However, by the same token, whites should not intermarry with them, for this would tend to infect posterity with the 'disorder'... attempts must be made to cure the disease\".<ref>Rush, Benjamin (1799). \"Observations Intended to Favour a Supposition That the Black Color (As It Is Called) of the Negroes Is Derived from the Leprosy\".

Meiner studied the physical, mental and moral characteristics of each race, and built a race hierarchy based on his findings. Meiners split mankind into two divisions, which he labelled the \"beautiful [[white race]]\" and the \"ugly [[black race]]\". In Meiners's book ''The Outline of History of Mankind'', he said that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He thought only the white race to be beautiful. He considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral and animal-like. He said that the dark, ugly peoples were distinct from the white, beautiful peoples by their \"sad\" lack of virtue and their \"terrible vices\".<ref>{{harvnb|Isaac|2006|p=150}}</ref> According to Meiners,\n\n<blockquote>The more intelligent and noble people are by nature, the more adaptable, sensitive, delicate, and soft is their body; on the other hand, the less they possess the capacity and disposition towards virtue, the more they lack adaptability; and not only that, but the less sensitive are their bodies, the more can they tolerate extreme pain or the rapid alteration of heat and cold; when they are exposed to illnesses, the more rapid their recovery from wounds that would be fatal for more sensitive peoples, and the more they can partake of the worst and most indigestible foods ... without noticeable ill effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}</blockquote>\n\nMeiners said the Negro felt less pain than any other race and lacked in emotions. Meiners wrote that the Negro had thick nerves and thus was not sensitive like the other races. He went as far as to say that the Negro has \"no human, barely any animal, feeling\". He described a story where a Negro was condemned to death by being burned alive. Halfway through the burning, the Negro asked to smoke a pipe and smoked it like nothing was happening while he continued to be burned alive. Meiners studied the [[anatomy]] of the Negro and came to the conclusion that Negroes have bigger teeth and jaws than any other race, as Negroes are all [[carnivores]]. Meiners claimed the skull of the Negro was larger but the brain of the Negro was smaller than any other race. Meiners claimed the Negro was the most unhealthy race on Earth because of  its poor diet, mode of living and lack of morals.<ref name=\"Gupta07\">{{cite book|author=Das Gupta, Tania|title=Race and Racialization: Essential Readings|year=2007|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nMeiners also claimed the \"[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]]\" were an inferior stock of people. He said they could not adapt to different climates, types of food, or modes of life, and that when exposed to such new conditions, they lapse into a \"deadly melancholy\".\nMeiners studied the diet of the Americans and said they fed off any kind of \"foul offal\". He thought they consumed very much alcohol. He believed their skulls were so thick that the blades of Spanish swords shattered on them. Meiners also claimed the skin of an American is thicker than that of an ox.<ref name=Gupta07/>\n\nMeiners wrote that the noblest race was the [[Celts]]. They were able to conquer various parts of the world, they were more sensitive to heat and cold, and their delicacy is shown by the way they are selective about what they eat. Meiners claimed that [[Slavs]] are an inferior race, \"less sensitive and content with eating rough food\". He described stories of Slavs allegedly eating poisonous fungi without coming to any harm. He claimed that their medical techniques were also backward: he used as an example their heating sick people in ovens, then making them roll in the snow.<ref name=Gupta07/>\n\nIn Meiners's large work entitled ''Researches on the Variations in Human Nature'' (1815), he studied also the [[sexology]] of each race. He claimed that the African Negroids have unduly strong and perverted sex drives, whilst only the white Europeans have it just right.\n\n===Later thinkers===\n\n====Thomas Jefferson====\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743\u20131826) was an American politician, scientist,<ref>[Thomas Jefferson, Scientist by Travis Martin](https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/08/thomas-jefferson-scientist/)</ref><ref>[Thomas Jefferson: Founding Father of Science by Ross Pomeroy](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2012/02/thomas-jefferson-citizen-scientist.html)</ref> and slave owner.

''The New York Times''.</ref> In his \"[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]\" Jefferson described black people as follows:\n\n<blockquote>They seem to require less sleep. A black, after hard labor through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the morning. They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome. But this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present. When present, they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness than the whites. They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection... Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me, that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one [black] could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid; and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous... I advance it therefore as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.<ref>[[Thomas Jefferson]], ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, by 1791, Jefferson had to reassess his earlier suspicions of whether blacks were capable of intelligence when he was presented with a letter and almanac from [[Benjamin Banneker]], an educated black mathematician. Delighted to have discovered scientific proof for the existence of black intelligence, Jefferson wrote to Banneker:\n\n<blockquote>No body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colors of men, & that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa & America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body & mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. <ref> (Jefferson\u2019s Letter to Benjamin Banneker, August 30, 1791.

Cuvier believed there were three distinct races: the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] (white), [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] (yellow) and the [[Ethiopia]]n (black). He rated each for the beauty or ugliness of the skull and quality of their civilizations. Cuvier wrote about Caucasians: \"The white race, with oval face, straight hair and nose, to which the civilised people of Europe belong and which appear to us the most beautiful of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage and activity\".<ref>Georges Cuvier, ''Tableau elementaire de l'histoire naturelle des animaux'' (Paris, 1798) p. 71</ref>\n\nRegarding Negroes, Cuvier wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The Negro race ... is marked by black complexion, crisped or woolly hair, compressed cranium and a flat nose. The projection of the lower parts of the face, and the thick lips, evidently approximate it to the monkey tribe: the hordes of which it consists have always remained in the most complete state of barbarism.<ref>Georges Cuvier, ''The Animal Kingdom: Arranged in Conformity with its Organization,'' Translated from the French by H.M. Murtrie, p. 50.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe thought [[Adam and Eve]] were Caucasian and hence the original race of mankind. The other two races arose by survivors' escaping in different directions after a major catastrophe hit the earth 5,000 years ago.

All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention, because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers, and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want, and misery, which, in their many forms, were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] of nature, and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>[[Schopenhauer]], ''Parerga and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Franz Ignaz Pruner====\n[[Franz Ignaz Pruner]] (1808\u20131882) was a medical doctor who studied the racial structure of Negroes in Egypt. In a book which he wrote in 1846 he claimed that Negro blood had a negative influence on the Egyptian moral character. He published a monograph on Negroes in 1861. He claimed that the main feature of the Negro's skeleton is [[prognathism]], which he claimed was the Negro's relation to the ape. He also claimed that Negroes had very similar brains to apes and that Negroes have a shortened big toe, which is a characteristic connecting Negroes closely to apes.<ref>[[Gustav Jahoda]], ''Images of Savages: Ancients [sic] Roots of Modern Prejudice in Western Culture'', 1999, p. 82</ref>\n\n==Racial theories in physical anthropology, 1850\u20131918==\n{{Further|Historical definitions of race}}\n[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|a late-19th-century illustration by H.

Breaks often occur in all parts of the series, some being wide, sharp and defined, others less so in various degrees; as between the [[Orangutan|orang]] and its nearest allies\u2014between the [[Tarsius]] and the other [[Lemuridae]] between the elephant, and in a more striking manner between the [[Ornithorhynchus]] or [[Echidna]], and all other mammals. But these breaks depend merely on the number of related forms which have become extinct. At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as [[Hermann Schaaffhausen|Professor Schaaffhausen]] has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a [[baboon]], instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the [[gorilla]].|''The Descent of Man'' (1871), Volume I, Chapter VI: \"On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man\", pp. 200\u201301}}\n\nIn the Chapter \"''On the Development of the Intellectual and Moral Faculties during Primeval and Civilised Times''\" Darwin claimed that \"the western nations of Europe, who now so immeasurably surpass their former savage progenitors, and stand at the summit of civilisation, owe little or none of their superiority to direct inheritance from the old Greeks\".<ref>The Descent of Man, (Second edition, 1874) p. 141</ref>\n\nWhile proposing a sole human species, Darwin contrasted the \"civilized races\" with the \"savage races\".

But it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of structural difference. The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation, and in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual, faculties. Every one who has had the opportunity of comparison, must have been struck with the contrast between the taciturn, even morose, aborigines of S. America and the light-hearted, talkative negroes. There is a nearly similar contrast between the Malays and the Papuans, who live under the same physical conditions, and are separated from each other only by a narrow space of sea.<ref>''The Descent of Man'', (First edition, 1871) pp. 216\u201317</ref>}}\n\n===Arthur de Gobineau===\n[[File:Arthur de Gobineau.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] by the Comtesse de la Tour, 1876]]\nThe French aristocrat and writer [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816\u20131882), is best known for his book ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853\u201355) which proposed three human races (black, white and yellow) were natural barriers and claimed that [[miscegenation|race mixing]] would lead to the collapse of culture and civilization.

His works were praised by many white supremacist American pro-slavery thinkers such as Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze.\n\nGobineau believed that the different races originated in different areas, the white race had originated somewhere in Siberia, the Asians in the Americas and the blacks in Africa. He believed that the white race was superior, writing:\n{{quote|I will not wait for the friends of equality to show me such and such passages in books written by missionaries or sea captains, who declare some Wolof is a fine carpenter, some Hottentot a good servant, that a Kaffir dances and plays the violin, that some Bambara knows arithmetic\u2026 Let us leave aside these puerilities and compare together not men, but groups.<ref>D'Souza, Dinesh \"Is Racism a Western Idea?\" pp. 517\u201339 from The American Scholar, Vol. 64, No. 4 Autumn 1995, p.538</ref>}}\n\nGobineau later used the term \"[[Aryan race|Aryans]]\" to describe the Germanic peoples (''la race germanique'').<ref>A.

These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction.<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|Weidman|2005|p=87}}</ref> Haeckel was also an advocate of the [[out of Asia theory]] by writing that the origin of humanity was to be found in [[Asia]]; he believed that [[Hindustan]] (South Asia) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved.

Such institutional racism was effected via [[Phrenology]], telling character from physiognomy; [[craniometry|craniometric]] skull and skeleton studies; thus skulls and skeletons of black people and other colored ''volk'', were displayed between apes and white men.\n\nIn 1906, [[Ota Benga]], a [[Pygmies|Pygmy]], was displayed as the \"Missing Link\", in the [[Bronx Zoo]], New York City, alongside apes and animals. The most influential theorists included the anthropologist [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854\u20131936) who proposed \"anthroposociology\"; and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744\u20131803), who applied \"race\" to [[nationalist]] theory, thereby developing the first conception of [[ethnic nationalism]]. In 1882, [[Ernest Renan]] contradicted Herder with a nationalism based upon the \"will to live together\", not founded upon ethnic or racial prerequisites. Scientific racist discourse posited the historical existence of \"national races\" such as the ''[[German people|Deutsche Volk]]'' in Germany, and the \"French race\" being a branch of the basal \"[[Aryan race]]\" extant for millennia, to advocate for [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] borders parallel to the racial ones.\n\n===Craniometry and physical anthropology===\n{{Further|Craniometry |physical anthropology}}\n[[File:Petrus-Camper-(professor).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Pieter Camper]]\n\nThe Dutch scholar [[Pieter Camper]] (1722\u201389), an early craniometric theoretician, used \"craniometry\" (interior skull-volume measurement) to scientifically justify racial differences. In 1770, he conceived of the [[facial angle]] to measure intelligence among species of men. The facial angle was formed by drawing two lines: a horizontal line from nostril to ear; and a vertical line from the upper-jawbone prominence to the forehead prominence. Camper's craniometry reported that antique statues (the Gr\u00e6co\u2013Roman ideal) had a 90-degree facial angle, whites an 80-degree angle, blacks a 70-degree angle, and the [[orangutan]] a 58-degree facial angle\u2014thus he established a racist biological hierarchy for mankind, per the [[decadence|Decadent]] conception of history. Such scientific racist researches were continued by the naturalist [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1772\u20131844) and the anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] (1824\u20131880).\n\n====Samuel George Morton====\n[[File:Morton drawing.png|right|thumb|Racialist differences: \"a Negro head ... a Caucasian skull ... a Mongol head\", [[Samuel George Morton]], 1839.]]\n\nIn the 19th century, an early American [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]], physician and polygenist [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799\u20131851), collected human skulls from worldwide, and attempted a logical classification scheme. Influenced by contemporary racialist theory, Dr Morton said he could judge racial intellectual capacity by measuring the interior [[cranial capacity]], hence a large skull denoted a large brain, thus high [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] capacity. Conversely, a small skull denoted a small brain, thus low intellectual capacity; superior and inferior established. After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since interpretations of the bible indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]] only a thousand years earlier, Morton claimed that Noah's sons could not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.<ref name=\"DavidHurst\">David Hurst Thomas, ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, And The Battle For Native American Identity'', 2001, pp. 38\u201341</ref>\n\nIn Morton's ''Crania Americana'', his claims were based on [[Craniometry]] data, that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Native Americans were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches.<ref name=\"DavidHurst\" />\n\nIn ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), the [[History of science|historian of science]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that Samuel Morton had falsified the craniometric data, perhaps inadvertently over-packing some skulls, to so produce results that would legitimize the racist presumptions he was attempting to prove.

Moreover, Morton himself had been reluctant to espouse polygenism, because it [[Theology|theologically]] challenged the Christian [[creation myth]] espoused in the Bible.\n\nLater, in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), Charles Darwin proposed the [[single-origin hypothesis]], i.e., [[monogenism]]\u2014mankind has a common genetic ancestry, the races are related, opposing everything that the polygenism of Nott and Gliddon proposed.\n\n===Typologies===\n{{Further|Race (historical definitions)}}\n[[File:Ripley map of cephalic index in Europe.png|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Cephalic Index [[William Z.

Furthermore, he proposed that the concept of \"race\" was ambiguous, and in its stead proposed the compound word \"[[ethnic group]]\", which later prominently featured in the works of [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Alfred C.

Having adopted Ripley's three-race European populace model, but disliking the \"Teuton\" race name, he transliterated ''la race nordique'' into \"The Nordic race\", the acme of the concocted racial hierarchy, based upon his racial classification theory, popular in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\n[[Statens Institut f\u00f6r Rasbiologi]] and its director [[Herman Lundborg]] in [[Sweden]] were active in racist research.  Furthermore, much of early research on [[Ural-Altaic languages]] was coloured by attempts at justifying the view that European peoples east of Sweden were Asian and thus of inferior race, justifying colonialism, eugenics and racial hygiene.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The book ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (Or, The Racial Basis of European History) by American eugenicist, lawyer, and amateur anthropologist [[Madison Grant]] was published in 1916. Though influential, the book was largely ignored when it first appeared, and it went through several revisions and editions. Nevertheless, the book was used by people who advocated restricted immigration as justification for what became known as [[scientific racism]].<ref>Lindsay, J.A. (1917).

The term ''drapetomania'' (mania of the runaway slave) derives from the Greek \u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (''drapetes'', \"a runaway [slave]\") and \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 (''mania'', \"madness, frenzy\")<ref>Samual A.

The [[1840 United States Census]] claimed that Northern, free blacks suffered mental illness at higher rates than did their Southern, enslaved counterparts. Though the census was later found to have been severely flawed by the [[American Statistical Association]], to [[John Quincy Adams]] and others it became a political weapon against [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]]. Southern slavers concluded that escaping Negroes were suffering from \"mental disorders\".<ref name=\"Higgins, 1994\">Higgins, 1994</ref><ref>See also the article + references for [[John Wingate Thornton]]</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365), the matter of [[miscegenation]] prompted studies of ostensible physiological differences between [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] and [[Negro]]es. Early [[anthropology|anthropologists]], such as [[Josiah Clark Nott]], [[George Robins Gliddon]], [[Robert Knox]], and [[Samuel George Morton]], aimed to scientifically prove that Negroes were a human species different from the white people species; that the rulers of [[Ancient Egypt]] were not [[Africa]]n; and that mixed-race offspring (the product of miscegenation) tended to physical weakness and infertility. After the Civil War, Southern (Confederacy) physicians wrote textbooks of scientific racism based upon studies claiming that black freemen (ex-slaves) were becoming extinct, because they were inadequate to the demands of being a free man\u2014implying that black people benefited from enslavement.\n\nIn ''Medical Apartheid'', Harriet A. Washington noted the prevalence of two different views on blacks in the 19th century: the belief that they were inferior and \"riddled with imperfections from head to toe\", and the idea that they didn't know true pain and suffering because of their primitive nervous systems (and that slavery was therefore justifiable). Washington noted the failure of scientists to accept the inconsistency between these two viewpoints, writing that \"in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scientific racism was simply science, and it was promulgated by the very best minds at the most prestigious institutions of the nation. Other, more logical medical theories stressed the equality of Africans and laid poor black health at the feet of their abusers, but these never enjoyed the appeal of the medical philosophy that justified slavery and, along with it, our nation's profitable way of life.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apGhwRt6A7QC&pg=PA42|title=Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present|page=42|last=Washington|first=Harriet A.|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|date=2008|isbn=978-0767929394}}</ref>\n\nEven after the end of the Civil War, some scientists continued to justify the institution of slavery by citing the effect of topography and climate on racial development. [[Nathaniel Shaler]], a prominent geologist at [[Harvard University]] from 1869-1906, published the book ''Man and the Earth'' in 1905 describing the physical geography of different continents and linking these geologic settings to the intelligence and strength of human races that inhabited these spaces.

They believed that the cultural differences between whites and blacks in South Africa might be caused by physiological differences in the brain.

[[Alfred Ploetz]] (1860\u20131940) coined the term ''Rassenhygiene'' in ''Racial Hygiene Basics'' (1895), and founded the [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]] in 1905. The movement advocated [[selective breeding]], [[compulsory sterilization]], and a close alignment of [[public health]] with [[eugenics]].\n\nRacial hygiene was historically tied to traditional notions of [[public health]], but with emphasis on [[heredity]]\u2014what philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]] has called [[state racism]]. In 1869, [[Francis Galton]] (1822\u20131911) proposed the first social measures meant to preserve or enhance biological characteristics, and later coined the term \"eugenics\". Galton, a [[statistics|statistician]], introduced [[correlation]] and [[regression analysis]] and discovered [[regression toward the mean]]. He was also the first to study human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]] with statistical methods. He introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|surveys]] to collect data on [[population]] sets, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies. Galton also founded [[psychometrics]], the science of measuring mental faculties, and [[differential psychology]], a branch of psychology concerned with psychological differences between people rather than common traits.\n\nLike scientific racism, eugenics grew popular in the early 20th century, and both ideas influenced [[Nazi racial policies]] and [[Nazi eugenics]]. In 1901, Galton, [[Karl Pearson]] (1857\u20131936) and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter F.R. Weldon]] (1860\u20131906) founded the ''[[Biometrika]]'' scientific journal, which promoted [[biometrics]] and statistical analysis of [[heredity]]. [[Charles Davenport]] (1866\u20131944) was briefly involved in the review.

Franco contested the findings of Snyderman and Herrnstein. Franco stated that even though Snyderman and Herrnstein reported that the data collected from the results of the intelligence tests were in no way used to pass The Immigration Act of 1924, the IQ test results were still taken into consideration by legislators. As suggestive evidence, Franco pointed to the following fact: Following the passage of the immigration act, information from the 1890 census was used to set quotas based on percentages of immigrants coming from different countries. Based on these data, the legislature restricted the entrance of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe into the United States and allowed more immigrants from northern and Western Europe into the country. The use of the 1900, 1910 or 1920 census data sets would have resulted in larger numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe being allowed into the U.S. However, Franco pointed out that using the 1890 census data allowed congress to exclude southern and eastern Europeans (who performed worse on IQ tests of the time than did western and northern Europeans) from the U.S. Franco argued that the work Snyderman and Herrnstein conducted on this matter neither proved or disproved that intelligence testing influenced immigration laws.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Franco, J.N.|title=Intelligence tests and social policy|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=64|issue=4|pages=278\u20139|year=1985|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1985.tb01101.x}}</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\n[[File:Dean's house Uppsala Sweden 001.JPG|thumb|180px|The Swedish [[Statens institut f\u00f6r rasbiologi|''State institute for racial biology'']], founded in 1922, was the world's first government-funded institute performing research into racial biology.

In this book he presented a view of the world situation pertaining to race focusing concern on the coming population explosion among the \"colored\" peoples of the world and the way in which \"white world-supremacy\" was being lessened in the wake of World War I and the collapse of colonialism.\n\nStoddard's analysis divided world politics and situations into \"white\", \"yellow\", \"black\", \"Amerindian\", and \"brown\" peoples and their interactions. Stoddard argued race and heredity were the guiding factors of history and civilization, and that the elimination or absorption of the \"white\" race by \"colored\" races would result in the destruction of Western civilization. Like Madison Grant, Stoddard divided the white race into three main divisions: Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. He considered all three to be of good stock, and far above the quality of the colored races, but argued that the Nordic was the greatest of the three and needed to be preserved by way of eugenics. Unlike Grant, Stoddard was less concerned with which varieties of European people were superior to others (Nordic theory), but was more concerned with what he called \"bi-racialism\", seeing the world as being composed of simply \"colored\" and \"white\" races. In the years after the Great Migration and World War I, Grant's racial theory would fall out of favor in the U.S. in favor of a model closer to Stoddard's.{{citation needed| date=July 2016}}\n\nAn influential publication was ''[[The Races of Europe (1939 book)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1939) by [[Carleton S.

{"title_page": "1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement", "text_new": "<br />\n{{Short description|Nuclear weapons security pact}}\n\n\nThe 1958 '''US\u2013UK Mutual Defense Agreement''', or '''UK\u2013US Mutual Defence Agreement''', is a [[bilateral treaty]] between the United States and the United Kingdom on [[nuclear weapon]]s co-operation. The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (second from right) and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] (left foreground) meet for talks in Bermuda in March 1957 to repair the rift created by the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].]]\nAt the three-power Bermuda Conference in December 1953, Eisenhower and Churchill,{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=200\u2013201}} who had become prime minister again on 25 October 1951,{{sfn|Farmelo|2013|pp=372\u2013375}} discussed the possibility of the United States giving Britain access to American nuclear weapons in wartime.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=200\u2013201}} This came to be called [[Project E]].{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}} There were technical and legal issues that had to be overcome before American bombs could be carried in British aircraft. The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK. He ordered extra copies of the report into the fire to be destroyed, and for the printers to destroy their [[Letterpress printing|type]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Britain Suppressed Details of '57 Atomic Disaster: Macmillan feared the loss of U.S. cooperation |first=Steve |last=Lohr |date=2 January 1988 |p=3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/02/world/britain-suppressed-details-of-57-atomic-disaster.html |access-date=18 August 2019 }}</ref> He immediately sensed how shaken the Americans had been by Sputnik.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of IRBMs by a shocked and distraught nation.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nEisenhower and Macmillan agreed to form a study group headed by Sir Richard Powell, the Permanent Secretary to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and [[Donald A. Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

Standing are (left to right): [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Earl of Athlone]] ([[Governor General of Canada]]), [[Mackenzie King]] ([[Prime Minister of Canada]]), Sir [[Alexander Cadogan]], and [[Brendan Bracken]].]]\nDuring the early part of the [[Second World War]], Britain had a [[nuclear weapons]] project, codenamed [[Tube Alloys]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=108\u2013111}} At the [[Quadrant Conference]] in August 1943, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Winston Churchill]], and the [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin Roosevelt]], signed the [[Quebec Agreement]], which merged Tube Alloys with the American [[Manhattan Project]] to create a combined British, American and Canadian project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=277}} The Quebec Agreement established the [[Combined Policy Committee]] and the [[Combined Development Trust]] to co-ordinate their efforts.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=285\u2013286}} Many of Britain's top scientists [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|participated in the Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=236\u2013242}}\n\nThe September 1944 [[Hyde Park Aide-M\u00e9moire]] extended both commercial and military co-operation into the post-war period,{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=340\u2013342}} but Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and it was not binding on subsequent administrations.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=72\u201373}} In fact, it was physically lost. When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D.

The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK.

Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted. Only Britain qualified as a nation that had made substantial progress.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=232\u2013233}} The bill passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and was signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=234\u2013236}} The 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed by Dulles and [[Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]], the British Minister in Washington, DC, on 3 July,<ref name=\"full text\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/56_4.pdf |title=Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=1 June 2017 }}</ref> and approved by Congress on 30 July.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=238}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Details of the agreement===\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080709-D-7203C-008.jpg|thumb|left|UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] (right) addresses a reception hosted by US Defense Secretary [[Robert M.

{"title_page": "Micro-series", "text_new": "{{tone|date=July 2018}}\nA '''micro-series''' (also microseries) is a very short [[Episode|episodic]] [[television program]]ming \nnarrative sponsored by an [[advertiser]]. This is a non-traditional way of reaching primary markets. A micro-series is intended to promote a product while engaging viewers with entertaining content. These episodes are generally two to three minutes long and often run during commercial breaks of popular television programs. After each air date, they are also available online and on mobile devices.\n\n== Popular micro-series ==\nEven if it doesn't have a wide audience, a micro-series creates buzz, especially if it is interactive, as in the case of CBS's 2006 micro-series ''[[The Courier (micro-series)|The Courier]]''.\nSometimes a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] micro-series is created from a popular TV show, for example, [[NBC]]'s prime-time hit, ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''. In November 2008, [[Sprint Nextel]] sponsored a four-episode micro-series called Heroes: Destiny on mobile, online and television. Each five- to seven-minute episode debuted on Monday nights.

The band, commonly known by the initials APTBS, play a heavy, atmospheric [[wall of sound]]-influenced blend of [[psychedelic rock]], [[shoegaze]] and [[space rock]].\n\n==History==\n===Early days===\nA Place to Bury Strangers were formed in 2002 by David Goffan and Tim Gregorio. Current frontman and guitarist Ackermann had moved to New York following the disbanding of his previous group, Skywave, to join APTBS, and become the primary songwriter after the departure of Goffan. They played their first show at Luxx in [[Brooklyn]] in 2003. Jason \"Jay Space\" Weilmeister and Jonathan \"Jono Mofo\" Smith, both from the New York City-based band Mofo, joined the band when Gregorio left. In 2006, APTBS self-released three different EPs, handmade with different color schemes: ''Breathe'', ''Missing You'' and ''Never Going Down''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/A-Place-To-Bury-Strangers-A-Place-To-Bury-Strangers/release/3749678 |title=A Place To Bury Strangers - A Place To Bury Strangers (Vinyl, LP, LP) at Discogs |website=Discogs.com |date=2008-11-03 |accessdate=2015-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, APTBS gained acclaim following their [[Webster Hall]] performance with [[the Brian Jonestown Massacre]]. The band returned to Webster Hall in 2007 to play with one of their major influences, [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]].

In November 2008, the band returned to Europe and the UK on tour supporting [[MGMT]].\n\n===''Exploding Head''===\nIn early 2009, APTBS signed to [[Mute Records]]. The band also announced another European tour and appearances at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], [[Seaport Music Festival]] and [[Siren Music Festival]].\n\nTheir second album, ''[[Exploding Head]]'', was released by Mute in October 2009.\n\nIn spring 2010, Smith decided to leave APTBS for personal reasons rather than participate in their US tour supporting [[the Big Pink]].

The band, commonly known by the initials APTBS, play a heavy, atmospheric [[wall of sound]]-influenced blend of [[psychedelic rock]], [[shoegaze]] and [[space rock]].\n\n==History==\n===Early days===\nA Place to Bury Strangers were formed in 2002 by David Goffan and Tim Gregorio. Current frontman and guitarist Ackermann had moved to New York following the disbanding of his previous group, Skywave, to join APTBS, and become the primary songwriter after the departure of Goffan. They played their first show at Luxx in [[Brooklyn]] in 2003. Jason \"Jay Space\" Weilmeister and Jonathan \"Jono Mofo\" Smith, both from the New York City-based band Mofo, joined the band when Gregorio left. In 2006, APTBS self-released three different EPs, handmade with different color schemes: ''Breathe'', ''Missing You'' and ''Never Going Down''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/A-Place-To-Bury-Strangers-A-Place-To-Bury-Strangers/release/3749678 |title=A Place To Bury Strangers - A Place To Bury Strangers (Vinyl, LP, LP) at Discogs |website=Discogs.com |date=2008-11-03 |accessdate=2015-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, APTBS gained acclaim following their [[Webster Hall]] performance with [[the Brian Jonestown Massacre]].
