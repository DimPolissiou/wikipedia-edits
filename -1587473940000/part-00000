Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.\n\nBibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.\n\n== Concept ==\nA '''[https://english-biography.com/ bibliographic citation]''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |website= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}</ref> Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].\n\n== Content ==\nCitation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:\n* ''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905125227/http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).\n* ''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.\n* ''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.\n* ''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452.

Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.</ref>\n\n=== Vancouver system ===\n{{main|Vancouver system}}\nThe Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.\n\nFor example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:\n\n:\"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.\"<sup>1</sup>\n\nThe note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:\n\n:1. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45\u201360.\n\nIn a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:\n\n:1. K\u00fcbler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45\u201360.\n\nThe bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:\n\n:K\u00fcbler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.\n\nIn the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Parenthetical referencing ===\n{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}\nParenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nAn example of a parenthetical reference:\n:\"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance\" (K\u00fcbler-Ross, 1969, pp. 45\u201360).\n\nDepending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called \"References\", \"Bibliography\", \"Works cited\" or \"Works consulted\".\n\nIn-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].<ref>[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.</ref> This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.\n\n=== Citation-name system ===\nSuperscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation\u2010sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.\n\n== Styles ==\n{{styles}}\n{{Main|APA style|MLA style|The Chicago Manual of Style|Bluebook|ALWD Citation Manual|ASA style|Harvard referencing|Vancouver system}}\n\nCitation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats & Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}</ref> The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.\n\nA number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.\n\n=== Humanities ===\n* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style\u2014which derives from it\u2014is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.\n* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.\n* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.<ref name=\"evidence\">Elizabeth Shown Mills. ''Evidence Explained : Citing History Sources from Artifacts to cyberspace.'' 2d ed. Baltimore:Genealogical Pub. Co., 2009.</ref>\n* [[Harvard referencing]] (or author-date system) is a specific kind of [[parenthetical referencing]]. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., \"(Smith, 2000)\", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.\n* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English (\"[[foreign languages]]\"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a \"Works Cited\" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as \"[[APA style]]\".}}\n* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the United Kingdom, where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the United States. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.<ref>The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.\n</ref>\n\nIn some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term \"footnote\" is actually used as a synonym for \"reference\", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.\n\n=== Law ===\n{{Main|Legal citation}}\n* The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}</ref> At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.\n* The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.</ref>\n* British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).\n\n=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===\n* The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.\n* In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.\n* Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an \"''Authorship trigraph.''\"\n* The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.\n** In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.\n** The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.<ref>[http://www.icmje.org \"Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals\"].</ref>  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides \"ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] \u2013 Sample References\".<ref>International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html \"ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals \u2013 Sample References\"].</ref>\n* The AMA Style.\n* The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924043706/http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}. Retrieved 2015-02-16.</ref>\n* In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.\n* Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed.

APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.\n* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.<ref name=APSA>Stephen Yoder, ed.

Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a \"half-life\", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.<ref>Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V.

Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.\n\nBibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.\n\n== Concept ==\nA '''bibliographic citation''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |website= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}</ref> Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].\n\n== Content ==\nCitation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:\n* ''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905125227/http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).\n* ''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.\n* ''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.\n* ''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452.

Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.</ref>\n\n=== Vancouver system ===\n{{main|Vancouver system}}\nThe Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.\n\nFor example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:\n\n:\"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.\"<sup>1</sup>\n\nThe note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:\n\n:1. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45\u201360.\n\nIn a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:\n\n:1. K\u00fcbler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45\u201360.\n\nThe bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:\n\n:K\u00fcbler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.\n\nIn the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Parenthetical referencing ===\n{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}\nParenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nAn example of a parenthetical reference:\n:\"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance\" (K\u00fcbler-Ross, 1969, pp. 45\u201360).\n\nDepending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called \"References\", \"Bibliography\", \"Works cited\" or \"Works consulted\".\n\nIn-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].<ref>[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.</ref> This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.\n\n=== Citation-name system ===\nSuperscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation\u2010sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.\n\n== Styles ==\n{{styles}}\n{{Main|APA style|MLA style|The Chicago Manual of Style|Bluebook|ALWD Citation Manual|ASA style|Harvard referencing|Vancouver system}}\n\nCitation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats & Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}</ref> The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.\n\nA number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.\n\n=== Humanities ===\n* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style\u2014which derives from it\u2014is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.\n* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.\n* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.<ref name=\"evidence\">Elizabeth Shown Mills.

Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., \"(Smith, 2000)\", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.\n* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English (\"[[foreign languages]]\"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a \"Works Cited\" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as \"[[APA style]]\".}}\n* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the United Kingdom, where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the United States. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.<ref>The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.\n</ref>\n\nIn some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term \"footnote\" is actually used as a synonym for \"reference\", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.\n\n=== Law ===\n{{Main|Legal citation}}\n* The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}</ref> At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.\n* The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.</ref>\n* British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).\n\n=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===\n* The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.\n* In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.\n* Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an \"''Authorship trigraph.''\"\n* The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.\n** In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.\n** The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.<ref>[http://www.icmje.org \"Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals\"].</ref>  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides \"ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] \u2013 Sample References\".<ref>International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html \"ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals \u2013 Sample References\"].</ref>\n* The AMA Style.\n* The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924043706/http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}. Retrieved 2015-02-16.</ref>\n* In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.\n* Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed. (2007), by [[Jan Pechenik|Jan A. Pechenik]].<ref>[http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/majors-programs/Biology/Undergraduate_Research/Forms/citation_guide.pdf \"Pechenik Citation Style QuickGuide\"] ([[PDF]]).

APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.\n* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.<ref name=APSA>Stephen Yoder, ed.

Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a \"half-life\", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.<ref>Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V. Dimitrova. ''Vanishing Act: The Erosion of Online Footnotes and Implications for Scholarship in the Digital Age''. Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books (2010)</ref>\n\nOther experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Replications and Extensions in Marketing: Rarely Published But Quite Contrary |author=Raymond Hubbard and J.

Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.<ref name=\"Wright2008\">{{cite journal |title=The Ombudsman: Verification of Citations: Fawlty Towers of Knowledge? |first1=Malcolm |last1=Wright |first2=J.&nbsp;Scott |last2=Armstrong |author2-link=J.

Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The main prosecutors were [[Julio C\u00e9sar Strassera]] and his assistant [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] (who would go on to become the first Chief Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]].) The trial was presided over by a tribunal of six judges: [[Le\u00f3n Arslani\u00e1n]], Jorge Torlasco, [[Ricardo Gil Lavedra]], Andr\u00e9s D'Alessio, Jorge Valerga Ar\u00e1oz, and Guillermo Ledesma.\n\nThe dictatorship was a series of several military governments under four [[military junta]]s. The fourth junta, before calling for elections and relinquishing power to the democratic authorities, enacted a Self-Amnesty Law on April 18, 1983, as well as a secret decree that ordered the destruction of records and other evidence of their past crimes.\n\n===Preparation===\nThree days after his inauguration, on 13 December 1983), President Alfons\u00edn signed Decree No. 158, which mandated the initiation of legal proceedings against the nine military officers of the first three juntas, but not the fourth (ruled by General [[Reynaldo Bignone]]). The [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] was established two days later to collect testimonies from thousands of witnesses, and presented 8,960 cases of [[Desaparecidos (disambiguation)|forced disappearances]] to the president on 20 September 1984. Following the refusal of a [[military court]] to try former junta members, Alfons\u00edn established a National Criminal Court of Appeals for the purpose on 14 October.\n\n===Trial of the Juntas===\nThis trial, which officially began on 22 April 1985, is so far the only example of such a large scale procedure by a democratic government against a former dictatorial government of the same country in [[Latin America]]. It was the first major trial held for war crimes since the [[N\u00fcremberg Trials]] in Germany following World War II, and the first to be conducted by a civilian court. It succeeded in prosecuting the crimes of the juntas, which included kidnapping, [[torture]], [[forced disappearance]], and [[murder]] of an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 people during what was called the [[Dirty War]] against political dissidents. Opposition to the trial was largely limited to critical commentary by politicians, lawyers, and media figures sympathetic to the dictatorship. Some protest became violent: during the [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] phase of the trial, 29 bomb threats were made to several Buenos Aires schools, and a number of bombs were detonated in key government installations, including the [[Libertador Building|Ministry of Defense]].  On October 25, President Alfons\u00edn declared a 60-day [[state of emergency]].<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Alfonsin/decreta/estado/sitio/Argentina/dias/elpepiint/19851026elpepiint_10/Tes \"Alfonsin decreta estado sitio\"], ''El Pa\u00eds'' (26 Oct 1985) {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nProsecutors presented 709 cases, of which 280 were heard.

In the same interview, Keller also cited the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 strike of textile workers]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] for instigating her support of socialism.\n\nKeller supported [[eugenics]]. In 1915, she wrote in favor of refusing life-saving medical procedures to infants with severe mental impairments or physical deformities, stating that their lives were not worthwhile and they would likely become criminals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nielsen|first1=Kim E.|title=The Radical Lives of Helen Keller|date=April 1, 2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, NY|isbn=0814758142|pages=36\u201337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XVQTCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA36&pg=PA36#v=onepage|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pernick|first1=M S|title=Eugenics and public health in American history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=November 1997|volume=87|issue=11|pages=1767\u20131772|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.87.11.1767|accessdate=October 12, 2016|doi=10.2105/ajph.87.11.1767|pmid=9366633|pmc=1381159}}</ref> Keller also expressed concerns about [[human overpopulation]].<ref name=\"pmquotes\">{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=https://www.populationmatters.org/making-case/quotations/|publisher=[[Population Matters]]|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=wpbquotes>{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=http://www.worldpopulationbalance.org/quotes|publisher=World Population Balance|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Helen Keller13.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Keller, c. 1912]]\nKeller wrote a total of 12 published books and several articles.\n\nOne of her earliest pieces of writing, at age 11, was ''[[The Frost King]]'' (1891).

Michael Anagnos, the school's director, asked a 20-year-old alumnus of the school, [[Anne Sullivan Macy|Anne Sullivan]], herself visually impaired, to become Keller's instructor.

Writing in her autobiography, ''The Story of My Life,'' Keller recalled the moment: \"I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten \u2014 a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me.

She was able to enjoy music by feeling the beat and she was able to have a strong connection with animals through touch.

In 1896, they returned to Massachusetts, and Keller entered [[The Cambridge School of Weston|The Cambridge School for Young Ladies]] before gaining admittance, in 1900, to [[Radcliffe College]] of [[Harvard University]],<ref name=radcliff>{{cite journal |title=HELEN KELLER IN COLLEGE \u2013 Blind, Dumb and Deaf Girl Now Studying at Radcliffe |journal=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=October 13, 1900 |page=16 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1900/10/13/page/16/article/helen-keller-in-college}}</ref> where she lived in Briggs Hall, [[Cabot House|South House]]. Her admirer, [[Mark Twain]], had introduced her to [[Standard Oil]] magnate [[Henry H. Rogers|Henry Huttleston Rogers]], who, with his wife Abbie, paid for her education. In 1904, at the age of 24, Keller graduated as a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]<ref>[https://www.pbk.org/Members \"Phi Beta Kappa Members\"]. The Phi Beta Kappa Society (PBK.org).

This message came with the visit of Helen Keller and her teacher, Mrs. John Macy, and both had a hand in imparting it Saturday evening to a splendid audience that filled The Memorial. The wonderful girl who has so brilliantly triumphed over the triple afflictions of blindness, dumbness and deafness, gave a talk with her own lips on \"Happiness\", and it will be remembered always as a piece of inspired teaching by those who heard it.</blockquote>\n\nWhen part of the account was reprinted in the January 20, 2016 edition of the paper under the heading \"From the Files\", the column compiler added\n\n<blockquote>According to those who attended, Helen Keller spoke of the joy that life gave her. She was thankful for the faculties and abilities that she did possess and stated that the most productive pleasures she had were curiosity and imagination. Keller also spoke of the joy of service and the happiness that came from doing things for others&nbsp;... Keller imparted that \"helping your fellow men were one's only excuse for being in this world and in the doing of things to help one's fellows lay the secret of lasting happiness.\" She also told of the joys of loving work and accomplishment and the happiness of achievement.

Keller met every U.S. President from [[Grover Cleveland]] to [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and was friends with many famous figures, including [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Mark Twain]]. Keller and Twain were both considered [[political radical]]s allied with leftist politics and, as a consequence, their political views have been forgotten or glossed over in American high school textbooks and the popular mind.<ref name=\"loewen\"/>\n\nKeller was a member of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and actively campaigned and wrote in support of the working class from 1909 to 1921. Many of her speeches and writings were about women's right to vote and the impacts of war; in addition, she supported causes that opposed [[Interventionism (politics)|military intervention]].<ref>Davis, Mark J.

In the same interview, Keller also cited the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 strike of textile workers]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] for instigating her support of socialism.\n\nKeller supported [[eugenics]]. In 1915, she wrote in favor of refusing life-saving medical procedures to infants with severe mental impairments or physical deformities, stating that their lives were not worthwhile and they would likely become criminals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nielsen|first1=Kim E.|title=The Radical Lives of Helen Keller|date=April 1, 2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, NY|isbn=0814758142|pages=36\u201337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XVQTCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA36&pg=PA36#v=onepage|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pernick|first1=M S|title=Eugenics and public health in American history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=November 1997|volume=87|issue=11|pages=1767\u20131772|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.87.11.1767|accessdate=October 12, 2016|doi=10.2105/ajph.87.11.1767|pmid=9366633|pmc=1381159}}</ref> Keller also expressed concerns about [[human overpopulation]].<ref name=\"pmquotes\">{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=https://www.populationmatters.org/making-case/quotations/|publisher=[[Population Matters]]|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=wpbquotes>{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=http://www.worldpopulationbalance.org/quotes|publisher=World Population Balance|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Helen Keller13.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Keller, c. 1912]]\nKeller wrote a total of 12 published books and several articles.\n\nOne of her earliest pieces of writing, at age 11, was ''[[The Frost King]]'' (1891).

This particular representation of the Virgin is called a [[Maest\u00e0]], a popular representation at the time. It is often celebrated as the first painting of the [[Renaissance]] due to its newfound naturalism and escape from the constraints of [[Gothic art]]. \n\nIt is generally dated to around 1310. While historians have had trouble finding specific information for indisputably attributing many of Giotto's works to the artist, ''Madonna Enthroned'' is one piece for which there are a few documents supporting its creation by Giotto.  There are many sources that show he spent many years living and creating in [[Florence]]. However, the main source that documents ''Madonna Enthroned'' specifically is artist [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s autobiography, ''I Commentarii'' (1447).  An earlier manuscript document of 1418 also attributes the painting to Giotto, but it is Ghiberti's autobiography that provides the most solid evidence.<ref>Turner, 676</ref>\n\nOne of Giotto's later works, ''Madonna Enthroned'' was completed in [[Florence]], upon the artist's return to the city.  It was originally painted for the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] church in Florence.  Built for the [[Humiliati]], a small religious order at the time, the church had many acclaimed paintings designed for it.  Specifically, Giotto's ''Madonna Enthroned'' was designed for the high altar.\n\n==Influences==\nThe ''Madonna Enthroned'' shows the numerous styles of art that influenced Giotto. In both the gold coloring used throughout the artwork and the flattened gold background, Giotto's art continued the traditional Italo-Byzantine style so popular in the proto-Renaissance time period.  The altarpiece represents a formalized representation of an icon, still retaining the stiffness of Byzantine art, and Giotto retained the hierarchy of scale, making the centralized Madonna and the Christ Child much larger in size than the surrounding saints and religious figures.\n\nGiotto's figures however escape the bounds of Byzantine art.  His figures are weighty and are reminiscent of three-dimensional sculptures, such as that in classical Roman sculpture.  The Madonna's intricately decorated throne, which itself is an Italian Gothic design, has a very specific use of colored marble as a surface decoration.  This method of decoration, based on a style called Cosmatesque or Cosmati, was popular in Rome since the Early Christian period and in Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages.  \n\nThere were, additionally, a number of specific artists whose styles heavily influenced ''The Ognissanti Madonna''.  The influence of [[Cimabue]], traditionally recognized as Giotto's teacher, is shown first in the very symmetrical composition of the piece.<ref>Stokstad, 603</ref> Historians are not sure whether him being a teacher to the young Giotto is true or not. However, [[Giorgio Vasari]], recognized as the first art historian, referred to Cimabue as being Giotto's master. <ref>Vasari, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</ref> While the use of that word is not clear, [[Italian language|Italian]] stems directly from [[Latin]]. The Latin word, [[\"magister\"]] has two meanings: master and teacher, and it is not improbable that Giorgio had meant the second definition of magister. Cimabue portrayed the same subject of symmetry in his 1280 ''Virgin and Child Enthroned'', and both pieces share aspects of the Italo-Byzantine style, with Cimabue's having more Byzantine attributes.  Additionally, the two depictions of the angels' wings in Giotto and Cimabue's pieces clearly resemble each other. Both pieces share a similar, initial feeling of severity, yet there is more to each piece than the drama. Giotto adopted from his teacher the importance of, and the concern for, volume and forms in space.  \n\nThe tranquility of Giotto's figures resembled also the style of [[Pietro Cavallini]].  From this artist, who painted neo-Byzantine pieces, taking cues from both mosaics and frescos from Roman and Early Christian times, Giotto took important lessons in the technique of painting, and in rendering figures as statuesque and calm.<ref>Turner, 686</ref><br> Lastly, Giotto took cues from many contemporary sculptors, including [[Nicola Pisano|Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Pisano]], whose work shares influences of Northern Gothic art.  In the work of these artists, Giotto saw great, dramatic compositions that would certainly influence his ''Ognissanti Madonna''.\n\n==Technique==\n[[Giotto]] was the first artist to depict three-dimensional figures in western European art. Additionally, he used a much smaller space than other contemporary artists, further emphasizing the importance of the bodies in the artwork. Giotto did away with many aspects of Byzantine art that would flatten the painting.  Within [[Cimabue]]'s ''Virgin and Child Enthroned'', there is the use of gold tracing to delineate the folds of the fabric.  In contrast to this, Giotto's fabric folds are more realistic, and instead of lines he used light, shadow, and color to create the appearance of fabric.  Contours of the body underneath these fabric folds are also visible, specifically in the Virgin's knees and also around her breasts. \n\nGiotto used a value scale, a distinct range of light and darks, to create a sense of volume in his figures, giving them the slight smokiness that is usually characteristic of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and later Renaissance artists.\n\n==References and sources==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{external media | headerimage = [[File:Giotto di Bondone Madonna Enthroned detail.png|200px]] | width = 210px | align = right | video1 = [http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/giotto-the-ognissanti-madonna.html Giotto, The Ognissanti Madonna (Madonna Enthroned)], [[Smarthistory]]<ref name=\"smarth\">{{cite web | title =Giotto, The Ognissanti Madonna (Madonna Enthroned) | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/giotto-the-ognissanti-madonna.html | accessdate =January 24, 2013 }}</ref> }}\n;References\n{{reflist}}\n;Sources\n* Beckett, Sister Wendy and Patricia Wright.
