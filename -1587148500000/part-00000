The rebuilding/renaming came as a result of the Diocese's decision to upgrade all of its secondary campuses beginning in 2002. The original campus was located in [[South San Diego]], near the intersection of Coronado Avenue and Thermal Street. Across from Marian Catholic was the parochial K-8 school, Saint Charles Catholic School<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome Page |url=http://www.saintcharlesschool.com/ |website=Saint Charles Catholic School Website |accessdate=April 11, 2019 |page=Address on mid-page}}</ref>. The new campus is located in East Chula Vista, in close proximity to Otay Ranch Town Center and Olympian High School. Its facilities include tennis courts, a track and football stadium, baseball and softball diamonds, full-service 800-seat theater, competition swimming pool, basketball/volleyball gym, environmentally friendly \"earth bench,\" and a Catholic chapel.\n\n== Background ==\nMarian Catholic was established in 1960.

It is located in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego]]. Mater Dei Catholic replaced its former school, Marian Catholic High School, in September 2007. The rebuilding/renaming came as a result of the Diocese's decision to upgrade all of its secondary campuses beginning in 2002. The original campus was located in [[South San Diego]], near the intersection of Coronado Avenue and Thermal Street. Across from Marian Catholic was the parochial K-8 school, Saint Charles Catholic School<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome Page |url=http://www.saintcharlesschool.com/ |website=Saint Charles Catholic School Website |accessdate=April 11, 2019 |page=Address on mid-page}}</ref>. The new campus is located in East Chula Vista, in close proximity to Otay Ranch Town Center and Olympian High School. It's facilities include tennis courts, a track and football stadium, baseball and softball diamonds, full-service 800-seat theater, competition swimming pool, basketball/volleyball gym, environmentally friendly \"earth bench,\" and a Catholic chapel.\n\n== Background ==\nMarian Catholic was established in 1960.

King Boulevard.\n\n==Early history==\nOnce called \u201cthe Queen of Memphis\u201d and \u201cthe most complex, the most fabulous building in Memphis,\u201d the Sterick Building featured a white stone spire topped with a green tile roof; its own bank, pharmacy, barber shop, and beauty parlor; and stockbrokers' offices. The first three floors were made from granite and limestone. From the lobby, which was said to \u201crival[s] the beauty of a Moorish castle,\u201d its eight high-speed elevators ferried the building's 2,000+ workers and guests to the upper floors, including the Regency Room restaurant on the top floor.<ref name=FLYER459 />\n\nThe original lease of land for the property, dating from the late 1920s, required the $1,500 monthly payment to be paid in gold coin \u201cof standard weight and fineness or its equivalent.\u201d  An unsuccessful 1975 lawsuit by the land owners sought to recalculate the rent at the then-current price of gold, or roughly $13,500 per month.<ref>[http://www.memphismagazine.com/askvanceblog/?p=195#more-195 Lauderdale, Vance. When the Sterick Building Was Supreme. Ask Vance. November 25, 2008.]</ref>\n\n==Decline==\nThe building began to decline in the 1960s, and, despite a number of alterations (including being repainted from its original white and green to yellow and tan), it has been left vacant since the 1980s. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.\n\n==Recent events==\nIn 2006, the Memphis Center City Commission placed the Sterick Building on its list of \"Top Ten Center City Redevelopment Sites\".<ref name=TOPTEN>\n{{Cite web\n  | author=Memphis Center City Commission\n  | title=\"Top Ten\" Center City Redevelopment Sites\n  | url=http://www.downtownmemphis.com/downtownmemphis/documents/topten2.pdf\n}}</ref> Criteria for inclusion on this list include:\n* \u201cA site that is important to the health and vitality of its neighborhood and of Memphis\u201d\n* \u201cA site that currently has no solid redevelopment plans on the board\u201d\n* \u201cA site with architecture significant in the history of Memphis\u201d\n* \u201cA site where redevelopment is seen as a catalyst for future improvements\u201d<ref name=TOPTEN />\n\nThe {{convert|350883|sqft|m2|adj=on}} property was appraised at $419,200 in 2005.<ref name='DailyNews'>{{cite news | first=Andy | last=Meek | coauthors= | title=Underutilized Downtown Properties Await Development | date=2005-08-23 | publisher= | url =http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=28690 | work =Memphis Daily News | pages = | accessdate = 2008-09-02 | language = }}</ref>\n\nWhile local desire to see the building redeveloped has been expressed, the difficulties of the undertaking have also been noted, including the large size of the property, the height of the floor plates, lack of adequate duct work, environmental issues, and the need to bring the building up to current seismic standards.<ref name='MemphisBizJournal01'>{{cite news | first=Jane | last=Aldinger | coauthors= | title=Ripe for redevelopmentCenter City tags Top 10 buildings needing attention | date=2005-10-07 | publisher=American City Business Journals | url =http://memphis.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2005/10/10/story1.html | work =Memphis Business Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2008-09-02 | language = }}</ref>\n\nFurther complications toward redevelopment include legal entanglements regarding the ground lease.

Preservationists have also noted the possibility of tax credits and possible conservation easements for developers.<ref name='GatesofMemphis'/>\n\nIn 1994, some shots of the movie, [[The Client (1994 film)|''The Client'']] were taken around this building.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Sterickbuilding.jpg|Backside view of the building, from Madison Ave.\nImage:Sterickbuilding-entrance.jpg|Boarded-up entrance and first floor\nImage:Sterickbuilding-front.jpg|Front view\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Shelby County, Tennessee]]\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://hdl.handle.net/10267/157 ''Sterick Building at Night'', Rhodes College Digital Depository]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box\n| before=[[Lincoln American Tower]]\n| title=[[List of tallest buildings in Memphis|Tallest Building in Memphis]]\n| years=1930 - 1965<br /><small>111m</small>\n| after=[[100 North Main]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Memphis, Tennessee}}\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\n\n[[Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Memphis, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1928]]\n[[Category:Office buildings completed in 1928]]\n[[Category:1928 establishments in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Memphis, Tennessee]]\n", "name_user": "Waidawut", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly history:typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterick_Building"}
