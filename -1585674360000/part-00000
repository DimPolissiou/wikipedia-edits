{"title_page": "Polymer characterization", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2008}}\n'''Polymer characterization''' is the analytical branch of [[polymer science]].\n\nThe discipline is concerned with the characterization of polymeric materials on a variety of levels. The characterization typically has as a goal to improve the performance of the material. As such, many characterization techniques should ideally be linked to the desirable properties of the material such as strength, impermeability, thermal stability, and optical properties.<ref>http://camcor.uoregon.edu/labs/polymer-character. Chartoff, Richard.\"Polymer Characterization Laboratory\". University of Oregon CAMCOR. 2013.</ref>\n\nCharacterization techniques are typically used to determine [[molecular mass]], molecular structure, [[morphology (molecular)|morphology]], thermal properties, and mechanical properties.<ref>Campbell, D.; Pethrick, R. A.; White, J. R. ''Polymer Characterization Physical Techniques''. Chapman and Hall, 1989 p. 11-13.</ref>\n\n==Molecular mass==\nThe molecular mass of a polymer differs from typical molecules, in that polymerization reactions produce a distribution of molecular weights and shapes. The distribution of molecular masses can be summarized by the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and [[polydispersity]]. Some of the most common methods for determining these parameters are [[colligative property]] measurements, [[static light scattering]] techniques, [[viscometry]], and [[size exclusion chromatography]].\n\n[[Gel permeation chromatography]], a type of size exclusion chromatography, is an especially useful technique used to directly determine the molecular weight distribution parameters based on the polymer's [[hydrodynamic volume]]. Gel permeation chromatography is often used in combination with [[multi-angle light scattering]] (MALS), [[Low-angle laser light scattering]] (LALLS) and/or [[viscometry]] for an absolute  determination (i.e., independent of the chromatographic separation details) of the molecular weight distribution as well as the branching ratio and degree of long chain branching of a polymer, provided a suitable solvent can be found.<ref>S. Podzimek. The use of GPC coupled with a multiangle laser light scattering photometer for the characterization of polymers. On the determination of molecular weight, size, and branching. ''J. Appl. Polymer Sci.''  1994 54 , 91-103.</ref>\n\nMolar mass determination of [[copolymers]] is a much more complicated procedure. The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the [[homopolymer]]s and how this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically requires multiple characterization methods. For instance, copolymers with short chain branching such as [[linear low-density polyethylene]] (a copolymer of ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or octene) require the use of Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (ATREF) techniques. These techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection system comprising [[multi-angle light scattering]], UV absorption and differential refractometry, if the copolymer is composed of two base polymers that provide different responses to UV and/or refractive index.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rowland | first1 = S.

Chem. | volume = 84 | issue = 11| pages = 4812\u20134820 }}</ref>\n\n==Molecular structure==\nMany of the analytical techniques used to determine the molecular structure of unknown organic compounds are also used in polymer characterization. Spectroscopic techniques such as [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[electron spin resonance spectroscopy]], [[X-ray diffraction]], and [[mass spectrometry]] are used to identify common functional groups.\n\n==Morphology==\nPolymer morphology is a microscale property that is largely dictated by the amorphous or crystalline portions of the polymer chains and their influence on each other. Microscopy techniques are especially useful in determining these microscale properties, as the domains created by the polymer morphology are large enough to be viewed using modern microscopy instruments. Some of the most common microscopy techniques used are [[X-ray diffraction]], [[Transmission Electron Microscopy]], [[Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy]], [[Scanning Electron Microscopy]], and [[Atomic Force Microscopy]].\n\nPolymer morphology on a mesoscale (nanometers to micrometers) is particularly important for the mechanical properties of many materials. [[Transmission Electron Microscopy]] in combination with [[staining]] techniques, but also [[Scanning Electron Microscopy]], [[Scanning probe microscopy]] are important tools to optimize the morphology of materials like [[polybutadiene]]-[[polystyrene]] polymers and many polymer blends.\n\n[[X-ray diffraction]] is generally not as powerful for this class of materials as they are either amorphous or poorly crystallized. The [[Small-angle scattering]] like [[Small-angle X-ray scattering]] (SAXS) can be used to measure the long periods of semicrystalline polymers.\n\n==Thermal properties==\n\nA true workhorse for polymer characterization is [[thermal analysis]], particularly [[Differential scanning calorimetry]]. Changes in the compositional and structural parameters of the material usually affect its melting transitions or glass transitions and these in turn can be linked to many performance parameters. For semicrystalline polymers it is an important method to measure crystallinity. [[Thermogravimetric analysis]] can also give an indication of polymer thermal stability and the effects of additives such as flame retardants.\nOther thermal analysis techniques are typically combinations of the basic techniques and include [[differential thermal analysis]], [[thermomechanical analysis]], dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and [[dielectric thermal analysis]].\n\n[[Dynamic mechanical spectroscopy]] and [[dielectric spectroscopy]] are essentially extensions of thermal analysis that can reveal more subtle transitions with temperature as they affect the complex modulus or the dielectric function of the material.\n\n==Mechanical properties==\nThe characterization of mechanical properties in polymers typically refers to a measure of the strength, elasticity, [[viscoelasticity]], and anisotropy of a polymeric material. The mechanical properties of a polymer are strongly dependent upon the [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] interactions of the polymer chains, and the ability of the chains to elongate and align in the direction of the applied force. Other phenomena, such as the propensity of polymers to form crazes can impact the mechanical properties. Typically, polymeric materials are characterized as elastomers, plastics, or rigid polymers depending on their mechanical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/mech.htm|title=Mechanical Properties of Polymers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[tensile strength]], [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]], and [[Young's modulus]] are measures of strength and elasticity, and are of particular interest for describing the stress-strain properties of polymeric materials. These properties can be measured through tensile testing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strapassen|first=R.|last2=Amico|first2=S. C.|last3=Pereira|first3=M. F.

If the stress is applied in the direction of chain alignment, the polymer chains will exhibit a higher yield stress and strength, as the covalent bonds connecting the backbone of the polymer absorb the stress.  However, if the stress is applied normal to the direction of chain alignment, the Van der Waals interactions between chains will primarily be responsible for the mechanical properties and thus, the yield stress will decrease.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=I M|date=February 1962|title=Optical and Mechanical Anisotropy in Crystalline Polymers|journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1176\u20131188|doi=10.1088/0370-1328/80/5/319}}</ref> This would be observable in a stress strain graph found through tensile testing. Sample preparation, including chain orientation within the sample, for tensile tests therefore can play a large role in the observed mechanical properties.\n\nThe fracture properties of crystalline and semicrystalline polymers can be evaluated with [[Charpy impact test]]ing. Charpy tests, which can also be used with alloy systems, are performed by creating a notch in the sample, and then using a pendulum to fracture the sample at the notch. The pendulum\u2019s motion can be used to extrapolate the energy absorbed by the sample to fracture it. Charpy tests can also be used to evaluate the strain rate on the fracture, as measured with changes in the pendulum mass. Typically, only brittle and somewhat ductile polymers are evaluated with Charpy tests. In addition to the fracture energy, the type of break can be visually evaluated, as in whether the break was a total fracture of the sample or whether the sample experienced fracture in only part of the sample, and severely deformed section are still connected. Elastomers are typically not evaluated with Charpy tests due to their high yield strain inhibiting the Charpy test results.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tak|first=A. G.

As the degree of polymerization goes up, so does the polymer\u2019s strength, as a longer chains have high Van der Waals interactions and chain entanglement. Long polymers can entangle, which leads to a subsequent increase in bulk modulus.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Gennes|first=P.

These defects are typically made up of a second, low modulus polymer that is dispersed throughout the primary phase. The crazes can increase the strength and decrease the brittleness of a polymer by allowing the small cracks to absorb higher stress and strain without leading to fracture. If crazes are allowed to propagate or coalesce, they can lead to cavitation and fracture in the sample.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://polymerdatabase.com/polymer%20physics/Crazing.html|title=Polymer Properties Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Passaglia|first=Elio|date=1987|title=Crazes and Fracture in Polymers|url=|journal=J.

Dynamic mechanical analysis is a characterization technique used to measure storage modulus and glass transition temperature, confirm crosslinking, determine switching temperatures in shape-memory polymers, monitor cures in thermosets, and determine molecular weight. An oscillating force is applied to a polymer sample and the sample\u2019s response is recorded. DMA documents the lag between force applied and deformation recovery in the sample. Viscoelastic samples exhibit a sinusoidal modulus called the [[dynamic modulus]].

The characterization typically has as a goal to improve the performance of the material. As such, many characterization techniques should ideally be linked to the desirable properties of the material such as strength, impermeability, thermal stability, and optical properties.<ref>http://camcor.uoregon.edu/labs/polymer-character. Chartoff, Richard.\"Polymer Characterization Laboratory\". University of Oregon CAMCOR. 2013.</ref>\n\nCharacterization techniques are typically used to determine [[molecular mass]], molecular structure, [[morphology (molecular)|morphology]], thermal properties, and mechanical properties.<ref>Campbell, D.; Pethrick, R. A.; White, J. R. ''Polymer Characterization Physical Techniques''. Chapman and Hall, 1989 p. 11-13.</ref>\n\n==Molecular mass==\nThe molecular mass of a polymer differs from typical molecules, in that polymerization reactions produce a distribution of molecular weights and shapes. The distribution of molecular masses can be summarized by the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and [[polydispersity]]. Some of the most common methods for determining these parameters are [[colligative property]] measurements, [[static light scattering]] techniques, [[viscometry]], and [[size exclusion chromatography]].\n\n[[Gel permeation chromatography]], a type of size exclusion chromatography, is an especially useful technique used to directly determine the molecular weight distribution parameters based on the polymer's [[hydrodynamic volume]]. Gel permeation chromatography is often used in combination with [[multi-angle light scattering]] (MALS), [[Low-angle laser light scattering]] (LALLS) and/or [[viscometry]] for an absolute  determination (i.e., independent of the chromatographic separation details) of the molecular weight distribution as well as the branching ratio and degree of long chain branching of a polymer, provided a suitable solvent can be found.<ref>S. Podzimek. The use of GPC coupled with a multiangle laser light scattering photometer for the characterization of polymers. On the determination of molecular weight, size, and branching. ''J. Appl. Polymer Sci.''  1994 54 , 91-103.</ref>\n\nMolar mass determination of [[copolymers]] is a much more complicated procedure. The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the [[homopolymer]]s and how this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically requires multiple characterization methods. For instance, copolymers with short chain branching such as [[linear low-density polyethylene]] (a copolymer of ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or octene) require the use of Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (ATREF) techniques. These techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection system comprising [[multi-angle light scattering]], UV absorption and differential refractometry, if the copolymer is composed of two base polymers that provide different responses to UV and/or refractive index.<ref>S. M. Rowland, A. M. Striegel. Characterization of Copolymers and Blends by Quintuple-Detector Size-Exclusion Chromatography. ''Anal. Chem.'' 2012 '''84'''(11), 4812-4820.</ref>\n\n==Molecular structure==\nMany of the analytical techniques used to determine the molecular structure of unknown organic compounds are also used in polymer characterization. Spectroscopic techniques such as [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[electron spin resonance spectroscopy]], [[X-ray diffraction]], and [[mass spectrometry]] are used to identify common functional groups.\n\n==Morphology==\nPolymer morphology is a microscale property that is largely dictated by the amorphous or crystalline portions of the polymer chains and their influence on each other. Microscopy techniques are especially useful in determining these microscale properties, as the domains created by the polymer morphology are large enough to be viewed using modern microscopy instruments. Some of the most common microscopy techniques used are [[X-ray diffraction]], [[Transmission Electron Microscopy]], [[Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy]], [[Scanning Electron Microscopy]], and [[Atomic Force Microscopy]].\n\nPolymer morphology on a mesoscale (nanometers to micrometers) is particularly important for the mechanical properties of many materials. [[Transmission Electron Microscopy]] in combination with [[staining]] techniques, but also [[Scanning Electron Microscopy]], [[Scanning probe microscopy]] are important tools to optimize the morphology of materials like [[polybutadiene]]-[[polystyrene]] polymers and many polymer blends.\n\n[[X-ray diffraction]] is generally not as powerful for this class of materials as they are either amorphous or poorly crystallized. The [[Small-angle scattering]] like [[Small-angle X-ray scattering]] (SAXS) can be used to measure the long periods of semicrystalline polymers.\n\n==Thermal properties==\n\nA true workhorse for polymer characterization is [[thermal analysis]], particularly [[Differential scanning calorimetry]]. Changes in the compositional and structural parameters of the material usually affect its melting transitions or glass transitions and these in turn can be linked to many performance parameters. For semicrystalline polymers it is an important method to measure crystallinity. [[Thermogravimetric analysis]] can also give an indication of polymer thermal stability and the effects of additives such as flame retardants.\nOther thermal analysis techniques are typically combinations of the basic techniques and include [[differential thermal analysis]], [[thermomechanical analysis]], dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and [[dielectric thermal analysis]].\n\n[[Dynamic mechanical spectroscopy]] and [[dielectric spectroscopy]] are essentially extensions of thermal analysis that can reveal more subtle transitions with temperature as they affect the complex modulus or the dielectric function of the material.\n\n==Mechanical properties==\nThe characterization of mechanical properties in polymers typically refers to a measure of the strength, elasticity, [[viscoelasticity]], and anisotropy of a polymeric material. The mechanical properties of a polymer are strongly dependent upon the [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] interactions of the polymer chains, and the ability of the chains to elongate and align in the direction of the applied force. Other phenomena, such as the propensity of polymers to form crazes can impact the mechanical properties. Typically, polymeric materials are characterized as elastomers, plastics, or rigid polymers depending on their mechanical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/mech.htm|title=Mechanical Properties of Polymers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[tensile strength]], [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]], and [[Young's modulus]] are measures of strength and elasticity, and are of particular interest for describing the stress-strain properties of polymeric materials. These properties can be measured through tensile testing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strapassen|first=R.|last2=Amico|first2=S. C.|last3=Pereira|first3=M. F.

If the stress is applied in the direction of chain alignment, the polymer chains will exhibit a higher yield stress and strength, as the covalent bonds connecting the backbone of the polymer absorb the stress.  However, if the stress is applied normal to the direction of chain alignment, the Van der Waals interactions between chains will primarily be responsible for the mechanical properties and thus, the yield stress will decrease.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=I M|date=February 1962|title=Optical and Mechanical Anisotropy in Crystalline Polymers|journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1176\u20131188|doi=10.1088/0370-1328/80/5/319}}</ref> This would be observable in a stress strain graph found through tensile testing. Sample preparation, including chain orientation within the sample, for tensile tests therefore can play a large role in the observed mechanical properties.\n\nThe fracture properties of crystalline and semicrystalline polymers can be evaluated with [[Charpy impact test]]ing. Charpy tests, which can also be used with alloy systems, are performed by creating a notch in the sample, and then using a pendulum to fracture the sample at the notch. The pendulum\u2019s motion can be used to extrapolate the energy absorbed by the sample to fracture it. Charpy tests can also be used to evaluate the strain rate on the fracture, as measured with changes in the pendulum mass. Typically, only brittle and somewhat ductile polymers are evaluated with Charpy tests. In addition to the fracture energy, the type of break can be visually evaluated, as in whether the break was a total fracture of the sample or whether the sample experienced fracture in only part of the sample, and severely deformed section are still connected. Elastomers are typically not evaluated with Charpy tests due to their high yield strain inhibiting the Charpy test results.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tak|first=A. G.

As the degree of polymerization goes up, so does the polymer\u2019s strength, as a longer chains have high Van der Waals interactions and chain entanglement. Long polymers can entangle, which leads to a subsequent increase in bulk modulus.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Gennes|first=P.

These defects are typically made up of a second, low modulus polymer that is dispersed throughout the primary phase. The crazes can increase the strength and decrease the brittleness of a polymer by allowing the small cracks to absorb higher stress and strain without leading to fracture. If crazes are allowed to propagate or coalesce, they can lead to cavitation and fracture in the sample.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://polymerdatabase.com/polymer%20physics/Crazing.html|title=Polymer Properties Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Passaglia|first=Elio|date=1987|title=Crazes and Fracture in Polymers|url=|journal=J.

Dynamic mechanical analysis is a characterization technique used to measure storage modulus and glass transition temperature, confirm crosslinking, determine switching temperatures in shape-memory polymers, monitor cures in thermosets, and determine molecular weight. An oscillating force is applied to a polymer sample and the sample\u2019s response is recorded. DMA documents the lag between force applied and deformation recovery in the sample. Viscoelastic samples exhibit a sinusoidal modulus called the [[dynamic modulus]]. Both energy recovered and lost are considered during each deformation and described quantitatively by the elastic modulus (E\u2019) and the loss modulus (E\u2019\u2019) respectively. The applied stress  and the strain on the sample exhibit a phase difference, \u1e9f, which is measured over time.

The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections.<ref name=\"WebbDJ\"/> Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include [[tadalafil]] (Cialis) and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra).\n\nSildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4(major route), but also by CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil's action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (about 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (around 13% of the administered oral dose).

The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections.<ref name=\"WebbDJ\"/> Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include [[tadalafil]] (Cialis) and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra).\n\nSildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4(major route), but also by CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil's action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (about 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (around 13% of the administered oral dose).  If taken with a high-fat meal, absorption is reduced; the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour, and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one-third.<ref name=RxListCP>{{cite web| url = http://www.rxlist.com/viagra-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm | title = Viagra Clinical Pharmacology | year = 2008 | accessdate = 20 August 2008 | publisher = RxList.com}}</ref>\n\n==Route of administration==\n* When taken [[Oral administration|by mouth]] sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average time to onset of erections of 27 minutes (ranging from 12 to 70 minutes).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eardley I, Ellis P, Boolell M, Wulff M |title=Onset and duration of action of sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=53 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=61S\u201365S |year=2002 |pmid=11879261 |pmc=1874251 |doi= 10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.00034.x|url=}}</ref>\n* [[Sublingual administration|Under the tongue]] use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average onset of action of 15 minutes and lasting for an average of 40 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deveci S, Pe\u015fkircio\u011flu L, Ayg\u00fcn C, Tekin MI, Dirim A, Ozkarde\u015f H |title=Sublingual sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction: faster onset of action with less dose |journal=Int.

At the age of 12 he attended the \"Privatschule Franz Wieszners\", a German-speaking school in Temeswar (today [[Timi\u0219oara]]), and at 16 the high school in [[Szeged]], where his tendency to painting was recognized. At 18 he took up a four years' art study in [[Budapest]]. \n\nAfter study trips in [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], J\u00e4ger in 1910 established himself in Hatzfeld (today [[Jimbolia]]), where he spent the rest of his life. Though he had been active as a painter before the turn of the century, the first official exhibition of his paintings opened only in 1930. \n\nAs noted, the themes of many of his paintings were drawn from the history and daily life of his community, the [[Danube Swabian]]s. Among the most well known of his works are \n* ''The settlement of Germans in the Banat'', approx. 1905, 300&nbsp;cm broad\n* ''The immigration of Germans to Hungary '', 1906\u20131910, 145 x 510&nbsp;cm\n\nThe 1930s and 1940s were a major crisis point for this community, as for the other East European ethnic Germans.

At the age of 12 he attended the \"Privatschule Franz Wieszners\", a German-speaking school in Temeswar (today [[Timi\u015foara]]), and at 16 the high school in [[Szeged]], where his tendency to painting was recognized. At 18 he took up a four years' art study in [[Budapest]]. \n\nAfter study trips in [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], J\u00e4ger in 1910 established himself in Hatzfeld (today [[Jimbolia]]), where he spent the rest of his life. Though he had been active as a painter before the turn of the century, the first official exhibition of his paintings opened only in 1930. \n\nAs noted, the themes of many of his paintings were drawn from the history and daily life of his community, the [[Danube Swabian]]s. Among the most well known of his works are \n* ''The settlement of Germans in the Banat'', approx. 1905, 300&nbsp;cm broad\n* ''The immigration of Germans to Hungary '', 1906\u20131910, 145 x 510&nbsp;cm\n\nThe 1930s and 1940s were a major crisis point for this community, as for the other East European ethnic Germans. During the [[Second World War]], they were perceived as - and some of them were - collaborators with [[Nazi Germany]]'s occupation. Specifically, many Danube Swabians were drafted to the [[Waffen-SS]] - officially as volunteers, though it was claimed that they had in fact little choice in the matter. \n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Vertreibung.png|thumb|350px|left|''Danube Swabians being led away by Russian forces''.]] -->\nAs a result, they were after 1945 the target of harsh reprisals and especially mass expulsions from countries such as [[Hungary]] and [[Yugoslavia]] where many of these families had lived for centuries.
