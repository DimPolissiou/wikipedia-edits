From 2012 onwards, the winner has been chosen by an LSA jury. [[Tere Pyaar Mein]] was the first winner. Every year, LSA jury short lists number of films between 1 and 10. Only those short listed films are nominated in the ceremony. Usually, five films are nominated for Best Film. In 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011, no nominations were announced due to lack of films releases. In 2010 and 2012, no award was given because jury did not find any film worth winning. Three films were nominated in 2001, 2002 and 2008. In 2013, four films were nominated for the award. \n=== Best Film and Best Director ===\nBest Film and Best Director are closely linked.

The awards celebrate \"style\" in the Pakistani entertainment industry, and it is the oldest event dedicated to [[Cinema of Pakistan|cinema]], [[television in Pakistan|television]], [[Pakistani clothing|fashion]], [[music of Pakistan|music]] and [[film industry]] in Pakistan. Categories have changed over the years, but most are awarded by panels of judges who are experts in the respective industries, with some \"people's choice\" awards in the film and TV categories.\n\nThe ceremonies, which are televised, have usually been held in [[Karachi]], but in some years have taken place in [[Lahore]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Dubai]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Lux Style Awards were conceptualised and created in 2002 by Naheed Chowdhry, the female executive who headed the [[Unilever Pakistan Limited|Unilever]] Lux team at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onfrontiers.com/profile/nchowdhry|title=Naheed Chowdhry|website=On Frontiers|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> in collaboration with Frieha Altaf, TV and event producer and former model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siddysays.com/interview-frieha-altaf/|title=In Conversation With Frieha Altaf|website=SiddySays|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.somethinghaute.com/lux-style-awards-3/|title=Why the show must go on!|website=Haute|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> It is the largest annual awards ceremony held in Pakistan as well as the oldest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siddysays.com/the-siddysays-winners-of-lux-style-awards-2019/|title=The Siddysays Winners Of Lux Style Awards 2019|website=SiddySays|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parhlo.com/unforgettable-highlights-lux-style-awards-2018/|website=parhlo|title=7 Major Highlights of LUX Style Awards 2018 Which Are Absolutely Unforgettable|first=Zain |last=Kazi|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first awards were presented in 2002 at the [[Karachi Naval Dockyard|Naval Base]] in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] due to heightened security and high-profile attendance. The Awards Ceremony was preceded by seven days of exhibitions and fashion shows at different smaller venues throughout Karachi and on [[Manora, Karachi|Manora island]], as a build-up to the final show.

From 2012 onwards, the winner has been chosen by an LSA jury. [[Tere Pyaar Mein]] was the first winner. Every year, LSA jury short lists number of films between 1 and 10. Only those short listed films are nominated in the ceremony. Usually, five films are nominated for Best Film. In 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011, no nominations were announced due to lack of films releases. In 2010 and 2012, no award was given because jury did not find any film worth winning. Three films were nominated in 2001, 2002 and 2008. In 2013, four films were nominated for the award. \n=== Best Film and Best Director ===\nBest Film and Best Director are closely linked.

Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers.<ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp. 3\u201322</ref>\n\nThe nation's small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders. Elite colleges became increasingly exclusive and contributed little upward social mobility. By concentrating on the offspring of wealthy families, and ministers, elite Eastern colleges such as Harvard, played a role in the formation of a Northeastern elite.<ref>Michael Katz, \"The Role of American Colleges in the Nineteenth Century\", ''History of Education Quarterly'', Vol. 23, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 215\u2013223 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/368160 in JSTOR], summarizing Colin B.

The number of colleges skyrocketed in waves, during the early and mid 20th century. State universities grew from small institutions of fewer than 1000 students to campuses with 40,000 more students, with networks of regional campuses around the state. In turn, regional campuses broke away and became separate universities. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nTo handle the explosive growth of K\u201312 education, every state set up a network of teachers' colleges, beginning with Massachusetts in the 1830s. After 1950, they became state colleges and then state universities with a broad curriculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMajor new trends included the development of the [[Junior college#United States|junior colleges]]. They were usually set up by City school systems starting in the 1920s.<ref>Leonard V. Koos, ''The Junior College Movement'' (1924).</ref> By the 1960s they were renamed as \"community colleges.\"\n\nJunior colleges grew from 20 in number In 1909, to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each. Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students. The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white-collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four-year colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however, many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis. Community colleges continue as open-enrollment, low-cost institutions with a strong component of vocational education, as well as a low-cost preparation for transfer students into four-year schools. They appeal to a poorer, older, less prepared element.<ref>Jesse P. Bogue, ed.

Over 100 [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs) operate, both private and public.\n\nSome [[U.S. states]] offer higher education at two year \"colleges\" formerly called \"[[community college]]s\".

Completing each course to the schools satisfaction gains the student a number of credits. To enter tertiary education the student will be doing a number of [[Advanced placement]] courses that will gain the highest number of credits. A student graduates from High School when the minimum number of credits has been achieved, and will be accepted by a college when their required number is achieved.

(This is unlike college admissions in many European countries, as well as graduate admissions.) Some students, rather than being rejected, are \"wait-listed\" for a particular college and may be admitted if another student who was admitted decides not to attend the college or university. The five major parts of admission are [[ACT (test)|ACT]]/[[SAT]] scores, [[grade point average]], college application, essay, and [[letters of recommendation]].

In the 1980s and 1990s there were significant changes in the economics of academic life. \nDespite rising tuition rates and growing university revenues, professorial positions were replaced with poorly paid [[Adjunct professors in North America|adjunct]] positions and graduate-student labor.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Case of the Vanishing Full-Time Professor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03strategy-t.html|access-date=December 12, 2012 | work=The New York Times|first=Samantha|last=Stainburn|date=January 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWith academic institutions producing Ph.D.s in greater numbers than the number of tenure-track positions they intended to create, [[Academic administration#United States|administrators]] were cognizant of the economic effects of this arrangement.

The first tier includes sports sanctioned by one of the collegiate sport governing bodies. Some of these collegiate sports governing organizations like the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) are umbrella [[non-profit organization]]s that govern multiple sports. Additionally, the first tier is characterized by selective participation, since only the elite programs in their sport are able to participate; some colleges offer [[athletic scholarship]]s to intercollegiate sports competitors. The second tier includes [[intramural]] and recreational sports clubs, which are available to more of the student body. Competition between student clubs from different colleges, not organized by and therefore not representing the institutions or their faculties, may also be called \"intercollegiate\" athletics or simply college sports.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosandich|first=Thomas|title=Collegiate Sports Programs: A Comparative Analysis|page=476|publisher=Education|date=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe largest collegiate sport governing body in the first tier is the NCAA, which regulates athletes of 1,268 institutions across the US and Canada.

Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers.<ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp. 3\u201322</ref>\n\nThe nation's small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders.

The number of colleges skyrocketed in waves, during the early and mid 20th century. State universities grew from small institutions of fewer than 1000 students to campuses with 40,000 more students, with networks of regional campuses around the state. In turn, regional campuses broke away and became separate universities. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nTo handle the explosive growth of K\u201312 education, every state set up a network of teachers' colleges, beginning with Massachusetts in the 1830s. After 1950, they became state colleges and then state universities with a broad curriculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMajor new trends included the development of the [[Junior college#United States|junior colleges]]. They were usually set up by City school systems starting in the 1920s.<ref>Leonard V.

By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each. Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students. The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white-collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four-year colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however, many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis. Community colleges continue as open-enrollment, low-cost institutions with a strong component of vocational education, as well as a low-cost preparation for transfer students into four-year schools. They appeal to a poorer, older, less prepared element.<ref>Jesse P. Bogue, ed.

Over 100 [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs) operate, both private and public.\n\nSome [[U.S. states]] offer higher education at two year \"colleges\" formerly called \"[[community college]]s\".

Completing each course to the schools satisfaction gains the student a number of credits. To enter tertiary education the student will be doing a number of [[Advanced placement]] courses that will gain the highest number of credits. A student graduates from High School when the minimum number of credits has been achieved, and will be accepted by a college when their required number is achieved.

(This is unlike college admissions in many European countries, as well as graduate admissions.) Some students, rather than being rejected, are \"wait-listed\" for a particular college and may be admitted if another student who was admitted decides not to attend the college or university.

In the 1980s and 1990s there were significant changes in the economics of academic life. \nDespite rising tuition rates and growing university revenues, professorial positions were replaced with poorly paid [[Adjunct professors in North America|adjunct]] positions and graduate-student labor.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Case of the Vanishing Full-Time Professor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03strategy-t.html|access-date=December 12, 2012 | work=The New York Times|first=Samantha|last=Stainburn|date=January 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWith academic institutions producing Ph.D.s in greater numbers than the number of tenure-track positions they intended to create, [[Academic administration#United States|administrators]] were cognizant of the economic effects of this arrangement. Sociologist [[Stanley Aronowitz]] wrote: \"Basking in the plenitude of qualified and credentialed instructors, many university administrators see the time when they can once again make tenure a rare privilege, awarded only to the most faithful and to those whose services are in great demand\".<ref>Aronowitz, Stanley.

The first tier includes sports sanctioned by one of the collegiate sport governing bodies. Some of these collegiate sports governing organizations like the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) are umbrella [[non-profit organization]]s that govern multiple sports. Additionally, the first tier is characterized by selective participation, since only the elite programs in their sport are able to participate; some colleges offer [[athletic scholarship]]s to intercollegiate sports competitors. The second tier includes [[intramural]] and recreational sports clubs, which are available to more of the student body. Competition between student clubs from different colleges, not organized by and therefore not representing the institutions or their faculties, may also be called \"intercollegiate\" athletics or simply college sports.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosandich|first=Thomas|title=Collegiate Sports Programs: A Comparative Analysis|page=476|publisher=Education|date=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe largest collegiate sport governing body in the first tier is the NCAA, which regulates athletes of 1,268 institutions across the US and Canada. The NCAA uses a three-division system of [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]].

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n== Slavic dialects spoken in the region of [[Thrace (Greece)|Thrace]] ==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2019}}\nSome of the [[Rup dialects]] of the [[Bulgarian language]] are spoken by the [[Pomaks]] in [[Western Thrace]] in Greece.

Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington, 2003, p. 32.</ref> The [[Communist Party of Greece]] led by [[Nikos Zahariadis]] took the side of the [[Cominform]]. After the defeat of communists in the [[Greek Civil War]] in 1949, a hunt for [[Titoist]] spies began in the midst of Greek political immigrants - civil war refugees, living in socialist countries in Eastern Europe (often coming there after a brief stay in the so called \u201cTito's traitorous fascist Yugoslavia\"). As result the Greek communist publisher \"Nea Ellada\" issued a Macedonian grammar (1952) and developed a different alphabet.  Between 1952 and 1956, the Macedonian Department of Nea Hellas published a number of issues in this literary standard, officially called \" Macedonian language of the Slav Macedonians from Greek or Aegean Macedonia\". This failed attempt of codification included the \u042a, \u042c, \u042e, \u042f, \u0419 and was proclaimed as ''non-serbianised''. However it was merely a form of the Bulgarian.<ref>Euangelos K\u014dphos, Speros Basil Vryonis, Nationalism and communism in Macedonia: civil conflict, politics of mutation, national identity; Center for the Study of Hellenism, A.

Although this \"Aegean Macedonian language\" legitimized the symbolic importance of the \"Macedonian language\" and thus facilitated the later spread of the standard Yugoslav Macedonian norm among the Aegean emigrants, it also delayed this process, creating certain reservations towards the Yugoslavian Macedonian standard. Educated in this norm ''Greek refugees'' were nearly unable to adopt later the ''Yugoslav version''.<ref>Roumen Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies; BRILL, 2013; {{ISBN|900425076X}}, p. 480.</ref>\n====Communist refugees from Greece in Australia ====\nThe Macedonian [[Refugees of the Greek Civil War|Greek Civil War Refugees]] in Australia issued a ''[[Makedonska Iskra]]'' (Macedonian Spark).

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n== Slavic dialects spoken in the region of [[Thrace (Greece)|Thrace]] ==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2019}}\nSome of the [[Rup dialects]] of the [[Bulgarian language]] are spoken by the [[Pomaks]] in [[Western Thrace]] in Greece.

Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington, 2003, p. 32.</ref> The [[Communist Party of Greece]] led by [[Nikos Zahariadis]] took the side of the [[Cominform]]. After the defeat of communists in the [[Greek Civil War]] in 1949, a hunt for [[Titoist]] spies began in the midst of Greek political immigrants - civil war refugees, living in socialist countries in Eastern Europe (often coming there after a brief stay in the so called \u201cTito's traitorous fascist Yugoslavia\"). As result the Greek communist publisher \"Nea Ellada\" issued a Macedonian grammar (1952) and developed a different alphabet.  Between 1952 and 1956, the Macedonian Department of Nea Hellas published a number of issues in this literary standard, officially called \" Macedonian language of the Slav Macedonians from Greek or Aegean Macedonia\". This failed attempt of codification included the \u042a, \u042c, \u042e, \u042f, \u0419 and was proclaimed as ''non-serbianised''. However it was merely a form of the Bulgarian.<ref>Euangelos K\u014dphos, Speros Basil Vryonis, Nationalism and communism in Macedonia: civil conflict, politics of mutation, national identity; Center for the Study of Hellenism, A.

Although this \"Aegean Macedonian language\" legitimized the symbolic importance of the \"Macedonian language\" and thus facilitated the later spread of the standard Yugoslav Macedonian norm among the Aegean emigrants, it also delayed this process, creating certain reservations towards the Yugoslavian Macedonian standard. Educated in this norm ''Greek refugees'' were nearly unable to adopt later the ''Yugoslav version''.<ref>Roumen Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies; BRILL, 2013; {{ISBN|900425076X}}, p. 480.</ref>\n===Communist refugees in Australia ===\nThe Macedonian [[Refugees of the Greek Civil War|Greek Civil War Refugees]] in Australia issued a ''[[Makedonska Iskra]]'' (Macedonian Spark).
