{"title_page": "Silver mining", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Silver mine||Silvermine (disambiguation)}}\n[[Image:Silberbergwerk Suggental Josephistollen.jpg|thumb|right|An underground silver mine in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], Germany]]\n'''Silver mining''' is the [[resource extraction]] of [[silver]] by [[mining]].\n\nSilver is found in a [[native metal|native]] form very rarely as nuggets, but more usually combined with [[sulfur]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], or [[chlorine]] and in various ores such as [[argentite]] (Ag<sub>2</sub>[[sulfur|S]]), [[chlorargyrite]] (\"horn silver,\" Ag[[chlorine|Cl]]), and [[galena]] (a [[lead]] ore often containing significant amounts of silver). As silver is often found in conjunction with these or alloyed with other metals such as gold, it usually must be further extracted through amalgamation or electrolysis.\n\nSilver mining has been undertaken since early times. As silver is a [[precious metal]] often used for [[coins]], its mining has historically often been lucrative. As with other precious metals such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], newly discovered deposits of silver ore have sparked [[silver rush]]es of miners seeking their fortunes. In recent centuries, large deposits were discovered and mined in the Americas, influencing the growth and development of Mexico, Andean countries such as Bolivia, Chile, and Peru, as well as Canada and the United States.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:EarlyAthenianCoin.jpg|thumb|Early silver [[Athenian]] coin, 5th century BCE. [[British Museum]].]]\nSilver has been known since ancient times. Silver is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]], and slag heaps found in [[Asia Minor]] and on the islands of the [[Aegean Sea]] indicate that silver was being separated from [[lead]] as early as the [[4th millennium BCE|4th millennium BC]]. The silver mines at [[Laurium]] were very rich and helped provide a currency for the economy of [[Ancient Athens]]. It involved mining the ore in underground galleries, washing the ores and [[smelting]] it ttal. Elaborate washing tables still exist at the site using rain water held in cisterns and collected during the winter months.\n\nExtraction of silver from lead ore was widespread in [[Roman Britain]] as a result of [[Roman mining]] very soon after the conquest of the first century AD.\n\nFrom the mid-15th century silver began to be extracted from copper ores in massive quantities using the [[liquation]] process creating a boost to the mining and [[metallurgy]] industries of [[Central Europe]].\n\n===Americas===\n[[File:Capitulo-CIX.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cerro de Potos\u00ed|Potosi]], discovered in 1545, produced massive amounts of silver from a single site in upper Peru. The first image published in Europe. [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], 1553.]]\n[[File:Potosi Real.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver [[Spanish real]] from the silver of Potos\u00ed, Bolivia. The amount of silver mined at Potos\u00ed and other locations in the [[Spanish Empire]] led to significant inflation in Europe.]]\nVast amounts of silver were brought into the possession of the crowns of Europe after the [[European colonization of the Americas|conquest]] of the [[Americas]] from the now Mexican state of [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] (discovered in 1546)<ref>Dan Oancea: Low Sulphidation Epithermal Vein Deposits http://technology.infomine.com/articles/1/546/silver.sulphidation.epithermal/silver.deposits.\u2013.aspx</ref>  and [[Potos\u00ed]] (Bolivia, also discovered in 1546), which triggered a period of inflation in Europe. Silver mining required large amounts of mercury to extract the metal from ore.

As silver is often found in conjunction with these or alloyed with other metals such as gold, it usually must be further extracted through amalgamation or electrolysis.\n\nSilver mining has been undertaken since early times. As silver is a [[precious metal]] often used for [[coins]], its mining has historically often been lucrative. As with other precious metals such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], newly discovered deposits of silver ore have sparked [[silver rush]]es of miners seeking their fortunes. In recent centuries, large deposits were discovered and mined in the Americas, influencing the growth and development of Mexico, Andean countries such as Bolivia, Chile, and Peru, as well as Canada and the United States.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:EarlyAthenianCoin.jpg|thumb|Early silver [[Athenian]] coin, 5th century BCE. [[British Museum]].]]\nSilver has been known since ancient times. Silver is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]], and slag heaps found in [[Asia Minor]] and on the islands of the [[Aegean Sea]] indicate that silver was being separated from [[lead]] as early as the [[4th millennium BCE|4th millennium BC]]. The silver mines at [[Laurium]] were very rich and helped provide a currency for the economy of [[Ancient Athens]]. It involved mining the ore in underground galleries, washing the ores and [[smelting]] it to produce the metal. Elaborate washing tables still exist at the site using rain water held in cisterns and collected during the winter months.\n\nExtraction of silver from lead ore was widespread in [[Roman Britain]] as a result of [[Roman mining]] very soon after the conquest of the first century AD.\n\nFrom the mid-15th century silver began to be extracted from copper ores in massive quantities using the [[liquation]] process creating a boost to the mining and [[metallurgy]] industries of [[Central Europe]].\n\n===Americas===\n[[File:Capitulo-CIX.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cerro de Potos\u00ed|Potosi]], discovered in 1545, produced massive amounts of silver from a single site in upper Peru.

The amount of silver mined at Potos\u00ed and other locations in the [[Spanish Empire]] led to significant inflation in Europe.]]\nVast amounts of silver were brought into the possession of the crowns of Europe after the [[European colonization of the Americas|conquest]] of the [[Americas]] from the now Mexican state of [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] (discovered in 1546)<ref>Dan Oancea: Low Sulphidation Epithermal Vein Deposits http://technology.infomine.com/articles/1/546/silver.sulphidation.epithermal/silver.deposits.\u2013.aspx</ref>  and [[Potos\u00ed]] (Bolivia, also discovered in 1546), which triggered a period of inflation in Europe. Silver mining required large amounts of mercury to extract the metal from ore.  In the Andes, the source was the [[Huancavelica]] mercury mine; Mexico was dependent on mercury from the [[Almad\u00e9n]] mercury mine in Spain. Mercury had a very high and adverse environmental impact.<ref>Nicholas A. Robins, ''Mercury, Mining, and Empire: The Human and Ecological Cost of Colonial Silver Mining in the Andes''.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The engineering factory of [[Pietrarsa]] was the largest industrial plant in the Italian peninsula{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}, producing tools, [[cannon]]s, rails, [[locomotive]]s. The complex also included a school for train drivers, and naval engineers and, thanks to this school, the kingdom was able to replace the English personnel who had been necessary until then. The first [[steamboat]] with [[propellor|screw propulsion]] known in the Mediterranean Sea was the \"Giglio delle Onde\", with mail delivery and passenger transport purposes after 1847.\n\nIn Calabria, the Fonderia Ferdinandea was a large [[foundry]] where cast iron was produced. The [[Reali ferriere ed Officine di Mongiana]] was an iron foundry and [[weapon]]s factory. Founded in 1770, it employed 1600 workers in 1860 and closed in 1880.  In Sicily (near [[Catania]] and [[Agrigento]]), [[sulfur]] was mined to make [[gunpowder]]. The Sicilian mines were able to satisfy most of the global demand for sulfur. [[Silk]] cloth production was focused in [[San Leucio]] (near [[Caserta]]). The region of [[Basilicata]] also had several mills in [[Potenza]] and [[San Chirico Raparo]], where [[cotton]], [[wool]] and silk were processed.

In [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]] Britain, with the repeal of [[Tariff|tariffs]] on salt in 1824, demand for sulfur from Sicily surged upward. The increasing British control and exploitation of the mining, refining, and transportation of the sulfur, coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform Sicily's backward and impoverished economy, led to the 'Sulfur Crisis' of 1840, when [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]] gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a French firm, violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with Britain.

One of the most important industrial complexes in the kingdom was the [[shipyard]] of [[Castellammare di Stabia]], which employed 1800 workers. The engineering factory of [[Pietrarsa]] was the largest industrial plant in the Italian peninsula{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}, producing tools, [[cannon]]s, rails, [[locomotive]]s. The complex also included a school for train drivers, and naval engineers and, thanks to this school, the kingdom was able to replace the English personnel who had been necessary until then. The first [[steamboat]] with [[propellor|screw propulsion]] known in the Mediterranean Sea was the \"Giglio delle Onde\", with mail delivery and passenger transport purposes after 1847.\n\nIn Calabria, the Fonderia Ferdinandea was a large [[foundry]] where cast iron was produced. The [[Reali ferriere ed Officine di Mongiana]] was an iron foundry and [[weapon]]s factory. Founded in 1770, it employed 1600 workers in 1860 and closed in 1880.  In Sicily (near [[Catania]] and [[Agrigento]]), [[sulfur]] was mined to make [[gunpowder]]. The Sicilian mines were able to satisfy most of the global demand for sulfur. [[Silk]] cloth production was focused in [[San Leucio]] (near [[Caserta]]). The region of [[Basilicata]] also had several mills in [[Potenza]] and [[San Chirico Raparo]], where [[cotton]], [[wool]] and silk were processed.  [[food industry|Food processing]] was widespread, especially near [[Naples]] ([[Torre Annunziata]] and [[Gragnano]]).<!-- Deleted because just too incredible and unsourced.

In [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]] Britain, with the repeal of [[Tariff|tariffs]] on salt in 1824, demand for sulfur from Sicily surged upward. The increasing British control and exploitation of the mining, refining, and transportation of the sulfur, coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform Sicily's backward and impoverished economy, led to the 'Sulfur Crisis' of 1840, when [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]] gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a French firm, violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with Britain. A peaceful solution was eventually negotiated by France.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=D.
