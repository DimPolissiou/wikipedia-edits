Production credits include a single with Brighton [[jangle pop]] outfit [[The Popguns]] (\"Crazy\", 1991) and ''[[Gravy Deco]]'' for [[Robyn Hitchcock]].\n\nIn 2002, Seligman played at the Shanghai Festival with Snail, along with Chris Bell and [[Jon Klein (musician)|Jonathan Klein]], and in 2007 began working with the Fire Escapes. In 2011\u201312 he contributed to Thomas Dolby's ''[[A Map of the Floating City]]'' also appearing with him on tours of the UK and northern Europe, at the Blue Note in Tokyo in February 2012 and at the Latitude Festival, Suffolk, the UK in July 2012. In 2014, with fellow Fire Escapers Mark Headley and Lucy Pullin, he completed the Magical Creatures' ''Wishing Machine'' collection, also appearing live with them at a summer 2016 William Burroughs-inspired launch party in Brighton, UK.\n\nMatthew has always played a black Fender Jazz bass as his first choice instrument.

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Flintstones]]''\n|1960\u20131966\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstones episodes|166 episodes]]\n|6\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|4\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|5\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|6\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''The New Shmoo''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|8\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|11\n|''[[Cave Kids]]''\n|1996\n|[[Cartoon Network]]\n|8 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].

There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]].

In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television series===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Flintstones]]''\n|1960\u20131966\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstones episodes|166 episodes]]\n|6\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|4\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|5\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|6\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''The New Shmoo''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|8\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|11\n|''[[Cave Kids]]''\n|1996\n|[[Cartoon Network]]\n|8 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

His mother was Muhammad's aunt, [[Safiyyah bint \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]], hence Al-Zubayr was Muhammad's first cousin.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|75}} He had two brothers, Sa'ib and Abdul Kaaba; a maternal brother, Safi ibn Al-Harith, who was from the Umayya clan;<ref name=\"Saad8\">Muhammad ibn Saad.

Safiya, who was pregnant at the time, had to carry the man home. When the passers-by asked what had happened, she told them, \"He fought Al-Zubayr. Did you find Al-Zubayr soft like cheese or dates or full of brass?\" That's when they knew that he would grow up to be strong during war.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|765}}\n\nAl-Awwam died while Al-Zubayr was still young. His mother used to beat him severely. When it was said to her, \"You have killed him! You have wrenched his heart. Will you destroy the boy?\" she replied, \"I beat him so that he will be intelligent and will be bold in the battle.\"<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|76}}\n\nAl-Zubayr is described as of medium height, lean, dark-complexioned and hairy, though with a thin beard. His hair hung down to his shoulders, and he did not dye it after it turned white.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\n==Conversion to Islam==\n\nAl-Zubayr was one of the first five men to accept Islam under the influence of [[Abu Bakr]],<ref name=\"Ishaq\">Muhammad ibn Ishaq.

The ''Negus'' met the rebels on the banks of the Nile. The Muslims, greatly worried about losing their protector, delegated Al-Zubayr to be their news-bearer. Helped by an inflated waterskin, he swam down the Nile until he reached the point where the battle was being fought. He watched until the ''Negus'' had defeated the rebels, then swam back to the Muslims. He ran up waving his clothes and announced, \"Hurrah, the ''Negus'' has conquered and God has destroyed his enemies and established him in his land!\" The Muslims rejoiced.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|153}}\n\nAl-Zubayr was among those who returned to Mecca in 619 because they heard that the Meccans had converted to Islam. \"But when they got near to Mecca, they learned that the report was false, so that they entered the town under the protection of a citizen or by stealth.\"<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|167\u2013168}} However, Al-Zubayr did not name his protector.\n\nAl-Zubayr joined the general [[Hijra (Islam)|emigration]] to [[Medina]] in 622. At first he lodged with Al-Mundhir ibn Muhammad. It is disputed who became Al-Zubayr's \"brother\" in Islam: variant traditions name [[Abdullah, son of Masud|Abdullah ibn Masood]], [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]], Kaab ibn Malik and Salama ibn Salama.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|76\u201377}}<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|234}} Muhammad gave him a large plot of land to build his house and a grant of some palm trees.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|77}} In 625 Al-Zubayr was given more palm trees from the land of the expelled Nadir tribe.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|78}}\n\n==Military Activity under Muhammad==\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Main|List of expeditions of Muhammad}}\nIt is said that Al-Zubayr joined all of Muhammad's military expeditions,<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|76}} typically dressed in a distinctive yellow turban.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|77}}\n\n===Badr===\n\nAt the [[Battle of Badr]] he was sent as a scout and he captured a Meccan spy.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|295}} He then fought in the battle<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|328}} and killed Ubayda ibn Sa'id of the Umayya.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|337}}\n\n===Uhud===\n\nAt the [[Battle of Uhud]] he volunteered to take up Muhammad's sword \"with its right,\" which was to \"smite the enemy with it until it bends,\" and was \"much mortified\" when Muhammad rejected his offer.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|373}} He was standing so close to the fleeing Meccan women that he could see [[Hind bint Utbah]]'s anklets.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|379}} But it was at that point that the battle turned; Al-Zubayr was one of the handful of men who stood beside Muhammad when the Muslims in their turn fled and who accompanied him to the glen. \"He was firm with him in the Battle of Uhud and he gave him allegiance to the death.\"<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|78}}<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|381}}\n\n===The Trench===\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Trench]], Al-Zubayr rode a [[Roan (horse)|roan horse]]. He volunteered to bring news of the [[Banu Qurayza|Qurayza]] tribe to Muhammad, who responded, \"Every Prophet has a disciple, and my disciple is Al-Zubayr.\"<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|79}}\n\n===Khaybar===\n\nIn 628 Al-Zubayr joined the expedition to [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]] and answered Yasir the Jew's challenge to single combat. His mother Safiya asked Muhammad, \"Will he kill my son?\" and Muhammad reassured her, \"No, your son will kill him, Allah willing.\" Al-Zubayr advanced reciting:\n\n<poem>\"''Khaybar, know that I am Zabbar,''\n''chief of a people no cowardly runaways,''\n''the son of those who defend their glory,''\n''the son of princes.''\n''O Yasir let not all the unbelievers deceive you,''\n''for all of them are like a slowly moving mirage.''\"</poem>\n\nThey fought, and Al-Zubayr killed Yasir. Afterwards the Muslims commented on how sharp his sword must have been; Al-Zubayr replied that it had not been sharp but he had used it with great force.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|513\u2013514}}\n\nAfter the Muslims had conquered [[Al-Qamus]], the Jewish treasurer, [[Kenana ibn al-Rabi|Kinana]], was brought to Muhammad, but he refused to reveal where their money was hidden.

When they could not find the letter in her baggage, they realised she must have concealed it on her person, so they talked her into it. The spy then produced the letter, which she had hidden in her hair, and Al-Zubayr and Ali brought it back to Muhammad, confident that the Muslims would now take Mecca by surprise.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|545}}\n\nWhen Muhammad entered Mecca, Al-Zubayr held one of the three banners of the Emigrants<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|78}} and commanded the left wing of the conquering army.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|549}} He also fought at the [[Battle of Hunayn]].<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|670}}\n\n==Career After Muhammad==\nIn the third week of July 632, the Caliph Abu Bakr scraped together an army mainly from the [[Banu Hashim]] (the clan of Muhammad) to defend Medina from an imminent invasion by the apostate forces of [[Tulayha]], a self-proclaimed prophet. The army included stalwarts like Zubayr, and Talha ibn Ubaidullah. Each of them was appointed as commander of one-third of the newly organised force. They had their roles during the [[Ridda Wars]]; however, they did not face any combat scenario.\n\nAl-Zubayr was the most successful field commander during the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] under Caliph [[Umar]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} He commanded a regiment in the decisive [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} and in 640 he commanded the reinforcements sent to [[Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Egypt]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nWhen Umar was dying in 644, he selected Al-Zubayr and five other men to elect the next [[Caliph]].<ref name=\"Medlung\">{{cite book |last=Medlung |first=Wilferd |date=1997 |title=The succession to Muhammad |url=http://de.scribd.com/doc/115924270/The-Succession-to-Muhammad-a-Study-of-the-Early-Caliphate |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521561817 |accessdate=June 30, 2014 }}</ref>{{rp|71}} They duly elected [[Uthman]],<ref name=\"Medlung\"/>{{rp|72}} during whose caliphate, Al-Zubayr was not involved in political or military matters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\nAl-Zubayr was cautious about narrating ''ahadith'' about Muhammad even though he had been constantly in his company.

His mother was Muhammad's aunt, [[Safiyyah bint \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]], hence Al-Zubayr was Muhammad's first cousin.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|75}} He had two brothers, Sa'ib and Abdul Kaaba; a maternal brother, Safi ibn Al-Harith, who was from the Umayya clan;<ref name=\"Saad8\">Muhammad ibn Saad.

Safiya, who was pregnant at the time, had to carry the man home. When the passers-by asked what had happened, she told them, \"He fought Al-Zubayr. Did you find Al-Zubayr soft like cheese or dates or full of brass?\" That's when they knew that he would grow up to be strong during war.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|765}}\n\nAl-Awam died while Al-Zubayr was still young. His mother used to beat him severely. When it was said to her, \"You have killed him! You have wrenched his heart. Will you destroy the boy?\" she replied, \"I beat him so that he will be intelligent and will be bold in the battle.\"<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|76}}\n\nAl-Zubayr is described as of medium height, lean, dark-complexioned and hairy, though with a thin beard. His hair hung down to his shoulders, and he did not dye it after it turned white.<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\n==Conversion to Islam==\n\nAl-Zubayr was one of the first five men to accept Islam under the influence of [[Abu Bakr]],<ref name=\"Ishaq\">Muhammad ibn Ishaq.

The ''Negus'' met the rebels on the banks of the Nile. The Muslims, greatly worried about losing their protector, delegated Al-Zubayr to be their news-bearer. Helped by an inflated waterskin, he swam down the Nile until he reached the point where the battle was being fought. He watched until the ''Negus'' had defeated the rebels, then swam back to the Muslims. He ran up waving his clothes and announced, \"Hurrah, the ''Negus'' has conquered and God has destroyed his enemies and established him in his land!\" The Muslims rejoiced.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|153}}\n\nAl-Zubayr was among those who returned to Mecca in 619 because they heard that the Meccans had converted to Islam. \"But when they got near to Mecca, they learned that the report was false, so that they entered the town under the protection of a citizen or by stealth.\"<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|167\u2013168}} However, Al-Zubayr did not name his protector.\n\nAl-Zubayr joined the general [[Hijra (Islam)|emigration]] to [[Medina]] in 622. At first he lodged with Al-Mundhir ibn Muhammad.

He volunteered to bring news of the [[Banu Qurayza|Qurayza]] tribe to Muhammad, who responded, \"Every Prophet has a disciple, and my disciple is Al-Zubayr.\"<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|79}}\n\n===Khaybar===\n\nIn 628 Al-Zubayr joined the expedition to [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]] and answered Yasir the Jew's challenge to single combat. His mother Safiya asked Muhammad, \"Will he kill my son?\" and Muhammad reassured her, \"No, your son will kill him, Allah willing.\" Al-Zubayr advanced reciting:\n\n<poem>\"''Khaybar, know that I am Zabbar,''\n''chief of a people no cowardly runaways,''\n''the son of those who defend their glory,''\n''the son of princes.''\n''O Yasir let not all the unbelievers deceive you,''\n''for all of them are like a slowly moving mirage.''\"</poem>\n\nThey fought, and Al-Zubayr killed Yasir. Afterwards the Muslims commented on how sharp his sword must have been; Al-Zubayr replied that it had not been sharp but he had used it with great force.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|513\u2013514}}\n\nAfter the Muslims had conquered [[Al-Qamus]], the Jewish treasurer, [[Kenana ibn al-Rabi|Kinana]], was brought to Muhammad, but he refused to reveal where their money was hidden.

When they could not find the letter in her baggage, they realised she must have concealed it on her person, so they talked her into it. The spy then produced the letter, which she had hidden in her hair, and Al-Zubayr and Ali brought it back to Muhammad, confident that the Muslims would now take Mecca by surprise.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|545}}\n\nWhen Muhammad entered Mecca, Al-Zubayr held one of the three banners of the Emigrants<ref name=\"Saad3\"/>{{rp|78}} and commanded the left wing of the conquering army.<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|549}} He also fought at the [[Battle of Hunayn]].<ref name=\"Ishaq\"/>{{rp|670}}\n\n==Career After Muhammad==\nIn the third week of July 632, the Caliph Abu Bakr scraped together an army mainly from the [[Banu Hashim]] (the clan of Muhammad) to defend Medina from an imminent invasion by the apostate forces of [[Tulayha]], a self-proclaimed prophet. The army included stalwarts like Zubayr, and Talha ibn Ubaidullah. Each of them was appointed as commander of one-third of the newly organised force. They had their roles during the [[Ridda Wars]]; however, they did not face any combat scenario.\n\nAl-Zubayr was the most successful field commander during the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] under Caliph [[Umar]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} He commanded a regiment in the decisive [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} and in 640 he commanded the reinforcements sent to [[Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Egypt]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nWhen Umar was dying in 644, he selected Al-Zubayr and five other men to elect the next [[Caliph]].<ref name=\"Medlung\">{{cite book |last=Medlung |first=Wilferd |date=1997 |title=The succession to Muhammad |url=http://de.scribd.com/doc/115924270/The-Succession-to-Muhammad-a-Study-of-the-Early-Caliphate |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521561817 |accessdate=June 30, 2014 }}</ref>{{rp|71}} They duly elected [[Uthman]],<ref name=\"Medlung\"/>{{rp|72}} during whose caliphate, Al-Zubayr was not involved in political or military matters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\nAl-Zubayr was cautious about narrating ''ahadith'' about Muhammad even though he had been constantly in his company.
