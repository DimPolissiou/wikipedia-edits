He meets up with the widow of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann, who has been killed by [[the Mafia]] while driving a [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the [[Italian Alps]]. Mrs Beckermann gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the hostile attention of his killers, which details a way to steal $4 million in gold in the city of [[Turin]] and escape to [[Switzerland]].\n\nCroker breaks back into his former prison to convince the powerful crime lord Mr. Bridger, who is intensely nationalistic, to finance the plan. Bridger, who has bribed almost all of the prison guards to work for him, initially rejects the plan, but changes his mind after he learns that [[Fiat]] is set to build a new factory in [[China]].\n\nWith Bridger's backing, Croker recruits computer expert Professor Peach and a team of thieves and drivers. The plan calls for Peach to replace the programme in the computer that controls Turin's [[Advanced Traffic Management System|traffic control system]], creating a paralysing traffic jam that will allow the thieves to escape with the gold in three [[Mini Cooper S]] getaway cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theitalianjob.com/cars_coopers.htm|title=Cars \u2013 Mini Coopers|work=The Italian Job.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter planning and training, Croker, his girlfriend Lorna, and the heist crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann. Altabani warns Croker that the Mafia are aware of the gang's intentions and smashes their getaway cars (two [[Jaguar E-Type]] and an [[Aston Martin DB4]] drophead) off a cliff. Just as Altabani is about to give the order to shoot the gang, Croker tells him that Mr. Bridger will avenge their deaths by driving Italian merchants in selected British cities out of business. Not wanting to risk suffering on any fellow Italians, Altabani lets them go, ordering them to return to England and believing that it is too big a job for Croker to undertake. Instead, Croker proceeds with the plan, replacing the traffic control system's [[magnetic tape data storage]] reels. On the day of the robbery, Croker sends gang member Birkinshaw, disguised as a football fan, to jam the [[closed circuit television]] cameras that monitor traffic. The substitute data reel then causes widespread traffic chaos. The gang converge on the gold convoy, overpower the guards, and tow the armoured car into the entrance hall of the [[Museo Egizio]]. There, the gang transfer the gold to the Minis.\n\nAltabani recognises that \"If they planned this jam, they must have planned a way out.\" Pursued by the Turin police, the three Minis race through the shopping arcades of the city, speed down stairs, jump between rooftops, and finally escape the traffic jams by a pre-planned route across a [[weir]]. The getaway is timed perfectly, and they throw off the police by driving through a large sewer pipe. As Mr. Bridger receives the cheers and adulation of his fellow prison inmates, the gang drive the Minis into the back of a moving customised coach. They then unload the gold and dispose of the Minis by pushing them off the mountainside.\n\nThe rest of the gang, having sneaked out of the city in a minibus while disguised as football supporters, rendezvous with the coach in the Alps. On the looping mountain roads, driver \"Big\" William loses control of the coach. The back of the bus is left teetering over a cliff and the gold slides towards the rear doors. As Croker attempts to reach the gold, it slips further. The film finishes on a literal [[cliffhanger]] with Croker announcing:  \"Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Mark |title='Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea!'

The property was later seen in films such as ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (1973), ''[[A Touch of Class (film)|A Touch of Class]]'' (1973), and ''[[Sweeney!]]'' (1977). \n\nThe training sessions shown for the Mini drivers were at the [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]] race track in [[Upper Norwood]], South London. The attempt to blow the doors off the bullion van, which led to its destruction and Croker's famous line, took place at Crystal Palace Sports Centre. The [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace transmitter]] can be seen in the background. The meeting at the misty funeral was filmed in [[Cruagh]] Cemetery, in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains. The [[office block]] that doubled as the Turin traffic control centre was Apex House, the [[Hanworth]], [[Middlesex]] head office of the television rental chain [[Radio Rentals|DER]].<ref name = \"makingof\" />\n\n[[File:1960 Morris Mini - The Italian Job - Coventry Transport Museum.jpg|thumb|right|A display of a Mini emerging from a sewer tunnel in [[Coventry Transport Museum]]]]\n\nThe chase sequences were filmed in Turin, except for the chase through the sewer tunnel, which was shot in the [[River Sowe|Sowe]] Valley Sewer Duplication system in the [[Stoke Aldermoor]] district of [[Coventry]] in the English Midlands, filmed from the back of a [[Mini Moke]].<ref name=\"makingof\" /> The person on the far side who closes the gate at the end of sewer tunnel is the director, Peter Collinson.

The weir the Minis cross in the car chase is just down river from the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele I at the end of [[Po (river)|Via Po]] in central Turin.\n\nA portion of the car chase was filmed as a dance between the Minis and police cars with a full orchestra playing \"[[The Blue Danube]]\" inside [[Pier Luigi Nervi]]'s Palazzo Esposizioni usually used for the Turin Motor Show (now the hospital library).<ref name = \"makingof\" /> It was cut from the final version and appears as an extra on the [[DVD]].\n\nThe final escape from Turin was filmed on the road to [[Ceresole Reale]] via [[Lago Agnel]] and [[Nivolet Pass]] (the highway does not lead to France or Switzerland because it is a dead end). The bus was left hanging off this corner<ref>https://goo.gl/maps/sNCidc999BQ2</ref> in the climactic ending.\n\n==Vehicles==\n[[File:The Italian Job - geograph.org.uk - 953936.jpg|thumb|right|Minis on display at Bardney Heritage Centre]]\nRoger Beckermann's orange [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the opening scene is actually two cars. The first was a Miura P400 that was sold as new afterwards. In 2015 it was unearthed and authenticated by Iain Tyrrell, one of the world's foremost classic car experts and Lamborghini aficionado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaintyrrell.co.uk/media | title = iaintyrrell.co.uk/media | accessdate = 8 Jan 2018}}</ref> The second car, tumbled down the chasm by the Mafia bulldozer, was another Miura that had previously been in a serious accident and was not roadworthy. Lamborghini confirmed in May 2019 that the Italian Job Miura had been confirmed as chassis number 3586.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/classic-cars/italian-jobs-lost-lamborghini-miura-found/|title=The Italian Job's lost Lamborghini Miura has been found|date=2019-05-08|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the director's commentary on the DVD, despite the publicity the film would give to the Mini, the car's maker, [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]], only provided a token fleet of Minis and the production company had to buy the rest at trade price. [[Fiat]] offered the production as many super-charged Fiat cars as they needed, several sports cars for the Mafia confrontation scene, plus $40,000, but the producers turned down the offer because it would have meant replacing the Minis with Fiats.\n\nThe Minis seen on screen carry registration numbers HMP 729G (Red), GPF 146G (White) and LGW 809G (Blue). As at July 2012, a [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|DVLA]] query indicates that two of these plates may still be registered; these, however, are not the cars used in the film as the film cars had \"future dated\" plates to make them current with the release date of the film, and as such would not be road legal. There were also numerous detail differences between the Minis used during filming and the launch of the \"G\" year suffix. According to the \"making of\" DVD extra, the Minis used in the chase scenes were all destroyed in accidents while filming the sewer sequence.\n\nAs Croker walks through the garage where the Minis are being prepared, viewers hear that \"Rozzer's having trouble with his differential\", and the back of the red Mini Cooper is jacked up where Rozzer is working. This is an inside joke since the Mini has front-wheel drive and does not have a rear differential. In the early 1960s, front-wheel-drive cars were new and asking a car mechanic to repair a Mini's rear differential was a popular [[snipe hunt]].\n\nGold cost $38.69 per [[troy ounce]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kitco.com/charts/historicalgold.html | title = Hisotical Gold Charts and Data | publisher=Kitco | accessdate = 29 May 2006 }}</ref> so four million dollars in gold bars would have weighed about 3200&nbsp;kg (7000&nbsp;lb), requiring each of the three Minis to carry about 1070&nbsp;kg (2300&nbsp;lb) in addition to the driver and passenger. Since a 1968 Mini only weighs 630&nbsp;kg (1400&nbsp;lb),<ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Chris|title=Complete Classic Mini 1959\u20132000|isbn=9781899870608|year=2003|publisher=Motor Racing Publications|location=Croydon}}</ref> each of these vehicles would have had to carry 1\u00bd times its own weight in gold.\n\nThe coach at the end of the film was a 1964 [[Bedford VAL]] with [[Harrington Legionnaire]] Body, distinctive for its twin front steering axles. After its use in the film, the coach returned to commercial service. It was scrapped about 1990 after being in service with several operators, mainly in the Scotland area. The coach had to be reinforced behind the driver's seat so that when the Coopers came into the back they didn't crush the driver. Even though plating had been secured, the driver's seat was still pushed forward several inches, enough for the driver to be touching the steering wheel with his stomach.\n\nWhen the Legionnaire was on its way to Turin, it has London-Turin on the destination display above the windscreen; on the way back it had been changed to Turin-London. It also proudly displayed 'Charlie Croker's Coach Tours' logos on the rear and both flanks. Following the filming, the coach had its improvised rear doors welded and was used on a Scottish school bus route until the mid-1980s when, according to the Legionnaire register, it was scrapped. However, a replica can be found on the roadside at New Invention, Willenhall, West Midlands.\n\nCharlie Croker picks up his [[Aston Martin DB4]] convertible from a garage after release from prison. The scene was mostly improvised, which caused visible lighting irregularities since the crew did not know where the actors would be. The location of the underground carpark and lift is now part of Park Lane BMW, London.\n\nThe original DB4 belongs today to a private English collection. According to several sources, the \"Aston\" pushed off the cliff was a [[Vignale]] [[Lancia Flaminia]] mocked up as an Aston. The two [[Jaguar E-Type|E-type Jaguars]] that suffered from the Mafia's revenge were restored to original condition, the red one of which, 848 CRY, is owned by Phillip Porter, the founder of the Jaguar E-type club.\n\nThe black [[Fiat Dino]] coup\u00e9 of Mafia boss Altabani was bought by Peter Collinson but became so rusty that only its doors remain. The [[Italy|Italian]] police cars seen around [[Turin]] were [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]s. The Italian police armoured car which escorts the gold convoy is a conversion of a former Second World War American [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car. The original 37mm gun was removed and replaced with a water cannon.\n\nA [[Land Rover Series]] IIa Station Wagon, registration BKO 686C, was used to get to the convoy before attacking and was modified with window bars and a [[towbar]]. A [[Ford Thames 400E]] van was used for the football fans' decorated van; this was referred to as the [[Dormobile]], the name of a common [[camper-van]] conversion [[coachbuilder]]. The cross-Channel ferry featured in one scene is the [[MS Free Enterprise I|MS ''Free Enterprise I'']]. The ship spent many years as a day cruise ship in Greek waters before being scrapped in 2013. The \"Chinese\" plane delivering the gold to Turin is a rare [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]], of which only 14 were built and only four passed into private ownership. It had been abandoned in Milan by its owners and was moved to Turin for filming. It was destroyed by fire in 1970.<ref name=\"serial\">{{cite web|url=http://cgibin.rcn.com/jeremy.k/cgi-bin/gzUsafSearch.pl?target=&content=Globemaster |title=USAF Serial Number Search Results|accessdate=26 November 2010|work=Aircraft Serial Number Search|first=Jeremy|last=Kuris|date=25 March 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|The Italian Job (soundtrack)}}\n{{Listen|filename=Matt Monro - On Days Like These excerpt.ogg|title=Matt Monro \u2013 On Days Like These excerpt|description=An excerpt from Matt Monro's ''On Days Like These''}}\nThe music for the soundtrack was written by [[Quincy Jones]].

He complimented the film's technological sophistication, only criticising what he saw as an 'emotionally retarded' plot. Canby also expressed concern that Coward's appearance in the film, although intended to be kind, 'exploits him in vaguely unpleasant ways' by surrounding his character with images of the royal family, which had not knighted him at the time. A contemporary review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine felt that the film spent too much time focusing on the film's caper as opposed to building the characters; it also criticised the car chases as 'dull and deafening'.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901493,00.html | title = Cinema: Britannia Waives the Rules | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 16 October 2011 | date=19 September 1969}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was the 14th most popular at the UK box office in 1969.<ref>{{cite news|title=The World's Top Twenty Films |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=27 September 1970 |via=The Sunday Times Digital Archive }}</ref> Although it received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Best English-Language Foreign Film\", the film was not a success in the US. The film remains popular, however. James Travers of Films de France believes that the film's enduring appeal rests in the 'improbable union' of Michael Caine, No\u00ebl Coward and [[Benny Hill]], whom he considers \"three of the best known [British] performers... in the late 1960s\". He states that the film has a [[cult following|cult status]] and stands as a 'classic of its genre'.<ref name=\"france\"/>\n\nA [[novelisation]] of the film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin and Ken Wlaschin, was published by [[Sphere Books]] in 1969. The book contains numerous differences to the film: for example there is a rival group of German gangsters called the Hamburg Syndicate who try to obtain Beckerman's plans for the robbery, Croker and the three minis travel to Italy by yacht, and Professor Peach is rescued by the gang after he is arrested. The ending of the novel is also significantly different. The bus successfully crosses the border into Switzerland and two days later the gang and the gold arrive on a beach near Dover in a landing craft where they are met by Mr. Bridger and Luigi Altabani. Mr. Bridger tells Charlie Croker that they have come to an agreement to \"divide Europe\" and that the gold must be given back to the Italians.\n\nSince 2000, there have been two remakes of the film. The first was released in 2003 and also called ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'', set in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Charlie Croker. It features [[Donald Sutherland]] as John Bridger, played as more of a father figure to Croker. It employs the updated [[Mini (BMW)|Mini Cooper]] for a chase towards the end. An official [[Bollywood]] remake of the 2003 film, called ''[[Players (2012 film)|Players]]'', was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=India to Remake 'The Italian Job'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-remake-italian-job-48404|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=11 July 2018|first=Nyay|last=Bhushan|date=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere is a [[The Italian Job (2001 video game)|video game]] based on the 1969 film, released for the [[PlayStation]] [[Video game console|game console]] in 2001 and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002 and published by [[Rockstar Games]].

He meets up with the widow of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann, who has been killed by [[the Mafia]] while driving a [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the [[Italian Alps]]. Mrs Beckermann gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the hostile attention of his killers, which details a way to steal $4 million in gold in the city of [[Turin]] and escape to [[Switzerland]].\n\nCroker breaks back into his former prison to convince the powerful crime lord Mr. Bridger, who is intensely nationalistic, to finance the plan. Bridger, who has bribed almost all of the prison guards to work for him, initially rejects the plan, but changes his mind after he learns that [[Fiat]] is set to build a new factory in [[China]].\n\nWith Bridger's backing, Croker recruits computer expert Professor Peach and a team of thieves and drivers. The plan calls for Peach to replace the programme in the computer that controls Turin's [[Advanced Traffic Management System|traffic control system]], creating a paralysing traffic jam that will allow the thieves to escape with the gold in three [[Mini Cooper S]] getaway cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theitalianjob.com/cars_coopers.htm|title=Cars \u2013 Mini Coopers|work=The Italian Job.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter planning and training, Croker, his girlfriend Lorna, and the heist crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann. Altabani warns Croker that the Mafia are aware of the gang's intentions and smashes their getaway cars (two [[Jaguar E-Type]] and an [[Aston Martin DB4]] drophead) off a cliff. Just as Altabani is about to give the order to shoot the gang, Croker tells him that Mr. Bridger will avenge their deaths by driving Italian merchants in selected British cities out of business. Not wanting to risk suffering on any fellow Italians, Altabani lets them go, ordering them to return to England and believing that it is too big a job for Croker to undertake. Instead, Croker proceeds with the plan, replacing the traffic control system's [[magnetic tape data storage]] reels. On the day of the robbery, Croker sends gang member Birkinshaw, disguised as a football fan, to jam the [[closed circuit television]] cameras that monitor traffic. The substitute data reel then causes widespread traffic chaos. The gang converge on the gold convoy, overpower the guards, and tow the armoured car into the entrance hall of the [[Museo Egizio]]. There, the gang transfer the gold to the Minis.\n\nAltabani recognises that \"If they planned this jam, they must have planned a way out.\" Pursued by the Turin police, the three Minis race through the shopping arcades of the city, speed down stairs, jump between rooftops, and finally escape the traffic jams by a pre-planned route across a [[weir]]. The getaway is timed perfectly, and they throw off the police by driving through a large sewer pipe. As Mr. Bridger receives the cheers and adulation of his fellow prison inmates, the gang drive the Minis into the back of a moving customised coach. They then unload the gold and dispose of the Minis by pushing them off the mountainside.\n\nThe rest of the gang, having sneaked out of the city in a minibus while disguised as football supporters, rendezvous with the coach in the Alps. On the looping mountain roads, driver \"Big\" William loses control of the coach. The back of the bus is left teetering over a cliff and the gold slides towards the rear doors. As Croker attempts to reach the gold, it slips further. The film finishes on a literal [[cliffhanger]] with Croker announcing:  \"Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Mark |title='Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea!'

The tunnel in which Beckermann abruptly meets his demise at the hands of the Mafia was shot at [[La Thuile, Aosta Valley|La Thuile]] on road SS26, Italy.\n\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Torino, 1961) - BEIC 6337366.jpg|thumb|The roof of the [[Torino Palavela|Palavela]] in Turin ''(pictured in 1961)'' where the three Minis are pursed by a police car before they go back down it and escape ]] \nThe interior of the prison that held Bridger was [[Kilmainham Gaol]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland \u2014 No\u00ebl Coward was a tax exile and couldn't film in Britain.

The property was later seen in films such as ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (1973), ''[[A Touch of Class (film)|A Touch of Class]]'' (1973), and ''[[Sweeney!]]'' (1977). \n\nThe training sessions shown for the Mini drivers were at the [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]] race track in [[Upper Norwood]], South London. The attempt to blow the doors off the bullion van, which led to its destruction and Croker's famous line, took place at Crystal Palace Sports Centre. The [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace transmitter]] can be seen in the background. The meeting at the misty funeral was filmed in [[Cruagh]] Cemetery, in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains. The [[office block]] that doubled as the Turin traffic control centre was Apex House, the [[Hanworth]], [[Middlesex]] head office of the television rental chain [[Radio Rentals|DER]].<ref name = \"makingof\" />\n\n[[File:1960 Morris Mini - The Italian Job - Coventry Transport Museum.jpg|thumb|right|A display of a Mini emerging from a sewer tunnel in [[Coventry Transport Museum]]]]\n\nThe chase sequences were filmed in Turin, except for the chase through the sewer tunnel, which was shot in the [[River Sowe|Sowe]] Valley Sewer Duplication system in the [[Stoke Aldermoor]] district of [[Coventry]] in the English Midlands, filmed from the back of a [[Mini Moke]].<ref name=\"makingof\" /> The person on the far side who closes the gate at the end of sewer tunnel is the director, Peter Collinson. Collinson also appeared in the scene on the highway when the ramps get jettisoned, clinging to the right-hand rear door of the coach as the Minis enter at speed.<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n\nDuring the getaway the Minis are pursued by police on the rooftop of the [[Torino Palavela|Palavela]], and later on the rooftop test track of what was then a Fiat factory in the [[Lingotto]] building in Turin. The weir the Minis cross in the car chase is just down river from the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele I at the end of [[Po (river)|Via Po]] in central Turin.\n\nA portion of the car chase was filmed as a dance between the Minis and police cars with a full orchestra playing \"[[The Blue Danube]]\" inside [[Pier Luigi Nervi]]'s Palazzo Esposizioni usually used for the Turin Motor Show (now the hospital library).<ref name = \"makingof\" /> It was cut from the final version and appears as an extra on the [[DVD]].\n\nThe final escape from Turin was filmed on the road to [[Ceresole Reale]] via [[Lago Agnel]] and [[Nivolet Pass]] (the highway does not lead to France or Switzerland because it is a dead end). The bus was left hanging off this corner<ref>https://goo.gl/maps/sNCidc999BQ2</ref> in the climactic ending.\n\n==Vehicles==\n[[File:The Italian Job - geograph.org.uk - 953936.jpg|thumb|right|Minis on display at Bardney Heritage Centre]]\nRoger Beckermann's orange [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the opening scene is actually two cars. The first was a Miura P400 that was sold as new afterwards. In 2015 it was unearthed and authenticated by Iain Tyrrell, one of the world's foremost classic car experts and Lamborghini aficionado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaintyrrell.co.uk/media | title = iaintyrrell.co.uk/media | accessdate = 8 Jan 2018}}</ref> The second car, tumbled down the chasm by the Mafia bulldozer, was another Miura that had previously been in a serious accident and was not roadworthy. Lamborghini confirmed in May 2019 that the Italian Job Miura had been confirmed as chassis number 3586.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/classic-cars/italian-jobs-lost-lamborghini-miura-found/|title=The Italian Job's lost Lamborghini Miura has been found|date=2019-05-08|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the director's commentary on the DVD, despite the publicity the film would give to the Mini, the car's maker, [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]], only provided a token fleet of Minis and the production company had to buy the rest at trade price. [[Fiat]] offered the production as many super-charged Fiat cars as they needed, several sports cars for the Mafia confrontation scene, plus $40,000, but the producers turned down the offer because it would have meant replacing the Minis with Fiats.\n\nThe Minis seen on screen carry registration numbers HMP 729G (Red), GPF 146G (White) and LGW 809G (Blue). As at July 2012, a [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|DVLA]] query indicates that two of these plates may still be registered; these, however, are not the cars used in the film as the film cars had \"future dated\" plates to make them current with the release date of the film, and as such would not be road legal. There were also numerous detail differences between the Minis used during filming and the launch of the \"G\" year suffix. According to the \"making of\" DVD extra, the Minis used in the chase scenes were all destroyed in accidents while filming the sewer sequence.\n\nAs Croker walks through the garage where the Minis are being prepared, viewers hear that \"Rozzer's having trouble with his differential\", and the back of the red Mini Cooper is jacked up where Rozzer is working. This is an inside joke since the Mini has front-wheel drive and does not have a rear differential. In the early 1960s, front-wheel-drive cars were new and asking a car mechanic to repair a Mini's rear differential was a popular [[snipe hunt]].\n\nGold cost $38.69 per [[troy ounce]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kitco.com/charts/historicalgold.html | title = Hisotical Gold Charts and Data | publisher=Kitco | accessdate = 29 May 2006 }}</ref> so four million dollars in gold bars would have weighed about 3200&nbsp;kg (7000&nbsp;lb), requiring each of the three Minis to carry about 1070&nbsp;kg (2300&nbsp;lb) in addition to the driver and passenger. Since a 1968 Mini only weighs 630&nbsp;kg (1400&nbsp;lb),<ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Chris|title=Complete Classic Mini 1959\u20132000|isbn=9781899870608|year=2003|publisher=Motor Racing Publications|location=Croydon}}</ref> each of these vehicles would have had to carry 1\u00bd times its own weight in gold.\n\nThe coach at the end of the film was a 1964 [[Bedford VAL]] with [[Harrington Legionnaire]] Body, distinctive for its twin front steering axles. After its use in the film, the coach returned to commercial service. It was scrapped about 1990 after being in service with several operators, mainly in the Scotland area. The coach had to be reinforced behind the driver's seat so that when the Coopers came into the back they didn't crush the driver. Even though plating had been secured, the driver's seat was still pushed forward several inches, enough for the driver to be touching the steering wheel with his stomach.\n\nWhen the Legionnaire was on its way to Turin, it has London-Turin on the destination display above the windscreen; on the way back it had been changed to Turin-London. It also proudly displayed 'Charlie Croker's Coach Tours' logos on the rear and both flanks. Following the filming, the coach had its improvised rear doors welded and was used on a Scottish school bus route until the mid-1980s when, according to the Legionnaire register, it was scrapped. However, a replica can be found on the roadside at New Invention, Willenhall, West Midlands.\n\nCharlie Croker picks up his [[Aston Martin DB4]] convertible from a garage after release from prison. The scene was mostly improvised, which caused visible lighting irregularities since the crew did not know where the actors would be. The location of the underground carpark and lift is now part of Park Lane BMW, London.\n\nThe original DB4 belongs today to a private English collection. According to several sources, the \"Aston\" pushed off the cliff was a [[Vignale]] [[Lancia Flaminia]] mocked up as an Aston. The two [[Jaguar E-Type|E-type Jaguars]] that suffered from the Mafia's revenge were restored to original condition, the red one of which, 848 CRY, is owned by Phillip Porter, the founder of the Jaguar E-type club.\n\nThe black [[Fiat Dino]] coup\u00e9 of Mafia boss Altabani was bought by Peter Collinson but became so rusty that only its doors remain. The [[Italy|Italian]] police cars seen around [[Turin]] were [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]s. The Italian police armoured car which escorts the gold convoy is a conversion of a former Second World War American [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car. The original 37mm gun was removed and replaced with a water cannon.\n\nA [[Land Rover Series]] IIa Station Wagon, registration BKO 686C, was used to get to the convoy before attacking and was modified with window bars and a [[towbar]]. A [[Ford Thames 400E]] van was used for the football fans' decorated van; this was referred to as the [[Dormobile]], the name of a common [[camper-van]] conversion [[coachbuilder]]. The cross-Channel ferry featured in one scene is the [[MS Free Enterprise I|MS ''Free Enterprise I'']]. The ship spent many years as a day cruise ship in Greek waters before being scrapped in 2013. The \"Chinese\" plane delivering the gold to Turin is a rare [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]], of which only 14 were built and only four passed into private ownership. It had been abandoned in Milan by its owners and was moved to Turin for filming. It was destroyed by fire in 1970.<ref name=\"serial\">{{cite web|url=http://cgibin.rcn.com/jeremy.k/cgi-bin/gzUsafSearch.pl?target=&content=Globemaster |title=USAF Serial Number Search Results|accessdate=26 November 2010|work=Aircraft Serial Number Search|first=Jeremy|last=Kuris|date=25 March 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|The Italian Job (soundtrack)}}\n{{Listen|filename=Matt Monro - On Days Like These excerpt.ogg|title=Matt Monro \u2013 On Days Like These excerpt|description=An excerpt from Matt Monro's ''On Days Like These''}}\nThe music for the soundtrack was written by [[Quincy Jones]].

The closing theme, \"Get a Bloomin' Move On\" (AKA \"The Self Preservation Society\"), was performed by the cast and had lyrics featuring [[Rhyming slang|Cockney Rhyming Slang]]. Many incidental themes are based on British patriotic songs, such as \"[[Rule, Britannia!]]\", \"[[The British Grenadiers]]\" and \"[[God Save the Queen]]\".\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened at the Plaza Cinema in London on 5 June 1969.<ref name=\"Art & Hue\"/>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:The Italian Job.jpg|thumb|180px|Poster for the American release of the film.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds an approval rating of 83% and an average rating of 7.4/10, based on 27 reviews.

He complimented the film's technological sophistication, only criticising what he saw as an 'emotionally retarded' plot. Canby also expressed concern that Coward's appearance in the film, although intended to be kind, 'exploits him in vaguely unpleasant ways' by surrounding his character with images of the royal family, which had not knighted him at the time. A contemporary review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine felt that the film spent too much time focusing on the film's caper as opposed to building the characters; it also criticised the car chases as 'dull and deafening'.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901493,00.html | title = Cinema: Britannia Waives the Rules | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 16 October 2011 | date=19 September 1969}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was the 14th most popular at the UK box office in 1969.<ref>{{cite news|title=The World's Top Twenty Films |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=27 September 1970 |via=The Sunday Times Digital Archive }}</ref> Although it received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Best English-Language Foreign Film\", the film was not a success in the US. The film remains popular, however. James Travers of Films de France believes that the film's enduring appeal rests in the 'improbable union' of Michael Caine, No\u00ebl Coward and [[Benny Hill]], whom he considers \"three of the best known [British] performers... in the late 1960s\". He states that the film has a [[cult following|cult status]] and stands as a 'classic of its genre'.<ref name=\"france\"/>\n\nA [[novelisation]] of the film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin and Ken Wlaschin, was published by [[Sphere Books]] in 1969. The book contains numerous differences to the film: for example there is a rival group of German gangsters called the Hamburg Syndicate who try to obtain Beckerman's plans for the robbery, Croker and the three minis travel to Italy by yacht, and Professor Peach is rescued by the gang after he is arrested. The ending of the novel is also significantly different. The bus successfully crosses the border into Switzerland and two days later the gang and the gold arrive on a beach near Dover in a landing craft where they are met by Mr. Bridger and Luigi Altabani. Mr. Bridger tells Charlie Croker that they have come to an agreement to \"divide Europe\" and that the gold must be given back to the Italians.\n\nSince 2000, there have been two remakes of the film. The first was released in 2003 and also called ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'', set in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Charlie Croker. It features [[Donald Sutherland]] as John Bridger, played as more of a father figure to Croker. It employs the updated [[Mini (BMW)|Mini Cooper]] for a chase towards the end. An official [[Bollywood]] remake of the 2003 film, called ''[[Players (2012 film)|Players]]'', was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=India to Remake 'The Italian Job'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-remake-italian-job-48404|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=11 July 2018|first=Nyay|last=Bhushan|date=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere is a [[The Italian Job (2001 video game)|video game]] based on the 1969 film, released for the [[PlayStation]] [[Video game console|game console]] in 2001 and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002 and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. The film was also the subject of a play, ''Bill Shakespeare's \"The Italian Job\"'', written by Malachi Bogdanov, who used lines from Shakespeare plays to tell the story. It was performed in 2003 at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/fringe/fringe03-20.htm|title=Fringe 2003 Reviews (20)|work=[[The British Theatre Guide]]|first=Peter|last=Lathan|date=2003|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nMichael Caine's performance and 'bloody doors' line has been parodied in several British comedies, and in a music video for [[Pick a Part That's New]] by [[Stereophonics]].

The party controlled [[Lagos State|Lagos]]. It was regarded as a natural successor to the progressive politics more closely associated with the [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] and [[Unity Party of Nigeria]] (UPN) led by Chief [[Obafemi Awolowo]] in the First and Second Republics respectively. However, criticism of the party's more pragmatic and less ideological political outlook associated with AG and UPN, has made many argue it was less of a worthy political heir. The Party had strong presence in the South West (5 Governors, 15 Senators and 6 State Houses), Mid-West (1 Governor) and North Central Regions (3 Senators). Lagos, [[Edo State|Edo]], [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]], [[Kogi]], [[Ondo State|Ondo]], [[Bauchi]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], [[Niger State|Niger]], [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]], [[Oyo State|Oyo]] and [[Osun State|Osun]] states by far accounts for majority of the party's presence and  discernible power base.\n\nIn February 2013 the party merged with the [[Congress for Progressive Change]], the [[All Nigeria Peoples Party]], and the [[All Progressives Grand Alliance]] to form the [[All Progressives Congress]].<ref name=\"Agree to Merge\">{{cite news|last=Maram|first=Mazen|title=Nigerian Biggest Opposition Parties Agree to Merge|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-07/nigerian-biggest-opposition-parties-merging-against-ruling-party.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==2006==\nThe party was formed in 2006 in order to form a larger political opposition to the federally dominant centrist [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] and the Northern-based [[All Nigeria Peoples Party]]. On May 12, 2006, the provisional officers of the party (most of whom carried their seats from the Alliance for Democracy) were replaced at the Kaduna convention by ballot; [[Adebisi Akande|Bisi Akande]] succeeded Hassan M. Zurmi as National Chairman, and [[Bashir Dalhatu]] replaced Bumi Omoseyindemi as National Secretary.\n\n==2007==\nThe party ran [[Vice President of Nigeria|Vice President]] [[Atiku Abubakar]], who defected from the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], as its presidential candidate in the [[Nigerian general election, 2007|2007 presidential election]]. Abubakar was disqualified from the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission, but the disqualification was later overturned by the Supreme Court.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1863A9D2-FBA2-467A-B2A2-A5DD59DA015B.htm \"Nigerian VP 'able to stand in poll'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421044611/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1863A9D2-FBA2-467A-B2A2-A5DD59DA015B.htm |date=2007-04-21 }}, Al Jazeera, April 16, 2007.</ref> Currently, the party's  most prominent elected official was former member, Governor [[Babatunde Fashola]] of [[Lagos State]]. Also very prominent in the party was the political brain behind the party, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, the former Governor of Lagos State and erstwhile Senator in the Third Republica. Tinubu is noted for his astute Pro-Democracy credentials and progressive Federalist Principles that saw him clash severally with former President Olusegun Obasanjo of the more conservative unitarian school of thought.\n\nIn the 21 April 2007 [[Nigerian National Assembly]] [[Nigerian general election, 2007|election]], the party won 32 out of 360 seats in the [[Nigerian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 6 out of 109 seats in the [[Nigerian Senate|Senate]].\n\nFollowing the victory of PDP candidate [[Umaru Yar'Adua]] in the 2007 presidential election, the AC has been pursuing a legal challenge to the results. On July 6, 2007, the party announced its rejection of an offer to join Yar'Adua's government (an offer that was accepted by the ANPP and the [[Progressive Peoples Alliance]]), with a spokesman saying that \"there is no compelling moral, legal or political reason for us to join a government that we have told the whole world stole its mandate\" and that participating in the government would mean \"partaking in stolen goods\".<ref>[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=nw20070706171713331C490969 \"Opposition party says no to Umaru Yar'Adua\"], Reuters (''IOL''), July 6, 2007.</ref>\n\nHowever, on August 7, 2007, the National Secretary, Bashir Dalhatu, resigned (along with two other officials) over the refusal of the Action Congress to take up Yar'adua's offer. He was replaced by the current Secretary, Usman Bugaje.\n\n==2008\u20132009==\nMost of the Party's success came in 2008 via judicial challenges to the widely maligned [[Nigerian general election, 2003|2003 General Elections]], that was judged to be rigged by international observers and even the ruling party in favor of the PDP. In 2008, the Party's candidate in Edo State, former Labor leader Comrade [[Adams Oshiomhole]] won a decisive victory and took the mantle of power in that state. In Ekiti state, the Party's candidate- Dr. Fayemi, also emerged victorious over the PDP Candidate Engr. Oni in court, and secured a cancellation of results of 63 wards, with the Appeals Court ordering rerun. Heading into this rerun, AC had an over 12 000 votes advantage. The current Acting Speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly (legislature) was an AC member.\n\nAC Governorship candidates still have cases pending in Osun, Oyo and Ogun states where analysts have given them better than even chance to secure a rerun or emerge outright victors. The Ekiti State Guber Rerun election also saw some form of alliance between the Labour Party Governor in Ondo State, Dr. Mimiko and the Action Congress under the perceived leadership of [[Bola Tinubu|Asiwaju Bola Tinubu]].\n\n==2010==\n\nThe Action Congress changed their name to the Action Congress of Nigeria. The March 2010 rerun of the Ekiti Guber polls resulted in PDP Candidate and Ex-Governor, Engineer Oni being returned as winner despite widespread allegations of voter intimidation, rigging and pressures on [[Independent National Electoral Commission|INEC]] officials to release the falsified result to favor the ruling party (PDP).

The party controlled [[Lagos State|Lagos]]. It was regarded as a natural successor to the progressive politics more closely associated with the [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] and [[Unity Party of Nigeria]] (UPN) led by Chief [[Obafemi Awolowo]] in the First and Second Republics respectively. However, criticism of the party's more pragmatic and less ideological political outlook associated with AG and UPN, has made many argue it was less of a worthy political heir. The Party had strong presence in the South West (5 Governors, 15 Senators and 6 State Houses), Mid-West (1 Governor) and North Central Regions (3 Senators). Lagos, [[Edo State|Edo]], [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]], [[Kogi]], [[Ondo State|Ondo]], [[Bauchi]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], [[Niger State|Niger]], [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]], [[Oyo State|Oyo]] and [[Osun State|Osun]] states by far accounts for majority of the party's presence and  discernible power base.\n\nIn February 2013 the party merged with the [[Congress for Progressive Change]], the [[All Nigeria Peoples Party]], and the [[All Progressives Grand Alliance]] to form the [[All Progressives Congress]].<ref name=\"Agree to Merge\">{{cite news|last=Maram|first=Mazen|title=Nigerian Biggest Opposition Parties Agree to Merge|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-07/nigerian-biggest-opposition-parties-merging-against-ruling-party.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==2006==\nThe party was formed in 2006 in order to form a larger political opposition to the federally dominant centrist [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] and the Northern-based [[All Nigeria Peoples Party]]. On May 12, 2006, the provisional officers of the party (most of whom carried their seats from the Alliance for Democracy) were replaced at the Kaduna convention by ballot; [[Adebisi Akande|Bisi Akande]] succeeded Hassan M. Zurmi as National Chairman, and Bashir Dalhatu replaced Bumi Omoseyindemi as National Secretary.\n\n==2007==\nThe party ran [[Vice President of Nigeria|Vice President]] [[Atiku Abubakar]], who defected from the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], as its presidential candidate in the [[Nigerian general election, 2007|2007 presidential election]]. Abubakar was disqualified from the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission, but the disqualification was later overturned by the Supreme Court.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1863A9D2-FBA2-467A-B2A2-A5DD59DA015B.htm \"Nigerian VP 'able to stand in poll'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421044611/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1863A9D2-FBA2-467A-B2A2-A5DD59DA015B.htm |date=2007-04-21 }}, Al Jazeera, April 16, 2007.</ref> Currently, the party's  most prominent elected official was former member, Governor [[Babatunde Fashola]] of [[Lagos State]]. Also very prominent in the party was the political brain behind the party, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, the former Governor of Lagos State and erstwhile Senator in the Third Republica. Tinubu is noted for his astute Pro-Democracy credentials and progressive Federalist Principles that saw him clash severally with former President Olusegun Obasanjo of the more conservative unitarian school of thought.\n\nIn the 21 April 2007 [[Nigerian National Assembly]] [[Nigerian general election, 2007|election]], the party won 32 out of 360 seats in the [[Nigerian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and 6 out of 109 seats in the [[Nigerian Senate|Senate]].\n\nFollowing the victory of PDP candidate [[Umaru Yar'Adua]] in the 2007 presidential election, the AC has been pursuing a legal challenge to the results. On July 6, 2007, the party announced its rejection of an offer to join Yar'Adua's government (an offer that was accepted by the ANPP and the [[Progressive Peoples Alliance]]), with a spokesman saying that \"there is no compelling moral, legal or political reason for us to join a government that we have told the whole world stole its mandate\" and that participating in the government would mean \"partaking in stolen goods\".<ref>[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=nw20070706171713331C490969 \"Opposition party says no to Umaru Yar'Adua\"], Reuters (''IOL''), July 6, 2007.</ref>\n\nHowever, on August 7, 2007, the National Secretary, Bashir Dalhatu, resigned (along with two other officials) over the refusal of the Action Congress to take up Yar'adua's offer. He was replaced by the current Secretary, Usman Bugaje.\n\n==2008\u20132009==\nMost of the Party's success came in 2008 via judicial challenges to the widely maligned [[Nigerian general election, 2003|2003 General Elections]], that was judged to be rigged by international observers and even the ruling party in favor of the PDP. In 2008, the Party's candidate in Edo State, former Labor leader Comrade [[Adams Oshiomhole]] won a decisive victory and took the mantle of power in that state. In Ekiti state, the Party's candidate- Dr. Fayemi, also emerged victorious over the PDP Candidate Engr. Oni in court, and secured a cancellation of results of 63 wards, with the Appeals Court ordering rerun. Heading into this rerun, AC had an over 12 000 votes advantage. The current Acting Speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly (legislature) was an AC member.\n\nAC Governorship candidates still have cases pending in Osun, Oyo and Ogun states where analysts have given them better than even chance to secure a rerun or emerge outright victors. The Ekiti State Guber Rerun election also saw some form of alliance between the Labour Party Governor in Ondo State, Dr. Mimiko and the Action Congress under the perceived leadership of [[Bola Tinubu|Asiwaju Bola Tinubu]].\n\n==2010==\n\nThe Action Congress changed their name to the Action Congress of Nigeria. The March 2010 rerun of the Ekiti Guber polls resulted in PDP Candidate and Ex-Governor, Engineer Oni being returned as winner despite widespread allegations of voter intimidation, rigging and pressures on [[Independent National Electoral Commission|INEC]] officials to release the falsified result to favor the ruling party (PDP). AC Candidate proceeded to challenge these results at the Elections Tribunal, where he lost 3-2. Pinning his appeal on the minority judgement, he sought to be installed as Governor based on the cancellation of results from two local governments where PDP allegedly perpetrated fraud and violence.

For example, the average age could be used to determine the type of population in a particular region. A population with an average age of 15 would have a young population compared to a population that has an average age of 55, which would be considered an older population. It is also important to consider these measures because the collected data is not completely accurate. The mid-year population is often used in calculations to account for the number of births and deaths that occur.\n\nA population pyramid gives a clear picture of how a country transitions from high fertility to low [[fertility rate]]. The broad base of the pyramid means a relative majority of the population lies between ages 0\u201314, which tells us that the fertility rate of the country is high and above population [[sub-replacement fertility]] level. The older population is declining over time due to a shorter [[life expectancy]] of sixty years.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2013/population-pyramids.aspx|title=From Population Pyramids to Pillars|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> However, there are still more females than males in these ranges since women have a longer life expectancy. As reported by the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,'' women tend to live longer than men because women do not partake in risky behaviors. Also, Weeks' ''Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,'' considered that the sex ratio gap for the older ages will shrink due to women's health declining due to the effects of smoking, as suggested by the United Nations and U.S. Census Bureau. Moreover, it can also reveal the age-dependency ratio of a population. Populations with a big base, young population, or a big top, an older population, shows that there is a higher dependency ratio. The [[dependency ratio]] refers to how many people are dependent on the working class (ages 15\u201364). According to Weeks' ''Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,'' population pyramids can be used to predict the future, known as a population forecast. [[Population momentum]], when a population's birth rates continue to increase even after replacement level has been reached, can even be predicted if a population has a low mortality rate since the population will continue to grow. This then brings up the term [[doubling time]], which is used to predict when the population will double in size. Lastly, a population pyramid can even give insight on the economic status of a country from the [[age stratification]]  since the distribution of supplies are not evenly distributed through a population.\n\nIn the [[demographic transition]] model, the size and shape of population pyramids vary. In stage one of the demographic transition model, the pyramids have the most defined shape. They have the ideal big base and skinny top. In stage two, the pyramid looks similar, but starts to widen in the middle age groups. In stage three, the pyramids start to round out and look similar in shape to a tombstone.  In stage four, there is a decrease in the younger age groups. This causes the base of the widened pyramid to narrow. Lastly, in stage five, the pyramid starts to take on the shape of a kite as the base continues to decrease. The shape of the population is dependent upon what the economy is like in the country. More developed countries can be found in stages three four and five while the least developed countries have a population represented by the pyramids in stages one and two.\n\n==Types==\nEach country will have different or unique population pyramids. However, population pyramids will be defined as the following: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. These types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rates of a country.<ref name=osu>[http://www.fsl.orst.edu/pnwerc/wrb/Atlas_web_compressed/5.Human_Populations/5h.pyramids_web.pdf Population Pyramids] - Oregon State University</ref>\n\n;\"Stationary\" pyramid\n:A pyramid can be described as stationary if the percentages of population (age and sex) remains constant over time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Population An Introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2011|isbn=978-1305094505|location=|pages=309}}</ref> Stationary population is when a population contains equal birth rates and death rates.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;\"Expansive\" pyramid\n:A population pyramid that is very wide at the younger ages, characteristic of countries with high birth rate and low life expectancy.<ref name=osu/> The population is said to be fast-growing, and the size of each birth cohort gets larger than the size of the previous year.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Korenjak-C\u02c7 erne, Kej\u017ear, Batagelj|year=2008|title=Clustering of Population Pyramids|url=|journal=Informatica|volume=32|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n;\"Constrictive\" pyramid\n:A population pyramid that is narrowed at the bottom.

The increase in the popularity of those styles is a result of the dramatic changes occurring within the Chinese society.\n\nIn 1900\u201301, the [[Righteous Harmony Society|Righteous and Harmonious Fists]] rose against foreign occupiers and Christian missionaries in China. This uprising is known in the West as the [[Boxer Rebellion]] due to the martial arts and calisthenics practiced by the rebels. [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] gained control of the rebellion and tried to use it against the foreign powers. The failure of the rebellion led ten years later to the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the creation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Chinese Republic]].\n\nThe present view of Chinese martial arts is strongly influenced by the events of the [[History of the Republic of China|Republican Period]] (1912\u20131949). In the transition period between the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] as well as the turmoil of the Japanese invasion and the Chinese Civil War, Chinese martial arts became more accessible to the general public as many martial artists were encouraged to openly teach their art. At that time, some considered martial arts as a means to promote national pride and build a strong nation.

There are styles that mimic movements from animals and others that gather inspiration from various [[Chinese philosophies]], myths and legends. Some styles put most of their focus into the harnessing of [[qi]], while others concentrate on competition.\n\nChinese martial arts can be split into various categories to differentiate them: For example, ''external'' ({{lang|zh|\u5916\u5bb6\u62f3}}) and ''[[Internal martial arts|internal]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u5185\u5bb6\u62f3}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Tianji|first=Li|author2=Du Xilian|title=A Guide to Chinese Martial Arts|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=7-119-01393-9}}</ref> Chinese martial arts can also be categorized by location, as in ''northern'' ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u62f3}}) and ''southern'' ({{lang|zh|\u5357\u62f3}}) as well, referring to what part of China the styles originated from, separated by the [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang); Chinese martial arts may even be classified according to their province or city.<ref name=\"Kennedy\" /> The main perceived difference between northern and southern styles is that the northern styles tend to emphasize fast and powerful kicks, high jumps and generally fluid and rapid movement, while the southern styles focus more on strong arm and hand techniques, and stable, immovable stances and fast footwork. Examples of the northern styles include [[changquan]] and [[xingyiquan]]. Examples of the southern styles include [[Bak Mei]], [[Wuzuquan]], [[Cai li fo|Choy Li Fut]], and [[Wing Chun]]. Chinese martial arts can also be divided according to religion, imitative-styles ({{lang|zh|\u8c61\u5f62\u62f3}}), and family styles such as [[Hung Gar]] ({{lang|zh|\u6d2a\u5bb6}}). There are distinctive differences in the training between different groups of the Chinese martial arts regardless of the type of classification. However, few experienced martial artists make a clear distinction between internal and external styles, or subscribe to the idea of northern systems being predominantly kick-based and southern systems relying more heavily on upper-body techniques. Most styles contain both hard and soft elements, regardless of their internal nomenclature. Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles, philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner's skills unbalanced or deficient, as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole.

Today, many styles begin to teach new students by focusing on exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, in order to allow its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. 'Sparring' refers to the most important aspect of application training, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.\n\nCompetitive sparring disciplines include Chinese [[kickboxing]] [[Sanshou|S\u01censh\u01d2u]] ({{lang|zh|\u6563\u624b}}) and Chinese [[folk wrestling]] [[Shuai jiao|Shu\u0101iji\u0101o]] ({{lang|zh|\u6454\u8de4}}), which were traditionally contested on a raised platform arena [[Lei tai|L\u00e8it\u00e1i]] ({{lang|zh|\u64c2\u53f0}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hui|first=Mizhou|date=July 1996|title=San Shou Kung Fu Of The Chinese Red Army: Practical Skills And Theory Of Unarmed Combat|publisher=Paladin Press|isbn=0-87364-884-6}}</ref> L\u00e8it\u00e1i represents public challenge matches that first appeared in the [[Song Dynasty]].

Forms were originally intended to preserve the lineage of a particular style branch, and were often taught to advanced students selected for that purpose. Forms contained both literal, representative and exercise-oriented forms of applicable techniques that students could extract, test, and train in through [[sparring]] sessions.<ref name=\"Bolelli\">{{cite book|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele|date=2003-02-20|title=On the Warrior's Path: Philosophy, Fighting, and Martial Arts Mythology|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=1-58394-066-9}}</ref>\n\nToday, many consider ''taolu'' to be one of the most important practices in Chinese martial arts. Traditionally, they played a smaller role in training for combat application and took a back seat to sparring, drilling, and conditioning. Forms gradually build up a practitioner's flexibility, internal and external strength, speed and stamina, and they teach balance and coordination. Many styles contain forms that use weapons of various lengths and types, using one or two hands. Some styles focus on a certain type of weapon. Forms are meant to be both practical, usable, and applicable as well as to promote fluid motion, meditation, flexibility, balance, and coordination. Teachers are often heard to say \"train your form as if you were sparring and spar as if it were a form.\"\n\nThere are two general types of ''taolu'' in Chinese martial arts. Most common are ''solo forms'' performed by a single student. There are also ''sparring'' forms \u2014 choreographed fighting sets performed by two or more people. Sparring forms were designed both to acquaint beginning fighters with basic measures and concepts of combat and to serve as performance pieces for the school. Weapons-based sparring forms are especially useful for teaching students the extension, range, and technique required to manage a weapon.\n\n====Forms in Traditional Chinese Martial Arts====\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe term ''taolu (\u5957\u8def)'' is a shortened version of ''Tao Lu Yun Dong (\u5957\u8def\u904b\u52d5)'', an expression introduced only recently with the popularity of modern wushu. This expression refers to \"exercise sets\" and used in the context of athletics or sport.\n\nIn contrast, in traditional Chinese martial arts alternative terminologies for the training (\u7df4) of 'sets or forms ''are:''\n\n* lian quan tao (\u7df4\u62f3\u5957) \u2013 practicing a sequence of fists.\n* lian quan jiao (\u7df4\u62f3\u8173) \u2013 practicing fists and feet.\n* lian bing qi (\u7df4\u5175\u5668) \u2013 practicing weapons.\n* dui da (\u5c0d\u6253) and dui lian (\u5c0d\u7df4) \u2013 fighting sets.\n\nTraditional \"sparring\" sets, called ''dui da'' (\u5c0d\u6253) or ''dui lian'' (\u5c0d\u7df4), were an essential part of Chinese martial arts for centuries. ''Dui lian'' means, to train by a pair of combatants opposing each other\u2014the character ''lian'' (\u7df4), referes to practice; to train; to perfect one's skill; to drill. As well, often one of these terms are also included in the name of fighting sets (\u96d9\u6f14; ''shuang yan''), \"paired practice\" (\u6399\u52dd; ''zheng sheng''), \"to struggle with strength for victory\" (\u6575; ''di''), match \u2013 the character suggests to strike an enemy; and \"to break\" (\u7834; ''po'').\n\nGenerally, there are 21, 18, 12, 9 or 5 drills or 'exchanges/groupings' of attacks and counterattacks, in each ''dui lian'' set. These drills were considered only generic patterns and never meant to be considered inflexible 'tricks'. Students practiced smaller parts/exchanges, individually with opponents switching sides in a continuous flow. Dui ''lian'' were not only sophisticated and effective methods of passing on the fighting knowledge of the older generation, but they were also essential and effective training methods. The relationship between single sets and contact sets is complicated, in that some skills cannot be developed with solo 'sets', and, conversely, with ''dui lian''. Unfortunately, it appears that most traditional combat oriented ''dui lian'' and their training methodology have disappeared, especially those concerning weapons. There are several reasons for this. In modern Chinese martial arts, most of the ''dui lian'' are recent inventions designed for light props resembling weapons, with safety and drama in mind. The role of this kind of training has degenerated to the point of being useless in a practical sense, and, at best, is just performance.\n\nBy the early Song period, sets were not so much \"individual isolated technique strung together\" but rather were composed of techniques and counter technique groupings. It is quite clear that \"sets\" and \"fighting (two-person) sets\" have been instrumental in TCM for many hundreds of years\u2014even before the Song Dynasty. There are images of two-person weapon training in Chinese stone painting going back at least to the Eastern Han Dynasty.\n\nAccording to what has been passed on by the older generations, the approximate ratio of contact sets to single sets was approximately 1:3. In other words, about 30% of the 'sets' practiced at Shaolin were contact sets, ''dui lian'', and two-person drill training. This ratio is, in part, evidenced by the Qing Dynasty mural at Shaolin.\n\nFor most of its history, Shaolin martial arts was mostly weapon-focused: staves were used to defend the monastery, not bare hands. Even the more recent military exploits of Shaolin during the Ming and Qing Dynasties involved weapons. According to some traditions, monks first studied basics for one year and were then taught staff fighting so that they could protect the monastery. Although wrestling has been as sport in China for centuries, weapons have been an essential part of Chinese wushu since ancient times. If one wants to talk about recent or 'modern' developments in Chinese martial arts (including Shaolin for that matter), it is the over-emphasis on bare hand fighting. During the Northern Song Dynasty (976- 997 A.D) when platform fighting is known as ''Da Laitai'' (Title Fights Challenge on Platform) first appeared, these fights were with only swords and staves. Although later, when bare hand fights appeared as well, it was the weapons events that became the most famous. These open-ring competitions had regulations and organized by government organizations; the public also organized some. The government competitions, held in the capital and prefectures, resulted in appointments for winners, to military posts.\n\n====Practice forms vs. kung fu in combat====\nEven though forms in Chinese martial arts are intended to depict realistic martial techniques, the movements are not always identical to how techniques would be applied in combat. Many forms have been elaborated upon, on the one hand, to provide better combat preparedness, and on the other hand to look more aesthetically pleasing. One manifestation of this tendency toward elaboration beyond combat application is the use of lower stances and higher, stretching kicks. These two maneuvers are unrealistic in combat and are used in forms for exercise purposes.<ref>{{cite book|last= Kane|first=Lawrence A. |year=2005|title=The Way of Kata |publisher=YMAA Publication Center |pages=56|isbn= 1-59439-058-4}}</ref> Many modern schools have replaced practical defense or offense movements with acrobatic feats that are more spectacular to watch, thereby gaining favor during exhibitions and competitions.{{refn|Pages 118\u2013119<ref name=\"Bolelli\" />|group=\"note\"}} This has led to criticisms by traditionalists of the endorsement of the more acrobatic, show-oriented Wushu competition.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Johnson |author2=Sue Feng  |title=Inner Peace?

Documentation in ancient literature during the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) and the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279) suggests some sets, (including two + person sets: ''dui da'' also called ''dui lian'') became very elaborate and 'flowery', many mainly concerned with aesthetics. During this time, some martial arts systems devolved to the point that they became popular forms of martial art storytelling entertainment shows. This created an entire category of martial arts known as ''Hua Fa Wuyi''. During the Northern Song period, it was noted by historians this type of training had a negative influence on training in the military.\n\nMany traditional Chinese martial artists, as well as practitioners of modern sport combat, have become critical of the perception that forms work is more relevant to the art than sparring and drill application, while most continue to see traditional forms practice within the traditional context\u2014as vital to both proper combat execution, the Shaolin aesthetic as an art form, as well as upholding the meditative function of the physical art form.<ref>{{cite news |first=Geoffrey |last=Fowler |author2=Juliet Ye |title=Kung Fu Monks Don't Get a Kick Out of Fighting |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119758024054227513?mod=Sports |publisher= Wall Street Journal |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nAnother reason why techniques often appear different in forms when contrasted with sparring application is thought by some to come from the concealment of the actual functions of the techniques from outsiders.<ref>{{cite book|last= Seabrook|first=Jamie A. |year=2003 |title=Martial Arts Revealed |publisher=iUniverse | pages=20 |isbn= 0-595-28247-4}}</ref>{{sps|date=February 2020}}\n\nForms practice is mostly known for teaching combat techniques yet when  practicing forms, the practitioner focuses on posture, breathing, and performing the techniques of both right and left sides of the body also develop both hemispheres of the brain and contributes to improved motor skills, forms practice also trains the muscles to execute many complex techniques of the art (muscle memory) and can improve balance, flexibility, and the cardiovascular system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904100024/http://www.chinastrategies.com/hiddenforms.htm|title=Three hidden meanings of Chinese forms|last=Verstappe|first=Stefan|date=2014-09-04|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Wushu==\n[[File:Gun2 10 all china games.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Modern forms are used in the sport of [[wushu (sport)|wushu]], as seen in this staff routine]]\n{{see also|Wushu (sport)}}\nThe word ''wu'' ({{lang|zh|\u6b66}}; ''{{transl|zh|w\u01d4}}'') means \u2018martial\u2019.

This implies that \u201cwu\u2019 \u6b66,\u201d is a defensive use of combat.{{Dubious|reason=spelling does not reliably indicate meaning|date=April 2017}} The term \u201cwushu \u6b66\u8853\u201d meaning 'martial arts' goes back as far as the [[Liang Dynasty]] (502-557) in an anthology compiled by Xiao Tong ({{lang|zh|\u856d\u901a}}), (Prince Zhaoming; {{lang|zh|\u662d\u660e\u592a\u5b50}} d. 531), called ''Selected Literature'' ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u9078}}; ''{{transl|zh|W\u00e9nxu\u01cen}}''). The term is found in the second verse of a poem by Yan Yanzhi titled: \u7687\u592a\u5b50\u91cb\u5960\u6703\u4f5c\u8a69 \"Huang Taizi Shidian Hui Zuoshi\".\n\n<blockquote>\"The great man grows the many myriad things . . .\nBreaking away from the military arts,\nHe promotes fully the cultural mandates.\"</blockquote>\n: (Translation from: ''Echoes of the Past'' by Yan Yanzhi (384\u2013456))\n\nThe term ''wushu'' is also found in a poem by Cheng Shao (1626\u20131644) from the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe earliest term for 'martial arts' can be found in the Han History (206BC-23AD) was \"military fighting techniques\" ({{lang|zh|\u5175\u6280\u5de7}}; ''{{transl|zh|b\u012bng j\u00ecqi\u01ceo}}''). During the Song period (c.960) the name changed to \"martial arts\" ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u827a}}; ''{{transl|zh|w\u01d4y\u00ec}}''). In 1928 the name was changed to \"national arts\" ({{lang|zh|\u56fd\u672f}}; ''{{transl|zh|gu\u00f3sh\u00f9}}'') when the [[Central Guoshu Institute|National Martial Arts Academy]] was established in Nanjing. The term reverted to ''w\u01d4sh\u00f9'' under the People's Republic of China during the early 1950s.\n\nAs forms have grown in complexity and quantity over the years, and many forms alone could be practiced for a lifetime, modern styles of Chinese martial arts have developed that concentrate solely on forms, and do not practice application at all.

M. | last=Schneiderman}}</ref> Bruce Lee was the iconic international superstar that popularized Chinese martial arts in the West with his own variation of Chinese martial arts called ''[[Jeet Kune Do]]''. It is a hybrid style of martial art that Bruce Lee practiced and mastered. ''Jeet Kune Do'' is his very own unique style of martial art that uses little to minimum movement but maximizes the effect to his opponents. The influence of Chinese martial art have been widely recognized and have a global appeal in Western cinemas starting off with Bruce Lee.\n\nMartial artists and actors such as [[Jet Li]] and [[Jackie Chan]] have continued the appeal of movies of this genre. Jackie Chan successfully brought in a sense of humour in his fighting style in his movies. Martial arts films from China are often referred to as \"kung fu movies\" ({{lang|zh|\u529f\u592b\u7247}}), or \"wire-fu\" if extensive wire work is performed for special effects, and are still best known as part of the tradition of kung fu theater. (see also: wuxia, [[Hong Kong action cinema]]). The talent of these individuals have broadened Hong Kong's cinematography production and rose to popularity overseas, influencing Western cinemas.\n\nIn the west, kung fu has become a regular action staple, and makes appearances in many films that would not generally be considered \"Martial Arts\" films. These films include but are not limited to [[The Matrix Trilogy]], ''[[Kill Bill]]'', and ''[[The Transporter]]''.\n\nMartial arts themes can also be found on television networks.  A [[United States|U.S.]] network [[TV western]] [[television series|series]] of the early 1970s called ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' also served to popularize the Chinese martial arts on television. With 60 episodes over a three-year span, it was one of the first North American TV shows that tried to convey the philosophy and practice in Chinese martial arts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pilato|first=Herbie J.|date=1993-05-15|title=Kung Fu Book of Caine|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|edition=1st|isbn=0-8048-1826-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Carradine|first=David|date=1993-01-15|title=Spirit of Shaolin|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=0-8048-1828-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spiritofshaolin0000carr}}</ref> The use of Chinese martial arts techniques can now be found in most TV action series, although the philosophy of Chinese martial arts is seldom portrayed in depth.\n\n=== Influence on Hip Hop ===\n\nIn the 1970s, Bruce Lee was beginning to gain popularity in Hollywood for his martial arts movies. The fact that he was a non-white male who portrayed self-reliance and righteous self-discipline resonated with black audiences and made him an important figure in this community.<ref>Phil Hoad,\n [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/18/bruce-lee-films-black-audiences \"Why Bruce Lee and kung fu films hit home with black audiences\"], ''The Guardian''</ref> Around 1973, Kung Fu movies became a hit in America across all backgrounds; however, black audiences maintained the films\u2019 popularity well after the general public lost interest. Urban youth in New York City were still going from every borough to Time Square every night to watch the latest movies.<ref>Wisdom B, [http://throwbackmag.com/site/know-your-hip-hop-history-the-b-boy/ \"Know Your Hip-Hop History: The B-Boy\"], ''Throwback Magazine''</ref>  Amongst these individuals were those coming from the Bronx where, during this time, hip-hop was beginning to take form. One of the pioneers responsible for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was [[DJ Kool Herc]], who began creating this new form of music by taking rhythmic breakdowns of songs and looping them. From the new music came a new form of dance known as b-boying or [[breakdancing]], a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences. Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and \u201cup rocking\u201d (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed kung-fu fights.<ref name=\"jetli.com\">Chris Friedman, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180227094121/https://www.jetli.com/2017/10/kung-fu-break-dancing-hip-hop \"Kung Fu Influences Aspects of Hip Hop Culture Like Break Dancing\"]</ref> The dancers\u2019 ability to improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity, skills, and musicality. In a documentary, Crazy Legs, a member of breakdancing group [[Rock Steady Crew]], described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie, \u201cwhere the one kung fu master says something along the lines of \u2018hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,\u2019 then a fight erupts.\u201d <ref name=\"jetli.com\"/>\n\nHip hop group [[Wu Tang Clan]] were prominently influenced by kung fu cinema.  The name \"Wu Tang\" itself is a reference to the 1983 film ''[[Shaolin and Wu Tang]]''.  Subsequent albums by the group (especially their debut album [[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]) are rich with references to kung fu films of the 1970s and 1980s, which group members grew up watching.  Several group members ([[Ghostface Killah]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], [[Method Man]], and [[Masta Killa]]) had also taken their stage names from kung fu cinema.  Several music videos, promotional photos, etc. feature group members posing or engaging with kung fu regalia and action sequences.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Martial arts}}\n* [[Eighteen Arms of Wushu]]\n* [[Hard and soft (martial arts)]]\n* [[Kung fu (disambiguation)]]\n* [[List of Chinese martial arts]]\n* [[Wushu (sport)]]\n* [[Kwoon]]\n* [[Weapons and armor in Chinese mythology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Kung fu schools}}\n{{China topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Martial arts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Martial Arts}}\n[[Category:Chinese martial arts| ]]\n\n[[ml:\u0d15\u0d19\u0d4d \u0d2b\u0d41]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Kung fu|other uses|Kung fu (disambiguation)}}\n\n{{Short description|Category of martial arts}}{{Infobox Chinese\n|s=\u6b66\u672f\n|t=\u6b66\u8853\n|l=\"martial technique\"\n|p=w\u01d4sh\u00f9\n|mi={{IPAc-cmn|wu|3|.|sh|u|4}}\n|j=mou5 seot6\n}}\n[[File:A monk practicing kung fu in the bamboo forest inside the Shaolin Temple.jpg|thumb|A monk practicing kung fu in the bamboo forest inside the Shaolin Temple]]\n'''Chinese martial arts''', often named under the [[umbrella term]]s '''[[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]]''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u028a|\u014b|_|\u02c8|f|u\u02d0}}; {{zh|c=[[wiktionary:\u529f\u592b|\u529f\u592b]]|p=g\u014dngfu|cy=g\u016bng f\u016b}}), '''[[kuoshu]]''' ({{zh|c=\u570b\u8853|labels=no|p=gu\u00f3sh\u00f9}}) or '''wushu''' ({{zh|c=\u6b66\u8853|labels=no|p=w\u01d4sh\u00f9}}), are [[Styles of Chinese martial arts|several hundred fighting styles]] that have developed over the centuries in [[China]].

The increase in the popularity of those styles is a result of the dramatic changes occurring within the Chinese society.\n\nIn 1900\u201301, the [[Righteous Harmony Society|Righteous and Harmonious Fists]] rose against foreign occupiers and Christian missionaries in China. This uprising is known in the West as the [[Boxer Rebellion]] due to the martial arts and calisthenics practiced by the rebels. [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] gained control of the rebellion and tried to use it against the foreign powers. The failure of the rebellion led ten years later to the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the creation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Chinese Republic]].\n\nThe present view of Chinese martial arts are strongly influenced by the events of the [[History of the Republic of China|Republican Period]] (1912\u20131949). In the transition period between the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] as well as the turmoil of the Japanese invasion and the Chinese Civil War, Chinese martial arts became more accessible to the general public as many martial artists were encouraged to openly teach their art. At that time, some considered martial arts as a means to promote national pride and build a strong nation.

Those [[sifu|masters]] started to teach within the [[overseas Chinese]] communities but eventually they expanded their teachings to include people from other ethnic groups.\n\nWithin China, the practice of traditional martial arts was discouraged during the turbulent years of the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]] (1969\u20131976).<ref name=\"Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan\"/> Like many other aspects of traditional Chinese life, martial arts were subjected to a radical transformation by the [[People's Republic of China]] to align them with [[Maoist]] revolutionary doctrine.<ref name=\"Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan\"/> The [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] promoted the committee-regulated sport of [[Wushu (sport)|Wushu]] as a replacement for independent schools of martial arts. This new competition sport was disassociated from what was seen as the potentially [[subversive]] self-defense aspects and family lineages of Chinese martial arts.<ref name=\"Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan\"/>\n\nIn 1958, the government established the All-China Wushu Association as an umbrella organization to regulate martial arts training. The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports took the lead in creating standardized forms for most of the major arts. During this period, a national Wushu system that included standard forms, teaching curriculum, and instructor grading was established. Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level. The suppression of traditional teaching was relaxed during the [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976\u20131989)|Era of Reconstruction (1976\u20131989)]], as Communist ideology became more accommodating to alternative viewpoints.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kraus|first=Richard Curt|date=2004-04-28|title=The Party and the Arty in China: The New Politics of Culture (State and Society in East Asia)|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|pages=29|isbn=0-7425-2720-4}}</ref> In 1979, the State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports created a special task force to reevaluate the teaching and practice of Wushu.\nIn 1986, the Chinese National Research Institute of Wushu was established as the central authority for the research and administration of Wushu activities in the People's Republic of China.<ref>{{cite book|first=Wu|last=Bin |author2=Li Xingdong |author3=Yu Gongbao|date=1995-01-01|title=Essentials of Chinese Wushu|isbn=7-119-01477-3|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|location=Beijing}}</ref>\n\nChanging government policies and attitudes towards sports in general led to the closing of the [[State Sports Commission]] (the central sports authority) in 1998.

There are styles that mimic movements from animals and others that gather inspiration from various [[Chinese philosophies]], myths and legends. Some styles put most of their focus into the harnessing of [[qi]], while others concentrate on competition.\n\nChinese martial arts can be split into various categories to differentiate them: For example, ''external'' ({{lang|zh|\u5916\u5bb6\u62f3}}) and ''[[Internal martial arts|internal]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u5185\u5bb6\u62f3}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Tianji|first=Li|author2=Du Xilian|title=A Guide to Chinese Martial Arts|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=7-119-01393-9}}</ref> Chinese martial arts can also be categorized by location, as in ''northern'' ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u62f3}}) and ''southern'' ({{lang|zh|\u5357\u62f3}}) as well, referring to what part of China the styles originated from, separated by the [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang); Chinese martial arts may even be classified according to their province or city.<ref name=\"Kennedy\" /> The main perceived difference between northern and southern styles is that the northern styles tend to emphasize fast and powerful kicks, high jumps and generally fluid and rapid movement, while the southern styles focus more on strong arm and hand techniques, and stable, immovable stances and fast footwork. Examples of the northern styles include [[changquan]] and [[xingyiquan]]. Examples of the southern styles include [[Bak Mei]], [[Wuzuquan]], [[Cai li fo|Choy Li Fut]], and [[Wing Chun]]. Chinese martial arts can also be divided according to religion, imitative-styles ({{lang|zh|\u8c61\u5f62\u62f3}}), and family styles such as [[Hung Gar]] ({{lang|zh|\u6d2a\u5bb6}}). There are distinctive differences in the training between different groups of the Chinese martial arts regardless of the type of classification. However, few experienced martial artists make a clear distinction between internal and external styles, or subscribe to the idea of northern systems being predominantly kick-based and southern systems relying more heavily on upper-body techniques. Most styles contain both hard and soft elements, regardless of their internal nomenclature. Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles, philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner's skills unbalanced or deficient, as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole.

Stances may be differentiated by foot position, weight distribution, body alignment, etc. Stance training can be practiced statically, the goal of which is to maintain the structure of the stance through a set time period, or dynamically, in which case a series of movements is performed repeatedly.

Today, many styles begin to teach new students by focusing on exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, in order to allow its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. 'Sparring' refers to the most important aspect of application training, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.\n\nCompetitive sparring disciplines include Chinese [[kickboxing]] [[Sanshou|S\u01censh\u01d2u]] ({{lang|zh|\u6563\u624b}}) and Chinese [[folk wrestling]] [[Shuai jiao|Shu\u0101iji\u0101o]] ({{lang|zh|\u6454\u8de4}}), which were traditionally contested on a raised platform arena [[Lei tai|L\u00e8it\u00e1i]] ({{lang|zh|\u64c2\u53f0}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hui|first=Mizhou|date=July 1996|title=San Shou Kung Fu Of The Chinese Red Army: Practical Skills And Theory Of Unarmed Combat|publisher=Paladin Press|isbn=0-87364-884-6}}</ref> L\u00e8it\u00e1i represents public challenge matches that first appeared in the [[Song Dynasty]].

Forms were originally intended to preserve the lineage of a particular style branch, and were often taught to advanced students selected for that purpose. Forms contained both literal, representative and exercise-oriented forms of applicable techniques that students could extract, test, and train in through [[sparring]] sessions.<ref name=\"Bolelli\">{{cite book|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele|date=2003-02-20|title=On the Warrior's Path: Philosophy, Fighting, and Martial Arts Mythology|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=1-58394-066-9}}</ref>\n\nToday, many consider ''taolu'' to be one of the most important practices in Chinese martial arts. Traditionally, they played a smaller role in training for combat application, and took a back seat to sparring, drilling, and conditioning. Forms gradually build up a practitioner's flexibility, internal and external strength, speed and stamina, and they teach balance and coordination. Many styles contain forms that use weapons of various lengths and types, using one or two hands. Some styles focus on a certain type of weapon. Forms are meant to be both practical, usable, and applicable as well as to promote fluid motion, meditation, flexibility, balance, and coordination. Teachers are often heard to say \"train your form as if you were sparring and spar as if it were a form.\"\n\nThere are two general types of ''taolu'' in Chinese martial arts. Most common are ''solo forms'' performed by a single student. There are also ''sparring'' forms \u2014 choreographed fighting sets performed by two or more people. Sparring forms were designed both to acquaint beginning fighters with basic measures and concepts of combat, and to serve as performance pieces for the school. Weapons-based sparring forms are especially useful for teaching students the extension, range, and technique required to manage a weapon.\n\n====Forms in Traditional Chinese Martial Arts====\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe term ''taolu (\u5957\u8def)'' is a shortened version of ''Tao Lu Yun Dong (\u5957\u8def\u904b\u52d5)'', an expression introduced only recently with the popularity of modern wushu. This expression refers to \"exercise sets\" and used in the context of athletics or sport.\n\nIn contrast, in traditional Chinese martial arts alternative terminologies for the training (\u7df4) of 'sets or forms ''are:''\n\n* lian quan tao (\u7df4\u62f3\u5957) \u2013 practicing a sequence of fists.\n* lian quan jiao (\u7df4\u62f3\u8173) \u2013 practicing fists and feet.\n* lian bing qi (\u7df4\u5175\u5668) \u2013 practicing weapons.\n* dui da (\u5c0d\u6253) and dui lian (\u5c0d\u7df4) \u2013 fighting sets.\n\nTraditional \"sparring\" sets, called ''dui da'' (\u5c0d\u6253) or ''dui lian'' (\u5c0d\u7df4), were an essential part of Chinese martial arts for centuries. ''Dui lian'' means, to train by a pair of combatants opposing each other\u2014the character ''lian'' (\u7df4), referes to practice; to train; to perfect one's skill; to drill. As well, often one of these terms are also included in the name of fighting sets (\u96d9\u6f14; ''shuang yan''), \"paired practice\" (\u6399\u52dd; ''zheng sheng''), \"to struggle with strength for victory\" (\u6575; ''di''), match \u2013 the character suggests to strike an enemy; and \"to break\" (\u7834; ''po'').\n\nGenerally, there are 21, 18, 12, 9 or 5 drills or 'exchanges/groupings' of attacks and counterattacks, in each ''dui lian'' set. These drills were considered only generic patterns and never meant to be considered inflexible 'tricks'. Students practiced smaller parts/exchanges, individually with opponents switching sides in a continuous flow. Dui ''lian'' were not only sophisticated and effective methods of passing on the fighting knowledge of the older generation, but they were also essential and effective training methods. The relationship between single sets and contact sets is complicated, in that some skills cannot be developed with solo 'sets', and, conversely, with ''dui lian''. Unfortunately, it appears that most traditional combat oriented ''dui lian'' and their training methodology have disappeared, especially those concerning weapons. There are several reasons for this. In modern Chinese martial arts, most of the ''dui lian'' are recent inventions designed for light props resembling weapons, with safety and drama in mind. The role of this kind of training has degenerated to the point of being useless in a practical sense, and, at best, is just performance.\n\nBy the early Song period, sets were not so much \"individual isolated technique strung together\" but rather were composed of techniques and counter technique groupings. It is quite clear that \"sets\" and \"fighting (two-person) sets\" have been instrumental in TCM for many hundreds of years\u2014even before the Song Dynasty. There are images of two-person weapon training in Chinese stone painting going back at least to the Eastern Han Dynasty.\n\nAccording to what has been passed on by the older generations, the approximate ratio of contact sets to single sets was approximately 1:3. In other words, about 30% of the 'sets' practiced at Shaolin were contact sets, ''dui lian'', and two-person drill training. This ratio is, in part, evidenced by the Qing Dynasty mural at Shaolin.\n\nFor most of its history, Shaolin martial arts was mostly weapon-focused: staves were used to defend the monastery, not bare hands. Even the more recent military exploits of Shaolin during the Ming and Qing Dynasties involved weapons. According to some traditions, monks first studied basics for one year and were then taught staff fighting so that they could protect the monastery. Although wrestling has been as sport in China for centuries, weapons have been the essential part of Chinese wushu since ancient times. If one wants to talk about recent or 'modern' developments in Chinese martial arts (including Shaolin for that matter), it is the over-emphasis on bare hand fighting. During the Northern Song Dynasty (976- 997 A.D) when platform fighting is known as ''Da Laitai'' (Title Fights Challenge on Platform) first appeared, these fights were with only swords and staves. Although later, when bare hand fights appeared as well, it was the weapons events that became the most famous. These open-ring competitions had regulations and organized by government organizations; the public also organized some. The government competitions, held in the capital and prefectures, resulted in appointments for winners, to military posts.\n\n====Practice forms vs. kung fu in combat====\nEven though forms in Chinese martial arts are intended to depict realistic martial techniques, the movements are not always identical to how techniques would be applied in combat. Many forms have been elaborated upon, on the one hand to provide better combat preparedness, and on the other hand to look more aesthetically pleasing. One manifestation of this tendency toward elaboration beyond combat application is the use of lower stances and higher, stretching kicks. These two maneuvers are unrealistic in combat and are used in forms for exercise purposes.<ref>{{cite book|last= Kane|first=Lawrence A. |year=2005|title=The Way of Kata |publisher=YMAA Publication Center |pages=56|isbn= 1-59439-058-4}}</ref> Many modern schools have replaced practical defense or offense movements with acrobatic feats that are more spectacular to watch, thereby gaining favor during exhibitions and competitions.{{refn|Pages 118\u2013119<ref name=\"Bolelli\" />|group=\"note\"}} This has led to criticisms by traditionalists of the endorsement of the more acrobatic, show-oriented Wushu competition.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Johnson |author2=Sue Feng  |title=Inner Peace?

Documentation in ancient literature during the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) and the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279) suggests some sets, (including two + person sets: ''dui da'' also called ''dui lian'') became very elaborate and 'flowery', many mainly concerned with aesthetics. During this time, some martial arts systems devolved to the point that they became popular forms of martial art storytelling entertainment shows. This created an entire category of martial arts known as ''Hua Fa Wuyi''. During the Northern Song period, it was noted by historians this type of training had a negative influence on training in the military.\n\nMany traditional Chinese martial artists, as well as practitioners of modern sport combat, have become critical of the perception that forms work is more relevant to the art than sparring and drill application, while most continue to see traditional forms practice within the traditional context\u2014as vital to both proper combat execution, the Shaolin aesthetic as art form, as well as upholding the meditative function of the physical art form.<ref>{{cite news |first=Geoffrey |last=Fowler |author2=Juliet Ye |title=Kung Fu Monks Don't Get a Kick Out of Fighting |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119758024054227513?mod=Sports |publisher= Wall Street Journal |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nAnother reason why techniques often appear different in forms when contrasted with sparring application is thought by some to come from the concealment of the actual functions of the techniques from outsiders.<ref>{{cite book|last= Seabrook|first=Jamie A. |year=2003 |title=Martial Arts Revealed |publisher=iUniverse | pages=20 |isbn= 0-595-28247-4}}</ref>{{sps|date=February 2020}}\n\nForms practice is mostly known for teaching combat techniques yet when  practicing forms, the practitioner focuses on posture, breathing, and performing the techniques of both right and left sides of the body also develop both hemispheres of the brain and contributes to improved motor skills, forms practice also trains the muscles to execute many complex techniques of the art (muscle memory) and can improve balance, flexibility, and the cardiovascular system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904100024/http://www.chinastrategies.com/hiddenforms.htm|title=Three hidden meanings of Chinese forms|last=Verstappe|first=Stefan|date=2014-09-04|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Wushu==\n[[File:Gun2 10 all china games.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Modern forms are used in the sport of [[wushu (sport)|wushu]], as seen in this staff routine]]\n{{see also|Wushu (sport)}}\nThe word ''wu'' ({{lang|zh|\u6b66}}; ''{{transl|zh|w\u01d4}}'') means \u2018martial\u2019.

This implies that \u201cwu\u2019 \u6b66,\u201d is a defensive use of combat.{{Dubious|reason=spelling does not reliably indicate meaning|date=April 2017}} The term \u201cwushu \u6b66\u8853\u201d meaning 'martial arts' goes back as far as the [[Liang Dynasty]] (502-557) in an anthology compiled by Xiao Tong ({{lang|zh|\u856d\u901a}}), (Prince Zhaoming; {{lang|zh|\u662d\u660e\u592a\u5b50}} d. 531), called ''Selected Literature'' ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u9078}}; ''{{transl|zh|W\u00e9nxu\u01cen}}''). The term is found in the second verse of a poem by Yan Yanzhi titled: \u7687\u592a\u5b50\u91cb\u5960\u6703\u4f5c\u8a69 \"Huang Taizi Shidian Hui Zuoshi\".\n\n<blockquote>\"The great man grows the many myriad things . . .\nBreaking away from the military arts,\nHe promotes fully the cultural mandates.\"</blockquote>\n: (Translation from: ''Echoes of the Past'' by Yan Yanzhi (384\u2013456))\n\nThe term ''wushu'' is also found in a poem by Cheng Shao (1626\u20131644) from the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe earliest term for 'martial arts' can be found in the Han History (206BC-23AD) was \"military fighting techniques\" ({{lang|zh|\u5175\u6280\u5de7}}; ''{{transl|zh|b\u012bng j\u00ecqi\u01ceo}}''). During the Song period (c.960) the name changed to \"martial arts\" ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u827a}}; ''{{transl|zh|w\u01d4y\u00ec}}''). In 1928 the name was changed to \"national arts\" ({{lang|zh|\u56fd\u672f}}; ''{{transl|zh|gu\u00f3sh\u00f9}}'') when the [[Central Guoshu Institute|National Martial Arts Academy]] was established in Nanjing. The term reverted to ''w\u01d4sh\u00f9'' under the People's Republic of China during the early 1950s.\n\nAs forms have grown in complexity and quantity over the years, and many forms alone could be practiced for a lifetime, modern styles of Chinese martial arts have developed that concentrate solely on forms, and do not practice application at all. These styles are primarily aimed at exhibition and competition, and often include more acrobatic jumps and movements added for enhanced visual effect<ref>{{cite book|last=Shoude|first=Xie|year=1999|title=International Wushu Competition Routines|publisher=Hai Feng Publishing Co., Ltd.|isbn=962-238-153-7}}</ref> compared to the traditional styles.

The films of [[Bruce Lee]] were instrumental in the initial burst of Chinese martial arts' popularity in the West in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/sports/23karate.html|title=Contender Shores Up Karate's Reputation Among U.F.C.

M. | last=Schneiderman}}</ref> Bruce Lee was the iconic international superstar that popularized Chinese martial arts in the West with his own variation of Chinese martial arts called ''[[Jeet Kune Do]]''. It is a hybrid style of martial art that Bruce Lee practiced and mastered. ''Jeet Kune Do'' is his very own unique style of martial art that uses little to minimum movement but maximizes the effect to his opponents. The influence of Chinese martial art have been widely recognized and have a global appeal in Western cinemas starting off with Bruce Lee.\n\nMartial artists and actors such as [[Jet Li]] and [[Jackie Chan]] have continued the appeal of movies of this genre. Jackie Chan successfully brought in a sense of humour in his fighting style in his movies. Martial arts films from China are often referred to as \"kung fu movies\" ({{lang|zh|\u529f\u592b\u7247}}), or \"wire-fu\" if extensive wire work is performed for special effects, and are still best known as part of the tradition of kung fu theater. (see also: wuxia, [[Hong Kong action cinema]]). The talent of these individuals have broadened Hong Kong's cinematography production and rose to popularity overseas, influencing Western cinemas.\n\nIn the west, kung fu has become a regular action staple, and makes appearances in many films that would not generally be considered \"Martial Arts\" films. These films include but are not limited to [[The Matrix Trilogy]], ''[[Kill Bill]]'', and ''[[The Transporter]]''.\n\nMartial arts themes can also be found on television networks.  A [[United States|U.S.]] network [[TV western]] [[television series|series]] of the early 1970s called ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' also served to popularize the Chinese martial arts on television. With 60 episodes over a three-year span, it was one of the first North American TV shows that tried to convey the philosophy and practice in Chinese martial arts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pilato|first=Herbie J.|date=1993-05-15|title=Kung Fu Book of Caine|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|edition=1st|isbn=0-8048-1826-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Carradine|first=David|date=1993-01-15|title=Spirit of Shaolin|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=0-8048-1828-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spiritofshaolin0000carr}}</ref> The use of Chinese martial arts techniques can now be found in most TV action series, although the philosophy of Chinese martial arts is seldom portrayed in depth.\n\n=== Influence on Hip Hop ===\n\nIn the 1970s, Bruce Lee was beginning to gain popularity in Hollywood for his martial arts movies. The fact that he was a non-white male who portrayed self-reliance and righteous self-discipline resonated with black audiences and made him an important figure in this community.<ref>Phil Hoad,\n [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/18/bruce-lee-films-black-audiences \"Why Bruce Lee and kung fu films hit home with black audiences\"], ''The Guardian''</ref> Around 1973, Kung Fu movies became a hit in America across all backgrounds; however, black audiences maintained the films\u2019 popularity well after the general public lost interest. Urban youth in New York City were still going from every borough to Time Square every night to watch the latest movies.<ref>Wisdom B, [http://throwbackmag.com/site/know-your-hip-hop-history-the-b-boy/ \"Know Your Hip-Hop History: The B-Boy\"], ''Throwback Magazine''</ref>  Amongst these individuals were those coming from the Bronx where, during this time, hip-hop was beginning to take form. One of the pioneers responsible for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was [[DJ Kool Herc]], who began creating this new form of music by taking rhythmic breakdowns of songs and looping them. From the new music came a new form of dance known as b-boying or [[breakdancing]], a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences. Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and \u201cup rocking\u201d (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed kung-fu fights.<ref name=\"jetli.com\">Chris Friedman, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180227094121/https://www.jetli.com/2017/10/kung-fu-break-dancing-hip-hop \"Kung Fu Influences Aspects of Hip Hop Culture Like Break Dancing\"]</ref> The dancers\u2019 ability to improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity, skills and musicality. In a documentary, Crazy Legs, a member of breakdancing group [[Rock Steady Crew]], described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie, \u201cwhere the one kung fu master says something along the lines of \u2018hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,\u2019 then a fight erupts.\u201d <ref name=\"jetli.com\"/>\n\nHip hop group [[Wu Tang Clan]] were prominently influenced by kung fu cinema.  The name \"Wu Tang\" itself is a reference to the 1983 film ''[[Shaolin and Wu Tang]]''.  Subsequent albums by the group (especially their debut album [[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]) are rich with references to kung fu films of the 1970s and 1980s, which group members grew up watching.  Several group members ([[Ghostface Killah]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], [[Method Man]], and [[Masta Killa]]) had also taken their stage names from kung fu cinema.  Several music videos, promotional photos, etc. feature group members posing or engaging with kung fu regalia and action sequences.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Martial arts}}\n* [[Eighteen Arms of Wushu]]\n* [[Hard and soft (martial arts)]]\n* [[Kung fu (disambiguation)]]\n* [[List of Chinese martial arts]]\n* [[Wushu (sport)]]\n* [[Kwoon]]\n* [[Weapons and armor in Chinese mythology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Kung fu schools}}\n{{China topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Martial arts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Martial Arts}}\n[[Category:Chinese martial arts| ]]\n\n[[ml:\u0d15\u0d19\u0d4d \u0d2b\u0d41]]\n", "name_user": "LittleDragon21", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts"}

It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]].

Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994.

It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]] was the first original game in the series released on the [[PlayStation 2]], and was released in 1999. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994.

Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage.

The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure.

The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros.

Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]]. It is the third and currently last [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] based on the ''Mario'' series. The show was originally aired on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] in the 1991\u201392 season. It was featured in a half-hour time slot with a shortened version of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''. Episodes of ''Super Mario World'' were later shown as part of the [[Television syndication|syndication]] package ''Captain N and the Video Game Masters''. Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986.

A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

Miyamoto found Meledandri's creative process similar to his own, and decided he would be the proper lead for a Mario film. They had started more earnest discussions of the film as early as 2016, knowing that if they realized it wasn't working that they could easily walk away.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the ''Mario'' franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of ''Mario Tennis Aces''.\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into four kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''Super Mario Land''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the Pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.'''

It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].

Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

These games did not use the ''Mario'' branding and only featured Mario in the capacity of a cameo. He then appeared in ''[[Mario's Tennis]]'' for the Virtual Boy. After this, [[Camelot Software Planning]] released ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' for the Nintendo 64. They would subsequently develop other games in this series: ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the GameCube and Wii, ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour|Power Tour]]'' for the Game Boy Advance, ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS, ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash|Ultra Smash]]'' for the Wii U, and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces|Aces]]'' for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n==== ''Mario Golf'' series ====\nThe first use of Mario's likeness in a golf game was that the golfer in ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'' for NES and Game Boy featured a mustached man resembling Mario. Later, ''[[NES Open Tournament Golf]]'' was released. It featured Mario and Luigi as the golfers, with [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and [[Princess Daisy]] as their caddies.

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series until ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' in 2007, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled.

Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros.

Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]].

Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986. Directed by Masami Hata and produced by Masakatsu Suzuki and Tsunemasa Hatano, it stars [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who get stuck in a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] [[video game]], in which they must save [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the ''Mario'' franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of ''Mario Tennis Aces''.\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into four kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''Super Mario Land''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the Pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Dream Team''.\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.
