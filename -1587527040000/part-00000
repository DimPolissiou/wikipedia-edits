According to The Hindu newspaper, Tamil-speaking settlers migrated to Bengaluru in four major waves, the first after the 10th century; the second during the Vijayanagara period; and the third, in the 18th century, after the need for government service required by British East India Company who built the train tracks in Bengaluru. Lastly now most Tamilians move to Bengaluru for work and better standards of living. However some may say both kannadiga and Tamil were there from the first.  According to census 1991, people speaking Tamil as mother tongue in Bengaluru formed about 21%.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JZ2Ejl6C2-sC&lpg=PR11&pg=PA16&redir_esc=y&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false Modernisation and Ethnicity.

Around 1004, during the reign of [[Rajendra Chola I]], the Cholas defeated the Western Gangas, and captured Bengaluru. In the 19th century, Bengaluru essentially became a [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin city]], with the \"p\u0113t\u0113\", whose residents were predominantly [[Kannadiga]]s, and the \"cantonment\" created by the British, whose residents were predominantly British and [[Tamil people|Tamils]].<ref>{{cite book|title=KANNADA MOVEMENT|page=50|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172004-231956/unrestricted/4.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scholar.lib.vt.edu|access-date=29 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605195117/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172004-231956/unrestricted/4.pdf|archive-date=5 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Communities ==\n=== Hebbar Iyengar ===\nHebbar [[Iyengar]]s were formerly an endogamous group and constitute a part of the [[Iyengar]] sub-caste of the [[Karnataka]] Brahmins. They are traditionally followers of [[Ramanuja]] and [[Vedanta Desika]]. They hail primarily from [[Hassan, India|Hassan]], [[Mysore]], [[Tumkur]], [[Bangalore]], and surrounding areas in southern [[Karnataka]].\nThe characteristic dialect of the Hebbar Iyengars is called [[Hebbar Tamil]] and is a mixture of [[Iyengar Tamil]], [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]]. The group's primary mother tongue is Hebbar Tamil which is spoken in most Hebbar Iyengar households, though Kannada and English are increasingly taking its place. A peculiar characteristic of Iyengar Tamil (including Hebbar Tamil) is its retention of divine or holy food terminology. For example, Iyengar Tamil makes distinctions between potable ([t\u032ai\u02d0rt\u032ao]) and non-potable water ([d\u0361\u0292\u028clo]), the former considered sacred but both borrowed from Sanskrit. Standard Tamil exhibits only the generic term for 'water'. The Vaishnavite Brahmins of Southern Karnataka use the Tamil surname \"Iyengar\" and are believed to have migrated during the time of the 11th century Vaishnavite saint [[Ramanujacharya]]. Most Iyengars in Karnataka use sub-dialects of [[Iyengar Tamil]].\n\n=== Thigala ===\nThe '''[[Thigala]]''' or '''Tigala''' are a Tamil social group found in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Karnataka]] states of India, and particularly the city of [[Bangalore]].<ref name=\"People of India\">{{cite book|title=People of India|page=1423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQwAQAAIAAJ&q=thigala+Vanniar&dq=thigala+Vanniar|isbn=9788185938981|author1=Singh|first1=Kumar Suresh|last2=India|first2=Anthropological Survey of|year=2003}}</ref> They are likely a sub-caste of the numerous Vanniar caste.<ref name=\"People of India\"/>  Every year, the Thigalas celebrate a festival called Karaga.

Around 1004, during the reign of [[Rajendra Chola I]], the Cholas defeated the Western Gangas, and captured Bengaluru.

They are traditionally followers of [[Ramanuja]] and [[Vedanta Desika]]. They hail primarily from [[Hassan, India|Hassan]], [[Mysore]], [[Tumkur]], [[Bangalore]], and surrounding areas in southern [[Karnataka]].\nThe characteristic dialect of the Hebbar Iyengars is called [[Hebbar Tamil]] and is a mixture of [[Iyengar Tamil]], [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]]. The group's primary mother tongue is Hebbar Tamil which is spoken in most Hebbar Iyengar households, though Kannada and English are increasingly taking its place. A peculiar characteristic of Iyengar Tamil (including Hebbar Tamil) is its retention of divine or holy food terminology. For example, Iyengar Tamil makes distinctions between potable ([t\u032ai\u02d0rt\u032ao]) and non-potable water ([d\u0361\u0292\u028clo]), the former considered sacred but both borrowed from Sanskrit. Standard Tamil exhibits only the generic term for 'water'. The Vaishnavite Brahmins of Southern Karnataka use the Tamil surname \"Iyengar\" and are believed to have migrated during the time of the 11th century Vaishnavite saint [[Ramanujacharya]]. Most Iyengars in Karnataka use sub-dialects of [[Iyengar Tamil]].\n\n=== Thigala ===\nThe '''[[Thigala]]''' or '''Tigala''' are a Tamil social group found in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Karnataka]] states of India, and particularly the city of [[Bangalore]].<ref name=\"People of India\">{{cite book|title=People of India|page=1423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQwAQAAIAAJ&q=thigala+Vanniar&dq=thigala+Vanniar|isbn=9788185938981|author1=Singh|first1=Kumar Suresh|last2=India|first2=Anthropological Survey of|year=2003}}</ref> They are likely a sub-caste of the numerous Vanniar caste.<ref name=\"People of India\"/>  Every year, the Thigalas celebrate a festival called Karaga.

Doumanian, who had been an associate producer during the first five seasons of the show and produced a special for Michaels in 1978, was one of the few who remained. She was offered Michaels' job running ''SNL'', much to Michaels' surprise, and took over the show for the [[1980 in television|1980 season]], hiring a completely new cast and new writers.\n\nDoumanian's tenure as ''SNL'' executive producer was tumultuous. She hired [[Denny Dillon]], [[Gilbert Gottfried]], [[Gail Matthius]], [[Joe Piscopo]], [[Ann Risley]] and [[Charles Rocket]] as repertory players, and [[Yvonne Hudson]], Matthew Laurance and Patrick Weathers as featured players. Then-unknown [[Eddie Murphy]] would join the show as a featured player on the fourth episode and was upgraded to repertory status on January 24, 1981. With its team of all-new writers and cast members, the show was plagued with problems from the start of the season and deemed a commercial disappointment, and suffered from competition with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s new weekend show, ''[[Fridays (ABC TV series)|Fridays]]'', and budget cuts.\n\nIn a cliffhanger titled \"Who Shot C.R.\" from the episode on February 21, 1981, cast member [[Charles Rocket]] was \"shot\" after cast members shared their grievances with Rocket and with one another. When that episode's host, [[Charlene Tilton]], asked Rocket what it felt like to be shot, he replied \"Oh man, it's the first time I've been shot in my life. I'd like to know who the fuck did it.\" The uncensored expletive, seemingly planned, landed the show, its producer and the network in trouble. After one further episode on March 7, 1981, the show was put on a month-long hiatus after [[NBC]] executives decided the show needed an immediate overhaul, and Doumanian was dismissed from her position at ''SNL'' and replaced by [[Dick Ebersol]], who fired [[Gilbert Gottfried]], [[Ann Risley]] and [[Charles Rocket]] before the end of the hiatus. After one episode on April 11, 1981, the [[1981 Writers Guild of America strike]] began, causing the season to end early. After the season ended, Ebersol fired [[Gail Matthius]] and [[Denny Dillon]].  Only Piscopo, Murphy, and writers [[Pamela Norris|Pam Norris]], [[Barry W.

Doumanian, who had been an associate producer during the first five seasons of the show and produced a special for Michaels in 1978, was one of the few who remained. She was offered Michaels' job running ''SNL'', much to Michaels' surprise, and took over the show for the [[1980 in television|1980 season]], hiring a completely new cast and new writers.\n\nDoumanian's tenure as ''SNL'' executive producer was tumultuous. She hired [[Denny Dillon]], [[Gilbert Gottfried]], [[Gail Matthius]], [[Joe Piscopo]], [[Ann Risley]] and [[Charles Rocket]] as repertory players, and [[Yvonne Hudson]], Matthew Laurance and Patrick Weathers as featured players. Then-unknown [[Eddie Murphy]] would join the show as a featured player on the fourth episode and was upgraded to repertory status on January 24, 1981. With its team of all-new writers and cast members, the show was plagued with problems from the start of the season and deemed a commercial disappointment, and suffered from competition with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s new weekend show, ''[[Fridays (ABC TV series)|Fridays]]'', and budget cuts.\n\nIn a cliffhanger titled \"Who Shot C.R.\" from the episode on February 21, 1981, cast member [[Charles Rocket]] was \"shot\" after cast members shared their grievances with Rocket and with one another. When that episode's host, [[Charlene Tilton]], asked Rocket what it felt like to be shot, he replied \"Oh man, it's the first time I've been shot in my life. I'd like to know who the fuck did it.\" The uncensored expletive, seemingly planned, landed the show, its producer and the network in trouble. After one further episode on March 7, 1981, the show was put on a month-long hiatus after [[NBC]] executives decided the show needed an immediate overhaul, and Doumanian was dismissed from her position at ''SNL'' and replaced by [[Dick Ebersol]], who fired [[Gilbert Gottfried]], [[Ann Risley]] and [[Charles Rocket]] before the end of the hiatus. After one episode on April 11, 1981, the [[1981 Writers Guild of America strike]] began, causing the season to end early. After the season ended, Ebersol fired [[Gail Matthius]] and [[Denny Dillon]].  Only Piscopo, Murphy, and writers [[Pamela Norris|Pam Norris]], [[Barry W. Blaustein|Barry Blaustein]] and [[David Sheffield]] remained from Doumanian's tenure when the next season started.  One of Doumanian's writers, [[Terry Sweeney]], would become a cast member on the show in 1985 after [[Lorne Michaels]] returned to replace Ebersol.\n\nIn 2010, former cast writer [[Harry Shearer]] disclosed to [[Howard Stern]] that Doumanian rejected his proposal to bring in highly experienced talent and instead told him that she did not think she \"want[ed] people who know what they're doing.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn February 15, 2015, Doumanian attended the [[Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special|''SNL'' 40th anniversary special]],<ref name=DeadlineInterview>{{cite web|last1=Gerard|first1=Jeremy|title=Producer Jean Doumanian on TV, \u2018Brilliant Things\u2019 & \u2018SNL': Conversations With Jeremy Gerard|url=https://deadline.com/2015/02/jean-doumanian-snl-woody-allen-galveston-1201364951/|website=Deadline|accessdate=February 22, 2015|date=February 2, 2015}}</ref> although she apparently had not been officially invited, and it was said that ''SNL'' executives were not happy about her presence.
