The remnant of the [[Byzantine Empire]] is visible in the west; the [[Seljuk Empire]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Egypt]] are shown in green.|alt=Map of the states of the eastern Mediterranean in 1135]]\n\n'''Outremer''', or the '''Crusader states''', were [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[Christian state]]s created by a series of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. In particular the term refers to those states formed by the campaigns between 1096 and 1271 in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] aimed at recovering the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. [[Pope Urban II]] proclaimed the [[First Crusade]] at the [[Council of Clermont]] in 1095. He encouraged military support for the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios{{nbsp}}I]] against the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. There was an enthusiastic response in [[Western Europe]] across all social strata. This, and later campaigns, established four crusader states in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]]; the [[Principality of Antioch]]; the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; and the [[County of Tripoli]]. These states in the [[Levant]] were the first examples of \"Europe overseas\" and became known to historians by the [[French language|French]] version of the phrase, {{lang|fr|Outremer}}. A crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|fall]] of [[Acre,_Israel|Acre]] in 1291 led to the rapid loss of the last remaining holdings.\n\nThe crusader states were frontier societies with a minority Frankish populations ruling indigenous populations culturally related to the neighbouring communities. The states were politically and legally stratified with the Franks controlling the relationships between self-governing and ethnically-based communities. Society was divided between Frank and non-Frank, not between Christian and Muslim. Few Franks could speak more than basic Arabic, instead relying on indigenous interpreters and headmen. Indigenous  courts administered civil disputes and minor criminality with more serious offences dealt with by the Frankish {{lang|fr|cour des bourgeois}} or courts of the burgesses, the name of the non-noble Franks. There is little evidence of assimilation. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious divisions. Large differences in status and wealth existed between urban and rural dwellers; indigenous Christians were able gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas. Muslim and indigenous Christian populations tended to seperation rather than integration. Greek Orthodox communities proved resilient with many surviving the Arab conquest, rule by the Crusaders and for centuries after the fall of the crusader states. Other indigenous communities included Palestinian Christians, Arabic speaking members of the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]] and [[Maronite Church]], [[Armenians]] as well well as [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Druze]] Muslims. \n\nFew artistic styles originated in the crusader states. One that did was a military architecture that demonstrated a synthesis of the European, Byzantine and Muslim traditions; with the inclusion of oriental design features such as large water reservoirs and the exclusion of occidental features like moats.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=295\u2013296}} Early church design was in the [[French Romanesque architecture|French Romanesque]] style. The 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre retained some of the Byzantine details, but added new arches and chapels in northern French, Aquitanian and Proven\u00e7al styles. In sculpture little trace of an indigenous influence remains. In contrast the visual culture demonstrates the influence of indigenous artists. Decoration of shrines, painting and the production of manuscripts and the adoption of methods from the Byzantine and indigenous artists and iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style. Wall mosaics were unknown in the west but were widespread in the crusader states.\n\n==Background==\n\n{{Further|Spread of Islam|Crusades|Muslim conquests|Great Seljuk Empire|Byzantine\u2013Seljuk wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine wars| Council of Clermont| Reconquista}}\n\nBeginning in the 7th century, following the foundation of the [[Islam|Islamic religion]] by [[Muhammad]], and through the 8th century, Muslim [[Arabs]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] captured [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Iran]], [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|the Levant]] and [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|North Africa]] from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]s, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberia]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nIn 750 a bloody coup brought an end to Umayyad rule, leading to the gradual fragmentation of the monolithic Islamic state and the relocation of the political and economic centre of the Islamic world from Palestine to Iran and Iraq.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=18}} By the end of the 11th century the age of Islamic territorial expansion was long gone.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=40}} However, frontier conditions between the Christian and Muslim world remained militant across the Mediterranean area. From the 8th century, in what later became known as the ''[[Reconquista]]'', Christians were campaigning in Spain. In the 11th century [[Normans|Norman]] adventurers led by [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger de Hauteville]], later King Roger I of Sicily, seized [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] from the Muslims.{{sfn|Mayer|1988|pp=17\u201318}} The \"Holy Land\" had been under Arab Muslim control for more than four centuries, with fluctuating levels of tolerance, trade, and political relationships between Muslims and Christians. Catholic pilgrims had access to sacred sites and Christian residents in Muslim territories were given [[dhimmi]] status, legal rights, and legal protection. Indigenous Christians were allowed to maintain churches, and marriages between faiths were not uncommon.{{sfn|Findley|2005|p=73}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christian Byzantine Empire in the early 11th century stretched east to Iran and controlled Bulgaria and much of southern Italy in the west. However, from this point the arrival of new enemies on all frontiers placed intolerable strains on the resources of both the Byzantine Empire and the neighbouring Arab Muslim regimes.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=42\u201346}} The situation was a serious threat to the future of the Byzantine Empire.

[[Maronites]] were concentrated in Tripoli; Jacobites in Antioch and Edessa. Armenians were concentrated in the north but communities existed in all major towns. Palestine's central areas had a Muslim majority population. The Muslims were mainly Sunnis, but Shi'ite communities existed in [[Galilee]].

By the 13th{{nbsp}}century the population of Acre probably exceeded 60,000, then came [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], with the capital being the smallest of the three with a population somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=82}} At its zenith, the Latin population of the region reached {{circa|250,000}} with the Kingdom of Jerusalem's population numbering {{circa|120,000}} and the combined total in Tripoli, Antioch and Edessa being broadly comparable.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=396}} The presence of Frankish peasants is evident in 235 villages, out of a total of some 1,200 rural settlements.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=150}}\n\nIn context, Josiah Russell estimates the population of what he calls \"Islamic territory\" as roughly 12.5&nbsp;million in 1000{{mdash}}Anatolia 8 million, Syria 2 million, Egypt 1.5 million and North Africa 1 million {{mdash}} with the European areas that provided crusaders having a population of 23.7 million.

Russell acknowledges that much of Anatolia was Christian or under the Byzantines and that some purportedly Islamic areas such as Mosul and Baghdad had significant Christian populations.{{sfn|Russell|1985|p=298}}\n\n==Society==\n\n{{lang|fr|Outremer}} was frontier society with a Frankish elite ruling a indigenous population related to the neighbouring communities, many of whom were hostile to the Franks.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=17\u201319}} It was politically and legally stratified, with self-governing, ethnically-based communities. Relations between communities were controlled by the Franks.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=127}} The basic division in society was between Frank and non-Frank, and not between Christian and Muslim. All Franks were considered free men, while the indigenous peoples lived like western [[serfs]]. Conversion to Latin Christianity was their only route to full citizenship. The Franks imposed officials in order to use the military, legal and administrative systems to control the indigenous peoples. Few Franks could speak more than basic Arabic. [[Dragoman]]s{{mdash}}interpreters{{mdash}}and ''[[Rais|ru\u02beas\u0101\u02be]]''{{mdash}}village headmen{{mdash}}were used as mediators. Civil disputes and minor criminality were administered by the courts of the indigenous communities, but more serious offences and cases involving Franks were dealt with by the Frankish {{lang|fr|cour des bourgeois}} or courts of the burgesses, the name given to the non-noble Franks.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=81}} The lack of material evidence makes it difficult to identify the level of assimilation. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious division, although some historians assume that {{lang|fr|Outremer}}'s heterogeneity eroded formal apartheid.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=126\u2013136}} The key differentiator in status and economic position was between urban and rural dwellers. Indigenous Christians could gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas except those in servitude.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=128\u2013130}}\n\nFrankish courts reflected the region's diversity. [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] was part Armenian and married Fulk from Anjou. Their son Amalric, first married a Frank from the Levant, then a Byzantine Greek. William of Tyre was appalled at the use of Jewish, Syrian and Muslim physicians, who were popular among the nobility. Greek and Arabic speaking Christians made Antioch a centre of cultural interchange. The indigenous peoples showed the Frankish nobility traditional deference. Some Franks adopted the their dress, food, housing and military techniques. This does not mean that {{lang|fr|Outremer}} was a cultural melting pot. Inter-communal relations were shallow, separate identities were maintained and other communities were considered alien.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=127,131,136\u2013141}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nIn addition to being economic centres themselves, the crusader states provided an obstacle to Muslim trade by sea with the west and to the land routes from [[Mesopotamia]] and Syria to the great urban economies of the Nile. Despite hostility, commerce continued, coastal cities remained maritime outlets for the Islamic hinterland and eastern wares were exported to Europe in unprecedented volumes. The Byzantine-Muslim mercantile growth in the 12th{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}13th{{nbsp}}centuries may have occurred anyway, as the Western European economy was booming due to population growth; this increased wealth and created a growing social class demanding city centred products and eastern imports, but it is likely that the Crusades hastened the developments. European fleets were expanded, better ships built, navigation improved and fare paying pilgrims subsidised many voyages. Agricultural production, largely the domain of the indigenous population, flourished before the fall of the First Kingdom in 1187, but was negligible afterwards. Franks, Muslims, Jews and indigenous Christians traded crafts in the [[souks]], teeming oriental bazaars, of the cities.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=382}}  The Italian, Proven\u00e7al and Catalan merchants monopolised shipping, imports, exports, transportation and banking. The Frankish noble and ecclesiastical institutional income was based on income from estates, market tolls and taxation.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=352\u2013354}} The main centres of production were Antioch, Tripoli, Tyre and, less importantly, Beirut. Textiles, glass, dyestuffs, olives, wine, sesame oil and sugar were exported; silk was particularly prized.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=392\u2013393}} The Frankish population, estimated at roughly a quarter of a million people, provided an import market for clothing and finished goods.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=396\u2013397}}\n\n==Coinage==\n\n[[File:crusader coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|350px|Crusader coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

After 1124, Egyptian dinars were copied, creating Jerusalem's gold [[bezant]]. Following the collapse of {{lang|fr|Outremer}} in 1187, trade, rather than agriculture, increasingly dominated the economy and western coins began dominating the coinage in circulation. Although lords in Tyre, Sidon and Beirut minted silver pennies and copper coins there is little evidence of systematic attempts to create a unified currency.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=120\u2013121}}\n\n==Monarchy==\n\nDuring the period of near constant warfare in the early decades of the 12th{{nbsp}}century, the king of Jerusalem's foremost role was leader of the feudal host. They very rarely awarded land or lordships, and those awarded that became vacant\u2014a frequent event due to the high mortality rate in the conflict\u2014reverted to the crown. Instead their followers' loyalty was rewarded with city incomes. As a result, the royal domain of the first five rulers {{mdash}}including much of Judea, Samaria, the coast from Jaffa to Ascalon, the ports of Acre and Tyre, and other scattered castles and territories{{mdash}}was larger that the combined holdings of the nobility. This meant that the rulers of Jerusalem had greater internal power than comparative western monarchs, although they did not have the necessary administrative systems and personnel to govern such a large realm.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n[[File:Principado de Galileen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Map of the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187|alt=Map of the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187]]The situation evolved in the second quarter of the century with the establishment of baronial dynasties. Magnates{{mdash}}such as [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], Lord of [[Oultrejordain]], and [[Raymond III, Count of Tripoli]], [[Principality of Galilee|Prince of Galilee]]{{mdash}}often acted as autonomous rulers. Royal powers were abrogated and effectively governance was undertaken within the feudatories. What central control remained was exercised at the {{lang|la|[[Haute Cour]]}}{{mdash}}High Court, in English. Only the 13th{{nbsp}}century [[jurists]] of Jerusalem used this term, {{lang|la|[[curia regis]]}} was more common in Europe. These were meetings between the king and his tenants in chief. Over time the duty of the vassal to give counsel developed into a privilege and ultimately the legitimacy of the monarch depended on the agreement of the court.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=112}} The barons of Jerusalem in the 13th{{nbsp}}century have been poorly regarded by both contemporary and modern commentators: James of Vitry was disgusted by their superficial rhetoric; the historian [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] writes of their pedantry and the use of spurious legal justification for political action.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=226}}\n\nIn practice, the High Court consisted of the great barons and the king's direct vassals. In law a quorum was the king and three tenants in chief. The 1162 {{lang|fr|[[assise sur la ligece]]}} theoretically expanded the court's membership to all 600 or more fief-holders, making them all peers. All those who paid homage directly to the king were now members of the {{lang|la|Haute Cour}} of Jerusalem. They were joined by the heads of the military orders by the end of the 12th{{nbsp}}century, and the Italian communes in the 13th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=112\u2013117}} Before the defeat at Hattin in 1187 the laws developed by the court were documented as {{lang|fr|[[assises]]}} in ''Letters of the Holy Sepulchre''.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=122}} The entire body of written law was lost in the subsequent fall of Jerusalem. From this point the legal system was largely based on custom and the memory of the lost legislation. The renowned jurist [[Philip of Novara]] lamented \"We know [the laws] rather poorly, for they are known by hearsay and usage...and we think an assize is something we have seen as an assize...in the kingdom of Jerusalem [the barons] made much better use of the laws and acted on them more surely before the land was lost\". Thus a myth was created of an idyllic early 12th{{nbsp}}century legal system. The barons used this to reinterpret the {{lang|fr|assise sur la ligece}}, which Almalric I intended to strengthen the crown, to instead constrain the monarch, particularly with regards to the right of the monarch to remove feudal fiefs without trial. The concomitant loss of the vast majority of rural fiefs led to the barons becoming an urban mercantile class where knowledge of the law was a valuable, well-regarded skill and a career path to higher status.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=228}}\n\nThe leaders of the [[Third Crusade]] ignored the monarchy of Jerusalem; the kings of England and France agreed on the division of future conquests as if there was no need to take into account the nobility of the crusader states. The historian [[Joshua Prawer]] considered that the weakness of the crown of Jerusalem was demonstrated by the rapid offering of the throne to Conrad of Montferrat in 1190 and then [[Henry II, Count of Champagne]] in 1192.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=107\u2013108}} Emperor Frederick II married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem|Queen Isabella]] in 1225 and immediately claimed the throne of Jerusalem from her father, the King Regent, [[John of Brienne]]. In 1228 Isabella died after giving birth to a son, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], who through his mother was now legally king of Jerusalem and Frederick's heir.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=563\u2013571}} From 1229 when Frederick II left the Holy Land to defend his Italian and German lands, monarchs were absent{{mdash}}Conrad from 1225 until 1254, his son [[Conradin]] until his execution by Charles of Anjou in 1268. Government in Jerusalem had developed in the opposite direction to monarchies in the west. St Louis, Emperor Frederick and Kind Edward I\u2014contemporary rulers of France, Germany and England respectively\u2014 were powerful, with centralised bureaucracies. Jerusalem had a royalty without power.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=104}} Magnates such as the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]] attempted to seize the regency, fighting for control with an Italian army led by Frederick's viceroy [[Richard Filangieri]] in the [[War of the Lombards]]. Tyre, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] supported Filangieri. In opposition were the Ibelins, Acre, the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and Genoa. The rebels established a surragate commune, or parliament, for twelve years in Acre.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=229}} They prevailed in 1242 with the capture of Tyre and a succession of Ibelin and Cypriot regents followed.{{sfn|Tyerman |2019|p=268}} Centralised government collapsed while the nobility, military orders and Italian communes took the lead. Three Cypriot [[House of Lusignan|Lusignan]] kings succeeded without the financial or military resources to recover the lost territory. The title of king was even sold to Charles of Anjou, but although he gained power for a short while, he never visited the kingdom. The king of Cyprus fought at Acre until all hope was lost and then returned to his island realm.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=108\u2013109}} Cyprus survived the fall of the mainland crusader states and [[Peter I of Cyprus]] launched the [[Alexandrian Crusade|last crusade against Egypt]] that temporarily captured Alexandria in 1365.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=392}}\n\n==Religion==\n\nPartly a result of anti-Orthodox sentiment the early crusaders filled ecclesiastical positions in the Orthodox church left vacant with Franks, including the patriarchy of Jerusalem when [[Simeon II of Jerusalem|Simeon II]] died. The Greek Orthodox Church was considered part of the universal Church, which enabled the replacement of Orthodox bishops by Latin clerics in coastal towns. The first Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, [[Arnulf of Chocques]], ejected the Greek Orthodox monks from the Holy Sepulchre but relented when the miracle of Easter Fire failed in their absence. The appointment of Latin bishops had little effect on the Arabic-speaking Orthodox Christians because the previous bishops were also foreign, from the Byzantine Empire. The Latin bishops used Greeks as [[coadjutor bishop]]s to administer Syrians and Greeks left without higher clergy. In many villages Latin and Orthodox Christions shared a church. In exceptional political circumstances, Greeks replaced Latin patriarchs in Antioch. Orthodox monasteries were rebuilt and Orthodox monastic life revived.  This toleration continued despite an increasingly interventionist papal reaction demonstrated by [[Jacques de Vitry]], [[Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre|Bishop of Acre]]. The Armenians, Copts, Jacobites, Nestorians and Maronites had greater autonomy. As they were not in communion with Rome they could retain their own bishops without a conflict of authority. Around 1181 [[Aimery of Limoges]], Patriarch of Antioch, managed to bring the Maronites into communion with Rome, establishing a precedent for the [[Eastern Catholic Churches#Uniate|Uniate Churches]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=134\u2013143}}\n\nThat religion prevented assimilation is evidenced by the Franks' discriminatory laws against Jews and Muslims. They were banned from living in Jerusalem and sexual relations between Muslims and Christians were punished by mutilation. Some mosques were converted into Christian churches, but the Franks did not force Muslims to convert to Christianity. Frankish lords were particularly reluctant, because conversion would have ended the Muslim peasants' servile status. The Muslims were permitted to pray in public and their [[hajj|pilgrimages to Mecca]] continued.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=127\u2013129}} The [[Samaritans]]' annual Passover festival attracted visitors from beyond the kingdom's borders.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n==Communes==\n\nLargely located in the ports of Acre, Tyre, Tripoli and Sidon, [[commune]]s of Italians, Proven\u00e7als and Catalans had distinct cultural characteristics and exerted significant political power. Separate from the Frankish nobles or burgesses, the communes were autonomous political entities closely linked to their towns of origin. This gave them the ability to monopolise foreign trade and almost all banking and shipping in {{lang|fr|Outremer}}. Their parent cities' naval support was essential for the crusader states. Every opportunity to extend trade privileges was taken. One example saw the Venetians receiving one-third of Tyre and its territories, and exemption from all taxes, after Venice participated in the successful [[Siege of Tyre (1124)|1124 siege of the city]]. Despite all efforts, the Syrian and Palestinian ports were unable to replace Alexandria and Constantinople as the primary centres of commerce in the region. Instead, the communes competed with the monarchs and each other to maintain economic advantage. Power derived from the support of the communards' home cities rather than their number, which never reached more than hundreds. Thus, by the middle of the 13th{{nbsp}}century, the rulers of the communes were barely required to recognise the authority of the crusaders and divided Acre into several fortified miniature republics.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=85\u201393}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n==Military orders==\n{{Main|Military order (religious society)}}\n[[Image:Baldwin II ceeding the Temple of Salomon to Ugo dei Pagani and Gaudefroy de Saint-Homer.jpg|thumb|13th-century miniature of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] granting the captured [[Al Aqsa Mosque]] to [[Hugues de Payens]]|alt=13th-century miniature of King Baldwin II granting the captured Al Aqsa Mosque to Hugues de Payens]]\nThe crusaders' propensity to follow the customs of their Western European homelands meant that there were very few innovations developed from the culture in the crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this were the military orders, warfare and fortifications.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=252}} The Knights Hospitaller, formally the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to their ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=169}} In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclesiastical sphere.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=253}}\n\nMilitary orders like the Knights Hospitaller and Knights Templar provided Latin Christendom's first professional armies in support of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other crusader states. The Templars, formally the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon, and their [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Temple of Solomon]] were founded around 1119 by a small band of knights who dedicated themselves to protecting pilgrims en{{nbsp}}route to Jerusalem.{{sfn| Asbridge|2012| p= 168}} The Hospitallers and the Templars became supranational organisations as papal support led to rich donations of land and revenue across Europe. This, in turn, led to a steady flow of new recruits and the wealth to maintain multiple fortifications in the crusader states. In time, they developed into autonomous powers in the region.{{sfn| Asbridge|2012|pp=169\u2013170}} After the fall of Acre the Hospitallers first relocated to Cyprus, then conquered and ruled [[Rhodes]] (1309\u20131522) and Malta (1530\u20131798), and [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|continue in existence to the present-day]]. King [[Philip IV of France]] probably had financial and political reasons to oppose the Knights Templar, which led to him exerting pressure on [[Pope Clement V]]. The pope responded in 1312, with a series of papal bulls including ''[[Vox in Excelso]]'' and ''[[Ad Providam]]'' that dissolved the order on the alleged and probably false grounds of sodomy, magic and heresy.{{sfn|Davies|1997|p=359}}\n\n==Art and architecture==\n{{Further|Art of the crusades|List of Crusader castles}}\n\n[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|12th-century [[Knights Hospitaller]] castle of [[Krak des Chevaliers]] in Syria, one of the first castles to use concentric fortification, i.e. concentric rings of defence that could all operate at the same time.

Castles were a tangible symbol of the dominance of a Latin Christian minority over a largely hostile majority population. They also acted as centres of administration.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=280\u2013281}} Modern historiography rejects the 19th-century consensus that Westerners learnt the basis of military architecture from the Near East, as Europe had already experienced rapid growth in defensive technology before the First Crusade. Direct contact with Arab fortifications originally constructed by the Byzantines did influence developments in the east. But the lack of documentary evidence means that it remains difficult to differentiate between the importance of this design culture and the constraints of situation, which led to the inclusion of oriental design features such as large water reservoirs and the exclusion of occidental features like moats.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nTypically, early church design was in the [[French Romanesque architecture|French Romanesque]] style. This can be seen in the 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre. It retained some of the earlier Byzantine details, but new arches and chapels were built to northern French, Aquitanian and Proven\u00e7al patterns. There is little trace of any surviving indigenous influence in sculpture, although in the Holy Sepulchre the [[Capital (architecture)|column capitals]] of the south facade follow classical Syrian patterns.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=146}}\n\nIn contrast to architecture and sculpture, it is in the area of visual culture that the assimilated nature of the society was demonstrated. Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries the influence of indigenous artists was demonstrated in the decoration of shrines, painting and the production of manuscripts. In addition, Frankish practitioners borrowed methods from the Byzantines and indigenous artists and iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style leading to a cultural synthesis illustrated by the [[Church of the Nativity]]. Wall mosaics were unknown in the west but in widespread use in the crusader states. Whether this was by indigenous craftsmen or learnt by Frankish ones is unknown, but a distinctive and original artistic style evolved.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nManuscripts were produced and illustrated in workshops housing Italian, French, English and indigenous craftsmen leading to a cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques. An example of this is the [[Melisende Psalter]], created by several hands in a workshop attached to the Holy Sepulchre. This style could have either reflected or influenced the taste of patrons of the arts. But what is seen is an increase in stylised Byzantine-influenced content. This even extended to the production of [[icons]], unknown at the time to the Franks, sometimes in a Frankish style and even of western saints. This is seen as the origin of Italian panel painting.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=147\u2013149}} While it is difficult to track illumination of manuscripts and castle design back to their sources, textual sources are simpler. The translations made in Antioch are notable, but they are considered of secondary importance to the works emanating from Muslim Spain and from the hybrid culture of Sicily.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=667\u2013668}}\n\n==Military==\n\nReports from John of Ibelin indicate that around 1170 the military force of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was based on a feudal host of about 647 to 675 heavily armoured knights. Each [[feudatory]] would also provide his own armed retainers. Non-noble light cavalry and infantry were known as ''serjants''. The prelates and the towns were to provide 5,025 ''serjants'' to the royal army, according to Ibelin's list. This force would be augmented by hired soldiery called [[Turcopoles]]. In times of emergency, the king could also call upon a general muster of the whole Christian population.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=134}}\n\nJoshua Prawer estimated that the military orders could match the king's fighting strength. This means the total military of the kingdom was approximately 1,200 knights and 10,000 ''serjants''. Enough for further territorial gains, but fewer than required to maintain military domination. This was also a problem defensively. Putting a major army into the field required draining castles and cities of able-bodied fighting men. In the case of a defeat, such as the [[Battle of Hattin]], there remained few to resist the invaders. Muslim armies were incohesive and seldom campaigned outside the period between sowing and harvest. As a result, the crusaders adopted delaying tactics when faced with a superior invading Muslim force. They would avoid direct confrontation, instead retreating to strongholds and waiting for the Muslim army to disperse. It took generations before the Muslims recognised that they could not conquer {{lang|fr|Outremer}} without destroying the Franks' fortresses. This strategic change forced the crusaders away from the tactic of gaining and holding territory, including Jerusalem. Instead their aim became to attack and destroy Egypt. By removing this constant regional challenge, the crusaders hoped to gain the necessary time to improve the kingdom's demographic weakness. Egypt was isolated from the other Islamic power centres, it would be easier to defend and was self-sufficient in food.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=327\u2013333, 340\u2013341}} \n\nLittle was achieved by a [[Fifth Crusade]], primarily raised from Hungary, Germany, Flanders and led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. The crusaders attacked Egypt to break the Muslim hold on Jerusalem. Damietta was [[Siege of Damietta (1218\u20131219)|captured]] but then returned and an eight-year truce agreed after the Franks advancing into Egypt surrendered.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=214\u2013218,236}} In 1249 [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] led a [[Seventh Crusade|crusade]] attacking Egypt, was defeated at the [[Battle of Al Mansurah]] and the crusaders were captured [[Battle of Fariskur|as they retreated]]. Louis and his nobles were ransomed, other prisoners were given a choice of conversion to Islam or beheading. A ten-year truce was established and Louis remained in Syria until 1254 consolidating the Frankish position.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=583\u2013607,615\u2013620}}{{sfn|Tyerman |2019|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n==Language==\n\nThe Franks ruled as an elite and outnumbered class. As such, linguistic differences remained a key differentiator between the Franks lords and the local population. The Franks typically spoke [[Old French]] and wrote in [[Latin]]. While some learnt [[Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Hebrew]] this was unusual.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=177}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nRiley-Smith descibed the Latin [[kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the period between 1099 and 1187 as the first experiment in a \"Europe Overseas\". The raising, transportation, and supply of large armies led to flourishing [[Trade route|trade]] between Europe and the crusader states. The Italian city-states of Genoa and Venice flourished, through profitable trading communes.{{sfn|Housley|2006|pp=152\u2013154}}{{sfn|Davies|1997|pp=359\u2013360}} Many historians argue that the interaction between the western Christian and Islamic cultures played a significant, ultimately positive, part in the development of European civilisation and the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=96}} Relations between Europeans and the Islamic world, stretching across the length of the Mediterranean Sea, led to an improved perception of Islamic culture in the West. But this broad area of interaction also makes it difficult for historians to identify how much of this cultural cross-fertilisation originated in the crusader states and how much originated in Sicily and Spain.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=667\u2013668}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012 |publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=[[Europe: A History]]|last=Davies|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Davies|year=1997|publisher=[[Random House|Pimlico]]|isbn=978-0-7126-6633-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Findley| first=Carter Vaughan|year=2005|title=The Turks in World History|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-516770-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Housley|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Housley|title=Contesting the Crusades|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-1189-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Hans Eberhard|title=The Crusades|edition=&nbsp; Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-19-873097-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nicholson|first=Helen|title=The Crusades|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-313-32685-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/crusades00nich}}\n* {{cite book|last=Prawer|first=Joshua|authorlink=Joshua Prawer|title=The Crusaders' Kingdom|publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix Press]]|year=1972|isbn=978-1-84212-224-2|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AMxmAAAAMAAJ&q|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Russell|first=Josiah C.|chapter=The Population of the Crusader States|pages=295\u2013314|editor-last1=Zacour|editor-first1=Norman P.|editor-last2=Hazard| editor-first2=Harry W.|title=A History of the Crusades|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tgfMNfBIgSwC|volume=5 The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East|year=1985|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-09140-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|title=God's War: A New History of the Crusades|publisher=Belknap Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-674-02387-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|title=The World of the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIOVDwAAQBAJ|year=2019|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-21739-1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Andrew D Buck, \"[[doi:10.1093/ehr/ceaa008|Settlement, Identity, and Memory in the Latin East: An Examination of the Term \u2018Crusader States\u2019.]]\" ''The English Historical Review''\n* [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], ''The Feudal Nobility and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, 1174\u20131277''.

The remnant of the [[Byzantine Empire]] is visible in the west; the [[Seljuk Empire]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Egypt]] are shown in green.|alt=Map of the states of the eastern Mediterranean in 1135]]\n\n'''Outremer''', or the '''Crusader states''', were [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[Christian state]]s created by a series of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. In particular the term refers to those states formed by the campaigns between 1096 and 1271 in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] aimed at recovering the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. [[Pope Urban II]] proclaimed the [[First Crusade]] at the [[Council of Clermont]] in 1095. He encouraged military support for the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios{{nbsp}}I]] against the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] Turks and an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. There was an enthusiastic response in [[Western Europe]] across all social strata. This, and later campaigns, established four crusader states in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]]; the [[Principality of Antioch]]; the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; and the [[County of Tripoli]]. These states in the [[Levant]] were the first examples of \"Europe overseas\" and became known to historians by the [[French language|French]] version of the phrase, {{lang|fr|Outremer}}. A crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|fall]] of [[Acre,_Israel|Acre]] in 1291 led to the rapid loss of the last remaining holdings.\n\nThe crusader states were frontier societies with a minority Frankish populations ruling indigenous populations culturally related to the neighbouring communities. The states were politically and legally stratified with the Franks controlling the relationships between self-governing and ethnically-based communities. Society was divided between Frank and non-Frank, not between Christian and Muslim. Few Franks could speak more than basic Arabic, instead relying on indigenous interpreters and headmen. Indigenous  courts administered civil disputes and minor criminality with more serious offences dealt with by the Frankish {{lang|fr|cour des bourgeois}} or courts of the burgesses, the name of the non-noble Franks. There is little evidence of assimilation. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious divisions. Large differences in status and wealth existed between urban and rural dwellers; indigenous Christians were able gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas. Muslim and indigenous Christian populations tended to seperation rather than integration. Greek Orthodox communities proved resilient with many surviving the Arab conquest, rule by the Crusaders and for centuries after the fall of the crusader states. Other indigenous communities included Palestinian Christians, Arabic speaking members of the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]] and [[Maronite Church]], [[Armenians]] as well well as [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Druze]] Muslims. \n\nFew artistic styles originated in the crusader states. One that did was a military architecture that demonstrated a synthesis of the European, Byzantine and Muslim traditions; with the inclusion of oriental design features such as large water reservoirs and the exclusion of occidental features like moats.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=295\u2013296}} Early church design was in the [[French Romanesque architecture|French Romanesque]] style. The 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre retained some of the Byzantine details, but added new arches and chapels in northern French, Aquitanian and Proven\u00e7al styles. In sculpture little trace of an indigenous influence remains. In contrast the visual culture demonstrates the influence of indigenous artists. Decoration of shrines, painting and the production of manuscripts and the adoption of methods from the Byzantine and indigenous artists and iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style. Wall mosaics were unknown in the west but were widespread in the crusader states.\n\n==Background==\n\n{{Further|Spread of Islam|Crusades|Muslim conquests|Great Seljuk Empire|Byzantine\u2013Seljuk wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine wars| Council of Clermont| Reconquista}}\n\nBeginning in the 7th century, following the foundation of the [[Islam|Islamic religion]] by [[Muhammad]], and through the 8th century, Muslim [[Arabs]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] captured [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Iran]], [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|the Levant]] and [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|North Africa]] from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]s, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Iberia]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nIn 750 a bloody coup brought an end to Umayyad rule, leading to the gradual fragmentation of the monolithic Islamic state and the relocation of the political and economic centre of the Islamic world from Palestine to Iran and Iraq.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=18}} By the end of the 11th century the age of Islamic territorial expansion was long gone.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=40}} However, frontier conditions between the Christian and Muslim world remained militant across the Mediterranean area. From the 8th century, in what later became known as the ''[[Reconquista]]'', Christians were campaigning in Spain. In the 11th century [[Normans|Norman]] adventurers led by [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger de Hauteville]], later King Roger I of Sicily, seized [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] from the Muslims.{{sfn|Mayer|1988|pp=17\u201318}} The \"Holy Land\" had been under Arab Muslim control for more than four centuries, with fluctuating levels of tolerance, trade, and political relationships between Muslims and Christians. Catholic pilgrims had access to sacred sites and Christian residents in Muslim territories were given [[dhimmi]] status, legal rights, and legal protection. Indigenous Christians were allowed to maintain churches, and marriages between faiths were not uncommon.{{sfn|Findley|2005|p=73}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christian Byzantine Empire in the early 11th century stretched east to Iran and controlled Bulgaria and much of southern Italy in the west. However, from this point the arrival of new enemies on all frontiers placed intolerable strains on the resources of both the Byzantine Empire and the neighbouring Arab Muslim regimes.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=42\u201346}} The situation was a serious threat to the future of the Byzantine Empire. This made the possibility of western military aid from the Papacy for specific campaigns an attractive prospect to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=27}}\n\nIn 1095 the Byzantine emperor, [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] for the fight with the Seljuk Turks. Later that year, at the Council of Clermont, Pope Urban supported this and exhorted war.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=30}} This prompted a popular outbreak amongst poor Christians, led by the French priest [[Peter the Hermit]], known as the [[People's Crusade]]. Passing through Germany they indulged in wide-ranging anti-Jewish activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in Anatolia they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=41}} They were followed by a feudal army that may have numbered 100,000 including non-combatant that was cautiously welcomed to Byzantium by Alexios late in 1096.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=43\u201348}} He made them promise to return all recovered Byzantine territory{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=50\u201361}} These promises were not kept, for example [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] retained Antioch when it was captured, rather than returning it\nand fought with the Byzantines for a decade until his failure in Italy at the [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)]].{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=72\u201382}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=142\u2013149}}\n\n[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|13th century depiction of the reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem from the [[Old French]] translation of [[William of Tyre|Guillaume de Tyr]]'s ''Histoire d'Outremer''.]]\nAfter the [[First Crusade]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Of the crusader princes only [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] remained, with the aim of establishing his own lordship.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=106}} At this point the [[Franks]], as the western European crusaders were commonly known, held only Jerusalem, [[Antioch]] and [[Edessa]] but not the surrounding country.

Palestinian Christians lived around Jerusalem and in an arc stretching from [[Jericho]] and [[Jordan River|the Jordan]] to [[Hebron]] in the south.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=131}} Comparing archaeological research on Byzantine churches built before the Muslim conquest and Ottoman census records from the 16th{{nbsp}}century demonstrates that some Greek Orthodox communities had disappeared before the crusades but most continued for centuries after the fall of the crusader states. [[Maronites]] were concentrated in Tripoli; Jacobites in Antioch and Edessa. Armenians were concentrated in the north but communities existed in all major towns. Palestine's central areas had a Muslim majority population. The Muslims were mainly Sunnis, but Shi'ite communities existed in [[Galilee]]. The nonconformist Muslim [[Druze]]s were recorded living in the mountains of Tripoli. The Jewish population resided in coastal towns and some Galilean villages.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=131\u2013132}}{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=49,51}}\n\nWith the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|capture of Jerusalem]] and [[Battle of Ascalon|victory at Ascalon]] the majority of the crusaders considered their [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] complete and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=104\u2013106}} The Frankish population of the Kingdom of Jerusalem became concentrated in three major cities. By the 13th{{nbsp}}century the population of Acre probably exceeded 60,000, then came [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], with the capital being the smallest of the three with a population somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=82}} At its zenith, the Latin population of the region reached {{circa|250,000}} with the Kingdom of Jerusalem's population numbering {{circa|120,000}} and the combined total in Tripoli, Antioch and Edessa being broadly comparable.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=396}} The presence of Frankish peasants is evident in 235 villages, out of a total of some 1,200 rural settlements.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=150}}\n\nIn context, Josiah Russell estimates the population of what he calls \"Islamic territory\" as roughly 12.5&nbsp;million in 1000{{mdash}}Anatolia 8 million, Syria 2 million, Egypt 1.5 million and North Africa 1 million {{mdash}} with the European areas that provided crusaders having a population of 23.7 million. He estimates that by 1200 that these figures had risen to 13.7 million in Islamic territory{{mdash}}Anatolia 7 million, Syria 2.7 million, Egypt 2.5 million and North Africa 1.5 million{{mdash}} while the crusaders' home countries population was 35.6&nbsp;million. Russell acknowledges that much of Anatolia was Christian or under the Byzantines and that some purportedly Islamic areas such as Mosul and Baghdad had significant Christian populations.{{sfn|Russell|1985|p=298}}\n\n==Society==\n\n{{lang|fr|Outremer}} was frontier society with a Frankish elite ruling a indigenous population related to the neighbouring communities, many of whom were hostile to the Franks.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=17\u201319}} It was politically and legally stratified, with self-governing, ethnically-based communities. Relations between communities were controlled by the Franks.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=127}} The basic division in society was between Frank and non-Frank, and not between Christian and Muslim. All Franks were considered free men, while the indigenous peoples lived like western [[serfs]]. Conversion to Latin Christianity was their only route to full citizenship. The Franks imposed officials in order to use the military, legal and administrative systems to control the indigenous peoples. Few Franks could speak more than basic Arabic. [[Dragoman]]s{{mdash}}interpreters{{mdash}}and ''[[Rais|ru\u02beas\u0101\u02be]]''{{mdash}}village headmen{{mdash}}were used as mediators. Civil disputes and minor criminality were administered by the courts of the indigenous communities, but more serious offences and cases involving Franks were dealt with by the Frankish {{lang|fr|cour des bourgeois}} or courts of the burgesses, the name given to the non-noble Franks.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=81}} The lack of material evidence makes it difficult to identify the level of assimilation. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious division, although some historians assume that {{lang|fr|Outremer}}'s heterogeneity eroded formal apartheid.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=126\u2013136}} The key differentiator in status and economic position was between urban and rural dwellers. Indigenous Christians could gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas except those in servitude.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=128\u2013130}}\n\nFrankish courts reflected the region's diversity. [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] was part Armenian and married Fulk from Anjou. Their son Amalric, first married a Frank from the Levant, then a Byzantine Greek. William of Tyre was appalled at the use of Jewish, Syrian and Muslim physicians, who were popular among the nobility. Greek and Arabic speaking Christians made Antioch a centre of cultural interchange. The indigenous peoples showed the Frankish nobility traditional deference. Some Franks adopted the their dress, food, housing and military techniques. This does not mean that {{lang|fr|Outremer}} was a cultural melting pot. Inter-communal relations were shallow, separate identities were maintained and other communities were considered alien.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=127,131,136\u2013141}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nIn addition to being economic centres themselves, the crusader states provided an obstacle to Muslim trade by sea with the west and to the land routes from [[Mesopotamia]] and Syria to the great urban economies of the Nile. Despite hostility, commerce continued, coastal cities remained maritime outlets for the Islamic hinterland and eastern wares were exported to Europe in unprecedented volumes. The Byzamtine-Muslim mercantile growth in the 12th{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}13th{{nbsp}}centuries may have occurred anyway, as the Western European economy was booming due to population growth; this increased wealth and created a growing social class demanding city centred products and eastern imports, but it is likely that the Crusades hastened the developments. European fleets were expanded, better ships built, navigation improved and fare paying pilgrims subsidised many voyages. Agricultural production, largely the domain of the indigenous population, flourished before the fall of the First Kingdom in 1187, but was negligible afterwards. Franks, Muslims, Jews and indigenous Christians traded crafts in the [[souks]], teeming oriental bazaars, of the cities.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=382}}  The Italian, Proven\u00e7al and Catalan merchants monopolised shipping, imports, exports, transportation and banking. The Frankish noble and ecclesiastical institutional income was based on income from estates, market tolls and taxation.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=352\u2013354}} The main centres of production were Antioch, Tripoli, Tyre and, less importantly, Beirut. Textiles, glass, dyestuffs, olives, wine, sesame oil and sugar were exported; silk was particularly prized.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=392\u2013393}} The Frankish population, estimated at roughly a quarter of a million people, provided an import market for clothing and finished goods.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=396\u2013397}}\n\n==Coinage==\n\n[[File:crusader coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|350px|Crusader coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Right: gold bezant with Christian symbol (1250s)]]\nThe Franks adopted the more monetised indigenous economic system, using a hybrid coinage: predominantly northern Italian and southern French silver European coins; Frankish variant copper coins minted in Arabic and Byzantine styles; and silver and gold [[dirham]]s and [[dinar]]s. After 1124, Egyptian dinars were copied, creating Jerusalem's gold [[bezant]]. Following the collapse of {{lang|fr|Outremer}} in 1187, trade, rather than agriculture, increasingly dominated the economy and western coins began dominating the coinage in circulation. Although lords in Tyre, Sidon and Beirut minted silver pennies and copper coins there is little evidence of systematic attempts to create a unified currency.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=120\u2013121}}\n\n==Monarchy==\n\nDuring the period of near constant warfare in the early decades of the 12th{{nbsp}}century, the king of Jerusalem's foremost role was leader of the feudal host. They very rarely awarded land or lordships, and those awarded that became vacant\u2014a frequent event due to the high mortality rate in the conflict\u2014reverted to the crown. Instead their followers' loyalty was rewarded with city incomes. As a result, the royal domain of the first five rulers {{mdash}}including much of Judea, Samaria, the coast from Jaffa to Ascalon, the ports of Acre and Tyre, and other scattered castles and territories{{mdash}}was larger that the combined holdings of the nobility. This meant that the rulers of Jerusalem had greater internal power than comparative western monarchs, although they did not have the necessary administrative systems and personnel to govern such a large realm.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n[[File:Principado de Galileen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Map of the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187|alt=Map of the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187]]The situation evolved in the second quarter of the century with the establishment of baronial dynasties. Magnates{{mdash}}such as [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]], Lord of [[Oultrejordain]], and [[Raymond III, Count of Tripoli]], [[Principality of Galilee|Prince of Galilee]]{{mdash}}often acted as autonomous rulers. Royal powers were abrogated and effectively governance was undertaken within the feudatories. What central control remained was exercised at the {{lang|la|[[Haute Cour]]}}{{mdash}}High Court, in English. Only the 13th{{nbsp}}century [[jurists]] of Jerusalem used this term, {{lang|la|[[curia regis]]}} was more common in Europe. These were meetings between the king and his tenants in chief. Over time the duty of the vassal to give counsel developed into a privilege and ultimately the legitimacy of the monarch depended on the agreement of the court.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=112}} The barons of Jerusalem in the 13th{{nbsp}}century have been poorly regarded by both contemporary and modern commentators: James of Vitry was disgusted by their superficial rhetoric; the historian [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] writes of their pedantry and the use of spurious legal justification for political action.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=226}}\n\nIn practice, the High Court consisted of the great barons and the king's direct vassals. In law a quorum was the king and three tenants in chief. The 1162 {{lang|fr|[[assise sur la ligece]]}} theoretically expanded the court's membership to all 600 or more fief-holders, making them all peers. All those who paid homage directly to the king were now members of the {{lang|la|Haute Cour}} of Jerusalem. They were joined by the heads of the military orders by the end of the 12th{{nbsp}}century, and the Italian communes in the 13th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=112\u2013117}} Before the defeat at Hattin in 1187 the laws developed by the court were documented as {{lang|fr|[[assises]]}} in ''Letters of the Holy Sepulchre''.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=122}} The entire body of written law was lost in the subsequent fall of Jerusalem. From this point the legal system was largely based on custom and the memory of the lost legislation. The renowned jurist [[Philip of Novara]] lamented \"We know [the laws] rather poorly, for they are known by hearsay and usage...and we think an assize is something we have seen as an assize...in the kingdom of Jerusalem [the barons] made much better use of the laws and acted on them more surely before the land was lost\". Thus a myth was created of an idyllic early 12th{{nbsp}}century legal system. The barons used this to reinterpret the {{lang|fr|assise sur la ligece}}, which Almalric I intended to strengthen the crown, to instead constrain the monarch, particularly with regards to the right of the monarch to remove feudal fiefs without trial. The concomitant loss of the vast majority of rural fiefs led to the barons becoming an urban mercantile class where knowledge of the law was a valuable, well-regarded skill and a career path to higher status.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=228}}\n\nThe leaders of the [[Third Crusade]] ignored the monarchy of Jerusalem; the kings of England and France agreed on the division of future conquests as if there was no need to take into account the nobility of the crusader states. The historian [[Joshua Prawer]] considered that the weakness of the crown of Jerusalem was demonstrated by the rapid offering of the throne to Conrad of Montferrat in 1190 and then [[Henry II, Count of Champagne]] in 1192.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=107\u2013108}} Emperor Frederick II married [[Isabella II of Jerusalem|Queen Isabella]] in 1225 and immediately claimed the throne of Jerusalem from her father, the King Regent, [[John of Brienne]]. In 1228 Isabella died after giving birth to a son, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], who through his mother was now legally king of Jerusalem and Frederick's heir.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=563\u2013571}} From 1229 when Frederick II left the Holy Land to defend his Italian and German lands, monarchs were absent{{mdash}}Conrad from 1225 until 1254, his son [[Conradin]] until his execution by Charles of Anjou in 1268. Government in Jerusalem had developed in the opposite direction to monarchies in the west. St Louis, Emperor Frederick and Kind Edward I\u2014contemporary rulers of France, Germany and England respectively\u2014 were powerful, with centralised bureaucracies. Jerusalem had a royalty without power.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|p=104}} Magnates such as the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]] attempted to seize the regency, fighting for control with an Italian army led by Frederick's viceroy [[Richard Filangieri]] in the [[War of the Lombards]]. Tyre, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] supported Filangieri. In opposition were the Ibelins, Acre, the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and Genoa. The rebels established a surragate commune, or parliament, for twelve years in Acre.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=229}} They prevailed in 1242 with the capture of Tyre and a succession of Ibelin and Cypriot regents followed.{{sfn|Tyerman |2019|p=268}} Centralised government collapsed while the nobility, military orders and Italian communes took the lead. Three Cypriot [[House of Lusignan|Lusignan]] kings succeeded without the financial or military resources to recover the lost territory. The title of king was even sold to Charles of Anjou, but although he gained power for a short while, he never visited the kingdom. The king of Cyprus fought at Acre until all hope was lost and then returned to his island realm.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=108\u2013109}} Cyprus survived the fall of the mainland crusader states and [[Peter I of Cyprus]] launched the [[Alexandrian Crusade|last crusade against Egypt]] that temporarily captured Alexandria in 1365.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=392}}\n\n==Religion==\n\nPartly a result of anti-Orthodox sentiment the early crusaders filled ecclesiastical positions in the Orthodox church left vacant with Franks, including the patriarchy of Jerusalem when [[Simeon II of Jerusalem|Simeon II]] died. The Greek Orthodox Church was considered part of the universal Church, which enabled the replacement of Orthodox bishops by Latin clerics in coastal towns. The first Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, [[Arnulf of Chocques]], ejected the Greek Orthodox monks from the Holy Sepulchre but relented when the miracle of Easter Fire failed in their absence. The appointment of Latin bishops had little effect on the Arabic-speaking Orthodox Christians because the previous bishops were also foreign, from the Byzantine Empire. The Latin bishops used Greeks as [[coadjutor bishop]]s to administer Syrians and Greeks left without higher clergy. In many villages Latin and Orthodox Christions shared a church. In exceptional political circumstances, Greeks replaced Latin patriarchs in Antioch. Orthodox monasteries were rebuilt and Orthodox monastic life revived.  This toleration continued despite an increasingly interventionist papal reaction demonstrated by [[Jacques de Vitry]], [[Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre|Bishop of Acre]]. The Armenians, Copts, Jacobites, Nestorians and Maronites had greater autonomy. As they were not in communion with Rome they could retain their own bishops without a conflict of authority. Around 1181 [[Aimery of Limoges]], Patriarch of Antioch, managed to bring the Maronites into communion with Rome, establishing a precedent for the [[Eastern Catholic Churches#Uniate|Uniate Churches]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=134\u2013143}}\n\nThat religion prevented assimilation is evidenced by the Franks' discriminatory laws against Jews and Muslims. They were banned from living in Jerusalem and sexual relations between Muslims and Christians were punished by mutilation. Some mosques were converted into Christian churches, but the Franks did not force Muslims to convert to Christianity. Frankish lords were particularly reluctant, because conversion would have ended the Muslim peasants' servile status. The Muslims were permitted to pray in public and their [[hajj|pilgrimages to Mecca]] continued.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=127\u2013129}} The [[Samaritans]]' annual Passover festival attracted visitors from beyond the kingdom's borders.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n==Communes==\n\nLargely located in the ports of Acre, Tyre, Tripoli and Sidon, [[commune]]s of Italians, Proven\u00e7als and Catalans had distinct cultural characteristics and exerted significant political power. Separate from the Frankish nobles or burgesses, the communes were autonomous political entities closely linked to their towns of origin. This gave them the ability to monopolise foreign trade and almost all banking and shipping in {{lang|fr|Outremer}}. Their parent cities' naval support was essential for the crusader states. Every opportunity to extend trade privileges was taken. One example saw the Venetians receiving one-third of Tyre and its territories, and exemption from all taxes, after Venice participated in the successful [[Siege of Tyre (1124)|1124 siege of the city]]. Despite all efforts, the Syrian and Palestinian ports were unable to replace Alexandria and Constantinople as the primary centres of commerce in the region. Instead, the communes competed with the monarchs and each other to maintain economic advantage. Power derived from the support of the communards' home cities rather than their number, which never reached more than hundreds. Thus, by the middle of the 13th{{nbsp}}century, the rulers of the communes were barely required to recognise the authority of the crusaders and divided Acre into several fortified miniature republics.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=85\u201393}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n==Military orders==\n{{Main|Military order (religious society)}}\n[[Image:Baldwin II ceeding the Temple of Salomon to Ugo dei Pagani and Gaudefroy de Saint-Homer.jpg|thumb|13th-century miniature of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] granting the captured [[Al Aqsa Mosque]] to [[Hugues de Payens]]|alt=13th-century miniature of King Baldwin II granting the captured Al Aqsa Mosque to Hugues de Payens]]\nThe crusaders' propensity to follow the customs of their Western European homelands meant that there were very few innovations developed from the culture in the crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this were the military orders, warfare and fortifications.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=252}} The Knights Hospitaller, formally the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to their ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=169}} In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclesiastical sphere.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=253}}\n\nMilitary orders like the Knights Hospitaller and Knights Templar provided Latin Christendom's first professional armies in support of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other crusader states. The Templars, formally the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon, and their [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Temple of Solomon]] were founded around 1119 by a small band of knights who dedicated themselves to protecting pilgrims en{{nbsp}}route to Jerusalem.{{sfn| Asbridge|2012| p= 168}} The Hospitallers and the Templars became supranational organisations as papal support led to rich donations of land and revenue across Europe. This, in turn, led to a steady flow of new recruits and the wealth to maintain multiple fortifications in the crusader states. In time, they developed into autonomous powers in the region.{{sfn| Asbridge|2012|pp=169\u2013170}} After the fall of Acre the Hospitallers first relocated to Cyprus, then conquered and ruled [[Rhodes]] (1309\u20131522) and Malta (1530\u20131798), and [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|continue in existence to the present-day]]. King [[Philip IV of France]] probably had financial and political reasons to oppose the Knights Templar, which led to him exerting pressure on [[Pope Clement V]]. The pope responded in 1312, with a series of papal bulls including ''[[Vox in Excelso]]'' and ''[[Ad Providam]]'' that dissolved the order on the alleged and probably false grounds of sodomy, magic and heresy.{{sfn|Davies|1997|p=359}}\n\n==Art and architecture==\n{{Further|Art of the crusades|List of Crusader castles}}\n\n[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|12th-century [[Knights Hospitaller]] castle of [[Krak des Chevaliers]] in Syria, one of the first castles to use concentric fortification, i.e. concentric rings of defence that could all operate at the same time. It has two curtain walls and sits on a promontory.|alt=photograph of 12th-century Hospitaller castle of Krak des Chevaliers in Syria showing concentric rings of defence, curtain walls and location sitting on a promontory.]]According to Joshua Prawer no major European poet, theologian, scholar or historian settled in the crusader states. Some went on pilgrimage, and this is reflected in new imagery and ideas in western poetry. Although they did not migrate east themselves, their output often encouraged others to journey on pilgrimage to the east.{{sfn| Prawer|1972| p=468}}\n\nHistorians consider military architecture{{mdash}}demonstrating a synthesis of the European, Byzantine and Muslim traditions{{mdash}}the most original and impressive artistic achievement of the crusades. Castles were a tangible symbol of the dominance of a Latin Christian minority over a largely hostile majority population. They also acted as centres of administration.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=280\u2013281}} Modern historiography rejects the 19th-century consensus that Westerners learnt the basis of military architecture from the Near East, as Europe had already experienced rapid growth in defensive technology before the First Crusade. Direct contact with Arab fortifications originally constructed by the Byzantines did influence developments in the east. But the lack of documentary evidence means that it remains difficult to differentiate between the importance of this design culture and the constraints of situation, which led to the inclusion of oriental design features such as large water reservoirs and the exclusion of occidental features like moats.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nTypically, early church design was in the [[French Romanesque architecture|French Romanesque]] style. This can be seen in the 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre. It retained some of the earlier Byzantine details, but new arches and chapels were built to northern French, Aquitanian and Proven\u00e7al patterns. There is little trace of any surviving indigenous influence in sculpture, although in the Holy Sepulchre the [[Capital (architecture)|column capitals]] of the south facade follow classical Syrian patterns.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=146}}\n\nIn contrast to architecture and sculpture, it is in the area of visual culture that the assimilated nature of the society was demonstrated. Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries the influence of indigenous artists was demonstrated in the decoration of shrines, painting and the production of manuscripts. In addition, Frankish practitioners borrowed methods from the Byzantines and indigenous artists and iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style leading to a cultural synthesis illustrated by the [[Church of the Nativity]]. Wall mosaics were unknown in the west but in widespread use in the crusader states. Whether this was by indigenous craftsmen or learnt by Frankish ones is unknown, but a distinctive and original artistic style evolved.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nManuscripts were produced and illustrated in workshops housing Italian, French, English and indigenous craftsmen leading to a cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques. An example of this is the [[Melisende Psalter]], created by several hands in a workshop attached to the Holy Sepulchre. This style could have either reflected or influenced the taste of patrons of the arts. But what is seen is an increase in stylised Byzantine-influenced content. This even extended to the production of [[icons]], unknown at the time to the Franks, sometimes in a Frankish style and even of western saints. This is seen as the origin of Italian panel painting.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=147\u2013149}} While it is difficult to track illumination of manuscripts and castle design back to their sources, textual sources are simpler. The translations made in Antioch are notable, but they are considered of secondary importance to the works emanating from Muslim Spain and from the hybrid culture of Sicily.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=667\u2013668}}\n\n==Military==\n\nReports from John of Ibelin indicate that around 1170 the military force of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was based on a feudal host of about 647 to 675 heavily armoured knights. Each [[feudatory]] would also provide his own armed retainers. Non-noble light cavalry and infantry were known as ''serjants''. The prelates and the towns were to provide 5,025 ''serjants'' to the royal army, according to Ibelin's list. This force would be augmented by hired soldiery called [[Turcopoles]]. In times of emergency, the king could also call upon a general muster of the whole Christian population.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=134}}\n\nJoshua Prawer estimated that the military orders could match the king's fighting strength. This means the total military of the kingdom was approximately 1,200 knights and 10,000 ''serjants''. Enough for further territorial gains, but fewer than required to maintain military domination. This was also a problem defensively. Putting a major army into the field required draining castles and cities of able-bodied fighting men. In the case of a defeat, such as the [[Battle of Hattin]], there remained few to resist the invaders. Muslim armies were incohesive and seldom campaigned outside the period between sowing and harvest. As a result, the crusaders adopted delaying tactics when faced with a superior invading Muslim force. They would avoid direct confrontation, instead retreating to strongholds and waiting for the Muslim army to disperse. It took generations before the Muslims recognised that they could not conquer {{lang|fr|Outremer}} without destroying the Franks' fortresses. This strategic change forced the crusaders away from the tactic of gaining and holding territory, including Jerusalem. Instead their aim became to attack and destroy Egypt. By removing this constant regional challenge, the crusaders hoped to gain the necessary time to improve the kingdom's demographic weakness. Egypt was isolated from the other Islamic power centres, it would be easier to defend and was self-sufficient in food.{{sfn|Prawer|1972|pp=327\u2013333, 340\u2013341}} \n\nLittle was achieved by a [[Fifth Crusade]], primarily raised from Hungary, Germany, Flanders and led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. The crusaders attacked Egypt to break the Muslim hold on Jerusalem. Damietta was [[Siege of Damietta (1218\u20131219)|captured]] but then returned and an eight-year truce agreed after the Franks advancing into Egypt surrendered.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=214\u2013218,236}} In 1249 [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] led a [[Seventh Crusade|crusade]] attacking Egypt, was defeated at the [[Battle of Al Mansurah]] and the crusaders were captured [[Battle of Fariskur|as they retreated]]. Louis and his nobles were ransomed, other prisoners were given a choice of conversion to Islam or beheading. A ten-year truce was established and Louis remained in Syria until 1254 consolidating the Frankish position.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=583\u2013607,615\u2013620}}{{sfn|Tyerman |2019|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n==Language==\n\nThe Franks ruled as an elite and outnumbered class. As such, linguistic differences remained a key differentiator between the Franks lords and the local population. The Franks typically spoke [[Old French]] and wrote in [[Latin]]. While some learnt [[Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Hebrew]] this was unusual.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=177}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nRiley-Smith descibed the Latin [[kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the period between 1099 and 1187 as the first experiment in a \"Europe Overseas\". The raising, transportation, and supply of large armies led to flourishing [[Trade route|trade]] between Europe and the crusader states. The Italian city-states of Genoa and Venice flourished, through profitable trading communes.{{sfn|Housley|2006|pp=152\u2013154}}{{sfn|Davies|1997|pp=359\u2013360}} Many historians argue that the interaction between the western Christian and Islamic cultures played a significant, ultimately positive, part in the development of European civilisation and the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=96}} Relations between Europeans and the Islamic world, stretching across the length of the Mediterranean Sea, led to an improved perception of Islamic culture in the West. But this broad area of interaction also makes it difficult for historians to identify how much of this cultural cross-fertilisation originated in the crusader states and how much originated in Sicily and Spain.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=667\u2013668}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012 |publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=[[Europe: A History]]|last=Davies|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Davies|year=1997|publisher=[[Random House|Pimlico]]|isbn=978-0-7126-6633-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Findley| first=Carter Vaughan|year=2005|title=The Turks in World History|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-516770-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Housley|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Housley|title=Contesting the Crusades|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-1189-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Hans Eberhard|title=The Crusades|edition=&nbsp; Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-19-873097-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nicholson|first=Helen|title=The Crusades|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-313-32685-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/crusades00nich}}\n* {{cite book|last=Prawer|first=Joshua|authorlink=Joshua Prawer|title=The Crusaders' Kingdom|publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix Press]]|year=1972|isbn=978-1-84212-224-2|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AMxmAAAAMAAJ&q|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Russell|first=Josiah C.|chapter=The Population of the Crusader States|pages=295\u2013314|editor-last1=Zacour|editor-first1=Norman P.|editor-last2=Hazard| editor-first2=Harry W.|title=A History of the Crusades|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tgfMNfBIgSwC|volume=5 The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East|year=1985|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-09140-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|title=God's War: A New History of the Crusades|publisher=Belknap Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-674-02387-1|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|title=The World of the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIOVDwAAQBAJ|year=2019|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-21739-1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Andrew D Buck, \"[[doi:10.1093/ehr/ceaa008|Settlement, Identity, and Memory in the Latin East: An Examination of the Term \u2018Crusader States\u2019.]]\" ''The English Historical Review''\n* [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], ''The Feudal Nobility and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, 1174\u20131277''.

Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in [[Census in Egypt|Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.<ref>Kuhrt, A. (1995). ''The Ancient Near East, c. 3000\u2013330 BCE''. Vol. 2. London: Routledge. p. 695.</ref> Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations.\n\nAnother critical factor for such an estimate is the question of pre-modern [[infant mortality]] rates; these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times due to a lack of accurate records. Haub (1995) estimates that around 40% of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday. Haub also stated that \"[[life expectancy at birth]] probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history\",<ref name=Haub1995/> which is not to be mistaken for the life expectancy after reaching adulthood. The latter equally depended on period, location and social standing, but [[Life expectancy#Variation over time|calculations]] identify averages from roughly 30 years upward.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Demographics of the world]]\n* [[Anthropocene]]\n* [[Birth control]]\n* [[Coastal development hazards#Coastal population growth and development on coasts|Coastal population growth]]\n* [[Demographic transition]]\n* [[Depopulation]]\n* [[Doomsday argument]]\n* [[Family planning]]\n* [[Food security]]\n* [[Megacity]]\n* [[Natalism]]\n* [[One-child policy]]\n* [[Population boom]]\n* [[Population Matters]], charity encouraging smaller families\n* [[Population Reference Bureau]], population demographics and annual World Population Data Sheet\n* [[Two-child policy]]\n* [[World's largest cities]]\n\n'''Lists:'''\n* [[List of countries and dependencies by population]]\n* [[List of urban areas by population]]\n* [[List of population concern organizations]]\n* [[List of countries by fertility rate]]\n* [[List of countries by past and future population]]\n* [[List of countries by population in 1900]]\n* [[List of countries by population density]]\n* [[List of countries by population growth rate]]\n* [[Lists of organisms by population]] \u2013 for non-human global populations\n* [[List of religious populations]]\n\n'''Historical:'''\n* [[Census#Historical examples|Historical censuses]]\n* [[Historical demography]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"note\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Joel E. |title=How Many People Can The Earth Support? |location=New York |publisher=W.

Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in [[Census in Egypt|Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.<ref>Kuhrt, A. (1995). ''The Ancient Near East, c. 3000\u2013330 BCE''. Vol. 2. London: Routledge. p. 695.</ref> Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations.\n\nAnother critical factor for such an estimate is the question of pre-modern [[infant mortality]] rates; these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times due to a lack of accurate records. Haub (1995) estimates that around 40% of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday. Haub also stated that \"[[life expectancy at birth]] probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history\",<ref name=Haub1995/> which is not to be mistaken for the life expectancy after reaching adulthood. The latter equally depended on period, location and social standing, but [[Life expectancy#Variation over time|calculations]] identify averages from roughly 30 years upward.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Demographics of the world]]\n* [[Anthropocene]]\n* [[Birth control]]\n* [[Coastal development hazards#Coastal population growth and development on coasts|Coastal population growth]]\n* [[Demographic transition]]\n* [[Depopulation]]\n* [[Doomsday argument]]\n* [[Family planning]]\n* [[Food security]]\n* [[Megacity]]\n* [[Natalism]]\n* [[One-child policy]]\n* [[Population boom]]\n* [[Population Matters]], charity encouraging smaller families\n* [[Population Reference Bureau]], population demographics and annual World Population Data Sheet\n* [[Two-child policy]]\n* [[World's largest cities]]\n\n'''Lists:'''\n* [[List of countries and dependencies by population]]\n* [[List of urban areas by population]]\n* [[List of population concern organizations]]\n* [[List of countries by fertility rate]]\n* [[List of countries by past and future population]]\n* [[List of countries by population in 1900]]\n* [[List of countries by population density]]\n* [[List of countries by population growth rate]]\n* [[Lists of organisms by population]] \u2013 for non-human global populations\n* [[List of religious populations]]\n\n'''Historical:'''\n* [[Census#Historical examples|Historical censuses]]\n* [[Historical demography]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"note\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Joel E. |title=How Many People Can The Earth Support? |location=New York |publisher=W.

The series revolves around Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), an immature but talented [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detective in [[Brooklyn]]'s fictional 99th Precinct, who often comes into conflict with his new commanding officer, the serious and stern Captain Raymond Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]). The rest of the cast features [[Stephanie Beatriz]] as Rosa Diaz, [[Terry Crews]] as Terry Jeffords, [[Melissa Fumero]] as Amy Santiago, [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Charles Boyle, [[Chelsea Peretti]] as Gina Linetti, [[Dirk Blocker]] as Michael Hitchcock, and [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Norm Scully.\n\nProduced as a [[single-camera]] comedy, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] originally ordered 13 episodes for its first season, eventually expanding it to 22 episodes. ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine'' premiered on September 17, 2013. On May 10, 2018, Fox canceled the series after five seasons. The following day, [[NBC]] picked up the series for a sixth season; it premiered on NBC on January 10, 2019. On February 27, NBC renewed the series for a seventh season, which premiered on February 6, 2020. The series was renewed for an eighth season in November 2019, ahead of the premiere of its seventh season.\n\nThe series has been acclaimed by critics for its cast, especially Samberg, Beatriz, Fumero, and Braugher. It has won two [[Creative Arts Emmy Awards]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy]]. Samberg has won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy]], while Braugher has been nominated for three consecutive [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] and has won two [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. The series has also received particular praise for its portrayal of serious issues whilst retaining a sense of humor. For its portrayal of [[LGBTQ+]] people, the series won a [[GLAAD Media Award]] for Outstanding Comedy Series. <!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the fictional 99th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]] in [[Brooklyn]], ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine'' follows a team of detectives headed by the overly serious, newly appointed Captain Raymond Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]). The detectives include Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), who has a high rate of successful arrests and solved cases, in spite of his relaxed, carefree and (at times) childish attitude. He eventually falls for his stern, nerdy, by-the-book but loveable partner, Amy Santiago ([[Melissa Fumero]]). The hard-working but timid Charles Boyle ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]) is partnered with the apathetic, aggressive and stern, Rosa Diaz ([[Stephanie Beatriz]]). The pair of older Detectives, Michael Hitchcock ([[Dirk Blocker]]) and Norm Scully ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) often seem incompetent, stupid and lazy, but have solved more cases over the years simply because they have been on the job much longer. \n\nThe detectives report to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords ([[Terry Crews]]), a gentle giant and devoted family man who initially has a phobia of going back to active field police work for fear of being killed in the line of duty and leaving his children fatherless. The precinct also includes sarcastic and dominating civilian administrator Gina Linetti ([[Chelsea Peretti]]), who dislikes her job, prioritizes her social media, and believes that dancing is her life goal.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters}}\n<!-- Do not replace this with a table.

The series revolves around Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), an immature but talented [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detective in [[Brooklyn]]'s fictional 99th Precinct, who often comes into conflict with his new commanding officer, the serious and stern Captain Raymond Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]). The rest of the cast features [[Stephanie Beatriz]] as Rosa Diaz, [[Terry Crews]] as Terry Jeffords, [[Melissa Fumero]] as Amy Santiago, [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Charles Boyle, [[Chelsea Peretti]] as Gina Linetti, [[Dirk Blocker]] as Michael Hitchcock, and [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Norm Scully.\n\nProduced as a [[single-camera]] comedy, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] originally ordered 13 episodes for its first season, eventually expanding it to 22 episodes. ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine'' premiered on September 17, 2013. On May 10, 2018, Fox canceled the series after five seasons. The following day, [[NBC]] picked up the series for a sixth season; it premiered on NBC on January 10, 2019. On February 27, NBC renewed the series for a seventh season, which premiered on February 6, 2020.

The detectives include Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), who has a high rate of successful arrests and solved cases, in spite of his relaxed, carefree and (at times) childish attitude. He eventually falls for his stern, nerdy, by-the-book but loveable partner, Amy Santiago ([[Melissa Fumero]]). The hard-working but timid Charles Boyle ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]) is partnered with the apathetic, aggressive and stern, Rosa Diaz ([[Stephanie Beatriz]]). The pair of older Detectives, Michael Hitchcock ([[Dirk Blocker]]) and Norm Scully ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) often seem incompetent, stupid and lazy, but have solved more cases over the years simply because they have been on the job much longer. \n\nThe detectives report to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords ([[Terry Crews]]), a gentle giant and devoted family man who initially has a phobia of going back to active field police work for fear of being killed in the line of duty and leaving his children fatherless. The precinct also includes sarcastic and dominating civilian administrator Gina Linetti ([[Chelsea Peretti]]), who dislikes her job, prioritizes her social media, and believes that dancing is her life goal.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters}}\n<!-- Do not replace this with a table.
