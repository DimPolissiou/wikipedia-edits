Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. My first question for you sir is, who do you believe? My second question is would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin, would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you want him to never do it again?\n\nTRUMP: So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why haven't they taken the server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee?\n\nI've been wondering that. I've been asking that for months and months and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying?\n\nWith that being said, all I can do is ask the question.\n\nMy people came to me, [[Dan Coats]], came to me and some others they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia.\n\nI will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server but I have, I have confidence in both parties.\n\n[...]\n\nI have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today and what he did is an incredible offer.\n\nHe offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators, with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer. Ok? Thank you.<ref name=NPR_transcript/></blockquote>\n\nDuring the press conference, [[Jeff Mason (journalist)|Jeff Mason]] from [[Reuters]] asked whether Putin had wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 presidential election and had he directed any of his officials to help him do that? Putin replied: \"Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\" This contradicted a tweet sent by Trump in which he claimed: \"I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. They definitely don't want Trump!\" All reference to that exchange between Mr Mason and the Russian leader was omitted from the official White House transcript.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/trump-putin-press-conference-transcript/565385/|title=The White House Transcript Is Missing the Most Explosive Part of the Trump\u2013Putin Press Conference|last=Friedman|first=Uri|date=July 17, 2018|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=18 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718000505/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/trump-putin-press-conference-transcript/565385/|archive-date=18 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44959300|title=From 'alternative facts' to rewriting history|last=Sopel|first=Jon|date=2018-07-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726012522/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44959300|archive-date=2018-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAsked whether Russia possessed any compromising material on Trump, Putin laughed and talked about the number of businessmen who visit Russia, but did not give a direct answer.

Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. My first question for you sir is, who do you believe? My second question is would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin, would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you want him to never do it again?\n\nTRUMP: So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why haven't they taken the server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee?\n\nI've been wondering that. I've been asking that for months and months and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying?\n\nWith that being said, all I can do is ask the question.\n\nMy people came to me, [[Dan Coats]], came to me and some others they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia.\n\nI will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server but I have, I have confidence in both parties.\n\n[...]\n\nI have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today and what he did is an incredible offer.\n\nHe offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators, with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer. Ok? Thank you.<ref name=NPR_transcript/></blockquote>\n\nDuring the press conference, [[Jeff Mason (journalist)|Jeff Mason]] from [[Reuters]] asked whether Putin had wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 presidential election and had he directed any of his officials to help him do that? Putin replied: \"Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal.\" This contradicted a tweet sent by Trump in which he claimed: \"I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].
