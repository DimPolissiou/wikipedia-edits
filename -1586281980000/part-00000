He went on to become literate in the language, although he did not achieve a perfect grasp of Spanish grammar.{{ref label|id ref2a|note|Note}}<ref name=tx/> He described himself as \"eighty years of age\" in his 1615 manuscript, leading many to deduce that he was born in the year 1535, after the 1533 Spanish conquest of Peru. It seems that he used the figure \"80\" as a metaphor for old age, however, and many other references in his text indicate a possible birthdate of 1550 or shortly thereafter.\n\nThe information known about Guam\u00e1n Poma's life comes from a variety of written sources. Most likely he was born in the Lucanas province and spent most of his life in or near Huamanga, a central Peruvian district. It is believed that the first time he left his hometown was when he served as an interpreter on the church inspection tour of a Spanish priest named Crist\u00f3bal de Albornoz, who was attempting to eliminate idolatries in the small Quechua towns. In the late 1580s to early 1590s, he was an assistant to Fray Martin de Mur\u00faa, another Spanish cleric. In 1594 he was employed by the Spanish judge of Huamanga who was in charge of land titles. In late 1600, however, all of his property was confiscated and he was banished from Huamanga, an event that led to his travels throughout the country and most likely to the composition of his masterpiece.\n\nBased on a published work, in 1967, by archaeologist Edward P. Lanning, \"Peru before the Incas\", one of the first references to an organized culture around the Huaman Culture, was between 1000\u20131476 CE, known as the \"Late Intermediate\", before the Inca Empire expanded, forming alliances with the most powerful empires.\n\nThe Huaman Family, per stirpes,{{explain|date=December 2017}} belonged to the wealthy among the Inca Empire, before and after. As it used to be common, the marriages among the ruling families took place, to remain in control and current. At the time, the Huaman (or Waman, in Quechua; or Guaman after the Spanish conquest) were a selected family of warriors, and land owners in several regions of the pre-Inca empire. They venerated the wild bird (similar to a Falcon), that only grows in the Andean Region of Peru, above 4,000 meters above sea level.\n\nThere can be found, among the Inca's family tree lines: a) Tarco Huaman Inca, son of Inca Mayta Capac, cousin of Capac Yupanqui, and grandson of Lloque Yupanqui. b) Huaman Achachi, brother of Tupac Inca Yupanqui. c) Inca Huaman Taysi, son of Inca Rocca. d) Landowner Don Antonio Huaman Cucho, in Huamanga City, in 1570 declares ownership of several cities for the descendant of the Huaman Family as an Inca descendant.\n\nDuring the occupation of the conquerors, the Huaman family, being very extensive, were fiercely prosecuted, fearing the overtake of the Andean government, the impeachment of the Hispanic occupation and land ownership claims. Reasons for which most of wealth in pure gold, and ornaments were hidden and re-distributed among the descendants. Most family members moved to different areas from Peru and Ecuador. The most prominent landowners were located in Pariamarca, Santiago de Huaman, Quito and Huamanga.\n\nThere is a tale that says that direct descendants from the ruling Inca Huaman, are protected and secretly maintained as of \"ready\" to overtake the Peruvian empire and re-impose the supremacy of order over chaos. There are tales among the Andeans that one day the \"...Hawk will fly high, where the Sun surrenders...\"\n<ref name=tx/>\n\n== Chronicles ==\n[[File:POMA1105.jpg|thumb|300px|The author on his way to Lima (NC, p.&nbsp;1105).

And he leaves with no money, poorly dressed for walking in winter...''\" His dogs are identified in the drawing as \"Amigo\", ''friend'', and \"Lautaro.\"]]\nA handful of sixteenth-century documents attest that Guaman Poma served in the 1560s\u201370s as a Quechua translator for Fray Crist\u00f3bal de Albornoz<ref name=tx/> in his campaign to eradicate the messianic apostasy, known as ''[[Taki Unquy]]'', from the Christian doctrine of local believers.\n\nGuaman Poma appeared as a plaintiff in a series of lawsuits from the late 1590s, in which he attempted to recover land and political title in the Chupas valley that he believed to be his by family right. These suits ultimately proved disastrous for him; not only did he lose the suits, but in 1600 he was stripped of all his property and forced into exile from the towns which he had once ruled as a noble.\n\nGuaman Poma's great work was the ''[[Primer Nueva Cor\u00f3nica y Buen Gobierno|El primer nueva cor\u00f3nica [sic] y buen gobierno]]'' (''The First New Chronicle and Good Government''), a 1,189-page document written largely in Spanish, with sections in Quechua.<ref name=tx/> He wrote ''Cor\u00f3nica'' instead of ''Cr\u00f3nica'', a form of the word common in the Middle Ages.

He went on to become literate in the language, although he did not achieve a perfect grasp of Spanish grammar.{{ref label|id ref2a|note|Note}}<ref name=tx/> He described himself as \"eighty years of age\" in his 1615 manuscript, leading many to deduce that he was born in the year 1535, after the 1533 Spanish conquest of Peru. It seems that he used the figure \"80\" as a metaphor for old age, however, and many other references in his text indicate a possible birthdate of 1550 or shortly thereafter.\n\nThe information known about Guam\u00e1n Poma's life comes from a variety of written sources. Most likely he was born in the Lucanas province and spent most of his life in or near Huamanga, a central Peruvian district. It is believed that the first time he left his hometown was when he served as an interpreter on the church inspection tour of a Spanish priest named Crist\u00f3bal de Albornoz, who was attempting to eliminate idolatries in the small Quechua towns. In the late 1580s to early 1590s, he was an assistant to Fray Martin de Mur\u00faa, another Spanish cleric. In 1594 he was employed by the Spanish judge of Huamanga who was in charge of land titles. In late 1600, however, all of his property was confiscated and he was banished from Huamanga, an event that led to his travels throughout the country and most likely to the composition of his masterpiece.\n\nBased on a published work, in 1967, by archaeologist Edward P. Lanning, \"Peru before the Incas\", one of the first references to an organized culture around the Huaman Culture, was between 1000\u20131476 CE, known as the \"Late Intermediate\", before the Inca Empire expanded, forming alliances with the most powerful empires.\n\nThe Huaman Family, per stirpes,{{explain|date=December 2017}} belonged to the wealthy among the Inca Empire, before and after. As it used to be common, the marriages among the ruling families took place, to remain in control and current. At the time, the Huaman (or Waman, in Quechua; or Guaman after the Spanish conquest) were a selected family of warriors, and land owners in several regions of the pre-Inca empire. They venerated the wild bird (similar to a Falcon), that only grows in the Andean Region of Peru, above 4,000 meters above sea level.\n\nThere can be found, among the Inca's family tree lines: a) Tarco Huaman Inca, son of Inca Mayta Capac, cousin of Capac Yupanqui, and grandson of Lloque Yupanqui. b) Huaman Achachi, brother of Tupac Inca Yupanqui. c) Inca Huaman Taysi, son of Inca Rocca. d) Landowner Don Antonio Huaman Cucho, in Huamanga City, in 1570 declares ownership of several cities for the descendant of the Huaman Family as an Inca descendant.\n\nDuring the occupation of the conquerors, the Huaman family, being very extensive, were fiercely prosecuted, fearing the overtake of the Andean government, the impeachment of the Hispanic occupation and land ownership claims. Reasons for which most of wealth in pure gold, and ornaments were hidden and re-distributed among the descendants. Most family members moved to different areas from Peru and Ecuador. The most prominent landowners were located in Pariamarca, Santiago de Huaman, Quito and Huamanga.\n\nThere is a tale that says that direct descendants from the ruling Inca Huaman, are protected and secretly maintained as of \"ready\" to overtake the Peruvian empire and re-impose the supremacy of order over chaos. There are tales among the Andeans that one day the \"...Hawk will fly high, where the Sun surrenders...\"\n<ref name=tx/>\n\n== Chronicles ==\n[[File:POMA1105.jpg|thumb|300px|The author on his way to Lima (NC, p.&nbsp;1105).

These suits ultimately proved disastrous for him; not only did he lose the suits, but in 1600 he was stripped of all his property and forced into exile from the towns which he had once ruled as a noble.\n\nGuaman Poma's great work was the ''[[Primer Nueva Cor\u00f3nica y Buen Gobierno|El primer nueva cor\u00f3nica [sic] y buen gobierno]]'' (''The First New Chronicle and Good Government''), a 1,189-page document written largely in Spanish, with sections in Quechua.<ref name=tx/> He wrote ''Cor\u00f3nica'' instead of ''Cr\u00f3nica'', a form of the word common in the Middle Ages.

This freeway portion runs for about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} into the town of [[Middlefield, Connecticut|Middlefield]], where it becomes a four lane surface road.  In Middlefield, it has junctions with the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 147|Route 147]], and the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 217|Route 217]].  It then enters Middletown and becomes Washington Street, where it has junctions with the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 157|Route 157]] and the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 3|Route 3]] before passing by [[Wesleyan University]] and entering the downtown area. Route 66 then turns onto Main Street, as Washington Street becomes SR 545, providing southbound access to the [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]] freeway.  At the north end of Main Street, it intersects [[Connecticut Route 17|Route 17]].  Southbound Route 17 provides access to both directions of Route 9, while northbound Route 17 joins Route 66 to cross the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Arrigoni Bridge]] into [[Portland, Connecticut|Portland]].  Immediately east of the bridge, it meets the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 17A|Route 17A]], which leads to Portland center.  After Route 17 leaves to the north, Route 66 narrows to 2 lanes and follows the east shore of the Connecticut River into [[East Hampton, Connecticut|East Hampton.]] It passes the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 151|Route 151]], and bends northeast as it intersects the western end of [[Connecticut Route 16|Route 16]].  In the center of town, it meets the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 196|Route 196]], then crosses into [[Marlborough, Connecticut|Marlborough]].  Here, it has a junction with the [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]] freeway at Exit 13.  It then passes into [[Hebron, Connecticut]], where it has junctions with Routes [[Connecticut Route 85|85]] and [[Connecticut Route 316|316]] in the center of town.  It then enters [[Columbia, Connecticut|Columbia]], intersecting [[Connecticut Route 87|Route 87]] before reaching a junction with [[US Route 6|US 6]] at the western end of the Willimantic bypass.  Route 66 turns east as a collector of local traffic headed for [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]].  In Willimantic, it has a 0.74 mile concurrency with [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]], and intersects the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 195|Route 195]], and the western end of [[Connecticut Route 14|Route 14]].  It then turns north-northeastward and continues to US 6 at the east end of the Willimantic bypass, where Route 66 ends and US 6 assumes the roadway.<ref name=ctlog/>\n\nFrom US 6 in Columbia to the end in Windham, Route 66 is designated the [[Grand Army of the Republic Highway]].<ref name=ctlog/> The easternmost {{convert|1.5|mi}} of the route is named [[Boston Post Road]] and was part of the former [[post road|mail route]].\n\n== History ==\nThe entire length of modern Route 66 was originally improved in the 19th century as various private [[Toll road|turnpikes]]. The road from Meriden to Middletown was the '''Middletown and Meriden Turnpike''' chartered in 1809 and used the former surface alignment of Route 66 in Meriden (East Main Street). Between Middletown and East Hampton, modern Route 66 was the western half of the [[Colchester and Chatham Turnpike]] (the eastern half is modern Route 16), which was chartered in 1808. From East Hampton via Marlborough to the Hebron-Columbia line, the road was the '''Hebron and Middle Haddam Turnpike''' that was chartered in 1802. From the Hebron-Columbia line through Columbia to Willimantic, the road was the '''Columbia Turnpike''', chartered in 1808. \n\nRoute 66 was originally part of '''State Highway 111''' designated in 1922. It ran from the [[Milldale, Connecticut|Milldale]] section of [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]], via [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], to [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]. In the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]], old Highway 111 was designated as part of [[Connecticut Route 14|Route 14]], which extended from [[Woodbury, Connecticut|Woodbury]] to the [[Rhode Island]] state line. In 1941, the section of Route 14 from [[Woodbury, Connecticut|Woodbury]] to [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]] was redesignated as [[U.S. Route 6A (Willimantic-Woodbury, Connecticut)|US 6A]], connecting at [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]] on both ends. \n\nIn the early 1960s, plans for constructing a US 6A expressway between [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] in Southington and Willimantic were announced. By 1966, a short portion of the expressway from [[U.S. Route 5 in Connecticut|US 5]] in Meriden to Middlefield (where the current expressway ends) opened to traffic. By 1968, the US 6A designation was removed and split into several routes. The section from [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] in [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]] to US 6 in Columbia was renumbered as Route 66, including the newly opened freeway segment.  In 1971, another section of the Route 66 freeway opened from between [[Connecticut Route 322|Route 322]] and [[U.S. Route 5 in Connecticut|US 5]]. In 1987, with the completion of the freeway connection to [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]], the section of Route 66 west of [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] was redesignated as [[Interstate 691|I-691]], truncating the western end of Route 66. In 1983, [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]] was rerouted to a newly constructed [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] around Willimantic, and the former surface route section of [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]] from Columbia to Windham was transferred to Route 66.<ref>[http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ct66.html Connecticut Routes, Route 66]</ref>\n\n==Major intersections==\nExit numbers continue from I-691.\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=ctlog/>}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=New Haven\n|cspan=3\n|location=Meriden\n|lspan=3\n|mile=0.00\n|mspan=2\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=CT|I|691|dir1=west|I|91|CT|15|dir2=south|to2=yes|city1=Meriden|city2=New Haven}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of I-691\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=none\n|exit=11\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|I|91|dir1=north|city1=Hartford}}\n|notes=No southbound exit\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=0.27\n|exit=12\n|type=incomplete\n|road=Preston Avenue\n|notes=Eastbound exit and westbound entrance\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=Middlesex\n|cspan=14\n|location=Middlefield\n|lspan=4\n|mile=1.22\n|exit=13\n|type=incomplete\n|road=East Main Street\n|notes=Westbound exit and eastbound entrance\n}}\n{{jctplace|exit\n|mile=1.96\n|mspan=2\n|place=Eastern terminus of freeway section\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|espan=22\n|mile=none\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|147|dir1=south|city1=Middlefield}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route 147\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=3.88\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|217|dir1=north|city1=Westfield|city2=Cromwell|city3=Berlin}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 217\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Middletown\n|lspan=4\n|mile=5.43\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|157|dir1=south|city1=Middlefield|location2=[[Wadsworth Falls State Park]]}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route 157\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=6.12\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|3|dir1=north|city1=Berlin|city2=Cromwell}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 3\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=6.70\n|road={{Jctname|state=CT|SSR|545|name1=Washington Street|to2=yes|CT|9|dir2=south}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|type=concur\n|mile=6.98\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|17|dir1=south|to2=to|CT|9|name1=St. Johns Square}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 17 [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Connecticut River]]\n|mile=7.13\n|mile2=7.78\n|bridge=[[Arrigoni Bridge]]\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Portland\n|lspan=2\n|mile=7.96\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|17A|dir1=north|city1=Glastonbury}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 17A\n}}\n{{CTint\n|type=concur\n|mile=9.96\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|17|dir1=north|city1=Glastonbury}} \n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route 17 concurrency\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=East Hampton\n|lspan=3\n|mile=12.99\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|151|dir1=south|city1=Middle Haddam|city2=East Haddam|city3=Haddam Neck|city4=Moodus}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route 151; serves [[Hurd State Park]]\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=13.83\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|16|dir1=east|city1=Colchester}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 16\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=16.47\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|196|dir1=south|city1=Moodus}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route 196\n}}\n{{CTint\n|county=Hartford\n|location=Marlborough\n|mile=20.62\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|2|city1=Hartford|city2=Norwich}}\n|notes=Exit 13 on Route 2\n}}\n{{CTint\n|county=Tolland\n|cspan=4\n|location=Hebron\n|lspan=2\n|mile=25.90\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|85|city1=Gilead|city2=Bolton|city3=Colchester}}\n|notes=Serves [[Gay City State Park]]\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=26.07\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|316|dir1=north|city1=Andover}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 316\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Columbia\n|lspan=2\n|mile=30.56\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|87|city1=Andover|city2=Lebanon}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=32.33\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|US|6|CT|32|to2=yes|city1=Andover|city2=Hartford|location3=[[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence, RI]]}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|county=Windham\n|cspan=5\n|location=Windham\n|lspan=5\n|type=concur\n|mile=34.95\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|32|dir1=north|city1=Coventry|city2=Stafford}} \n|notes=Western terminus of Route 32 concurrency\n}}\n{{CTint\n|type=concur\n|mile=35.69\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|32|dir1=south|city1=Lebanon|city2=Norwich}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route 32 concurrency\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=36.89\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|195|dir1=north|location1=[[University of Connecticut]]}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 195\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=36.91\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|14|dir1=east|city1=Windham}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 14}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=38.38\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|US|6|city1=Hartford|location2=[[Windham Airport]]|city3=Danielson|location4=[[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence, RI]]}}\n|notes=Interchange with US 6 west; continues as US 6 east\n}}\n{{Jctbtm|exit|keys=incomplete,concur}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n{{Commons category|Connecticut Route 66}}\n*[http://www.gribblenation.net/ctends/66.html Conn.

This freeway portion runs for about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} into the town of [[Middlefield, Connecticut|Middlefield]], where it becomes a four lane surface road.  In Middlefield, it has junctions with the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 147|Route 147]], and the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 217|Route 217]].  It then enters Middletown and becomes Washington Street, where it has junctions with the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 157|Route 157]] and the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 3|Route 3]] before passing by [[Wesleyan University]] and entering the downtown area. Route 66 then turns onto Main Street, as Washington Street becomes SR 545, providing southbound access to the [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]] freeway.  At the north end of Main Street, it intersects [[Connecticut Route 17|Route 17]].  Southbound Route 17 provides access to both directions of Route 9, while northbound Route 17 joins Route 66 to cross the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Arrigoni Bridge]] into [[Portland, Connecticut|Portland]].  Immediately east of the bridge, it meets the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 17A|Route 17A]], which leads to Portland center.  After Route 17 leaves to the north, Route 66 narrows to 2 lanes and follows the east shore of the Connecticut River into [[East Hampton, Connecticut|East Hampton.]] It passes the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 151|Route 151]], and bends northeast as it intersects the western end of [[Connecticut Route 16|Route 16]].  In the center of town, it meets the northern end of [[Connecticut Route 196|Route 196]], then crosses into [[Marlborough, Connecticut|Marlborough]].  Here, it has a junction with the [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]] freeway at Exit 13.  It then passes into [[Hebron, Connecticut]], where it has junctions with Routes [[Connecticut Route 85|85]] and [[Connecticut Route 316|316]] in the center of town.  It then enters [[Columbia, Connecticut|Columbia]], intersecting [[Connecticut Route 87|Route 87]] before reaching a junction with [[US Route 6|US 6]] at the western end of the Willimantic bypass.  Route 66 turns east as a collector of local traffic headed for [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]].  In Willimantic, it has a 0.74 mile concurrency with [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]], and intersects the southern end of [[Connecticut Route 195|Route 195]], and the western end of [[Connecticut Route 14|Route 14]].  It then turns north-northeastward and continues to US 6 at the east end of the Willimantic bypass, where Route 66 ends and US 6 assumes the roadway.<ref name=ctlog/>\n\nFrom US 6 in Columbia to the end in Windham, Route 66 is designated the [[Grand Army of the Republic Highway]].<ref name=ctlog/> The easternmost {{convert|1.5|mi}} of the route is named [[Boston Post Road]] and was part of the former [[post road|mail route]].\n\n== History ==\nThe entire length of modern Route 66 was originally improved in the 19th century as various private [[Toll road|turnpikes]]. The road from Meriden to Middletown was the '''Middletown and Meriden Turnpike''' chartered in 1809 and used the former surface alignment of Route 66 in Meriden (East Main Street). Between Middletown and East Hampton, modern Route 66 was the western half of the [[Colchester and Chatham Turnpike]] (the eastern half is modern Route 16), which was chartered in 1808. From East Hampton via Marlborough to the Hebron-Columbia line, the road was the '''Hebron and Middle Haddam Turnpike''' that was chartered in 1802. From the Hebron-Columbia line through Columbia to Willimantic, the road was the '''Columbia Turnpike''', chartered in 1808. \n\nRoute 66 was originally part of '''State Highway 111''' designated in 1922. It ran from the [[Milldale, Connecticut|Milldale]] section of [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]], via [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], to [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]. In the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]], old Highway 111 was designated as part of [[Connecticut Route 14|Route 14]], which extended from [[Woodbury, Connecticut|Woodbury]] to the [[Rhode Island]] state line. In 1941, the section of Route 14 from [[Woodbury, Connecticut|Woodbury]] to [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]] was redesignated as [[U.S. Route 6A (Willimantic-Woodbury, Connecticut)|US 6A]], connecting at [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]] on both ends. \n\nIn the early 1960s, plans for constructing a US 6A expressway between [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] in Southington and Willimantic were announced. By 1966, a short portion of the expressway from [[U.S. Route 5 in Connecticut|US 5]] in Meriden to Middlefield (where the current expressway ends) opened to traffic. By 1968, the US 6A designation was removed and split into several routes. The section from [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] in [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]] to US 6 in Columbia was renumbered as Route 66, including the newly opened freeway segment.  In 1971, another section of the Route 66 freeway opened from between [[Connecticut Route 322|Route 322]] and [[U.S. Route 5 in Connecticut|US 5]]. In 1987, with the completion of the freeway connection to [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]], the section of Route 66 west of [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] was redesignated as [[Interstate 691|I-691]], truncating the western end of Route 66. In 1983, [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]] was rerouted to a newly constructed [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] around Willimantic, and the former surface route section of [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]] from Columbia to Windham was transferred to Route 66.<ref>[http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ct66.html Connecticut Routes, Route 66]</ref>\n\n==Major intersections==\nExit numbers continue from I-691.\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=ctlog/>}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=New Haven\n|cspan=3\n|location=Meriden\n|lspan=3\n|mile=0.00\n|mspan=2\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=CT|I|691|dir1=west|I|91|CT|15|dir2=south|to2=yes|city1=Meriden|city2=New Haven}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of I-691\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=none\n|exit=11\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|I|91|dir1=north|city1=Hartford}}\n|notes=No southbound exit\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=0.27\n|exit=12\n|type=incomplete\n|road=Preston Avenue\n|notes=Eastbound exit and westbound entrance\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=Middlesex\n|cspan=14\n|location=Middlefield\n|lspan=4\n|mile=1.22\n|exit=13\n|type=incomplete\n|road=East Main Street\n|notes=Westbound exit and eastbound entrance\n}}\n{{jctplace|exit\n|mile=1.96\n|mspan=2\n|place=Eastern terminus of freeway section\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|espan=22\n|mile=none\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|147|dir1=south|city1=Middlefield}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route 147\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=3.88\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|217|dir1=north|city1=Westfield|city2=Cromwell|city3=Berlin}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 217\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Middletown\n|lspan=4\n|mile=5.43\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|157|dir1=south|city1=Middlefield|location2=[[Wadsworth Falls State Park]]}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route 157\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=6.12\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|3|dir1=north|city1=Berlin|city2=Cromwell}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 3\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=6.70\n|road={{Jctname|state=CT|SSR|545|name1=Washington Street|to2=yes|CT|9|dir2=south}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|type=concur\n|mile=6.98\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|17|dir1=south|to2=to|CT|9|name1=St. Johns Square}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 17 [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Connecticut River]]\n|mile=7.13\n|mile2=7.78\n|bridge=[[Arrigoni Bridge]]\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Portland\n|lspan=2\n|mile=7.96\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|17A|dir1=north|city1=Glastonbury}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 17A\n}}\n{{CTint\n|type=concur\n|mile=9.96\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|17|dir1=north|city1=Glastonbury}} \n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route 17 concurrency\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=East Hampton\n|lspan=3\n|mile=12.99\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|151|dir1=south|city1=Middle Haddam|city2=East Haddam|city3=Haddam Neck|city4=Moodus}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route 151; serves [[Hurd State Park]]\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=13.83\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|16|dir1=east|city1=Colchester}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 16\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=16.47\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|196|dir1=south|city1=Moodus}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route 196\n}}\n{{CTint\n|county=Hartford\n|location=Marlborough\n|mile=20.62\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|2|city1=Hartford|city2=Norwich}}\n|notes=Exit 13 on Route 2\n}}\n{{CTint\n|county=Tolland\n|cspan=4\n|location=Hebron\n|lspan=2\n|mile=25.90\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|85|city1=Gilead|city2=Bolton|city3=Colchester}}\n|notes=Serves [[Gay City State Park]]\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=26.07\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|316|dir1=north|city1=Andover}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 316\n}}\n{{CTint\n|location=Columbia\n|lspan=2\n|mile=30.56\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|87|city1=Andover|city2=Lebanon}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=32.33\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|US|6|CT|32|to2=yes|city1=Andover|city2=Hartford|location3=[[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]}}\n}}\n{{CTint\n|county=Windham\n|cspan=5\n|location=Windham\n|lspan=5\n|type=concur\n|mile=34.95\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|32|dir1=north|city1=Coventry}} \n|notes=Western terminus of Route 32 concurrency\n}}\n{{CTint\n|type=concur\n|mile=35.69\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|32|dir1=south|city1=Lebanon|city2=Norwich}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route 32 concurrency\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=36.89\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|195|dir1=north|location1=[[University of Connecticut]]}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route 195\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=36.91\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|CT|14|dir1=east|city1=Windham}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 14}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=38.38\n|road={{Jct|state=CT|US|6|city1=Hartford|location2=[[Windham Airport]]|city3=Danielson|location4=[[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]}}\n|notes=Interchange with US 6 west; continues as US 6 east\n}}\n{{Jctbtm|exit|keys=incomplete,concur}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n{{Commons category|Connecticut Route 66}}\n*[http://www.gribblenation.net/ctends/66.html Conn.

This remains the last election in which an incumbent president's party nomination was still contested going into the convention.\n\n==Primary race==\nAt the time, Iran was experiencing a [[Iranian revolution|major uprising]] that severely damaged its oil infrastructure and greatly weakened its capability to produce oil.<ref name=uppafb>{{cite magazine |title=Oil Squeeze |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html |magazine=Time magazine |date=1979-02-05 |accessdate=22 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307085655/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C946222%2C00.html |archivedate=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>  In January 1979, shortly after Iran's leader [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] fled the country, lead Iranian opposition figure [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] returned from a 14-year exile and installed an Islamist ''r\u00e9gime'' that was hostile towards the United States.<ref name=uppafb />  The damage that resulted from Khomeini's rise to power would soon be felt throughout many American cities.<ref name=uppafb />  In the spring and summer of 1979 inflation was on the rise and various parts of the country were experiencing energy shortages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/money/retirement-planning/inflation-proofing-6-07/overview/0607_inflation_proofing_ov.htm |title=Inflation-proofing |publisher=ConsumerReports.org |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref>  The gas lines last seen just after the Arab/Israeli war of 1973 were back and President Carter was widely blamed.\n\nPresident Carter's approval ratings were very low\u201428% according to Gallup,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/14/bush.poll | work=CNN | title=Poll: Bush approval mark at all-time low | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> with some other polls giving even lower numbers. In July Carter returned from [[Camp David]] and announced a reshuffling of his cabinet on national television, giving a speech whose downcast demeanor resulted in it being widely labelled the \"malaise speech.\"  While the speech caused a brief upswing in the president's approval rating, the decision to dismiss several cabinet members was widely seen as a rash act of desperation, causing his approval rating to plummet back into the twenties. Some Democrats felt it worth the risk to mount a challenge to Carter in the primaries. Although [[Hugh Carey]] and [[William Proxmire]] decided not to run, Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]] finally made his long-expected run at the presidency.\n\nTed Kennedy had been asked to take his brother [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]]\u2019s place at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] and had refused. He ran for Senate Majority Whip in 1969, with many thinking that he was going to use this as a platform for the 1972 race.<ref>US News and World Report January 1969.</ref> However, then came the notorious [[Chappaquiddick incident]] that killed Kennedy's car passenger [[Mary Jo Kopechne]]. Kennedy subsequently refused to run for president in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] and [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. Many of his supporters suspected that Chappaquiddick had destroyed any ability he had to win on a national level. Despite this, in the summer of 1979, Kennedy consulted with [[Kennedy family|his extended family]], and that fall, he let it leak out that because of Carter\u2019s failings, 1980 might indeed be the year he would try for the nomination. Gallup had him beating the president by over two to one, but Carter remained confident, famously claiming at a June White House gathering of Congressmen that if Kennedy ran against him in the primary, he would \"whip his ass.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912465,00.html |title=Press: Whip His What?}}</ref>\n\nKennedy's official announcement was scheduled for early November.

Kennedy was suddenly left far behind.  Carter beat Kennedy decisively in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Carter decisively defeated Kennedy everywhere except Massachusetts, until impatience began to build with the President's strategy on Iran.  When the primaries in New York and Connecticut came around, it was Kennedy who won.\n\nMomentum built for Ted Kennedy after Carter's [[Operation Eagle Claw|attempt to rescue the hostages]] on April 25 ended in disaster and drew further skepticism towards Carter's leadership ability.<ref>[http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472108670-03.pdf The Iranian Hostage Rescue Mission]</ref>  Nevertheless, Carter was still able to maintain a substantial lead even after Kennedy won the key states of California and New Jersey in June.  Despite this, Kennedy refused to drop out, and the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]] was one of the nastiest on record.  On the penultimate day, Kennedy conceded the nomination and called for a more liberal party platform in what many saw as the best speech of his career.  On the stage on the final day, Kennedy for the most part ignored Carter.\n\n==Candidates==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]] was again selected as the nominee through a series of [[primary election]]s and [[caucus]]es culminating in the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]] held from August 11 to August 14, 1980, in [[New York City]].\n\nCarter faced a major primary challenger in Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]], who won 12 contests and received more than seven million votes nationwide, enough for him to refuse to concede the nomination until the second day of the convention. This remains the last election in which an incumbent president's party nomination was still contested going into the convention.\n\n==Primary race==\nAt the time, Iran was experiencing a [[Iranian revolution|major uprising]] that severely damaged its oil infrastructure and greatly weakened its capability to produce oil.<ref name=uppafb>{{cite magazine |title=Oil Squeeze |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html |magazine=Time magazine |date=1979-02-05 |accessdate=22 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307085655/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C946222%2C00.html |archivedate=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>  In January 1979, shortly after Iran's leader [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] fled the country, lead Iranian opposition figure [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] returned from a 14-year exile and installed an Islamist ''r\u00e9gime'' that was hostile towards the United States.<ref name=uppafb />  The damage that resulted from Khomeini's rise to power would soon be felt throughout many American cities.<ref name=uppafb />  In the spring and summer of 1979 inflation was on the rise and various parts of the country were experiencing energy shortages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/money/retirement-planning/inflation-proofing-6-07/overview/0607_inflation_proofing_ov.htm |title=Inflation-proofing |publisher=ConsumerReports.org |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref>  The gas lines last seen just after the Arab/Israeli war of 1973 were back and President Carter was widely blamed.\n\nPresident Carter's approval ratings were very low\u201428% according to Gallup,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/14/bush.poll | work=CNN | title=Poll: Bush approval mark at all-time low | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> with some other polls giving even lower numbers. In July Carter returned from [[Camp David]] and announced a reshuffling of his cabinet on national television, giving a speech whose downcast demeanor resulted in it being widely labelled the \"malaise speech.\"  While the speech caused a brief upswing in the president's approval rating, the decision to dismiss several cabinet members was widely seen as a rash act of desperation, causing his approval rating to plummet back into the twenties. Some Democrats felt it worth the risk to mount a challenge to Carter in the primaries. Although [[Hugh Carey]] and [[William Proxmire]] decided not to run, Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]] finally made his long-expected run at the presidency.\n\nTed Kennedy had been asked to take his brother [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]]\u2019s place at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] and had refused. He ran for Senate Majority Whip in 1969, with many thinking that he was going to use this as a platform for the 1972 race.<ref>US News and World Report January 1969.</ref> However, then came the notorious [[Chappaquiddick incident]] that killed Kennedy's car passenger [[Mary Jo Kopechne]]. Kennedy subsequently refused to run for president in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]] and [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. Many of his supporters suspected that Chappaquiddick had destroyed any ability he had to win on a national level. Despite this, in the summer of 1979, Kennedy consulted with [[Kennedy family|his extended family]], and that fall, he let it leak out that because of Carter\u2019s failings, 1980 might indeed be the year he would try for the nomination. Gallup had him beating the president by over two to one, but Carter remained confident, famously claiming at a June White House gathering of Congressmen that if Kennedy ran against him in the primary, he would \"whip his ass.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912465,00.html |title=Press: Whip His What?}}</ref>\n\nKennedy\u2019s official announcement was scheduled for early November.

Kennedy was suddenly left far behind.  Carter beat Kennedy decisively in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Carter decisively defeated Kennedy everywhere except Massachusetts, until impatience began to build with the President\u2019s strategy on Iran.  When the primaries in New York and Connecticut came around, it was Kennedy who won.\n\nMomentum built for Ted Kennedy after Carter's [[Operation Eagle Claw|attempt to rescue the hostages]] on April 25 ended in disaster and drew further skepticism towards Carter's leadership ability.<ref>[http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472108670-03.pdf The Iranian Hostage Rescue Mission]</ref>  Nevertheless, Carter was still able to maintain a substantial lead even after Kennedy won the key states of California and New Jersey in June.  Despite this, Kennedy refused to drop out, and the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]] was one of the nastiest on record.  On the penultimate day, Kennedy conceded the nomination and called for a more liberal party platform in what many saw as the best speech of his career.  On the stage on the final day, Kennedy for the most part ignored Carter.\n\n==Candidates==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

A test for [[SARS-CoV-2]] was not conducted since she had no connection to infected areas or people. Therefore, her infection went unnoticed for over a week. On 1 March it was announced that she had COVID-19 and that she had been relocated to Erasmus MC due to her deteriorating condition earlier. Since then the Beatrix Hospital went into lock-down out of precaution for a few days. Only personnel was allowed to enter and leave the building. The hospital fully reopened on 5 March, after all employees had tested negative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/drie-nieuwe-patienten-met-covid-19|title=Drie nieuwe pati\u00ebnten met COVID-19|date=1 March 2020|website=rivm.nl|language=nl|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2325309-beatrixziekenhuis-gorinchem-gesloten-om-coronavirus-tien-patienten-in-nl.html|title=Beatrixziekenhuis Gorinchem gesloten om coronavirus, tien pati\u00ebnten in NL|date=1 March 2020|website=nos.nl|language=nl|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destadgorinchem.nl/lokaal/zorg/326154/beatrixziekenhuis-gorinchem-en-lingepolikliniek-leerdam-donderdag-weer-open-na-melding|title=Beatrixziekenhuis Gorinchem en Lingepolikliniek Leerdam donderdag weer open na melding coronavirus |website=DeStadGorinchem.nl |language=Dutch |date=4 March 2020 |accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n* 4 March: the total number of cases was 38, which included one person passing through the Netherlands who was isolated in [[Hoofddorp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2325726-coronapatient-die-in-container-hoofddorp-zat-nu-naar-andere-locatie.html|title=Coronapati\u00ebnt die in container Hoofddorp zat nu naar andere locatie|date=4 March 2020|website=nos.nl|language=nl|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2325850-ook-ziekenhuispersoneel-in-eindhoven-breda-en-den-bosch-besmet-met-corona.html|title=Ook ziekenhuispersoneel in Eindhoven, Breda en Den Bosch besmet met corona|website=nos.nl|language=nl|date=5 March 2020|access-date=7 March 2020}}</ref> The next day this number more than doubled to 82.

On the down side is the weight of the batteries, which raises the vehicle weight, and their range before recharging of between {{convert|300 and 600|km|mi|0}}. Currently, battery electric units have a higher purchase price and running cost than petrol or diesel railcars, needing one or more charging stations along the routes they operate, unless they operate on a mixture of electrified and unelectrified track being charged from the electrified track. \n\nBattery technology has greatly improved over the past 20 years broadening the scope of use of battery trains, moving away from limited niche applications. Despite higher purchase and running costs, on certain railway lines battery trains are economically viable as the very high cost and maintenance of full line electrification is eliminated. From March 2014 passenger battery trains have been in operation in Japan on a number of lines. Austria has overhead wire/battery trains which became operational in 2019.<ref>http://www.railway-technology.com/features/featurepowering-the-trains-of-tomorrow-5723499/</ref> Britain successfully trialled fare paying passenger hybrid overhead wire/lithium battery trains in January and February 2015.<ref>https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/551880/Network-Rail-launches-first-battery-run-passenger-train-in-50-years</ref>\n\n==History==\nExperiments with accumulator railcars, as they were originally called, were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the ''Edison-Beach'' type, with [[nickel-iron battery|nickel-iron batteries]] were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|battery-electric Edison railcar]] operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm [[nickel-zinc battery]] was used on [[Drumm Battery Train|four 2-car sets]] between 1932 and 1946 on [[Harcourt Street railway line|the Harcourt Street Line]] in [[Ireland]] and [[British Railways]] used [[lead-acid batteries]] in a [[British Rail BEMU|railcar in 1958]]. Between 1955 and 1995 Deutsche Bahn railways successfully operated 232 [[DB Class ETA 150]] railcars utilising [[lead-acid batteries]].\n\n==Supercapacitors==\n[[Image:Metro Sul do Tejo - Corroios02.jpg|thumb|right|Siemens Avenio trams have supercapacitor versions]]\nA number of tramway manufacturers are offering battery tramcars that combine the traction battery with a [[supercapacitor]] that will be charged at each stop. The main motivation for the usage of battery-powered tramways is to avoid [[Overhead line|overhead wires]] across a city. Using boost charging at each stop allows to lower the size of the required traction battery.  This technology is hoped to be transferred to full trains. \n\nThe [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] [[Urbos 3]] tramways was ordered for the [[MetroCentro (Seville)|Seville MetroCentro]] with the ''Acumulador de Carga R\u00e1pida'' system which uses short overhead wires at each stop for charging.

The line is diesel train operated unable to progress into the electric 3rd rail underground Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail tunnels. The diesel operated line terminates at [[Bidston railway station]] in Birkenhead, with passengers having to change trains at Bidston to proceed onto the Merseyrail electric network. Network Rail proposed using dual battery powered/3rd rail pickup rolling stock without full electrification of the 27 mile long line, providing a cheaper method of increasing connectivity into the electrified underground sections of the Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail Wirral Line. If battery trains are introduced the Borderlands line will be incorporated into the Wirral Line becoming an urban metro line, in which trains only terminate at Wrexham running around the electrified Liverpool city centre underground tunnels in a loop.\n\nOn page 37 of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, it states that in 2020 a trial of new [[British Rail Class 777|class 777]] [[Merseyrail]] electric 3rd rail/battery trains will be undertaken in view to incorporate two stretches of unelectrified track onto the [[Merseyrail]] network.

On the down side is the weight of the batteries, which raises the vehicle weight, and their range before recharging of between {{convert|300 and 600|km|mi|0}}. Currently, battery electric units have a higher purchase price and running cost than petrol or diesel railcars, needing one or more charging stations along the routes they operate, unless they operate on a mixture of electrified and unelectrified track being charged from the electrified track. \n\nBattery technology has greatly improved over the past 20 years broadening the scope of use of battery trains, moving away from limited niche applications. Despite higher purchase and running costs, on certain railway lines battery trains are economically viable as the very high cost and maintenance of full line electrification is eliminated. From March 2014 passenger battery trains have been in operation in Japan on a number of lines. Austria has overhead wire/battery trains which became operational in 2019.<ref>http://www.railway-technology.com/features/featurepowering-the-trains-of-tomorrow-5723499/</ref> Britain successfully trialled fare paying passenger hybrid overhead wire/lithium battery trains in January and February 2015.<ref>https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/551880/Network-Rail-launches-first-battery-run-passenger-train-in-50-years</ref>\n\n==History==\nExperiments with accumulator railcars, as they were originally called, were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the ''Edison-Beach'' type, with [[nickel-iron battery|nickel-iron batteries]] were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|battery-electric Edison railcar]] operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm [[nickel-zinc battery]] was used on [[Drumm Battery Train|four 2-car sets]] between 1932 and 1946 on [[Harcourt Street railway line|the Harcourt Street Line]] in [[Ireland]] and [[British Railways]] used [[lead-acid batteries]] in a [[British Rail BEMU|railcar in 1958]]. Between 1955 and 1995 Deutsche Bahn railways successfully operated 232 [[DB Class ETA 150]] railcars utilising [[lead-acid batteries]].\n\n==Supercapacitors==\n[[Image:Metro Sul do Tejo - Corroios02.jpg|thumb|right|Siemens Avenio trams have supercapacitor versions]]\nA number of tramway manufacturers are offering battery tramcars that combine the traction battery with a [[supercapacitor]] that will be charged at each stop. The main motivation for the usage of battery-powered tramways is to avoid [[Overhead line|overhead wires]] across a city. Using boost charging at each stop allows to lower the size of the required traction battery.  This technology is hoped to be transferred to full trains. \n\nThe [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] [[Urbos 3]] tramways was ordered for the [[MetroCentro (Seville)|Seville MetroCentro]] with the ''Acumulador de Carga R\u00e1pida'' system which uses short overhead wires at each stop for charging.

The line is diesel train operated unable to progress into the electric 3rd rail underground Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail tunnels. The diesel operated line terminates at [[Bidston railway station]] in Birkenhead, with passengers having to change trains at Bidston to proceed onto the Merseyrail electric network. Network Rail proposed using dual battery powered/3rd rail pickup rolling stock without full electrification of the 27 mile long line, providing a cheaper method of increasing connectivity into the electrified underground sections of the Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail Wirral Line. If battery trains are introduced the Borderlands line will be incorporated into the Wirral Line becoming an urban metro line, in which trains only terminate at Wrexham running around the electrified Liverpool city centre underground tunnels in a loop.\n\nOn page 37 of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, it states that in 2020 a trial of new [[British Rail Class 777|class 777]] [[Merseyrail]] electric 3rd rail/battery trains will be undertaken in view to incorporate two stretches of unelectrified track onto the [[Merseyrail]] network.

He attended the public schools in [[Poultney, Vermont]], until the age of eight, at which time he began an accelerated course of studies preparing for college under the private tutelage of Henry Howe, the former principal of the Canandaiga Academy in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]]. In 1824, at the age of 10, he passed the admission exams for [[Middlebury College]] in [[Middlebury, Vermont]] and was admitted to the college. However, concerned about the difference in age between Buel and the other college students, his teacher and family persuaded him to continue his independent studies for three years. In 1827, at the age of 13, Buel accompanied one of his teachers and was enrolled as a sophomore at the [[University of Vermont]] in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], where he stayed for one year. In 1828, he decided to attend Middlebury College, which was his original intent.

In September 1830, he became superintendent of a classical academy in [[West Rutland, Vermont|West Rutland]]. In November 1831, he was invited to become principal of a classical academy at [[Fort Covington, New York|Fort Covington]] in northern New York, where he also began to study law. In December, 1832, he returned to his father's residence in Castleton and continued his study of law while also teaching at the [[Castleton State College|Castleton Academy]].\n\nIn October 1834, Buell moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] and within two months became Deputy Register of the Court of Probate. Because of his language skills, he was able to converse with the many French speakers native to Detroit at the time, as well as the increasing number of German immigrants. He [[admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in the spring of 1835 and commenced practice in Detroit.\n\nBuel was city attorney in 1837 and a member of the [[Michigan State House of Representatives]] in 1838 and again in 1848, serving as speaker the latter year. He was the prosecuting attorney for [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] 1843\u20131846.\n\nBuel first ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[Michigan's 1st congressional district]] in 1846, but lost in a close election.

He attended the public schools in [[Poultney, Vermont]], until the age of eight, at which time he began an accelerated course of studies preparing for college under the private tutelage of Henry Howe, the former principal of the Canandaiga Academy in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]]. In 1824, at the age of 10, he passed the admission exams for [[Middlebury College]] in [[Middlebury, Vermont]] and was admitted to the college. However, concerned about the difference in age between Buel and the other college students, his teacher and family persuaded him to continue his independent studies for three years. In 1827, at the age of 13, Buel accompanied one of his teachers and was enrolled as a sophomore at the [[University of Vermont]] in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], where he stayed for one year. In 1828, he decided to attend Middlebury College, which was his original intent. He was enrolled there as a junior and also taught at the common schools in [[Clarendon, Vermont|Clarendon]].<ref name=\"Vol 3\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Charles|title=History of Michigan, Volume 3 | date=1915 |publisher=Lewis Publishing Company, Alcona County, Mich.|page=1728\u20131729|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eZYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1727&dq=Alexander+Woodruff+Buel#v=onepage&q=Alexander%20Woodruff%20Buel&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn August 1830, at the age of 16, Buel graduated from Middlebury College ranked first in his class. In September 1830, he became superintendent of a classical academy in [[West Rutland, Vermont|West Rutland]]. In November 1831, he was invited to become principal of a classical academy at [[Fort Covington, New York|Fort Covington]] in northern New York, where he also began to study law. In December, 1832, he returned to his father's residence in Castleton and continued his study of law while also teaching at the [[Castleton State College|Castleton Academy]].\n\nIn October 1834, Buell moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] and within two months became Deputy Register of the Court of Probate. Because of his language skills, he was able to converse with the many French speakers native to Detroit at the time, as well as the increasing number of German immigrants. He [[admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in the spring of 1835 and commenced practice in Detroit.\n\nBuel was city attorney in 1837 and a member of the [[Michigan State House of Representatives]] in 1838 and again in 1848, serving as speaker the latter year. He was the prosecuting attorney for [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] 1843-1846.\n\nBuel first ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[Michigan's 1st congressional district]] in 1846, but lost in a close election. In 1848, Buel was elected as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] from Michigan's 1st District to the [[United States Congress]] for the [[Thirty-first United States Congress|Thirty-first Congress]], succeeding fellow Democrat [[Robert McClelland (American)|Robert McClelland]] who did not run. Buel served from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1851. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1850 to the [[Thirty-second United States Congress|Thirty-second Congress]] and resumed the practice of law. He was again a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1859 and 1860. He was appointed [[postmaster]] of Detroit on September 28, 1860, and served until March 18, 1861.<ref name=\"Hannan\">{{cite book|last=Hannan|last2= Herman|last3= Dye|last4= Ewald|last5= Genel-Gonzalez|first=Caryn|first2=Jennifer L.|first3= Bryan|first4= Mel|first5= Gloria|title=Michigan Biographical Dictionary|publisher=North American Book Dist LLC|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aWR5HJJktL8C&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=Alexander+Woodruff+Buel+(December+13,+1813+%E2%80%93+April+19,+1868)#v=onepage&q=Alexander%20Woodruff%20Buel%20(December%2013%2C%201813%20%E2%80%93%20April%2019%2C%201868)&f=false|isbn=9781878592958|date=1998-01-01}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBuel died in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, on April 19, 1868 (age 54 years, 128 days).
