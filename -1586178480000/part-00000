There was also a Roman Catholic church in the Christian hamlet of Pattanava, with a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic priest]] appointed by the Madras [[Diocese|Bishopric]].<ref name=Caste757>Pandian pp.75,77</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the [[monotheistic]] religions of Islam and Christianity, combined with the breakdown of the earlier Hindu ruled kingdoms and imposition of colonial rule, evolved new forms of rank and communal affiliation among the areas' religious communities. South India was not always a strictly \"orthodox\" Hindu Society. To the contrary, Christianity, Islam and Brahmanical Hinduism were forces which all came to impinge on the warrior cultures of South India.<ref>Bayly pp. 3, 15</ref>\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Azariah, Dr. Jayapaul.
