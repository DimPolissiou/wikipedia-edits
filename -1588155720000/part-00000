Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

In the year 980 it was sacked and razed to the ground.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p6</ref> It was once believed that a castle existed in Montrose in the 10th century and was destroyed by [[Kenneth III]].

During the 1140s it was an important trading town.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

The first structure to be built on this uninhabited oceanfront was the Biscayne House of Refuge, constructed in 1876 by the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] through an executive order issued by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Biscayne House of Refuge |url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=75990 |website=HMdb.org |accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> at approximately 72nd Street. Its purpose was to provide food, water, and a return to civilization for people who were shipwrecked. The structure, which had fallen into disuse by the time the Life-Saving Service became the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] in 1915, was destroyed in the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] and never rebuilt.\n \nThe next step in the development of the future Miami Beach was the planting of a coconut plantation along the shore in the 1880s by New Jersey entrepreneurs Ezra Osborn and Elnathan T. Field, but this was a failed venture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elnathan T. Field |url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/ingraham/expedition/FieldE.htm |website=University of Florida Library |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref> One of the investors in the project was agriculturist [[John S. Collins]], who achieved success by buying out other partners and planting different crops, notably avocados, on the land that would later become Miami Beach. Meanwhile, across Biscayne Bay, the City of Miami was established in 1896 with the arrival of the railroad and developed further as a port when the shipping channel of [[Government Cut]] was created in 1905, cutting off Fisher Island from the south end of the Miami Beach peninsula.\n\nCollins' family members saw the potential in developing the beach as a resort. This effort got underway in the early years of the 20th century by the Collins/Pancoast family, the Lummus brothers (bankers from Miami), and [[Indianapolis]] entrepreneur [[Carl G. Fisher]]. Until then, the beach here was only the destination for day-trips by ferry from Miami, across the bay. By 1912, Collins and Pancoast were working together to clear the land, plant crops, supervise the construction of canals to get their avocado crop to market, and set up the Miami Beach Improvement Company.<ref name=\"wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=https://wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/return-in-time-to-the-lincoln-hotel-miami-beach-late-january-1921/|title=RETURN IN TIME TO THE LINCOLN HOTEL, MIAMI BEACH, LATE JANUARY, 1921|author=|date=October 24, 2012|work=Wordpress.com|access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> There were bathhouses and food stands, but no hotel until Brown's Hotel was built in 1915 (still standing, at 112 Ocean Drive). Much of the interior landmass at that time was a tangled jungle of mangroves. Clearing it, deepening the channels and water bodies, and eliminating native growth almost everywhere in favor of landfill for development, was expensive. Once a 1600-acre, jungle-matted sand bar three miles out in the Atlantic, it grew to 2,800 acres when dredging and filling operations were completed.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Florida. A Guide to the Southernmost State\n|date=1939\n|place=New York\n|author=Federal Writers' Project\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|page=210}}</ref>\n\nWith loans from the Lummus brothers, Collins had begun work on a 2\u00bd-mile-long wooden bridge, the world's longest wooden bridge at the time, to connect the island to the mainland. When funds ran dry and construction work stalled, Indianapolis millionaire and recent Miami transplant Fisher intervened, providing the financing needed to complete the bridge the following year in return for a land swap deal.<ref name=\"wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com\"/> That transaction kicked off the island's first real estate boom. Fisher helped by organizing an annual speed boat regatta, and by promoting Miami Beach as an Atlantic City-style playground and winter retreat for the wealthy. By 1915, Lummus, Collins, Pancoast, and Fisher were all living in mansions on the island, three hotels and two bathhouses had been erected, an aquarium built, and an 18-hole golf course landscaped.\n[[File:Roney Plaza Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|Roller skating waitresses at Roney Plaza Hotel, 1939]]\n\nThe Town of Miami Beach was chartered on March 26, 1915; it grew to become a City in 1917. Even after the town was incorporated in 1915 under the name of Miami Beach, many visitors thought of the beach strip as Alton Beach, indicating just how well Fisher had advertised his interests there. The Lummus property was called Ocean Beach, with only the Collins interests previously referred to as Miami Beach.<ref>http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/tequesta/files/1955/55_1_01.pdf</ref>\n\nCarl Fisher was the main promoter of Miami Beach's development in the 1920s as the site for wealthy industrialists from the north and Midwest to and build their winter homes here. Many other Northerners were targeted to vacation on the island. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them: The [[Flamingo Hotel, Miami Beach|Flamingo Hotel]], The Fleetwood Hotel, The Floridian, The Nautilus, and the Roney Plaza Hotel. In the 1920s, Fisher and others created much of Miami Beach as landfill by dredging Biscayne Bay; this man-made territory includes Star, Palm, and Hibiscus Islands, the Sunset Islands, much of Normandy Isle, and all of the Venetian Islands except Belle Isle. The Miami Beach peninsula became an island in April 1925 when Haulover Cut was opened, connecting the ocean to the bay, north of present-day [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]]. The great [[1926 Miami hurricane]] put an end to this prosperous era of the [[Florida Boom]], but in the 1930s Miami Beach still attracted tourists, and investors constructed the mostly small-scale, stucco hotels and rooming houses, for seasonal rental, that comprise much of the present \"[[Art Deco]]\" historic district.\n\nCarl Fisher brought Steve Hannagan to Miami Beach in 1925 as his chief publicist.<ref>Ross, Edward Ellis; interview notebook; source: New York University Archives; p. 79.\n</ref> Hannagan set-up the Miami Beach News Bureau and notified news editors that they could \"Print anything you want about Miami Beach; just make sure you get our name right.\"<ref name=\":0\">Cooke, Bill (September 20, 2010); \"Selling Miami Beach with Sex and Celebrities Is Nothing New;\" <nowiki>http://www.miamibeach411.com/news/selling-miami</nowiki>; Miami Beach; 411.</ref> The News Bureau sent thousands of pictures of bathing beauties and press releases to columnists like Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of Hannagan's favorite venues was a billboard in Times Square, New York City, where he ran two taglines: \"'It's always June in Miami Beach' and 'Miami Beach, Where Summer Spends the Winter.'\"<ref>Fisher, Jane (1947); The Fabulous Hoosier; Robert M.

After [[Fidel Castro]]'s rise to power in 1959, a wave of Cuban refugees entered South Florida and dramatically changed the demographic make-up of the area.

His closing line became, almost invariably, \"As always, the Miami Beach audience is the greatest audience in the world!\" In the Fall 1966 television season, he abandoned the American Scene Magazine format and converted the show into a standard variety hour with guest performers. The show was renamed ''The Jackie Gleason Show'', lasting from September 17, 1966 \u2013 September 12, 1970. He started the 1966\u20131967 season with new, color episodes of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', with [[Sheila MacRae]] and [[Jane Kean]] as Alice Kramden and Trixie Norton, respectively. The regular cast included [[Art Carney]] as Ed Norton; [[Milton Berle]] was a frequent guest star. The show was shot in color on videotape at the [[Miami Beach Convention Center|Miami Beach Auditorium]] (later renamed the Jackie Gleason Theatre of the Performing Arts), now known as [[Miami Beach Convention Center#Fillmore Miami Beach|Fillmore Miami Beach]], and Gleason never tired of promoting the \"sun and fun capital of the world\" on camera.

Like much of Florida, there is a marked wet and dry season in Miami Beach. The tropical rainy season runs from May through October, when showers and late day thunderstorms are common. The dry season is from November through April, when few showers, sunshine, and low humidity prevail. The island location of Miami Beach, however, creates fewer convective thunderstorms, so Miami Beach receives less rainfall in a given year than neighboring areas such as Miami and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]].

This unfortunate reality of climate change contributes to the City of Miami Beach's $400\u2013500 Million of expenditures to address sea level rise over the next five years. After urgent meetings with city planners and engineers, Miami Beach officials decided on raising roads and installing pumps as the best course of action. Citizens have raised concerns that more pumps will simply exacerbate pollution in the bay, harming wildlife and decreasing biodiversity which in turn could harm tourism. Since they've turned on the pumps, seaside residents have complained of a lower quality of life due to the lack of stingrays, manatees, tarpin, and other wildlife. The tubes pump out a brown soot-like liquid, dangering those residents of lower property values. A hydrologist from Florida International University, Henry Brice\u00f1o, is studying the validity of the city's claims that the output from the pipes is just harmless turbidity in the bay. \u201cRemember,\u201d Brice\u00f1o argues, \u201cwe live here in Miami Beach out of tourism.\u201d Anthropologist Kenny Broad sees that Miami residents understand that their livelihoods are at stake, and they feel the realities of climate change beyond partisan lines. This alarmed mindset is catalyzing support for a proposal to turn a public golf course back into wetlands, a more deep ecology approach than the pump installations.\n\nThe urgency and apparency of flooding coupled with the many other golf courses that the public and tourists can access in Miami have curbed public opposition to an extent, but in preparation for varied public opinion, Miami Beach has proposed three options. The first would not affect the golf course other than retrofitting it with greener, water-absorbing features. The second would repurpose nine holes into wetlands with a recreation center, while the third option goes all the way in a total reimagination of the course into a 145-acre eco-district reminiscent of Central Park in New York City. This move wouldn't be unprecedented: a private conservancy group purchased an aging golf course on Florida's Gulf Coast and repurposed it as a wetland and wildflower preserve.\n\nAdditionally, to accommodate water filtration that the pipes inadequately attempt to clean, the golf course is just one piece of a larger plan to add plant-based systems that will filter water before they enter the high water table of Miami and return to Biscayne Bay. This plan is similar to dealing with sewage through aquatic water treatment plants and steps that other cities such as Houston are beginning to take to increase permeability in their cities for water to drain into.\n\n===Water temperature===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Average coastal water temperature for the Atlantic Ocean based on historical measurements.<ref name=\"water_temperature\">{{cite web|last1=Sun|first1=Charles|title=Coastal Water Temperature Table|url=https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|website=www.nodc.noaa.gov|publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 5, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905202557/https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|archivedate=September 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n!January\n| {{convert|71|F|C|1}}\n!May 1\u201315\n| {{convert|80|F|C|1}}\n!July 16\u201331\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!October 1\u201315\n| {{convert|83|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!February\n| {{convert|73|F|C|1}}\n!May 16\u201331\n| {{convert|81|F|C|1}}\n!August 1\u201315\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!October 16\u201331\n| {{convert|79|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!March\n| {{convert|75|F|C|1}}\n!June 1\u201315\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!August 16\u201331\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!November\n| {{convert|76|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!April 1\u201315\n| {{convert|78|F|C|1}}\n!June 16\u201330\n| {{convert|85|F|C|1}}\n!September 1\u201315\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!December\n| {{convert|73|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!April 16\u201330\n| {{convert|78|F|C|1}}\n!July 1\u201315\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!September 16\u201330\n| {{convert|83|F|C|1}}\n|}\n\n===Surrounding areas===\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Surrounding areas of Miami Beach'''\n|Northwest = [[Biscayne Bay]]\n|North     = [[Indian Creek, Florida|Indian Creek]], [[Surfside, Florida|Surfside]]\n|Northeast = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|West      = [[Biscayne Bay]], [[North Bay Village, Florida|North Bay Village]], [[Miami]], [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|Centre    = Miami Beach\n|East      = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|Southwest = [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|South     = [[Government Cut]], [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|Southeast = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 644\n|1930= 6494\n|1940= 28012\n|1950= 46282\n|1960= 63145\n|1970= 87072\n|1980= 96298\n|1990= 92639\n|2000= 87933\n|2010= 87779\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=91718\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 2em; width: 35%; font-size: 75%;\" \n!colspan=4|Miami Beach demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Miami Beach||Miami-Dade County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||87,779||2,496,435||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||-0.2%||+10.8%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||11,511.1/sq&nbsp;mi||1,315.5/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||87.4%||73.8%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||40.5%||15.4%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||4.4%||18.9%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||53.0%||65.0%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||1.9%||1.5%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.3%||0.2%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.1%||0.0%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (Multiracial)]]||2.7%||2.4%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some Other Race]]||3.2%||3.2%||3.6%\n|}\n\n{{As of|2010}}, those of Hispanic or Latino ancestry accounted for 53.0% of Miami Beach's population.

The first structure to be built on this uninhabited oceanfront was the Biscayne House of Refuge, constructed in 1876 by the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] through an executive order issued by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Biscayne House of Refuge |url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=75990 |website=HMdb.org |accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> at approximately 72nd Street. Its purpose was to provide food, water, and a return to civilization for people who were shipwrecked. The structure, which had fallen into disuse by the time the Life-Saving Service became the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] in 1915, was destroyed in the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] and never rebuilt.\n \nThe next step in the development of the future Miami Beach was the planting of a coconut plantation along the shore in the 1880s by New Jersey entrepreneurs Ezra Osborn and Elnathan T. Field, but this was a failed venture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elnathan T. Field |url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/ingraham/expedition/FieldE.htm |website=University of Florida Library |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref> One of the investors in the project was agriculturist [[John S. Collins]], who achieved success by buying out other partners and planting different crops, notably avocados, on the land that would later become Miami Beach. Meanwhile, across Biscayne Bay, the City of Miami was established in 1896 with the arrival of the railroad and developed further as a port when the shipping channel of [[Government Cut]] was created in 1905, cutting off Fisher Island from the south end of the Miami Beach peninsula.\n\nCollins' family members saw the potential in developing the beach as a resort. This effort got underway in the early years of the 20th century by the Collins/Pancoast family, the Lummus brothers (bankers from Miami), and [[Indianapolis]] entrepreneur [[Carl G. Fisher]]. Until then, the beach here was only the destination for day-trips by ferry from Miami, across the bay. By 1912, Collins and Pancoast were working together to clear the land, plant crops, supervise the construction of canals to get their avocado crop to market, and set up the Miami Beach Improvement Company.<ref name=\"wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=https://wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/return-in-time-to-the-lincoln-hotel-miami-beach-late-january-1921/|title=RETURN IN TIME TO THE LINCOLN HOTEL, MIAMI BEACH, LATE JANUARY, 1921|author=|date=October 24, 2012|work=Wordpress.com|access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> There were bathhouses and food stands, but no hotel until Brown's Hotel was built in 1915 (still standing, at 112 Ocean Drive). Much of the interior landmass at that time was a tangled jungle of mangroves. Clearing it, deepening the channels and water bodies, and eliminating native growth almost everywhere in favor of landfill for development, was expensive. Once a 1600-acre, jungle-matted sand bar three miles out in the Atlantic, it grew to 2,800 acres when dredging and filling operations were completed.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Florida. A Guide to the Southernmost State\n|date=1939\n|place=New York\n|author=Federal Writers' Project\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|page=210}}</ref>\n\nWith loans from the Lummus brothers, Collins had begun work on a 2\u00bd-mile-long wooden bridge, the world's longest wooden bridge at the time, to connect the island to the mainland. When funds ran dry and construction work stalled, Indianapolis millionaire and recent Miami transplant Fisher intervened, providing the financing needed to complete the bridge the following year in return for a land swap deal.<ref name=\"wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com\"/> That transaction kicked off the island's first real estate boom. Fisher helped by organizing an annual speed boat regatta, and by promoting Miami Beach as an Atlantic City-style playground and winter retreat for the wealthy. By 1915, Lummus, Collins, Pancoast, and Fisher were all living in mansions on the island, three hotels and two bathhouses had been erected, an aquarium built, and an 18-hole golf course landscaped.\n[[File:Roney Plaza Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|Roller skating waitresses at Roney Plaza Hotel, 1939]]\n\nThe Town of Miami Beach was chartered on March 26, 1915; it grew to become a City in 1917. Even after the town was incorporated in 1915 under the name of Miami Beach, many visitors thought of the beach strip as Alton Beach, indicating just how well Fisher had advertised his interests there. The Lummus property was called Ocean Beach, with only the Collins interests previously referred to as Miami Beach.<ref>http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/tequesta/files/1955/55_1_01.pdf</ref>\n\nCarl Fisher was the main promoter of Miami Beach's development in the 1920s as the site for wealthy industrialists from the north and Midwest to and build their winter homes here. Many other Northerners were targeted to vacation on the island. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them: The [[Flamingo Hotel, Miami Beach|Flamingo Hotel]], The Fleetwood Hotel, The Floridian, The Nautilus, and the Roney Plaza Hotel. In the 1920s, Fisher and others created much of Miami Beach as landfill by dredging Biscayne Bay; this man-made territory includes Star, Palm, and Hibiscus Islands, the Sunset Islands, much of Normandy Isle, and all of the Venetian Islands except Belle Isle. The Miami Beach peninsula became an island in April 1925 when Haulover Cut was opened, connecting the ocean to the bay, north of present-day [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]]. The great [[1926 Miami hurricane]] put an end to this prosperous era of the [[Florida Boom]], but in the 1930s Miami Beach still attracted tourists, and investors constructed the mostly small-scale, stucco hotels and rooming houses, for seasonal rental, that comprise much of the present \"[[Art Deco]]\" historic district.\n\nCarl Fisher brought Steve Hannagan to Miami Beach in 1925 as his chief publicist.<ref>Ross, Edward Ellis; interview notebook; source: New York University Archives; p. 79.\n</ref> Hannagan set-up the Miami Beach News Bureau and notified news editors that they could \"Print anything you want about Miami Beach; just make sure you get our name right.\"<ref name=\":0\">Cooke, Bill (September 20, 2010); \"Selling Miami Beach with Sex and Celebrities Is Nothing New;\" <nowiki>http://www.miamibeach411.com/news/selling-miami</nowiki>; Miami Beach; 411.</ref> The News Bureau sent thousands of pictures of bathing beauties and press releases to columnists like Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of Hannagan's favorite venues was a billboard in Times Square, New York City, where he ran two taglines: \"'It's always June in Miami Beach' and 'Miami Beach, Where Summer Spends the Winter.'\"<ref>Fisher, Jane (1947); The Fabulous Hoosier; Robert M.

There is also a liberal [[Jewish]] community containing such famous synagogues as [[Temple Emanu-El (Miami Beach, Florida)|Temple Emanu-El]], [[Temple Beth Sholom (Miami Beach, Florida)|Temple Beth Shalom]] and [[Cuban Hebrew Congregation]]. Miami Beach is also a magnet for [[Jew]]ish families, retirees, and particularly [[Snowbird (person)|snowbirds]] when the cold winter sets into the north. These visitors range from the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] to the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]&nbsp;\u2013 including many [[rebbe]]s who vacation there during the North American winter. Till his death in 1991, the Nobel laureate writer [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] lived in the northern end of Miami Beach and breakfasted often at Sheldon's drugstore on Harding Avenue.\n\nThere are many [[kosher]] restaurants and even [[kollel]]s for post-graduate [[Talmud]]ic scholars, such as the Miami Beach Community Kollel. Miami Beach had roughly 60,000 people in Jewish households, 62 percent of the total population, in 1982, but only 16,500, or 19 percent of the population, in 2004, said Ira Sheskin, a demographer at the University of Miami who conducts surveys once a [[decade]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The Miami Beach Jewish community had decreased in size by 1994 due to migration to wealthier areas and aging of the population.<ref>Patron, Eugene. \"To the Golden Cities: Pursuing the American Jewish Dream in Miami and L.A.\" ''[[Forward (magazine)|Forward]]'', May 27, 1994, Vol. LXXXXVIII(30,977), p.9. \"Old age and migration to more affluent communities have left Miami Beach all but a shell of the Jewish shtetl that blossomed there.\"</ref>\n\nMiami Beach is home to the [[Holocaust Memorial on Miami Beach]].\n\n=== LGBT community ===\n{{main|LGBT culture in Miami}}\nMiami Beach has been regarded as a [[gay mecca]] for decades as well as being one of the most LGBT friendly cities in the United States.

Like much of Florida, there is a marked wet and dry season in Miami Beach. The tropical rainy season runs from May through October, when showers and late day thunderstorms are common. The dry season is from November through April, when few showers, sunshine, and low humidity prevail. The island location of Miami Beach, however, creates fewer convective thunderstorms, so Miami Beach receives less rainfall in a given year than neighboring areas such as Miami and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]. Proximity to the moderating influence of the Atlantic gives Miami Beach lower high temperatures and higher lows than inland areas of Florida. According to the [[National Weather Service]], other than [[Key West]], Miami Beach is the only U.S. city (mainland) to never report freezing temperatures, with the record low of 32.3 F in January 1989.<ref name=Transmiami>{{Cite web|url=http://transmiami.com/|title=Car Service Miami &#124; Sedan Service Miami &#124; Transmiami Limos|website=transmiami.com}}</ref>\n\nMiami Beach's location on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], near its confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]], make it extraordinarily vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s.

This unfortunate reality of climate change contributes to the City of Miami Beach's $400\u2013500 Million of expenditures to address sea level rise over the next five years. After urgent meetings with city planners and engineers, Miami Beach officials decided on raising roads and installing pumps as the best course of action. Citizens have raised concerns that more pumps will simply exacerbate pollution in the bay, harming wildlife and decreasing biodiversity which in turn could harm tourism. Since they've turned on the pumps, seaside residents have complained of a lower quality of life due to the lack of stingrays, manatees, tarpin, and other wildlife. The tubes pump out a brown soot-like liquid, dangering those residents of lower property values. A hydrologist from Florida International University, Henry Brice\u00f1o, is studying the validity of the city's claims that the output from the pipes is just harmless turbidity in the bay. \u201cRemember,\u201d Brice\u00f1o argues, \u201cwe live here in Miami Beach out of tourism.\u201d Anthropologist Kenny Broad sees that Miami residents understand that their livelihoods are at stake, and they feel the realities of climate change beyond partisan lines. This alarmed mindset is catalyzing support for a proposal to turn a public golf course back into wetlands, a more deep ecology approach than the pump installations.\n\nThe urgency and apparency of flooding coupled with the many other golf courses that the public and tourists can access in Miami have curbed public opposition to an extent, but in preparation for varied public opinion, Miami Beach has proposed three options. The first would not affect the golf course other than retrofitting it with greener, water-absorbing features. The second would repurpose nine holes into wetlands with a recreation center, while the third option goes all the way in a total reimagination of the course into a 145-acre eco-district reminiscent of Central Park in New York City. This move wouldn't be unprecedented: a private conservancy group purchased an aging golf course on Florida's Gulf Coast and repurposed it as a wetland and wildflower preserve.\n\nAdditionally, to accommodate water filtration that the pipes inadequately attempt to clean, the golf course is just one piece of a larger plan to add plant-based systems that will filter water before they enter the high water table of Miami and return to Biscayne Bay. This plan is similar to dealing with sewage through aquatic water treatment plants and steps that other cities such as Houston are beginning to take to increase permeability in their cities for water to drain into.\n\n===Water temperature===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Average coastal water temperature for the Atlantic Ocean based on historical measurements.<ref name=\"water_temperature\">{{cite web|last1=Sun|first1=Charles|title=Coastal Water Temperature Table|url=https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|website=www.nodc.noaa.gov|publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 5, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905202557/https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|archivedate=September 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n!January\n| {{convert|71|F|C|1}}\n!May 1\u201315\n| {{convert|80|F|C|1}}\n!July 16\u201331\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!October 1\u201315\n| {{convert|83|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!February\n| {{convert|73|F|C|1}}\n!May 16\u201331\n| {{convert|81|F|C|1}}\n!August 1\u201315\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!October 16\u201331\n| {{convert|79|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!March\n| {{convert|75|F|C|1}}\n!June 1\u201315\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!August 16\u201331\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!November\n| {{convert|76|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!April 1\u201315\n| {{convert|78|F|C|1}}\n!June 16\u201330\n| {{convert|85|F|C|1}}\n!September 1\u201315\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!December\n| {{convert|73|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!April 16\u201330\n| {{convert|78|F|C|1}}\n!July 1\u201315\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!September 16\u201330\n| {{convert|83|F|C|1}}\n|}\n\n===Surrounding areas===\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Surrounding areas of Miami Beach'''\n|Northwest = [[Biscayne Bay]]\n|North     = [[Indian Creek, Florida|Indian Creek]], [[Surfside, Florida|Surfside]]\n|Northeast = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|West      = [[Biscayne Bay]], [[North Bay Village, Florida|North Bay Village]], [[Miami]], [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|Centre    = Miami Beach\n|East      = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|Southwest = [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|South     = [[Government Cut]], [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|Southeast = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 644\n|1930= 6494\n|1940= 28012\n|1950= 46282\n|1960= 63145\n|1970= 87072\n|1980= 96298\n|1990= 92639\n|2000= 87933\n|2010= 87779\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=91718\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 2em; width: 35%; font-size: 75%;\" \n!colspan=4|Miami Beach demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Miami Beach||Miami-Dade County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||87,779||2,496,435||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||-0.2%||+10.8%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||11,511.1/sq&nbsp;mi||1,315.5/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||87.4%||73.8%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||40.5%||15.4%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||4.4%||18.9%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||53.0%||65.0%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||1.9%||1.5%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.3%||0.2%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.1%||0.0%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (Multiracial)]]||2.7%||2.4%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some Other Race]]||3.2%||3.2%||3.6%\n|}\n\n{{As of|2010}}, those of Hispanic or Latino ancestry accounted for 53.0% of Miami Beach's population.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. But despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's collaborator\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. But despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's collaborator\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

It was called the '''Alliance Premier League''' from 1979 until 1986. Between 1986 and 2015, the league was known as the '''Football Conference'''.<ref name=nl>\"{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32194854 |title=Football Conference to be renamed as National League |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2015}}</ref> \n\nMost of the National League clubs are fully professional, while most National League North and National League South clubs are [[semi-professional]]. The professional clubs are sometimes clubs which have been in the [[English Football League]] (EFL) in the past, as opposed to those which have always been [[Non-League football|non-League]]. The National League is the lowest of the five nationwide football divisions in England, below the [[Premier League]] and the three divisions of the EFL, and is the top tier of the [[National League System]] of non-League football. The National League North and National League South form the sixth tier of English football. The National League consisted of only one division until 2004, but expanded as part of an extensive restructuring of the National League System which took effect beginning with the 2004\u201305 season.\n\n==Organisation==\nThe National League stands at the top of the [[National League System]] (NLS), a comprehensive structure linking together over 50 different leagues under the auspices of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The National League is at ''Step 1'' of the NLS, and National League North and National League South make up ''Step 2''. Above the National League are the 92 [[List of football clubs in England|clubs]] which together make up the highest levels of English football, the [[Premier League]] and the EFL; below the National League are the ''Step 3'' and lower leagues of the NLS.\n\nThe National League has 24 clubs and the North and South divisions have 22 clubs each. Each club plays the others in its division twice during a season, once at home and once away. Clubs earn three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat.\n\nAt the end of each season two clubs are promoted from National League to [[EFL League Two]] and two teams from League Two are relegated to National League to take their place. The two promotion places are awarded to the National League champions and to the winners of the National League Promotion Final from home and away semi finals between those clubs finishing second to seventh in the standings.\n\nAt the other end of the table, the bottom four clubs in National League are relegated to either National League North or National League South. The decision as to which division the relegated club joins is made by the FA's NLS Committee, but is largely determined by geography. The four relegated teams are replaced by four promoted teams, two from National League North and two from National League South. For each of these two leagues this will be the champions and the winners of their respective Promotion Finals between their second to seventh place clubs in those divisions.\n\nAt the bottom of National League North and National League South, three clubs from each division are relegated and these six clubs are divided among the ''Step 3'' leagues of the NLS, the [[Northern Premier League]], the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], and the [[Isthmian League]]. Each of these ''Step 3'' leagues promotes their respective champions and second- to fifth-place playoff winners. The NLS Committee determines which ''Step 3'' leagues the relegated clubs will join, and whether the promoted clubs will join National League North or National League South.\n\nThe clubs relegated from the national division are not always geographically balanced. Thus should it be deemed necessary, the NLS Committee will order one or more clubs from northern counties bordering the south and vice versa or from [[South Wales]] in the sixth tier to switch divisions (to move \"horizontally\" between the leagues, so to speak) so as to maintain numerical balance between North and South.\n\nDue to financial constraints at this level of football, some clubs have escaped relegation despite finishing in a relegation position, due to the misfortune of others. For promotion to proceed, whether from the National League to the EFL, within the National League, or between the various leagues of the NLS, certain conditions concerning finances and facilities must be met. Failure to meet the requirements of the league concerned will prevent the eligible club from being promoted.\n\nThe National League North and South will expand to 24 teams each in the 2021\u201322 season. Expansion was scheduled at first for 2020\u201321<ref name=non-league>{{cite interview |last1=Edkins |first1=Matt |title=EXCLUSIVE: FA outline second phase of Non-League restructuring |url=https://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/features/26633/fa-second-phase-non-league-restructuring/ |work=The Non-League Football Paper |date=17 April 2019}}</ref> until its implementation was deferred.<ref name=thefa>{{cite news |title=Update on non-League, women's & grassroots football seasons |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2020/mar/26/national-league-system-womens-football-pyramid-grassroots-covid-19-update-260320 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |publisher=The Football Association |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe National League was formed in 1979 from leading teams in the Northern Premier League and Southern League and was originally known as the ''Alliance Premier Football League'' and subsequently the ''Football Conference''. Support for such a league came from [[Alan Hardaker]], the long serving [[The Football League|Secretary of the Football League]]. He suggested that an amalgamation of the two strongest lower leagues in England, the [[Northern Premier League]] and the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] would reduce the number of candidates applying to join the Football League under the [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] system then in use. It was also thought it would enable the strongest non-league candidate to emerge. In 1977 the Northern Premier and Southern Leagues agreed to only put forward one candidate each for election to the League and this proved successful with [[Wimbledon F.C.]] and \n[[Wigan Athletic F.C.]] gaining election to the League in 1977 and 1978.<ref name=\"Robinson1\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Michael |title=Non-League Football Tables 1889-2017 |date=2017 |publisher=Soccer Books Ltd |location=Cleethorpes |isbn=978-1-86223-354-6 |page=47}}</ref> It was then agreed that a new league would be set up comprising 13 Southern League teams and 7 sides from the Northern Premier.<ref name=\"Robinson1\"/> \n\nThe founder members were:\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|\n* [[Leamington F.C.|AP Leamington]]\n* [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]]\n* [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]]\n* [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]]\n* [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]]\n* [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]]\n* [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]]\n|\n* [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Gravesend & Northfleet]]\n* [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]]\n* [[Maidstone United F.C.

[[Goole Town F.C.]], [[Lancaster City F.C.]], and [[Mossley A.F.C.]] all did not apply to enter the Alliance. [[Matlock Town F.C.]] and [[Runcorn F.C. Halton|Runcorn F.C.]] were not admitted, as their grounds did not meet the criteria required for the new league. [[Southport F.C.]], who had been voted out of the Football League in 1978, were accepted as members of the new league, but eventually chose not to join it due to concerns over travelling costs.<ref name=\"Robinson3\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Michael |title=Non-League Football Tables 1889-2017 |date=2017 |publisher=Soccer Books Ltd |location=Cleethorpes |isbn=978-1-86223-354-6 |page=48}}</ref> \n\nBarrow and Northwich had previously been members of the EFL. Barrow failed re-election in [[1971\u201372 in English football|1972]], while Northwich resigned from the league in [[1893\u201394 in English football|1894]]. Barnet, Boston, Maidstone, Scarborough and Yeovil have also tasted EFL football since the formation of the National League, but are now back in the National League or its feeder leagues (Scarborough and Maidstone now in new incarnations).\n\nOf the 20 founder members, the last to leave the fifth level were Northwich. They were relegated in 2005, a year after the demise of Telford. Barnet are the only founder member who have remained in the top five levels continuously since 1979.\n\nBangor City has since moved to the [[Welsh football league system]], while AP Leamington, Maidstone, Nuneaton, Scarborough, and Telford later collapsed and were reconstituted in lower English leagues. Gravesend & Northfleet changed its name to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Ebbsfleet United]] in 2007.\n\nThe National League had a single division for the first 25 years of its existence, but since the 2004\u201305 season has consisted of three divisions. The original division was renamed ''Conference National'' (currently ''National League'') and two new regional divisions one level down were introduced, ''Conference North'' and ''Conference South'' (currently National League North and South). The new clubs to form this larger competition were drawn from the Northern Premier League, Southern League, and Isthmian League according to guidelines developed by the NLS Committee.\n\nTwo teams have won the National League three times: [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] (1991, 2005, 2015) and [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] (1995, 1997, 2018). Prior to Barnet's and Macclesfield's third title wins, five other clubs had also become champions twice: [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]] (1980, 1981), [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]] (1983, 1986), [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] (1994, 2000), [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]], (1984, 1989), and [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]] (1996, 2010). Kidderminster also finished second in 1997 and 2013. [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] became the seventh club to win the National League twice (1988, 2017), but subsequent to Barnet's third title. Only Barnet was promoted to the EFL on all three occasions; Maidstone's first title came before the era of automatic promotion, while Kidderminster Harriers, Macclesfield Town and Stevenage Borough were denied promotion because their grounds were not up to the required standard at the time of their first win. However, all three were promoted when they took their second title. Altrincham are the only team in history to retain the title, as at the time there was no automatic promotion to the EFL.\n\nNo former National League club has yet reached the [[Premier League]], although six such clubs did compete in the top tier of football prior to the Premier League, in the [[Football League First Division]]: [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. Five of them have since returned to the League, Luton and Orient by winning the title, and the three others by winning the playoff finals. Additionally Luton and Oxford are the only clubs to have played league matches against each other in all top five tiers of English football. [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford Park Avenue]] also played in the First Division in its previous incarnation, however their current incarnation has only reached as high as the North division.\n\nThe highest League tier a club promoted from the National League has reached is the second-tier [[EFL Championship]], which (as of April 2019) has been reached by five clubs: [[Colchester United]], [[Doncaster Rovers]], Yeovil Town, Luton Town, and [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]].\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nPrior to 1987, in order for National League clubs to enter the EFL, they had to be elected by League members. As a consequence, there was no guarantee that winning the National League would result in promotion, and none of the league's first eight champions were promoted. This changed in 1987, when automatic promotion and relegation between the [[Football League Fourth Division]] and the National League was agreed. The first clubs to be affected by the new system were Lincoln City, who were relegated and replaced by [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]], despite losing 4-0 to [[Nuneaton Borough F.C.|Nuneaton]] on the first day of the season. To make matters even more mental, [[Nuneaton Borough F.C.|Nuneaton]] were relegated that season. However, although the champions of the National League are entitled to a place in the EFL, this was dependent on their stadium meeting the set criteria for membership. This meant that [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]], and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] all avoided relegation from the EFL, although Exeter and Torquay were both relegated to the National League at a later date.\n\nFor three successive years in the 1990s, the National League champions were denied promotion to the EFL on these grounds. Since 1997, when [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] won the title for the second time in three years, every champion has been promoted.\n\nSince 2003, the National League has been awarded a second promotion place. Through 2017, this was decided by a play-off system similar to that of the EFL. The four teams below the National League champions played against each other in semi-finals over two legs, with second playing fifth and third playing fourth. The winners of these ties then played a single final game known as the Promotion Final, with the winners gaining the second promotion place. [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] were the first team to win the Promotion Final.\n\nPrior to 2004, relegation from the National League meant dropping to one of the three feeder leagues below. After [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] failed to avoid expulsion in 2010, three teams were relegated instead of four, to either the [[Northern Premier League]], [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] or [[Isthmian League]], based on geographical criteria. In turn, the champions of these three leagues would be promoted to the National League. The closure of Chester City during the later stages of the 2009\u201310 season was the first mid-season closure of a club in the division since [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in the second half of the 1988\u201389 season; on both occasions, the records of both clubs were expunged.\n\nIn 2004, a restructuring of the National League System saw the creation of a new level immediately below the National League; two regional divisions now named National League North and National League South were created, with the feeder leagues dropping below them. There are two promotion places to the National League's top division  from each regional division&nbsp;\u2013 the champions are promoted automatically, while the remaining place is again decided by semi final play-offs and a Promotion Final. The four teams relegated from the National League (i.e. the highest division) are then allocated to one or other of the regional divisions dependent on their geographical location.\n\nIn May 2017, the National League proposed a revamp in the play-offs for all three divisions. Under the new system, the number of teams playing for promotion was increased to six. The clubs finishing second and third automatically proceed to a semi-final at their home ground, while the clubs in fourth and fifth stage respective qualifying round ties against the teams finishing seventh and sixth. The winners of those matches then complete the semi-final line up.<ref>{{cite news|title=Revealed: Big changes to National League format|url=http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/the-national-league/revealed-big-changes-national-league-format/|publisher=Pitch Hero Ltd.|date=17 May 2017}}</ref> These proposals were approved at the National League's annual general meeting on 10 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/the-national-league/big-changes-national-league-play-offs-confirmed/|title=Big Changes To National League Play-Offs Confirmed|publisher=Pitch Hero Ltd.|date=11 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nAs part of the gradual restructuring of the NLS so that North and South divisions will expand to 24 teams each after the 2020\u201321 season, four clubs in Step 2 will be relegated and eight promoted from all four Step 3 divisions: the division champions and play-off winners.

Very much like the [[EFL Cup]] and [[EFL Trophy]] at the higher levels, it has not always proved popular with fans and was generally viewed as of secondary importance to the [[FA Trophy]].

It was called the '''Alliance Premier League''' from 1979 until 1986. Between 1986 and 2015, the league was known as the '''Football Conference'''.<ref name=nl>\"{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32194854 |title=Football Conference to be renamed as National League |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 April 2015}}</ref> \n\nMost of the National League clubs are fully professional, while most National League North and National League South clubs are [[semi-professional]]. The professional clubs are sometimes clubs which have been in the [[English Football League]] (EFL) in the past, as opposed to those which have always been [[Non-League football|non-League]]. The National League is the lowest of the five nationwide football divisions in England, below the [[Premier League]] and the three divisions of the EFL, and is the top tier of the [[National League System]] of non-League football. The National League North and National League South form the sixth tier of English football. The National League consisted of only one division until 2004, but expanded as part of an extensive restructuring of the National League System which took effect beginning with the 2004\u201305 season.\n\n==Organisation==\nThe National League stands at the top of the [[National League System]] (NLS), a comprehensive structure linking together over 50 different leagues under the auspices of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The National League is at ''Step 1'' of the NLS, and National League North and National League South make up ''Step 2''. Above the National League are the 92 [[List of football clubs in England|clubs]] which together make up the highest levels of English football, the [[Premier League]] and the EFL; below the National League are the ''Step 3'' and lower leagues of the NLS.\n\nThe National League has 24 clubs and the North and South divisions have 22 clubs each. Each club plays the others in its division twice during a season, once at home and once away. Clubs earn three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat.\n\nAt the end of each season two clubs are promoted from National League to [[EFL League Two]] and two teams from League Two are relegated to National League to take their place. The two promotion places are awarded to the National League champions and to the winners of the National League Promotion Final from home and away semi finals between those clubs finishing second to seventh in the standings.\n\nAt the other end of the table, the bottom four clubs in National League are relegated to either National League North or National League South. The decision as to which division the relegated club joins is made by the FA's NLS Committee, but is largely determined by geography. The four relegated teams are replaced by four promoted teams, two from National League North and two from National League South. For each of these two leagues this will be the champions and the winners of their respective Promotion Finals between their second to seventh place clubs in those divisions.\n\nAt the bottom of National League North and National League South, three clubs from each division are relegated and these six clubs are divided among the ''Step 3'' leagues of the NLS, the [[Northern Premier League]], the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], and the [[Isthmian League]]. Each of these ''Step 3'' leagues promotes their respective champions and second- to fifth-place playoff winners. The NLS Committee determines which ''Step 3'' leagues the relegated clubs will join, and whether the promoted clubs will join National League North or National League South.\n\nThe clubs relegated from the national division are not always geographically balanced. Thus should it be deemed necessary, the NLS Committee will order one or more clubs from northern counties bordering the south and vice versa or from [[South Wales]] in the sixth tier to switch divisions (to move \"horizontally\" between the leagues, so to speak) so as to maintain numerical balance between North and South.\n\nDue to financial constraints at this level of football, some clubs have escaped relegation despite finishing in a relegation position, due to the misfortune of others. For promotion to proceed, whether from the National League to the EFL, within the National League, or between the various leagues of the NLS, certain conditions concerning finances and facilities must be met. Failure to meet the requirements of the league concerned will prevent the eligible club from being promoted.\n\nThe National League North and South will expand to 24 teams each in the 2021\u201322 season. Expansion was scheduled at first for 2020\u201321<ref name=non-league>{{cite interview |last1=Edkins |first1=Matt |title=EXCLUSIVE: FA outline second phase of Non-League restructuring |url=https://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/features/26633/fa-second-phase-non-league-restructuring/ |work=The Non-League Football Paper |date=17 April 2019}}</ref> until its implementation was deferred.<ref name=thefa>{{cite news |title=Update on non-League, women's & grassroots football seasons |url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2020/mar/26/national-league-system-womens-football-pyramid-grassroots-covid-19-update-260320 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |publisher=The Football Association |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe National League was formed in 1979 from leading teams in the Northern Premier League and Southern League and was originally known as the ''Alliance Premier Football League'' and subsequently the ''Football Conference''. Support for such a league came from [[Alan Hardaker]], the long serving [[The Football League|Secretary of the Football League]]. He suggested that an amalgamation of the two strongest lower leagues in England, the [[Northern Premier League]] and the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] would reduce the number of candidates applying to join the Football League under the [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] system then in use. It was also thought it would enable the strongest non-league candidate to emerge. In 1977 the Northern Premier and Southern Leagues agreed to only put forward one candidate each for election to the League and this proved successful with [[Wimbledon F.C.]] and \n[[Wigan Athletic F.C.]] gaining election to the League in 1977 and 1978.<ref name=\"Robinson1\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Michael |title=Non-League Football Tables 1889-2017 |date=2017 |publisher=Soccer Books Ltd |location=Cleethorpes |isbn=978-1-86223-354-6 |page=47}}</ref> It was then agreed that a new league would be set up comprising 13 Southern League teams and 7 sides from the Northern Premier.<ref name=\"Robinson1\"/> \n\nThe founder members were:\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|\n* [[Leamington F.C.|AP Leamington]]\n* [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]]\n* [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]]\n* [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]]\n* [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]]\n* [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]]\n* [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]]\n|\n* [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Gravesend & Northfleet]]\n* [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]]\n* [[Maidstone United F.C.

[[Goole Town F.C.]], [[Lancaster City F.C.]], and [[Mossley A.F.C.]] all did not apply to enter the Alliance. [[Matlock Town F.C.]] and [[Runcorn F.C. Halton|Runcorn F.C.]] were not admitted, as their grounds did not meet the criteria required for the new league. [[Southport F.C.]], who had been voted out of the Football League in 1978, were accepted as members of the new league, but eventually chose not to join it due to concerns over travelling costs.<ref name=\"Robinson3\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Michael |title=Non-League Football Tables 1889-2017 |date=2017 |publisher=Soccer Books Ltd |location=Cleethorpes |isbn=978-1-86223-354-6 |page=48}}</ref> \n\nBarrow and Northwich had previously been members of the EFL. Barrow failed re-election in [[1971\u201372 in English football|1972]], while Northwich resigned from the league in [[1893\u201394 in English football|1894]]. Barnet, Boston, Maidstone, Scarborough and Yeovil have also tasted EFL football since the formation of the National League, but are now back in the National League or its feeder leagues (Scarborough and Maidstone now in new incarnations).\n\nOf the 20 founder members, the last to leave the fifth level were Northwich. They were relegated in 2005, a year after the demise of Telford. Barnet are the only founder member who have remained in the top five levels continuously since 1979.\n\nBangor City has since moved to the [[Welsh football league system]], while AP Leamington, Maidstone, Nuneaton, Scarborough, and Telford later collapsed and were reconstituted in lower English leagues. Gravesend & Northfleet changed its name to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Ebbsfleet United]] in 2007.\n\nThe National League had a single division for the first 25 years of its existence, but since the 2004\u201305 season has consisted of three divisions. The original division was renamed ''Conference National'' (currently ''National League'') and two new regional divisions one level down were introduced, ''Conference North'' and ''Conference South'' (currently National League North and South). The new clubs to form this larger competition were drawn from the Northern Premier League, Southern League, and Isthmian League according to guidelines developed by the NLS Committee.\n\nTwo teams have won the National League three times: [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] (1991, 2005, 2015) and [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] (1995, 1997, 2018). Prior to Barnet's and Macclesfield's third title wins, five other clubs had also become champions twice: [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]] (1980, 1981), [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]] (1983, 1986), [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] (1994, 2000), [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]], (1984, 1989), and [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]] (1996, 2010). Kidderminster also finished second in 1997 and 2013. [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] became the seventh club to win the National League twice (1988, 2017), but subsequent to Barnet's third title. Only Barnet was promoted to the EFL on all three occasions; Maidstone's first title came before the era of automatic promotion, while Kidderminster Harriers, Macclesfield Town and Stevenage Borough were denied promotion because their grounds were not up to the required standard at the time of their first win. However, all three were promoted when they took their second title. Altrincham are the only team in history to retain the title, as at the time there was no automatic promotion to the EFL.\n\nNo former National League club has yet reached the [[Premier League]], although six such clubs did compete in the top tier of football prior to the Premier League, in the [[Football League First Division]]: [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. Five of them have since returned to the League, Luton and Orient by winning the title, and the three others by winning the playoff finals. Additionally Luton and Oxford are the only clubs to have played league matches against each other in all top five tiers of English football. [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford Park Avenue]] also played in the First Division in its previous incarnation, however their current incarnation has only reached as high as the North division.\n\nThe highest League tier a club promoted from the National League has reached is the second-tier [[EFL Championship]], which (as of April 2019) has been reached by five clubs: [[Colchester United]], [[Doncaster Rovers]], Yeovil Town, Luton Town, and [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]].\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nPrior to 1987, in order for National League clubs to enter the EFL, they had to be elected by League members. As a consequence, there was no guarantee that winning the National League would result in promotion, and none of the league's first eight champions were promoted. This changed in 1987, when automatic promotion and relegation between the [[Football League Fourth Division]] and the National League was agreed. The first clubs to be affected by the new system were Lincoln City, who were relegated and replaced by [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]], despite losing 4-0 to [[Nuneaton Borough F.C.|Nuneaton]] on the first day of the season. To make matters even more mental, [[Nuneaton Borough F.C.|Nuneaton]] were relegated that season. However, although the champions of the National League are entitled to a place in the EFL, this was dependent on their stadium meeting the set criteria for membership. This meant that [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]], and [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] all avoided relegation from the EFL, although Exeter and Torquay were both relegated to the National League at a later date.\n\nFor three successive years in the 1990s, the National League champions were denied promotion to the EFL on these grounds. Since 1997, when [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] won the title for the second time in three years, every champion has been promoted.\n\nSince 2003, the National League has been awarded a second promotion place. Through 2017, this was decided by a play-off system similar to that of the EFL. The four teams below the National League champions played against each other in semi-finals over two legs, with second playing fifth and third playing fourth. The winners of these ties then played a single final game known as the Promotion Final, with the winners gaining the second promotion place. [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] were the first team to win the Promotion Final.\n\nPrior to 2004, relegation from the National League meant dropping to one of the three feeder leagues below. After [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] failed to avoid expulsion in 2010, three teams were relegated instead of four, to either the [[Northern Premier League]], [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] or [[Isthmian League]], based on geographical criteria. In turn, the champions of these three leagues would be promoted to the National League. The closure of Chester City during the later stages of the 2009\u201310 season was the first mid-season closure of a club in the division since [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in the second half of the 1988\u201389 season; on both occasions, the records of both clubs were expunged.\n\nIn 2004, a restructuring of the National League System saw the creation of a new level immediately below the National League; two regional divisions now named National League North and National League South were created, with the feeder leagues dropping below them. There are two promotion places to the National League's top division  from each regional division&nbsp;\u2013 the champions are promoted automatically, while the remaining place is again decided by semi final play-offs and a Promotion Final. The four teams relegated from the National League (i.e. the highest division) are then allocated to one or other of the regional divisions dependent on their geographical location.\n\nIn May 2017, the National League proposed a revamp in the play-offs for all three divisions. Under the new system, the number of teams playing for promotion was increased to six. The clubs finishing second and third automatically proceed to a semi-final at their home ground, while the clubs in fourth and fifth stage respective qualifying round ties against the teams finishing seventh and sixth. The winners of those matches then complete the semi-final line up.<ref>{{cite news|title=Revealed: Big changes to National League format|url=http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/the-national-league/revealed-big-changes-national-league-format/|publisher=Pitch Hero Ltd.|date=17 May 2017}}</ref> These proposals were approved at the National League's annual general meeting on 10 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/the-national-league/big-changes-national-league-play-offs-confirmed/|title=Big Changes To National League Play-Offs Confirmed|publisher=Pitch Hero Ltd.|date=11 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nAs part of the gradual restructuring of the NLS so that North and South divisions will expand to 24 teams each after the 2020\u201321 season, four clubs in Step 2 will be relegated and eight promoted from all four Step 3 divisions: the division champions and play-off winners.

Citing safety issues, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] has since stopped accepting new entries, so the record will stand.\n\nOn December 4, 1958, Robert Timm and John Cook took off from [[McCarran International Airport|McCarran Airfield]] in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a used Cessna 172, registration number N9172B. They landed back at McCarran Airfield on February 7, 1959, after 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in flight.  The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for the [[Damon Runyon]] Cancer Fund.\n\n===Process===\nFood and water were transferred by matching speeds with a chase car on a straight stretch of road in the desert and hoisting the supplies aboard with a rope and bucket.  Fuel was taken on by hoisting a hose from a fuel truck up to the aircraft, filling an auxiliary belly tank installed for the flight, pumping that fuel into the aircraft's regular tanks and then filling the belly tank again.  The drivers steered while a second person matched speeds with the aircraft with his foot on the vehicle's accelerator pedal.\n\n===Modifications===\n# Engine oil was pumped from the cabin through a tube in the firewall.\n# Only the pilot's seat was installed. The remaining space was used for a pad on which the relief pilot slept.\n# The right cabin door was replaced with an easy-opening, accordion-type door to allow supplies and fuel to be hoisted aboard.\n# Early in the flight, the engine-driven electric generator failed.  A Champion wind-driven generator (turned by a small propeller) was hoisted aboard, taped to the wing support strut, and plugged into the cigarette lighter socket; it served as the aircraft's source of electricity for the rest of the flight.\n\n===Ending the flight===\nThe pilots decided to end the record-setting flight after running the engine 1,558 hours continuously (in addition to several hundred hours already on the engine beforehand, putting it considerably in excess of its normal overhaul interval), deteriorating the engine's power output to the point at which they were barely able to climb away after refuelling. The aircraft is on display in the passenger terminal at [[McCarran International Airport]].

The baggage compartment was increased in size, and nose-mounted dual landing lights were available as an option.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\nThe 1975 model 172M sold for US$16,055 for the 172, US$17,890 for the Skyhawk and US$20,335 for the {{nowrap|Skyhawk II}}.\n\nIn 1976, Cessna stopped marketing the aircraft as the 172 and began exclusively using the \"Skyhawk\" designation. This model year also saw a redesigned instrument panel to hold more avionics. Among other changes, the fuel and other small gauges were relocated to the left side for improved pilot readability compared with the earlier 172 panel designs.

The \"100\" designation indicated that it was powered by a Lycoming O-320-H2AD, {{convert|160|hp|kW|0}} engine designed to run on 100-octane fuel, whereas all previous engines used 80/87 fuel. But this engine proved troublesome, and it was replaced by the similarly rated O-320-D2J to create the 1981 172P.\n\nThe 1977 \"N\" model 172 also introduced rudder trim as an option and standard \"pre-selectable\" flaps. The price was US$22,300, with the {{nowrap|Skyhawk/100 II}} selling for US$29,950.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\nThe 1978 model brought a 28-volt electrical system to replace the previous 14-volt system.

The [[Lycoming O-320|Lycoming O-320-D2J]] was a great improvement.\n\nThe \"P\" model also saw the maximum flap deflection decreased from 40 degrees to 30 to allow a gross weight increase from {{convert|2300|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2400|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. A [[wet wing]] was optional, with a capacity of 62 [[US gallon]]s of fuel.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\nThe price of a new Skyhawk P was US$33,950, with the Skyhawk {{nowrap|P II}} costing US$37,810 and the Nav/Pac equipped Skyhawk {{nowrap|P II}} selling for US$42,460.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\nIn 1982, the \"P\" saw the landing lights moved from the nose to the wing to increase bulb life. The 1983 model added some minor soundproofing improvements and thicker windows.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\nA second door latch pin was introduced in 1984.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>\n\nProduction of the \"P\" ended in 1986, and no more 172s were built for eleven years as legal liability rulings in the US had pushed Cessna's insurance costs too high, resulting in dramatically increasing prices for new aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nThere were only 195 172s built in 1984, a rate of fewer than four per week.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n<div id=\"18\"></div>\n;{{visible anchor|172Q Cutlass}}\nThe 172Q was introduced in 1983 and given the name Cutlass to create an affiliation with the 172RG, although it was actually a 172P with a [[Lycoming O-360|Lycoming O-360-A4N]] engine of {{convert|180|hp|kW|0}}.

Citing safety issues, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] has since stopped accepting new entries, so the record will stand.\n\nOn December 4, 1958, Robert Timm and John Cook took off from [[McCarran International Airport|McCarran Airfield]] in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a used Cessna 172, registration number N9172B. They landed back at McCarran Airfield on February 7, 1959, after 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in flight.  The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for the [[Damon Runyon]] Cancer Fund.\n\n===Process===\nFood and water were transferred by matching speeds with a chase car on a straight stretch of road in the desert and hoisting the supplies aboard with a rope and bucket.  Fuel was taken on by hoisting a hose from a fuel truck up to the aircraft, filling an auxiliary belly tank installed for the flight, pumping that fuel into the aircraft's regular tanks and then filling the belly tank again.  The drivers steered while a second person matched speeds with the aircraft with his foot on the vehicle's accelerator pedal.\n\n===Modifications===\n# Engine oil was pumped from the cabin through a tube in the firewall.\n# Only the pilot's seat was installed. The remaining space was used for a pad on which the relief pilot slept.\n# The right cabin door was replaced with an easy-opening, accordion-type door to allow supplies and fuel to be hoisted aboard.\n# Early in the flight, the engine-driven electric generator failed.  A Champion wind-driven generator (turned by a small propeller) was hoisted aboard, taped to the wing support strut, and plugged into the cigarette lighter socket; it served as the aircraft's source of electricity for the rest of the flight.\n\n===Ending the flight===\nThe pilots decided to end the record-setting flight after running the engine 1,558 hours continuously (in addition to several hundred hours already on the engine beforehand, putting it considerably in excess of its normal overhaul interval), deteriorating the engine's power output to the point at which they were barely able to climb away after refuelling. The aircraft is on display in the passenger terminal at [[McCarran International Airport]].  Photos and details of the record flight can be seen in a small museum on the upper level of the baggage claim area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trivia-library.com/c/time-and-history-353-pm-longest-air-flight-in-history-begins.htm|title=Trivia on Time and History 3:53 P.M.

The plane was intercepted and followed by [[NORAD]] [[F-16]]s, finally landing on Highway 60 in [[Ellsinore, Missouri]], after a seven-hour flight. The student pilot, a Canadian citizen born in [[Turkey]], Adam Dylan Leon, formerly known as Yavuz Berke, was suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and attempted to commit suicide by being shot down. Instead, he was arrested shortly after landing. On November 3, 2009, he was sentenced to two years in a US federal prison after he pleaded guilty in August 2009 to all three charges against him: interstate transportation of a stolen aircraft, importation of a stolen aircraft, and illegal entry. College procedures at the time permitted students access to aircraft and the keys were routinely left in the aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7273710&page=1|title = Stolen Cessna's Pilot Captured|accessdate = 2009-04-06|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090408042308/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7273710&page=1|archive-date = 2009-04-08|url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC07Apr09\">{{cite news|url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pilot-charged-after-plane-leads-u-s-fighter-jets-over-4-states-1.783135|title = Pilot charged after plane leads U.S. fighter jets over 4 states|accessdate = 2009-04-07|last = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date = April 2009|work = CBC News|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090408184642/https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pilot-charged-after-plane-leads-u-s-fighter-jets-over-4-states-1.783135|archive-date = 2009-04-08|url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"AvWeb07Apr09\">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/PilotArrestedAfterPlaneChase_200094-1.html|title = Pilot Arrested After Plane Chase|accessdate = 2009-04-07|last = Niles|first = Russ|date = April 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090411055946/http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/PilotArrestedAfterPlaneChase_200094-1.html|archive-date = 2009-04-11|url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"AvWeb07Apr09A\">{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/SchoolReviewsSecurityAfter172Theft_200104-1.html|title = School Reviews Security After 172 Theft (Corrected)|accessdate = 2009-04-07|last = Niles|first = Russ|date = April 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090414100347/http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/SchoolReviewsSecurityAfter172Theft_200104-1.html|archive-date = 2009-04-14|url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC03Nov09\">{{cite news|url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-jailed-for-flying-stolen-plane-into-u-s-1.835881|title = Canadian jailed for flying stolen plane into U.S.|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date = November 2009|work = CBC News|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091107200352/https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-jailed-for-flying-stolen-plane-into-u-s-1.835881|archive-date = 2009-11-07|url-status = live}}</ref>\n*On October 9, 2013, a passenger in G-BCYR made a successful emergency landing at [[Humberside Airport]], United Kingdom, after the pilot was incapacitated.

It was situated between the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadion (Budapest Metro)|Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadion]] and the [[Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar (Budapest Metro)|Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar]] metro stations. It was used mainly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium, which was an all-seater, had a capacity of 38,652, though its original capacity exceeded 100,000. The stadium was closed in 2016 and demolished in 2017 to give place to the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion bej\u00e1rat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The entrance of the stadium]]\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion makettje az 1952. \u00e1prilis 4 \u00fcnneps\u00e9gen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The plan of the stadium]]\n\nThe first plan of a national stadium were drafted as early as 1896 when there were chances that Budapest would host the first modern [[Olympic Games]].\n\nIn 1911 Budapest was one of the frontrunners to host the [[1920 Olympics]].  However, after [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in [[World War I]], the Games were awarded to [[Antwerp]] instead.\n\nThe location of the first plan included [[Budapest XI. ker\u00fclete|Budapest XI. district]] and [[Budapest X. ker\u00fclete|Budapest X. district]].\n\nIn 1924 the government imposed a sport tax which was supposed to be use for the construction of a new national stadium, but finally this money was not used for the construction.\n\nThe stadium was built between 1948 and 1953 using a large number of volunteers, including soldiers. It opened in 1953 as ''N\u00e9pstadion''' (\"People's Stadium\").  Less than one year later, on 23 May 1954, the [[England national football team#Post-war|English football team]] suffered its worst ever defeat here (7\u20131).\n\nOn 14 August 2002 [[Zalaegerszegi TE]] moved their [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifying match first leg from their home ground to this stadium in order to host [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in order to accommodate a 40,000 crowd. They were rewarded with Zalaegerszeg scoring their most famous European victory, winning 1\u20130 with [[B\u00e9la Kopl\u00e1rovics]] becoming the hero with a 92nd-minute winner. Zalaegerszegi lost the return leg at [[Old Trafford]] 0\u20135 and went out of the competition 1\u20135 on aggregate.\n\nIn 2002, the stadium was renamed in honour of [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]], widely regarded as the best striker in the world in his time and Hungary's greatest footballer ever, who was the star of the national team during its glory years of the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{in

It was situated between the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadion (Budapest Metro)|Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadion]] and the [[Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar (Budapest Metro)|Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar]] metro stations. It was used mainly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium, which was an all-seater, had a capacity of 38,652, though its original capacity exceeded 100,000. The stadium was closed in 2016 and demolished in 2017 to give place to the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion bej\u00e1rat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The entrance of the stadium]]\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion makettje az 1952. \u00e1prilis 4 \u00fcnneps\u00e9gen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The plan of the stadium]]\n\nThe first plan of a national stadium were drafted as early as 1896 when there were chances that Budapest would host the first modern [[Olympic Games]].\n\nIn 1911 Budapest was one of the frontrunners to host the [[1920 Olympics]].  However, after [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in [[World War I]], the Games were awarded to [[Antwerp]] instead.\n\nThe location of the first plan included [[Budapest XI. ker\u00fclete|Budapest XI. district]] and [[Budapest X. ker\u00fclete|Budapest X. district]].\n\nIn 1924 the government imposed a sport tax which was supposed to be use for the construction of a new national stadium, but finally this money was not used for the construction.\n\nThe stadium was built between 1948 and 1953 using a large number of volunteers, including soldiers. It opened in 1953 as ''N\u00e9pstadion''' (\"People's Stadium\").  Less than one year later, on 23 May 1954, the [[England national football team#Post-war|English football team]] suffered its worst ever defeat here (7\u20131).\n\nOn 14 August 2002 [[Zalaegerszegi TE]] moved their [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifying match first leg from their home ground to this stadium in order to host [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in order to accommodate a 40,000 crowd. They were rewarded with Zalaegerszeg scoring their most famous European victory, winning 1\u20130 with [[B\u00e9la Kopl\u00e1rovics]] becoming the hero with a 92nd-minute winner. Zalaegerszegi lost the return leg at [[Old Trafford]] 0\u20135 and went out of the competition 1\u20135 on aggregate.\n\nIn 2002, the stadium was renamed in honour of [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]], widely regarded as the best striker in the world in his time and Hungary's greatest footballer ever, who was the star of the national team during its glory years of the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{in

The contestants in turn each receive 5 questions regarding their specialist subject areas (\"The Experts' Round\"), followed by questions from a subject Gleeson chooses (\"Tom's Round\") and then [[general knowledge]] questions (\"The People's Round\"). Contestants receive 5 points for answering a question correctly, and lose 5 points for answering a question incorrectly.  During the Experts' Round, a contestant may attempt to answer a question from another contestant's subject area. This is known as \"The Steal\". If a Steal is successful, the contestant receives 10 points but will only lose 5 points for an incorrect Steal attempt (in series 1, a failed Steal resulted in the contestant losing 10 points).  The contestant with the lowest score at the end of both the Experts Round and The People's Round are eliminated from the show. In the event of a tie for lowest scorer, the tie is broken with a Hard-Off, where Gleeson presents two options for a given question (often pertaining to the relative difficulty of two given tasks or physical hardness of two materials), which the first contestant to buzz in then answers. If the answering contestant chooses correctly, the other contestant is eliminated and vice versa if the answer given is incorrect. The final two contestants answer questions regarding their chosen subject area in a best of 5 [[penalty shootout]]-style format, with the winner receiving a trophy \u2013 the Hard Quiz Big Brass Mug.\n\n==Series Overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = skyblue\n| link1      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 1 (2016)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2016|12|21|df=y}}\n\n| color2     = orange\n| link2      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 2 (2017)\n| episodes2  = 18\n| start2     = {{Start date|2017|8|2|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2017|11|29|df=y}}\n\n| color3     = #C8A2C8\n| link3      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 3 (2018-19)\n| episodes3  = 22\n| start3     = {{Start date|2018|2|21|df=y}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2019|1|30|df=y}}\n\n| color4     = #FBCEB1\n| link4      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 4 (2019)\n| episodes4  = 20 + [[<includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#ep71|1 Special]]\n| start4     = {{Start date|2019|2|6|df=y}}\n| end4       = {{End date|2019|10|2|df=y}}\n\n| color5     = #9D296E\n| link5      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 5 (2020)\n| episodes5  = 40<ref name=\"TVBlackbox\" />\n| start5     = {{Start date|2020|2|5|df=y}}\n| end5       = \n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n\n''Names in '''Bold''' are the winners''\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=skyblue |overall=5 |title=16 |viewers=16 |airdate=16 |viewersT=Australian viewers |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| RTitle          = \"Episode 1\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 681,000<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Timeshifted: Wednesday 19 October 2016|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/10/timeshifted-wednesday-19-october-2016.html|website=TV Tonight|date=29 October 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Quizzers:<br>Sue -

The contestants in turn each receive 5 questions regarding their specialist subject areas (\"The Experts' Round\"), followed by questions from a subject Gleeson chooses (\"Tom's Round\") and then [[general knowledge]] questions (\"The People's Round\"). Contestants receive 5 points for answering a question correctly, and lose 5 points for answering a question incorrectly.  During the Experts' Round, a contestant may attempt to answer a question from another contestant's subject area. This is known as \"The Steal\". If a Steal is successful, the contestant receives 10 points but will only lose 5 points for an incorrect Steal attempt (in series 1, a failed Steal resulted in the contestant losing 10 points).  The contestant with the lowest score at the end of both the Experts Round and The People's Round are eliminated from the show. In the event of a tie for lowest scorer, the tie is broken with a Hard-Off, where Gleeson presents two options for a given question (often pertaining to the relative difficulty of two given tasks or physical hardness of two materials), which the first contestant to buzz in then answers. If the answering contestant chooses correctly, the other contestant is eliminated and vice versa if the answer given is incorrect. The final two contestants answer questions regarding their chosen subject area in a best of 5 [[penalty shootout]]-style format, with the winner receiving a trophy \u2013 the Hard Quiz Big Brass Mug.\n\n==Series Overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = skyblue\n| link1      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 1 (2016)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2016|12|21|df=y}}\n\n| color2     = orange\n| link2      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 2 (2017)\n| episodes2  = 18\n| start2     = {{Start date|2017|8|2|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2017|11|29|df=y}}\n\n| color3     = #C8A2C8\n| link3      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 3 (2018-19)\n| episodes3  = 22\n| start3     = {{Start date|2018|2|21|df=y}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2019|1|30|df=y}}\n\n| color4     = #FBCEB1\n| link4      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 4 (2019)\n| episodes4  = 20 + [[<includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#ep71|1 Special]]\n| start4     = {{Start date|2019|2|6|df=y}}\n| end4       = {{End date|2019|10|2|df=y}}\n\n| color5     = #9D296E\n| link5      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 5 (2020)\n| episodes5  = 40<ref name=\"TVBlackbox\" />\n| start5     = {{Start date|2020|2|5|df=y}}\n| end5       = \n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n\n''Names in '''Bold''' are the winners''\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=skyblue |overall=5 |title=16 |viewers=16 |airdate=16 |viewersT=Australian viewers |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| RTitle          = \"Episode 1\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 681,000<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Timeshifted: Wednesday 19 October 2016|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/10/timeshifted-wednesday-19-october-2016.html|website=TV Tonight|date=29 October 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Quizzers:<br>Sue -

The role was played by Shaffer during the show's entire nine-season run, from 2009 to 2018. Brick is the youngest of the three Heck siblings, and is highly intelligent and smarter than most people his age. He loves to read and has an ongoing fascination with [[font]]s. Brick is socially awkward, and repeatedly overlooked by the members of his family, such as via forgotten birthdays. The series and its cast were nominated dozens of times for awards, and won over a dozen collectively.\n\nIn a ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine interview published in January 2013, Shaffer said his role as Brick was very similar to his own life, as he is also a \"big reader\" and \"nerd[s] out over the weirdest stuff\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/frankenweenie-atticus-shaffer/ |title=5 Questions With Frankenweenie Actor Atticus Shaffer |date=January 8, 2013 |magazine=Wired |first=Rachel |last=Cericola |access-date=January 14, 2019 }}</ref> In May 2011, a ''[[TV Guide]]'' article had reported the closeness as well.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/middle-atticus-shaffer-1033230/ |title=Meet 'The Middle' Scene Stealer Atticus Shaffer |date=May 18, 2011 |magazine=TV Guide |first=David |last=Hochman |access-date=January 14, 2019 |quote=Shaffer is a lot like Brick, the character he plays on 'The Middle'. }}</ref> Brick's characterization, including his idiosyncratic [[palilalia]]n repetition of words and phrases at the end of sentences, is actually based on ''The Middle'' co-creator Eileen Heisler's son, Justin.<ref name=weird>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/arts/television/09atticus.html |title=Everybody Loves the Weird Kid |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Brooks |last=Barnes |date=May 6, 2010 |access-date=January 14, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nShaffer, named after [[Atticus Finch]], the lawyer in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', was born in [[Santa Clarita, California]], the son of Ron and Debbie Shaffer.

The role was played by Shaffer during the show's entire nine-season run, from 2009 to 2018. Brick is the youngest of the three Heck siblings, and is highly intelligent and smarter than most people his age. He loves to read and has an ongoing fascination with [[font]]s. Brick is socially awkward, and repeatedly overlooked by the members of his family, such as via forgotten birthdays. The series and its cast were nominated dozens of times for awards, and won over a dozen collectively.\n\nIn a ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine interview published in January 2013, Shaffer said his role as Brick was very similar to his own life, as he is also a \"big reader\" and \"nerd[s] out over the weirdest stuff\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/frankenweenie-atticus-shaffer/ |title=5 Questions With Frankenweenie Actor Atticus Shaffer |date=January 8, 2013 |magazine=Wired |first=Rachel |last=Cericola |access-date=January 14, 2019 }}</ref> In May 2011, a ''[[TV Guide]]'' article had reported the closeness as well.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/middle-atticus-shaffer-1033230/ |title=Meet 'The Middle' Scene Stealer Atticus Shaffer |date=May 18, 2011 |magazine=TV Guide |first=David |last=Hochman |access-date=January 14, 2019 |quote=Shaffer is a lot like Brick, the character he plays on 'The Middle'. }}</ref> Brick's characterization, including his idiosyncratic [[palilalia]]n repetition of words and phrases at the end of sentences, is actually based on ''The Middle'' co-creator Eileen Heisler's son, Justin.<ref name=weird>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/arts/television/09atticus.html |title=Everybody Loves the Weird Kid |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Brooks |last=Barnes |date=May 6, 2010 |access-date=January 14, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nShaffer, named after [[Atticus Finch]], the lawyer in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', was born in [[Santa Clarita, California]], the son of Ron and Debbie Shaffer.

Guided ascents are popular during summer months.\n\nVillarrica, with its [[lava]] of [[basaltic]]-[[andesitic]] composition, is one of a small number worldwide known to have an active (but in this case intermittent) [[lava lake]] within its [[volcanic crater|crater]]. The volcano usually generates [[strombolian eruption]]s with ejection of [[incandescent]] [[pyroclast]]s and lava flows. Rainfall plus melted snow and [[glacier|glacier ice]] can cause massive [[lahar]]s (mud and debris flows), such as during the eruptions of 1964 and 1971.\n\nVillarrica is one of 9 volcanoes currently monitored by the [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]]. The project is collecting data on the [[carbon dioxide]] and [[Sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]] emission rates from [[Subaerial eruption|subaerial volcanoes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DECADE Installations at Turrialba and Po\u00e1s|url=https://deepcarbon.net/feature/decade-installations-turrialba-and-po\u00e1s#.V-ltH2MomXh|website=Deep Carbon Observatory|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and geology==\nVillarica stands just east of the [[Chilean Central Valley]] as the westernmost of an alignment of three large [[stratovolcano]]es. The alignment is attributed to the existence of an old fracture in the crust, the North West-South East trending [[Mocha-Villarrica Fault Zone]],<ref name=\"Dzierma 2012\"/> the other volcanoes in the chain, [[Quetrupill\u00e1n]] and [[Lan\u00edn]], are far less active. The alignment is unusual as it crosses the N-S running [[Liqui\u00f1e-Ofqui Fault]], along which several active volcanoes are aligned.<ref name=\"Sernageom\">[http://www2.sernageomin.cl/ovdas/ovdas7/volcan_villarrica.pdf Volc\u00e1n Villarrica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220164629/http://www2.sernageomin.cl/ovdas/ovdas7/volcan_villarrica.pdf |date=2012-02-20 }} [[OVDAS]]</ref>\n\nVillarrica covers an area of 400&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and has an estimated volume of 250&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>. It contains volcanic caves and about 26 [[scoria cone]]s. The constant degassing at the lava lake turns the otherwise quite effusive lava more viscous, heightening its explosive potential. Two large [[ignimbrite]] layers are visible; the Lic\u00e1n Ignimbrite and the more recent Puc\u00f3n Ignimbrite.<ref name=\"Sernageom\"/>\n\nVillarrica emerged during the [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] and grew forming a large stratocone of similar dimensions to the current edifice. 100,000 years ago during the [[Eemian|Valdivia Interglacial]] the ancestral Villarrica collapsed following an eruption and formed a large elliptical [[caldera]] of 6.5 and 4.2&nbsp;km in diameter. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation]] Villarrica produced [[pyroclastic flow]] deposits, subglacial [[andesite]] lavas and [[dacite]] dykes. It collapsed once again 13,700 years ago forming a new smaller caldera, among other pyroclastic flows the Lic\u00e1n Ignimbrite has been related to this event. Beginning with the Lic\u00e1n Ignimbrite, generated just after the last deglaciation, activity continued in similar fashion. The Puc\u00f3n Ignimbrite was ejected during a minor collapse of the uppermost stratocone 3,700 years ago.<ref>Sterns ''et al.'' in Teresa Moreno and Wes Gibbons (eds.)

It contains volcanic caves and about 26 [[scoria cone]]s. The constant degassing at the lava lake turns the otherwise quite effusive lava more viscous, heightening its explosive potential. Two large [[ignimbrite]] layers are visible; the Lic\u00e1n Ignimbrite and the more recent Puc\u00f3n Ignimbrite.<ref name=\"Sernageom\"/>\n\nVillarrica emerged during the [[Pleistocene|Middle Pleistocene]] and grew forming a large stratocone of similar dimensions to the current edifice. 100,000 years ago during the [[Eemian|Valdivia Interglacial]] the ancestral Villarrica collapsed following an eruption and formed a large elliptical [[caldera]] of 6.5 and 4.2&nbsp;km in diameter. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation]] Villarrica produced [[pyroclastic flow]] deposits, subglacial [[andesite]] lavas and [[dacite]] dykes. It collapsed once again 13,700 years ago forming a new smaller caldera, among other pyroclastic flows the Lic\u00e1n Ignimbrite has been related to this event. Beginning with the Lic\u00e1n Ignimbrite, generated just after the last deglaciation, activity continued in similar fashion. The Puc\u00f3n Ignimbrite was ejected during a minor collapse of the uppermost stratocone 3,700 years ago.<ref>Sterns ''et al.'' in Teresa Moreno and Wes Gibbons (eds.)
