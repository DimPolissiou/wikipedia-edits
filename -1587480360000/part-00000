Many such shelters were constructed as [[civil defense]] measures during the [[Cold War]].\n\nDuring a nuclear explosion, matter vaporized in the resulting fireball is exposed to neutrons from the explosion, absorbs them, and becomes [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. When this material condenses in the rain, it forms dust and light sandy materials that resemble ground [[pumice]]. The fallout emits [[Alpha particle|alpha]] and [[beta particle]]s, as well as [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nMuch of this highly radioactive material falls to earth, subjecting anything within the line of sight to radiation, becoming a significant [[radioactive contamination|hazard]]. A fallout shelter is designed to allow its occupants to minimize exposure to harmful fallout until radioactivity has [[Radioactive decay|decayed]] to a safer level.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Fallout shelter photo.png|thumb|Idealized American fallout shelter, around 1957.]]\n\n=== North America ===\nDuring the [[Cold War]], many countries built fallout shelters for high-ranking government officials and crucial military facilities, such as [[Project Greek Island]] and the [[Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker]] in the United States and Canada's [[Emergency Government Headquarters]].

These buildings were [[placard]]ed with the orange-yellow and black [[trefoil]] sign designed by [[United States  Dies at 95 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/robert-blakeley-whose-fallout-shelter-sign-symbolized-the-cold-war-dies-at-95.html?_r=0 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805160704/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/robert-blakeley-whose-fallout-shelter-sign-symbolized-the-cold-war-dies-at-95.html?_r=0 |archivedate=5 August 2018 |language=English |date=27 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Emergency Alarm Repeater]] (NEAR) program was developed in the United States in 1956 during the [[Cold War]] to supplement the existing siren [[warning systems]] and radio broadcasts in the event of a [[nuclear attack]].

fallout and air raid shelter inside the basement parking garage of a hotel in Germany.]]\n\n=== Shielding ===\nA basic fallout shelter consists of shields that reduce gamma ray exposure by a factor of 1000. The required shielding can be accomplished with 10 times the [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|thickness]] of any quantity of material capable of cutting gamma ray exposure in half. Shields that reduce gamma ray intensity by 50% (1/2) include 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;inch) of lead, 6&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;inches) of concrete, 9&nbsp;cm (3.6&nbsp;inches) of packed earth or 150&nbsp;m (500&nbsp;ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding multiplies. Thus, a practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of packed earth, reducing gamma rays by approximately 1024 times (2<sup>10</sup>).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/emergency/hardened.html|title=Halving-thickness for various materials|publisher=\"The Compass DeRose Guide to Emergency Preparedness&nbsp;\u2013 Hardened Shelters\"}}</ref>\n\nUsually, an expedient purpose-built fallout shelter is a trench; with a strong roof buried by 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) of earth. The two ends of the trench have ramps or entrances at right angles to the trench, so that gamma rays cannot enter (they can travel only in straight lines). To make the overburden waterproof (in case of rain), a plastic sheet may be buried a few inches below the surface and held down with rocks or bricks.<ref name=NWSS6>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=37\u201345|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm|quote=\"The 3-foot thickness of earth shown (or a 2-foot thickness of concrete) will provide an effective barrier, attenuating (absorbing) about 99.9%, of all gamma rays from fallout.\" \"A right-angle turn, either from a vertical or horizontal entry, causes a reduction of about 90%.\" \"...a large piece of 4-mil-thick polyethylene was placed over the mound.

The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air.

Alpha particles are identical to a helium-4 nucleus (two protons and two neutrons), and travel at speeds in excess of 5% of the speed of light. [[Alpha particle]]s have little penetrating power; most cannot penetrate through human skin. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent injury from alpha radiation.<ref name=NWSSC>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=45|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Beta (\u03b2) ===\n[[Beta particle|Beta radiation]] consists of particles (high-speed electrons) given off by some fallout. Most beta particles cannot penetrate more than about 10 feet (3 metres) of air or about {{frac|1|8}} inch (3 millimetres) of water, wood, or human body tissue; or a sheet of aluminum foil. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent most injuries from beta radiation.<ref name=NWSSD/>\n\nThe primary dangers associated with beta radiation are internal exposure from ingested fallout particles and beta burns from fallout particles no more than a few days old. [[Beta burn]]s can result from contact with highly radioactive particles on bare skin; ordinary clothing separating fresh fallout particles from the skin can provide significant shielding.<ref name=NWSSD>{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |page=44 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Gamma (\u03b3) ===\n[[Gamma ray|Gamma radiation]] penetrates further through matter than alpha or beta radiation. Most of the design of a typical fallout shelter is intended to protect against gamma [[electromagnetic radiation|rays]]. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. Thus, lead is only modestly better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material such as aluminum, concrete, water or soil.\n\nSome gamma radiation from fallout will penetrate into even the best shelters. However, the radiation dose received while inside a shelter can be significantly reduced with proper shielding. Ten [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|halving thicknesses]] of a given material can reduce gamma exposure to less than {{frac|1|1000}} of unshielded exposure.<ref name=NWSSE>{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=11\u201320 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Weapons versus nuclear accident fallout ==\nThe bulk of the [[radioactivity]] in nuclear accident fallout is more long-lived than that in [[fallout|weapons fallout]]. A good table of the [[nuclide]]s, such as that provided by the [[Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute]], includes the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] yields of the different nuclides. From this data it is possible to calculate the isotopic mixture in the fallout (due to [[fission products]] in bomb fallout).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== Other matters and simple improvements ==\nWhile a person's home may not be a purpose-made shelter, it could be thought of as one if measures are taken to improve the degree of [[Radiation protection|fallout protection]].\n\n=== Measures to lower the beta dose ===\nThe main threat of [[Radiation#Beta|beta radiation]] exposure comes from ''[[hot particle]]s'' in contact with or close to the skin of a person. Also, swallowed or inhaled hot particles could cause [[beta burn]]s. As it is important to avoid bringing hot particles into the shelter, one option is to remove one's outer clothing, or follow other [[human decontamination|decontamination procedures]], on entry. Fallout particles will cease to be radioactive enough to cause beta burns within a few days following a nuclear explosion.

This reduces the dose rate as the gamma rays have to pass through the topsoil before they can irradiate anything above.\n* Nearby roads can be rinsed and washed down to remove dust and debris; the [[fallout]] would collect in the sewers and gutters for easier disposal. In [[Kiev]] after the [[Chernobyl accident]] a program of road washing was used to control the spread of radioactivity.\n* Windows can be bricked up, or the sill raised to reduce the hole in the shielding formed by the wall.\n* Gaps in the shielding can be blocked using containers of water. While water has a much lower density than that of lead, it is still able to shield some gamma rays.\n* Earth (or other dense material) can be heaped up against the exposed walls of the building; this forces the gamma rays to pass through a thicker layer of shielding before entering the house.\n* Nearby trees can be removed to reduce the dose due to fallout which is on the branches and leaves. It has been suggested by the US government that a fallout shelter should not be dug close to trees for this reason.<ref name=NWSSB>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=39|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Fallout shelters in popular culture ==\n[[File:United States Fallout Shelter Sign.svg|thumb|Robert W.

Many such shelters were constructed as [[civil defense]] measures during the [[Cold War]].\n\nDuring a nuclear explosion, matter vaporized in the resulting fireball is exposed to neutrons from the explosion, absorbs them, and becomes [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. When this material condenses in the rain, it forms dust and light sandy materials that resemble ground [[pumice]]. The fallout emits [[Alpha particle|alpha]] and [[beta particle]]s, as well as [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nMuch of this highly radioactive material falls to earth, subjecting anything within the line of sight to radiation, becoming a significant [[radioactive contamination|hazard]]. A fallout shelter is designed to allow its occupants to minimize exposure to harmful fallout until radioactivity has [[Radioactive decay|decayed]] to a safer level.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Fallout shelter photo.png|thumb|Idealized American fallout shelter, around 1957.]]\n\n=== North America ===\nDuring the [[Cold War]], many countries built fallout shelters for high-ranking government officials and crucial military facilities, such as [[Project Greek Island]] and the [[Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker]] in the United States and Canada's [[Emergency Government Headquarters]].

fallout and air raid shelter inside the basement parking garage of a hotel in Germany.]]\n\n=== Shielding ===\nA basic fallout shelter consists of shields that reduce gamma ray exposure by a factor of 1000. The required shielding can be accomplished with 10 times the [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|thickness]] of any quantity of material capable of cutting gamma ray exposure in half. Shields that reduce gamma ray intensity by 50% (1/2) include 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;inch) of lead, 6&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;inches) of concrete, 9&nbsp;cm (3.6&nbsp;inches) of packed earth or 150&nbsp;m (500&nbsp;ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding multiplies. Thus, a practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of packed earth, reducing gamma rays by approximately 1024 times (2<sup>10</sup>).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/emergency/hardened.html|title=Halving-thickness for various materials|publisher=\"The Compass DeRose Guide to Emergency Preparedness&nbsp;\u2013 Hardened Shelters\"}}</ref>\n\nUsually, an expedient purpose-built fallout shelter is a trench; with a strong roof buried by 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) of earth. The two ends of the trench have ramps or entrances at right angles to the trench, so that gamma rays cannot enter (they can travel only in straight lines). To make the overburden waterproof (in case of rain), a plastic sheet may be buried a few inches below the surface and held down with rocks or bricks.<ref name=NWSS6>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=37\u201345|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm|quote=\"The 3-foot thickness of earth shown (or a 2-foot thickness of concrete) will provide an effective barrier, attenuating (absorbing) about 99.9%, of all gamma rays from fallout.\" \"A right-angle turn, either from a vertical or horizontal entry, causes a reduction of about 90%.\" \"...a large piece of 4-mil-thick polyethylene was placed over the mound.

The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air. (This is a [[Kearny air pump]], or KAP, named after the inventor, [[Cresson Kearny]])\n\nUnfiltered air is safe, since the most dangerous fallout has the consistency of sand or finely ground pumice.<ref name=NWSS7/> Such large particles are not easily ingested into the soft tissues of the body, so extensive filters are not required. Any exposure to fine dust is far less hazardous than exposure to the fallout outside the shelter. Dust fine enough to pass the entrance will probably pass through the shelter.<ref name=NWSS7>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year= 1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=51\u201356 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p917.htm}}</ref> Some shelters, however, incorporate [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]-filters for additional protection.\n\n=== Locations ===\nEffective public shelters can be the middle floors of some tall buildings or parking structures, or below ground level in most buildings with more than 10 floors. The thickness of the upper floors must form an effective shield, and the windows of the sheltered area must not view fallout-covered ground that is closer than 1.5&nbsp;km (1&nbsp;mi).

Alpha particles are identical to a helium-4 nucleus (two protons and two neutrons), and travel at speeds in excess of 5% of the speed of light. [[Alpha particle]]s have little penetrating power; most cannot penetrate through human skin. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent injury from alpha radiation.<ref name=NWSSC>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=45|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Beta (\u03b2) ===\n[[Beta particle|Beta radiation]] consists of particles (high-speed electrons) given off by some fallout. Most beta particles cannot penetrate more than about 10 feet (3 metres) of air or about {{frac|1|8}} inch (3 millimetres) of water, wood, or human body tissue; or a sheet of aluminum foil. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent most injuries from beta radiation.<ref name=NWSSD/>\n\nThe primary dangers associated with beta radiation are internal exposure from ingested fallout particles and beta burns from fallout particles no more than a few days old. [[Beta burn]]s can result from contact with highly radioactive particles on bare skin; ordinary clothing separating fresh fallout particles from the skin can provide significant shielding.<ref name=NWSSD>{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |page=44 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Gamma (\u03b3) ===\n[[Gamma ray|Gamma radiation]] penetrates further through matter than alpha or beta radiation. Most of the design of a typical fallout shelter is intended to protect against gamma [[electromagnetic radiation|rays]]. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. Thus, lead is only modestly better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material such as aluminum, concrete, water or soil.\n\nSome gamma radiation from fallout will penetrate into even the best shelters. However, the radiation dose received while inside a shelter can be significantly reduced with proper shielding. Ten [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|halving thicknesses]] of a given material can reduce gamma exposure to less than {{frac|1|1000}} of unshielded exposure.<ref name=NWSSE>{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=11\u201320 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Weapons versus nuclear accident fallout ==\nThe bulk of the [[radioactivity]] in nuclear accident fallout is more long-lived than that in [[fallout|weapons fallout]]. A good table of the [[nuclide]]s, such as that provided by the [[Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute]], includes the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] yields of the different nuclides. From this data it is possible to calculate the isotopic mixture in the fallout (due to [[fission products]] in bomb fallout).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== Other matters and simple improvements ==\nWhile a person's home may not be a purpose-made shelter, it could be thought of as one if measures are taken to improve the degree of [[Radiation protection|fallout protection]].\n\n=== Measures to lower the beta dose ===\nThe main threat of [[Radiation#Beta|beta radiation]] exposure comes from ''[[hot particle]]s'' in contact with or close to the skin of a person. Also, swallowed or inhaled hot particles could cause [[beta burn]]s. As it is important to avoid bringing hot particles into the shelter, one option is to remove one's outer clothing, or follow other [[human decontamination|decontamination procedures]], on entry. Fallout particles will cease to be radioactive enough to cause beta burns within a few days following a nuclear explosion. The danger of gamma radiation will persist for far longer than the threat of beta burns in areas with heavy fallout exposure.<ref name=NWSSA>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=131|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p926.htm#Message2481}}</ref>\n\n=== Measures to lower the gamma dose rate ===\nThe gamma dose rate due to the contamination brought into the shelter on the clothing of a person is likely to be small (by wartime standards) compared to [[Radiation#Gamma|gamma radiation]] that penetrates through the walls of the shelter.<ref name=NWSSA/> The following measures can be taken to reduce the amount of gamma radiation entering the shelter:\n* Roofs and gutters can be cleaned to lower the dose rate in the house.\n* The top inch of soil in the area near the house can be either removed or dug up and mixed with the [[subsoil]]. This reduces the dose rate as the gamma rays have to pass through the topsoil before they can irradiate anything above.\n* Nearby roads can be rinsed and washed down to remove dust and debris; the [[fallout]] would collect in the sewers and gutters for easier disposal. In [[Kiev]] after the [[Chernobyl accident]] a program of road washing was used to control the spread of radioactivity.\n* Windows can be bricked up, or the sill raised to reduce the hole in the shielding formed by the wall.\n* Gaps in the shielding can be blocked using containers of water. While water has a much lower density than that of lead, it is still able to shield some gamma rays.\n* Earth (or other dense material) can be heaped up against the exposed walls of the building; this forces the gamma rays to pass through a thicker layer of shielding before entering the house.\n* Nearby trees can be removed to reduce the dose due to fallout which is on the branches and leaves. It has been suggested by the US government that a fallout shelter should not be dug close to trees for this reason.<ref name=NWSSB>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=39|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Fallout shelters in popular culture ==\n[[File:United States Fallout Shelter Sign.svg|thumb|Robert W.
