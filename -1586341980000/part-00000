She was the vocalist for the band [[Deee-Lite]], followed by a career as a DJ and solo songwriter. She is also known widely for her social, environmental, and human-rights activism.\n\n==Music career==\n===Deee-Lite===\nIn 1986, Kirby met Ukrainian-born Dmitry Brill (\"Supa DJ Dmitry\") in New York, when she made him silver platform boots and a glitter blue spacesuit for his band, Shazork. That same year, she began experimenting with singing and writing music with Brill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Deee-Lite.html|title=Deee-Lite Biography: OLDIES.com|publisher=Oldies.com |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nShortly after their first show in 1986, Brill was introduced to [[Towa Tei]], a Japan-raised Korean DJ who Kirby and Brill invited to join the band several years later. Combining Kirby's vocal and writing talents with Brill's sampling skills and Tei's techno mixing, the three formed the band [[Deee-Lite]]. They had performances every month, with Kier designing new costumes for each one. When the band signed a seven-album deal with [[Elektra Records]] she stopped go-go dancing, which she previously had continued to do at Bentleys and The Copa.\n\nDeee-Lite's sound was a mix of [[house music|house]], [[techno]] and [[Electronic dance music|dance]] elements. Deee-Lite shot to stardom in 1990 with the release of their first album ''[[World Clique]]'' and the hit \"[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\". In [[1991 MTV Video Music Awards|1991]], MTV nominated Deee-Lite for several Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best Dance Video, Best New Artist, Best Breakthrough Video, and Best Editing in a Video.\n\nKirby was very involved in the band's output: writing, producing, and performing the bulk of the band's songs. Known as much for their outrageous personae and costumes as for their music, the three took on larger-than-life alter-egos: Super DJ Dmitri, Jungle DJ Towa Towa, and Lady Miss Kier. Kirby is credited with designing and creating the look of the band, as well as much of the artwork accompanying the band's albums and marketing material. Her initial look relied on revamped and exaggerated retro '60s fashions. Her signature look was a zip-up catsuit, platform shoes and flipped hair-do.\n\nDeee-Lite followed their successful first album with ''[[Infinity Within]]'', a politically charged second album, in 1992. Their third album ''[[Dewdrops in the Garden]]'' was released in 1994 and saw a return to house roots with a new, more naturalistic tone.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Neither of the two follow-up albums matched the commercial success of their debut. The second and third albums were hampered by difficulties with the label, which refused to promote, support touring, or fund contractual videos.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The band functionally broke up during the writing of their third album in 1993, but Kirby and Brill decided to finish the project and tour together to promote the album before going their separate ways. In 1996, a remix album was released, and a greatest hits album was released in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/lady-miss-kier/2006/02/13/1139679507664.html |title=Lady Miss Kier \u2013 Gig Reviews \u2013 Music \u2013 Entertainment|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===International DJ and songwriting solo career===\n[[File:Lady Miss Kier Lounging.jpg|alt=|thumb|Lady Miss Kier Lounging]]\nBrill and Kirby's relationship fractured, and Deee-lite disbanded in 1995.<ref name=\"Smh.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/lady-miss-kier/2006/02/13/1139679507664.html?page=2 |title=Lady Miss Kier \u2013 Gig Reviews \u2013 Music \u2013 Entertainment|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref> \"When Dmitry and I split up, that was the end of the band,\" Kirby said. \"It was sad because I loved the band.

In the late 1990s, she collaborated on the albums of [[Bootsy Collins]], I Kamanchi and [[A Guy Called Gerald]].

She was the vocalist for the band [[Deee-Lite]], followed by a career as a DJ and solo songwriter. She is also known widely for her social, environmental, and human-rights activism.\n\n==Music career==\n===Deee-Lite===\nIn 1986, Kirby met Ukrainian-born Dmitry Brill (\"Supa DJ Dmitry\") in New York, when she made him silver platform boots and a glitter blue spacesuit for his band, Shazork. That same year, she began experimenting with singing and writing music with Brill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Deee-Lite.html|title=Deee-Lite Biography: OLDIES.com|publisher=Oldies.com |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nShortly after their first show in 1986, Brill was introduced to [[Towa Tei]], a Japan-raised Korean DJ who Kirby and Brill invited to join the band several years later. Combining Kirby's vocal and writing talents with Brill's sampling skills and Tei's techno mixing, the three formed the band [[Deee-Lite]]. They had performances every month, with Kier designing new costumes for each one. When the band signed a seven-album deal with [[Elektra Records]] she stopped go-go dancing, which she previously had continued to do at Bentleys and The Copa.\n\nDeee-Lite's sound was a mix of [[house music|house]], [[techno]] and [[Electronic dance music|dance]] elements. Deee-Lite shot to stardom in 1990 with the release of their first album ''[[World Clique]]'' and the hit \"[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\". In [[1991 MTV Video Music Awards|1991]], MTV nominated Deee-Lite for several Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best Dance Video, Best New Artist, Best Breakthrough Video, and Best Editing in a Video.\n\nKirby was very involved in the band's output: writing, producing, and performing the bulk of the band's songs. Known as much for their outrageous personae and costumes as for their music, the three took on larger-than-life alter-egos: Super DJ Dmitri, Jungle DJ Towa Towa, and Lady Miss Kier. Kirby is credited with designing and creating the look of the band, as well as much of the artwork accompanying the band's albums and marketing material. Her initial look relied on revamped and exaggerated retro '60s fashions. Her signature look was a zip-up catsuit, platform shoes and flipped hair-do.\n\nDeee-Lite followed their successful first album with ''[[Infinity Within]]'', a politically charged second album, in 1992. Their third album ''[[Dewdrops in the Garden]]'' was released in 1994 and saw a return to house roots with a new, more naturalistic tone.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Neither of the two follow-up albums matched the commercial success of their debut. The second and third albums were hampered by difficulties with the label, which refused to promote, support touring, or fund contractual videos.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The band functionally broke up during the writing of their third album in 1993, but Kirby and Brill decided to finish the project and tour together to promote the album before going their separate ways. In 1996, a remix album was released, and a greatest hits album was released in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/lady-miss-kier/2006/02/13/1139679507664.html |title=Lady Miss Kier \u2013 Gig Reviews \u2013 Music \u2013 Entertainment|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===International DJ and songwriting solo career===\n[[File:Lady Miss Kier.jpg|thumb|Lady Miss Kier performing in 2007]]\nBrill and Kirby's relationship fractured, and Deee-lite disbanded in 1995.<ref name=\"Smh.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/lady-miss-kier/2006/02/13/1139679507664.html?page=2 |title=Lady Miss Kier \u2013 Gig Reviews \u2013 Music \u2013 Entertainment|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref> \"When Dmitry and I split up, that was the end of the band,\" Kirby said. \"It was sad because I loved the band.

This modern format breathed new air into the competition which saw a new trophy handed out along with the Intercontinental Cup, the Toyota Cup.\n\nTo protect themselves against the possibility of European withdrawals, Toyota, UEFA and every European Cup participant signed annual contracts requiring the eventual winners of the European Cup to participate at the Intercontinental Cup\u2014as a condition UEFA stipulated to the clubs' participation in the European Cup\u2014or risk facing an international lawsuit from UEFA and Toyota.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1992/12/29/pagina-8/1259619/pdf.html?search=Intercontinental |title=La negociaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 dif\u00edcil |trans-title=Negotiations will be difficult |page=8 |last1=Aguilar |first1=Francesc |work=El Mundo Deportivo |format=PDF |date=18 September 1992|accessdate=6 March 2013 |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\nThe first Toyota Cup was held in [[1980 Intercontinental Cup|1980]] which saw Uruguay's Nacional triumph over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. The 1980s saw a domination by South American sides as Brazil's [[Clube de Regatas Flamengo|Flamengo]] and Gr\u00eamio, Uruguay's Nacional and Pe\u00f1arol, Argentina's Independiente and River Plate take the spoils once each after Nacional's victory in 1980. Only Juventus, [[FC Porto|Porto]] and Milan managed to bring the trophy to the European continent. In that decade, the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]] tried organising a Club World Cup sponsored by promoting company West Nally only to be shot down by UEFA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1983/04/20/pagina-20/1441398/pdf.html?search=mundial |title= La Copa Intercontinental el 11-D en Tokio: No habra una Copa Mundial de Clubes |work=[[El Mundo Deportivo (newspaper)|El Mundo Deportivo]] |accessdate=2 July 2010 |language= Spanish}}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s proved to be a decade dominated by European teams, as Milan, Red Star Belgrade, Ajax, Juventus, Real Madrid, Manchester United, and newcomers [[Borussia Dortmund]] of Germany were fuelled to victory by their economic powers and heavy poaching of South American stars. Only three titles went to South America, as [[S\u00e3o Paulo Futebol Clube|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and Argentina's [[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield|V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]] came out the winners, each of them defeating Milan, with S\u00e3o Paulo's inaugural win being over Barcelona. The 2000s would see Boca Juniors win the competition twice for South America, while European victories came from Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, and Porto.

Between 1960 and 1968, the cup was decided on points only, the same format used by CONMEBOL to determine the winner of the Copa Libertadores final through 1987. Because of this format, a third match was needed when both teams were equal on points. Commonly this match was host by the continent where the last game of the series was played.

Because of this format, a third match was needed when both teams were equal on points. Commonly this match was host by the continent where the last game of the series was played. From 1969 through 1979, the competition adopted the European standard method of aggregate score, with [[away goals rule|away goals]].\n\nStarting in 1980, the final became a single match.

It became one of the first [[disco]] hits to be released in an extended form.\n\nThe [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] named it one of the [[500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]], Summer's only selection on this list.<ref>{{cite web |last=Henke\n |first=James |url=https://www.infoplease.com/arts-entertainment/music/500-songs-shaped-rock |title=500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=March 2, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nBy 1975, Summer had been living in [[Germany]] for eight years and had participated in several musical theatre shows. She had also released an album in [[The Netherlands]] entitled ''[[Lady of the Night (album)|Lady of the Night]]'' (1974), written by [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]] and produced by Bellotte, which had given her a couple of hit singles. She was still a complete unknown in her home country when she suggested the lyric \"Love to Love You Baby\" to Moroder in 1975. He turned the lyric into a full [[disco]] song and asked Summer to record it. The full lyrics were somewhat explicit, and at first, Summer said she would only record it as a demo to give to someone else. However, Summer's erotic moans and groans impressed Moroder so much that he persuaded her to release it as her own song, and \"'''Love to Love You'''\" became a moderate hit in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nIn an interview in 1976, Summer responded to a number of questions that she claimed she'd been asked about the process of recording the song: \"Everyone's asking, 'Were you alone in the studio?' Yes, I was alone in the studio. 'Did you touch yourself?' Yes, well, actually I had my hand on my knee. 'Did you fantasize on anything?' Yes, on my handsome boyfriend Peter.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Donna Summer: 'The audience was groaning worse than I was' \u2013 a classic interview from the vaults|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/17/donna-summer-classic-interview|accessdate=9 June 2012 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Richard|last=Cromelin|date=17 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==International release and reception==\n\nA tape of the song was sent to [[Casablanca Records]] president [[Neil Bogart]] in the U.S., and he played it at a party at his home. Impressed with the track, Bogart continued to play it over and over all night. He later contacted Moroder and suggested that he make the track longer - possibly as long as 20 minutes. However, Summer again had reservations; she was not sure of all of the lyrics. Nevertheless, she imagined herself as an actress (namely [[Marilyn Monroe]])<ref name=\"blender\">[http://www.blender.com/guide/68500/greatest-songs-ever-love-to-love-you-baby.html \"The Greatest Songs Ever!

She had also released an album in [[The Netherlands]] entitled ''[[Lady of the Night (album)|Lady of the Night]]'' (1974), written by [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]] and produced by Bellotte, which had given her a couple of hit singles. She was still a complete unknown in her home country when she suggested the lyric \"Love to Love You Baby\" to Moroder in 1975. He turned the lyric into a full [[disco]] song and asked Summer to record it. The full lyrics were somewhat explicit, and at first, Summer said she would only record it as a demo to give to someone else. However, Summer's erotic moans and groans impressed Moroder so much that he persuaded her to release it as her own song, and \"'''Love to Love You'''\" became a moderate hit in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nIn an interview in 1976, Summer responded to a number of questions that she claimed she'd been asked about the process of recording the song: \"Everyone's asking, 'Were you alone in the studio?' Yes, I was alone in the studio. 'Did you touch yourself?' Yes, well, actually I had my hand on my knee. 'Did you fantasize on anything?' Yes, on my handsome boyfriend Peter.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Donna Summer: 'The audience was groaning worse than I was' \u2013 a classic interview from the vaults|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/17/donna-summer-classic-interview|accessdate=9 June 2012 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Richard|last=Cromelin|date=17 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==International release and reception==\n\nA tape of the song was sent to [[Casablanca Records]] president [[Neil Bogart]] in the U.S., and he played it at a party at his home. Impressed with the track, Bogart continued to play it over and over all night. He later contacted Moroder and suggested that he make the track longer - possibly as long as 20 minutes. However, Summer again had reservations; she was not sure of all of the lyrics. Nevertheless, she imagined herself as an actress (namely [[Marilyn Monroe]])<ref name=\"blender\">[http://www.blender.com/guide/68500/greatest-songs-ever-love-to-love-you-baby.html \"The Greatest Songs Ever!

Blake]]\nThe very first modern Olympic Games that were held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] saw the Americans fielding 14 athletes that competed in three sports. The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games. \n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17.

The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U.

Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games.

The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics. The countries developed a strong rivalry during the [[Cold War]], and while the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014]] and [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election|2016]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5164194/usa-russia-olympics-hockey/|title=USA Men's Team Vs.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:TeamUSA1980 stamp.png|thumb|upright|alt=Beige postage stamp featuring a brightly colored hockey player|Paraguayan stamp featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup.]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org:443/Road-to-Sochi-2014/Features/2014/February/15/Team-USA-Beats-Russia-In-Marathon-On-Ice|title=Team USA Beats Russia In 'Marathon On Ice'|website=Team USA}}</ref> Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[United States at the Winter Olympics]]\n*[[List of United States Olympic medalists]]\n*[[United States at the Paralympics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |title=United States of America |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/united-states-of-america }}\n* {{IOC medals|NOC=USA}}\n* {{cite web |title=Olympic Medal Winners |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/athletes?search=1&countryname=united%20states%20of%20america }}\n* {{cite web |title=United States |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA }}\n\n{{country at games navbox|United States|Olympics}}\n{{Nations at the Olympics}}\n{{National sports teams of the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States At The Olympics}}\n[[Category:United States at the Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:National sports teams of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox country at games\n| NOC = USA\n| NOCname = [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]]\n| games = Olympics\n| year = \n| flagcaption = [[Flag of the United States]]\n| oldcode = \n| website = \n| location = \n| competitors = \n| sports = \n| flagbearer = \n| rank = 1\n| gold = 1127\n| silver = 907\n| bronze = 793\n| officials = \n| appearances = \n| app_begin_year = \n| app_end_year = \n| summerappearances = {{Team appearances list|team=United States|competition=Summer Olympics|begin_year=|end_year= }}\n| winterappearances = {{Team appearances list|team=United States|competition=Winter Olympics|begin_year=|end_year= }}\n| seealso = [[United States at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906]] Intercalated Games\n}}\n{{See also|United States at the Summer Olympics|United States at the Winter Olympics}}\nThe '''[[United States|United States of America]]''' (USA) has sent athletes to every celebration of the modern [[Olympic Games]] with the exception of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], during which it led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]].

Blake]]\nThe very first modern Olympic Games that were held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] saw the Americans fielding 14 athletes that competed in three sports. The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games. \n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\n\n===Early Olympics (1896\u20131912)===\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the [[Athletics at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], setting a new world record.]]\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]] marked the first time that the newly communist countries, that were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War Two|WW2]], competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U.

Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library Edition: http://www.library.ebonline.com/eb/article-9098213</ref> The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1980/</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Los Angeles]] witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles&mdash;Romania&mdash;encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics. The countries developed a strong rivalry during the [[Cold War]], and while the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014]] and [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election|2016]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5164194/usa-russia-olympics-hockey/|title=USA Men's Team Vs.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:TeamUSA1980 stamp.png|thumb|upright|alt=Beige postage stamp featuring a brightly colored hockey player|Paraguayan stamp featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup.]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org:443/Road-to-Sochi-2014/Features/2014/February/15/Team-USA-Beats-Russia-In-Marathon-On-Ice|title=Team USA Beats Russia In 'Marathon On Ice'|website=Team USA}}</ref> Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[United States at the Winter Olympics]]\n*[[List of United States Olympic medalists]]\n*[[United States at the Paralympics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |title=United States of America |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/united-states-of-america }}\n* {{IOC medals|NOC=USA}}\n* {{cite web |title=Olympic Medal Winners |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/athletes?search=1&countryname=united%20states%20of%20america }}\n* {{cite web |title=United States |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA }}\n\n{{country at games navbox|United States|Olympics}}\n{{Nations at the Olympics}}\n{{National sports teams of the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States At The Olympics}}\n[[Category:United States at the Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:National sports teams of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Spdslecturer", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics"}

The earliest records for the house date from 1476. At that time it was called ''Smythes Tenement'' and was on land belonging to William Jenette, lord of the sub-manor of Selly. William Jenette leased ''Smythes Tenement'' to a local farmer, John Othe\u2019field (John of the field). \u00a0\n[[File:Selly Manor 'Crooke Hall' oak table - 02.jpeg|thumb|The Crooke Hall table on display at Selly Manor Museum. The carving states 'an arelome to this house forever'.]]\nIn 1561, attorney and bailiff John Setterford, his wife Phylis, and her son William Pritchett \u00a0leased the house. This family is significant as they prospered and bought the house. Phylis Setterford outlived her husband, and when she died in 1608, an inventory of the contents was made, which details the layout of the building as well as every item in it. From this, it is evident that at that time, the middle section of the building was a medieval hall. Hearth tax returns show that this section was replaced by 1664 with the three storey brick section that is now in place. The house was owned and occupied by Phylis Setterford\u2019s descendants until 1699. After this date, a succession of absentee landlords failed to invest in the building and its status declined. The house became unfashionable, and its status fell further in 1795 when the house was sold separately to the land that went with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sellymanormuseum.org.uk/explore/our-story|title=Our story|website=Selly Manor|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> \u00a0\n[[File:Selly Manor - panoramio (2).jpg|alt=Selly Manor in Bournville, Birmingham.|thumb|Selly Manor in Bournville, Birmingham.]]\nThe condition of ''Smythes Tenement'' continued to decline and by 1853 it had been split into three cottages to be leased, and was known as ''The Rookery''. The census records show that by 1861, ten members of the Davis family lived in the smallest end cottage, the middle cottage was occupied by four members of the Thompson family, and the remaining cottage was home to seven members of the Williams family. The house deteriorated further still and following the death of its owner Edward Olivieri, the Rookery was put up for sale by auction in 1907.\n\n== Relocation ==\n\nThe building was in a poor state of repair when its destruction was prevented by [[George Cadbury]], who acquired it in 1907<ref name=\"SM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sellymanormuseum.org.uk/explore-visit-us/selly-manor/|title=Selly Manor|publisher=Selly Manor Museum|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> with the intention that it would be a museum to complement the other public buildings h had built in the garden village of [[Bournville]], alongside the Cadbury chocolate factory. In a letter to his son, Laurence he wrote ''\u2018These old buildings are educational and especially needed for a new town like Birmingham; a vast majority of people never think of bygone times.\u2019'' \n\nContemporary accounts state that the area where ''The Rookery'' stood was \u2018unlovely\u2019. To give the building a better future, George Cadbury had the building carefully taken down and moved to its current site. The project was managed by architect [[William Alexander Harvey]], who meticulously documented each step. Work began in 1909, and was finally completed in 1916, at a cost of over \u00a36000. The following year, the building opened as a museum.<ref name=\"SM\" /> The house was protected with [[Grade II listed]] status in 1952.<ref name=\"EH\">{{NHLE|num=1076129|desc=Selly Manor|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932, [[Minworth Greaves]], from [[Minworth]], was similarly relocated, in the manor house's grounds.<ref name=\"MG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sellymanormuseum.org.uk/explore-visit-us/minworth-greaves/|title=Minworth Greaves|publisher=Selly Manor Museum|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n== The Laurence Cadbury Collection ==\nThe museum contains the Laurence Cadbury Collection, a unique collection of furniture and domestic objects intended to give the feel of a house from the 17<sup>th</sup> century. \n\nLaurence Cadbury was George Cadbury\u2019s fourth son, and the collection at Selly Manor is a testament to his interest in collecting fascinating items. Laurence Cadbury began collecting objects whilst studying at Cambridge in about 1908 and continued well into the mid 1930s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sellymanormuseum.org.uk/explore/collection-archives|title=Collection & archives|website=Selly Manor|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Much of his collection was displayed at his house, The Davids in [[Northfield, Birmingham|Northfield]], [[Birmingham]], but Selly Manor was a perfect home for the 16th and 17th century furniture and domestic objects he loved so much. From sturdy oak chests and intricate carvings to a beautiful tapestry and unusual utensils, there is so much to appreciate. The highlight of the collection is an 18 foot table dating from the 1630s which was originally from the now demolished Crooke Hall in Lancashire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sellymanormuseum.org.uk/explore/collection-archives|title=Collection & archives|website=Selly Manor|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\nA detailed collection catalogue has been produced on the Laurence Cadbury Collection with full descriptions and illustrations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Laurence Cadbury Collection at Selly Manor.|last=Callicott, Daniel.|isbn=9780993213403|oclc=919893163}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{Commons category inline|Selly Manor}}\n* [http://www.sellymanormuseum.org.uk/ Selly Manor Museum]\n\n{{Birmingham buildings}}\n\n[[Category:Museums in Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:Grade II listed buildings in Birmingham]]\n[[Category:Country houses in the West Midlands (county)]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in the West Midlands (county)]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:Grade II listed museum buildings]]\n", "name_user": "151.230.236.112", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selly_Manor"}
