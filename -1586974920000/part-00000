In the skirmish the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] cavalry led by [[Prince Rupert]] attacked the extended columns of the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] army of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|the Earl of Essex]] at Aldbourne Chase as he was attempting to get his army to London.<ref name=W32 >Wallace, p. 32.</ref>\n\nThe battle in and of itself was inconclusive, but it allowed the Royalists to get to Newbury ahead of Essex and ultimately forced the Parliamentarian army into a major confrontation.<ref name=M12 >Manganiello, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter relieving the [[siege of Gloucester]], the Earl of Essex needed to return to London with his army intact. To do so, Essex first chose to travel north to [[Tewkesbury]] in an attempt to draw the Royalist forces near Gloucester off his intended route back to London.<ref>Day, pp. 171-172.</ref> After [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] and the Royalist army followed, Essex turned south and traveled through [[Cheltenham]] to [[Cirencester]] where on 16 September he attacked and captured the Royalist garrison. At that time, Essex thought that he was far ahead of the Royalist army and slowed the pace of his army as they marched toward Swindon.<ref>Day, pp. 184-185.</ref>\n\nWhen King Charles realized that Essex was attempting to travel directly to London, he sent Prince Rupert ahead with the cavalry in an attempt to intercept the Parliamentarian army before it could link up with reinforcements coming from London.<ref>Money, p. 16.</ref> \n\n==Battle==\nEarly on 18 September, Rupert's cavalry caught the Parliamentarians as they were crossing Aldbourne Chase, approximately two miles north-west of the village of Aldbourne. At Aldbourne Chase, Rupert came upon long columns of Parliamentarian infantry ambling along with large intervals between the individual divisions. Given such an opportunity, the Royalist cavalry immediately began a series of charges at the Parliamentarian foot. Although the Parliamentarian cavalry soon joined in the fray, the Royalist began to take a heavy toll on the Parliamentary infantry units.

Northwestern had been off to a slow start on the season, especially offensively, but the team seemed to wake up for the Iowa game.  Clayton Thorson got the scoring started with a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Wildcats up 7\u20130.  Akrum Wadley would answer that with a touchdown run of his own.  The first half featured a lot of offense as Northwestern took a 17\u20137 lead, only to see it disappear quickly as Wadley scored again, and the Hawkeyes capitalized on a fumble by Justin Jackson as C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron in the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown and Iowa went into halftime up 21\u201317.  However, the Iowa defense could not stop the Wildcat offense, and they scored on three consecutive series.  Austin Carr hauled in a 16-yard touchdown catch with a terrific catch in the corner of the end zone to tie the game at 24\u201324, and then on the next drive Justin Jackson broke free and scored from 58 yards out to give Northwestern the lead back.  Carr then hauled in his third touchdown of the game and Northwestern went up 38\u201324.  LeShun Daniels cut the lead to 38\u201331 with a 1-yard touchdown run, but a last ditch effort by the Hawkeyes to come back was thwarted when Beathard was intercepted with 58 seconds left.

Iowa once again moved the ball, but have a drive stall and it settled for another short field goal by Duncan for a 6\u20130 lead.  However, Minnesota answered with its best drive of the game, and the Gophers took the lead on a 9-yard touchdown run by Shannon Brooks.  This was a game of missed opportunities as Iowa repeatedly moved the ball, but could not come up with points.  Riley McCarron lost a fumble inside the Minnesota 35 yard-line after a long reception and C.J. Beathard threw an ill-advised interception with Iowa at the Minnesota 27.  Iowa was finally able to break through as Akrum Wadley broke free for a 54-yard touchdown run, and an ensuing two-point conversion gave the Hawkeyes a 14\u20137 lead.

Early on, the Badgers were able to move up and down the field, but were unable to capitalize.  Their first drive stalled when kicker Andrew Endicott missed a 32-yard field goal.  Wisconsin did not get on the board until Bart Houston hit tight end Troy Fumagalli for a 17-yard touchdown with 10:06 left in the second.  Iowa would answer that with a 41-yard field goal from Keith Duncan.  Wisconsin continued to miss its opportunities as Corey Clement fumbled inside the Iowa 1 right before the half, and Iowa turned that into a field goal and despite getting significantly outgained, Iowa only went into halftime trailing 7\u20136.  Wisconsin continued to move the ball in the second half, as Corey Clement was able to score this time from the 1 and the Badgers extended their lead to 14\u20136.  With about 5 minutes left in the 4th, Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz decided to kick a field goal on 4th & 5 on the Wisconsin 20, instead of going for it and Keith Duncan missed a 38-yard field goal.  From there, Wisconsin was able to make a field goal of their own to essentially put the game on ice.  Iowa was able to get a field goal late in the game but Wisconsin recovered the ensuing onside kick and was able to hang on for the 17\u20139 win.   For Iowa, it was their third consecutive loss at Kinnick Stadium and dropped them to 5\u20133, 3\u20132 heading into their bye week.  The win snapped a two-game losing streak for Wisconsin and was also the team's fourth consecutive win in Kinnick.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clement Carries No. 10 Wisconsin to 17\u20139 Win Over Iowa |url=http://www.collegefootball.ap.org/article/clement-carries-no-10-wisconsin-17-9-win-over-iowa |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 22, 2016 |accessdate=November 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===at Penn State===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Iowa at Penn State'''\n|Visitor=Hawkeyes\n|V1=0|V2=7|V3=0|V4=7\n|Host='''No. 20 Nittany Lions'''\n|H1=7|H2=17|H3=3|H4=14\n|Date=November 5\n|Location=[[Beaver Stadium]]<br>[[University Park, Pennsylvania|University Park, PA]]\n|StartTime=7:30 PM\n|TimeZone=EDT\n|ElapsedTime=3:08\n|Attendance=106,194\n|Weather=56\u00b0, Clear, Wind WNW 10\n|Referee=Rod Snodgrass\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kevin Kugler]], [[Matt Millen]], [[Lisa Byington]]\n|TVStation=[[Big Ten Network|BTN]] \n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3081&path=football Box Score]\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=12:53|Team=Penn State|Event=Saeed Blacknall 19-yard TD pass from [[Trace McSorley]] (Tyler Davis kick) |Score=Penn State 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=10:28|Team=Penn State|Event=[[Saquon Barkley]] 57-yard run (Tyler Davis kick) |Score=Penn State 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=7:58|Team=Penn State|Event=Trace McSorley 1-yard run (Tyler Davis kick) |Score=Penn State 21\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=4:18|Team=Iowa|Event=Akrum Wadley 12-yard pass from C.J.

Throughout much of the game, Iowa was completely dominated by Penn State.  On the very first drive, Penn State marched right down the field for a touchdown drive that ended with Trace McSorley finding Saaed Blacknall for a score.  Saquon Barkley continued to run all over the Hawkeyes as he broke free for a 57-yard touchdown run to extend the lead to 14\u20130.  Soon after, McSorley scored from 1 yard out and the Nittany Lions were rolling, up 21\u20130.  Iowa got a much needed touchdown late in the half when Beathard found Akrum Wadley for a 12-yard touchdown to get Iowa on the board.  However, Penn State answered right back with a field goal to head into halftime up 24\u20137.  The second half was much of the same as Saquon Barkley caught a long pass from McSorley for another touchdown.  Backup quarterback Tommy Stevens even got in on the fun and added a rushing touchdown of his own as Penn State crushed the Hawkeyes, winning 41\u201314.  Barkley and McSorley combined for nearly 450 yards and Penn State racked up 599 yards of offense on the Hawkeyes.  It was the second consecutive loss for Iowa, who dropped to 5\u20134, 3\u20133 in the Big Ten and a matchup with the undefeated Michigan Wolverines upcoming.  Penn State continued to play great football, getting its fifth straight win and the second straight blowout for the Lions after they defeated #2 and previously undefeated Ohio State two weeks earlier.  \n<ref>{{cite web |title=No. 20 Penn State hammers Iowa 41\u201314 |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/no-20-penn-state-hammers-iowa-41-14 |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 6, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Michigan===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Michigan at Iowa'''\n|Visitor=No. 2 Wolverines\n|V1=3|V2=7|V3=0|V4=3\n|Host='''Hawkeyes'''\n|H1=0|H2=8|H3=3|H4=3\n|Date=November 12\n|Location=[[Kinnick Stadium]]<br>[[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City, IA]]\n|StartTime=7:12 PM\n|TimeZone=CST\n|ElapsedTime=3:19\n|Attendance=70,585\n|Weather=41\u00b0, Mostly Cloudy, Wind S 4\n|Referee=John O'Neill\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Chris Fowler]], [[Kirk Herbstreit]], [[Sam Ponder]]\n|TVStation=[[Saturday Night Football|ABC]]\n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3082&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=4:00|Team=Michigan |Event=Kenny Allen 26-yard field goal |Score=Michigan 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=8:56 |Team=Michigan |Event=Ty Isaac 7-yard run (Allen kick) |Score=Michigan 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:31 |Team=Iowa |Event=Team safety |Score=Michigan 10\u20132}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:27 |Team=Iowa |Event=Akrum Wadley 3-yard pass from C.J.

Iowa fell behind 10\u20130 in the second quarter, thanks to a Ty Isaac 7-yard touchdown run. Defensive tackle Jaleel Johnson gave Iowa some momentum when he tackled De'Veon Smith in the end zone for a safety.  Later, C.J. Beathard converted a 4th and goal by completing a screen pass to Akrum Wadley for a 3-yard touchdown.  The two-point conversion was unsuccessful and Iowa trailed 10\u20138 at halftime.  However, Iowa continued to control the game and Wadley was a force for Iowa, and Iowa took an 11\u201310 lead into the 4th quarter.  Michigan kicker Kenny Allen put them back in front with a 50-yard field goal midway through the 4th quarter, but Iowa would not go away.  With Iowa driving for the game-winning score, quarterback C.J. Beathard was intercepted by Michigan cornerback [[Channing Stribling]] with 1:54 left.  However, Iowa forced a Michigan punt, and the Wolverines committed a costly penalty on a punt return by Desmond King to set up Iowa with terrific field position.  From there, Iowa got two first downs and freshman kicker [[Keith Duncan]] drilled a 33-yard field goal as time expired to deliver Iowa a shocking 14\u201313 upset of Michigan.\n\nAkrum Wadley was the offensive standout for the Hawkeyes with 115 yards rushing, and another 52 yards receiving that included the touchdown late in the first half. The Hawkeye defense did their part as well, allowing only 201 total yards to a Wolverine offense that was averaging over 400 per game going into the contest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iowa upsets No. 2 Michigan 14\u201313 on last-second field goal |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/iowa-upsets-no-2-michigan-14-13-last-second-field-goal |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 12, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref> Senior DT Jaleel Johnson was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week, Duncan was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week, and Manny Rugamba was named Big Ten co-Freshman of the Week.<ref name=\"b1g-pow-week11\">{{cite web |title=Big Ten Football Players of the Week |url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111416aaa.html |work=[[Big Ten Conference]] |date=November 14, 2016 |accessdate=November 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233036/http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111416aaa.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith Clemson and Washington both losing, this marked only the second time #2, #3, and #4 fell during the same day in the regular-season.

Daniels would add a 50-yard touchdown run midway through the 4th and Iowa cruised to an easy 28\u20130 victory.  The Iowa defense was phenomenal all game, allowing just 198 yards of total offense for the Illini, forcing two turnovers, and getting the team's first shutout since a 45\u20130 win over Ball State in 2010.

The Hawkeyes got explosive plays early as Akrum Wadley got the scoring started with a 75-yard touchdown run to put Iowa up 6\u20130. On the next offensive play for Iowa, C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron for a 77-yard catch and run and Iowa was flying high, up 13\u20130 early.  After a Drew Brown field goal, Iowa again got a big play as LeShun Daniels had a 56-yard run which set up a 4-yard touchdown by Daniels and Iowa led 20\u20133.  In the second half, it was more of the same as Beathard found George Kittle for a 1-yard touchdown on the first drive of the second half and Iowa went up 26\u20133.  Nebraska momentarily got back into the game when Stanley Morgan Jr. caught a 13-yard touchdown pass on 4th down from Tommy Armstrong Jr. to cut the Iowa lead to 26\u201310.  But the running game for Iowa was too much for the Cornhuskers as the combination of Daniels and Wadley continued to wear down Nebraska.  Beathard found Kittle for another score, and late in the game, Daniels added a 1-yard touchdown to put the finishing touches on a 40\u201310 dismantling of the rival Cornhuskers.  The defense held Armstrong Jr. to 125 yards passing and gave up 217 total yards.  Iowa ran for 264 yards and Beathard threw for 3 touchdowns as Iowa won its third consecutive game to end the season, including knocking off two straight ranked opponents at Kinnick Stadium. Iowa finished the 2016 regular season at 8\u20134, 6\u20133 in the Big Ten.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iowa tops No. 17 Nebraska 40\u201310, Wisconsin wins Big Ten West |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/iowa-tops-no-17-nebraska-40-10-wisconsin-wins-big-ten-west |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 25, 2016 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |title=AP TOP 25: USF, Pitt among 6 teams to enter rankings |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/ap-top-25-usf-pitt-among-6-teams-enter-rankings |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 27, 2016 |accessdate=November 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===vs. Florida (Outback Bowl)===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Florida vs. Iowa'''<br><small>[[2017 Outback Bowl|Outback Bowl]]</small>\n|Visitor='''No. 20 Gators'''\n|V1=3|V2=7|V3=7|V4=13\n|Host=No. 21 Hawkeyes\n|H1=3|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0\n|Date=January 2\n|Location=[[Raymond James Stadium]] <br>[[Tampa, FL]]\n|StartTime=1:00 PM\n|TimeZone=EST\n|ElapsedTime=3:30\n|Attendance=51,119\n|Weather=83\u00b0 F, Sunny, Wind 10\n|Referee=Brad Van Vark\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Mike Patrick]], [[Ed Cunningham]], [[Jerry Punch]]\n|TVStation=[[College Football on ABC|ABC]]\n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=9547&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=8:56 |Team=Iowa |Event=Keith Duncan 36-yard field goal |Score=Iowa 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=5:42 |Team=Florida |Event= Pineiro 44-yard field goal |Score=Tied 3\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:46 |Team=Florida |Event=Thompson 85-yard pass from Appleby (Pineiro kick) |Score=Florida 10\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=3 |Time=0:48 |Team=Florida |Event=Goolsby 6-yard pass from Appleby (Pineiro kick) |Score=Florida 17\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=14:44 |Team=Florida |Event=Gardner 58-yard INT return (Pineiro kick) |Score=Florida 24\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=9:46 |Team=Florida |Event=Pineiro 25-yard field goal |Score=Florida 27\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=4 |Time=5:57 |Team=Florida |Event=Pineiro 48-yard field goal |Score='''Florida 30\u20133'''|LastEntry=yes}}\n\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\n{{main|2017 Outback Bowl}}\n{{see also|2016 Florida Gators football team}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Iowa Hawkeyes|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1\u20132\n| 2006\n| '''L''' 24\u201331\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web |title=Appleby shines, No. 20 Florida beats Iowa in Outback Bowl |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/appleby-shines-no-20-florida-beats-iowa-outback-bowl |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 2, 2017 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Iowa Hawkeyes|color=white|border=no}}\" | Weekly Awards\n|- align=center\n!

Northwestern had been off to a slow start on the season, especially offensively, but the team seemed to wake up for the Iowa game.  Clayton Thorson got the scoring started with a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Wildcats up 7\u20130.  Akrum Wadley would answer that with a touchdown run of his own.  The first half featured a lot of offense as Northwestern took a 17\u20137 lead, only to see it disappear quickly as Wadley scored again, and the Hawkeyes capitalized on a fumble by Justin Jackson as C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron in the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown and Iowa went into halftime up 21\u201317.  However, the Iowa defense could not stop the Wildcat offense, and they scored on three consecutive series.  Austin Carr hauled in a 16-yard touchdown catch with a terrific catch in the corner of the end zone to tie the game at 24\u201324, and then on the next drive Justin Jackson broke free and scored from 58 yards out to give Northwestern the lead back.

Iowa had a good drive early, but were unable to get points as long distance kicker Miguel Recinos missed a 50-yard field goal badly.  However, Iowa would get on the board first as Keith Duncan hit a short field goal for a 3\u20130 halftime lead.  Iowa once again moved the ball, but have a drive stall and it settled for another short field goal by Duncan for a 6\u20130 lead.  However, Minnesota answered with its best drive of the game, and the Gophers took the lead on a 9-yard touchdown run by Shannon Brooks.  This was a game of missed opportunities as Iowa repeatedly moved the ball, but could not come up with points.  Riley McCarron lost a fumble inside the Minnesota 35 yard-line after a long reception and C.J. Beathard threw an ill-advised interception with Iowa at the Minnesota 27.  Iowa was finally able to break through as Akrum Wadley broke free for a 54-yard touchdown run, and an ensuing two-point conversion gave the Hawkeyes a 14\u20137 lead.  The Iowa defense was able to stop an attempt by Minnesota to tie the game late, and the Hawkeyes held on for a 14\u20137 win and kept possession of the Floyd of Rosedale Trophy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wadley's big run nudges Iowa past Minnesota in 14\u20137 grinder |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/wadleys-big-run-nudges-iowa-past-minnesota-14-7-grinder |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 8, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===at Purdue===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Iowa at Purdue'''\n|Visitor='''Hawkeyes'''\n|V1=21|V2=14|V3=7|V4=7\n|Host=Boilermakers\n|H1=0|H2=7|H3=7|H4=21\n|Date=October 15\n|Location=[[Ross\u2013Ade Stadium]]<br>[[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette, IN]]\n|StartTime=12:01 PM\n|TimeZone=EDT\n|ElapsedTime=3:45\n|Attendance=40,239\n|Weather=67\u00b0, Cloudy, Wind SSW 14\n|Referee=Mike Cannon\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Anish Shroff]], [[Tom Ramsey]], Kevin Weidl\n|TVStation=[[ESPN2]] \n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3079&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=8:57 |Team=Iowa |Event=LeShun Daniels 1-yard run (Keith Duncan kick) |Score=Iowa 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=1 |Time=2:20 |Team=Iowa |Event=C.J.

Early on, the Badgers were able to move up and down the field, but were unable to capitalize.  Their first drive stalled when kicker Andrew Endicott missed a 32-yard field goal.  Wisconsin did not get on the board until Bart Houston hit tight end Troy Fumagalli for a 17-yard touchdown with 10:06 left in the second.  Iowa would answer that with a 41-yard field goal from Keith Duncan.  Wisconsin continued to miss its opportunities as Corey Clement fumbled inside the Iowa 1 right before the half, and Iowa turned that into a field goal and despite getting significantly outgained, Iowa only went into halftime trailing 7\u20136.  Wisconsin continued to move the ball in the second half, as Corey Clement was able to score this time from the 1 and the Badgers extended their lead to 14\u20136.  With about 5 minutes left in the 4th, Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz decided to kick a field goal on 4th & 5 on the Wisconsin 20, instead of going for it and Keith Duncan missed a 38-yard field goal.  From there, Wisconsin was able to make a field goal of their own to essentially put the game on ice.  Iowa was able to get a field goal late in the game but Wisconsin recovered the ensuing onside kick and was able to hang on for the 17\u20139 win.   For Iowa, it was their third consecutive loss at Kinnick Stadium and dropped them to 5\u20133, 3\u20132 heading into their bye week.

Throughout much of the game, Iowa was completely dominated by Penn State.  On the very first drive, Penn State marched right down the field for a touchdown drive that ended with Trace McSorley finding Saaed Blacknall for a score.  Saquon Barkley continued to run all over the Hawkeyes as he broke free for a 57-yard touchdown run to extend the lead to 14\u20130.  Soon after, McSorley scored from 1 yard out and the Nittany Lions were rolling, up 21\u20130.  Iowa got a much needed touchdown late in the half when Beathard found Akrum Wadley for a 12-yard touchdown to get Iowa on the board.  However, Penn State answered right back with a field goal to head into halftime up 24\u20137.  The second half was much of the same as Saquon Barkley caught a long pass from McSorley for another touchdown.  Backup quarterback Tommy Stevens even got in on the fun and added a rushing touchdown of his own as Penn State crushed the Hawkeyes, winning 41\u201314.  Barkley and McSorley combined for nearly 450 yards and Penn State racked up 599 yards of offense on the Hawkeyes.  It was the second consecutive loss for Iowa, who dropped to 5\u20134, 3\u20133 in the Big Ten and a matchup with the undefeated Michigan Wolverines upcoming.  Penn State continued to play great football, getting its fifth straight win and the second straight blowout for the Lions after they defeated #2 and previously undefeated Ohio State two weeks earlier.  \n<ref>{{cite web |title=No. 20 Penn State hammers Iowa 41\u201314 |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/no-20-penn-state-hammers-iowa-41-14 |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 6, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Michigan===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title='''Michigan at Iowa'''\n|Visitor=No. 2 Wolverines\n|V1=3|V2=7|V3=0|V4=3\n|Host='''Hawkeyes'''\n|H1=0|H2=8|H3=3|H4=3\n|Date=November 12\n|Location=[[Kinnick Stadium]]<br>[[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City, IA]]\n|StartTime=7:12 PM\n|TimeZone=CST\n|ElapsedTime=3:19\n|Attendance=70,585\n|Weather=41\u00b0, Mostly Cloudy, Wind S 4\n|Referee=John O'Neill\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Chris Fowler]], [[Kirk Herbstreit]], [[Sam Ponder]]\n|TVStation=[[Saturday Night Football|ABC]]\n}}\n\n*'''Source''': [http://www.hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3082&path=football Box Score]\n\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=4:00|Team=Michigan |Event=Kenny Allen 26-yard field goal |Score=Michigan 3\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=8:56 |Team=Michigan |Event=Ty Isaac 7-yard run (Allen kick) |Score=Michigan 10\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=6:31 |Team=Iowa |Event=Team safety |Score=Michigan 10\u20132}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=2 |Time=1:27 |Team=Iowa |Event=Akrum Wadley 3-yard pass from C.J.

Iowa fell behind 10\u20130 in the second quarter, thanks to a Ty Isaac 7-yard touchdown run. Defensive tackle Jaleel Johnson gave Iowa some momentum when he tackled De'Veon Smith in the end zone for a safety.  Later, C.J. Beathard converted a 4th and goal by completing a screen pass to Akrum Wadley for a 3-yard touchdown.  The two-point conversion was unsuccessful and Iowa trailed 10\u20138 at halftime.  However, Iowa continued to control the game and Wadley was a force for Iowa, and Iowa took an 11\u201310 lead into the 4th quarter.  Michigan kicker Kenny Allen put them back in front with a 50-yard field goal midway through the 4th quarter, but Iowa would not go away.  With Iowa driving for the game-winning score, quarterback C.J. Beathard was intercepted by Michigan cornerback [[Channing Stribling]] with 1:54 left.  However, Iowa forced a Michigan punt, and the Wolverines committed a costly penalty on a punt return by Desmond King to set up Iowa with terrific field position.  From there, Iowa got two first downs and freshman kicker [[Keith Duncan]] drilled a 33-yard field goal as time expired to deliver Iowa a shocking 14\u201313 upset of Michigan.\n\nAkrum Wadley was the offensive standout for the Hawkeyes with 115 yards rushing, and another 52 yards receiving that included the touchdown late in the first half. The Hawkeye defense did their part as well, allowing only 201 total yards to a Wolverine offense that was averaging over 400 per game going into the contest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iowa upsets No. 2 Michigan 14\u201313 on last-second field goal |url=http://collegefootball.ap.org/article/iowa-upsets-no-2-michigan-14-13-last-second-field-goal |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 12, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref> Senior DT Jaleel Johnson was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week, Duncan was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week, and Manny Rugamba was named Big Ten co-Freshman of the Week.<ref name=\"b1g-pow-week11\">{{cite web |title=Big Ten Football Players of the Week |url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111416aaa.html |work=[[Big Ten Conference]] |date=November 14, 2016 |accessdate=November 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233036/http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/111416aaa.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith Clemson and Washington both losing, this marked only the second time #2, #3, and #4 fell during the same day in the regular-season.

With Iowa heading in for a score, Akrum Wadley fumbled inside the Illini 5 to keep the game scoreless in the second quarter.  However, Iowa would respond with a Riley McCarron 55-yard punt return touchdown for the only score of the first half and Iowa led 7\u20130 at the break.  In the second half, Iowa dominated Illinois on the ground, as LeShun Daniels capped off a 12-play, 6 minute drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.  Daniels would add a 50-yard touchdown run midway through the 4th and Iowa cruised to an easy 28\u20130 victory.  The Iowa defense was phenomenal all game, allowing just 198 yards of total offense for the Illini, forcing two turnovers, and getting the team's first shutout since a 45\u20130 win over Ball State in 2010.  Daniels rushed for a season-high 159 yards and two touchdowns.

The Hawkeyes got explosive plays early as Akrum Wadley got the scoring started with a 75-yard touchdown run to put Iowa up 6\u20130. On the next offensive play for Iowa, C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron for a 77-yard catch and run and Iowa was flying high, up 13\u20130 early.  After a Drew Brown field goal, Iowa again got a big play as LeShun Daniels had a 56-yard run which set up a 4-yard touchdown by Daniels and Iowa led 20\u20133.  In the second half, it was more of the same as Beathard found George Kittle for a 1-yard touchdown on the first drive of the second half and Iowa went up 26\u20133.  Nebraska momentarily got back into the game when Stanley Morgan Jr. caught a 13-yard touchdown pass on 4th down from Tommy Armstrong Jr. to cut the Iowa lead to 26\u201310.  But the running game for Iowa was too much for the Cornhuskers as the combination of Daniels and Wadley continued to wear down Nebraska.  Beathard found Kittle for another score, and late in the game, Daniels added a 1-yard touchdown to put the finishing touches on a 40\u201310 dismantling of the rival Cornhuskers.  The defense held Armstrong Jr. to 125 yards passing and gave up 217 total yards.  Iowa ran for 264 yards and Beathard threw for 3 touchdowns as Iowa won its third consecutive game to end the season, including knocking off two straight ranked opponents at Kinnick Stadium.

She sent the band demos of her songs to work on in her absence. The album was released in April 1987 and became the band's second-highest selling album ever, behind ''Rumours''.\n\nCreative differences and unresolved personal issues within the band led Buckingham to quit the group right before their world tour.

A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he scored 184 goals in 687 league and cup games.\n\nHe started his professional career at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in February 1978, after failing to win a contract at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]]. He was coached by [[Billy Horner]] to become a strong centre-forward, using his natural strength and power to retain possession in attacking positions. Financial difficulties forced the club to sell him on to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] for \u00a325,000 in March 1982. After failing to impress in his two years in London, he was moved on to [[York City F.C.|York City]] for \u00a315,000 in March 1984. He played seven games in the club's [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] title winning season in 1983\u201384, before transferring to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] for \u00a340,000 in March 1986. He did not settle at the club, but in the summer he was fortunate enough to win a \u00a360,000 move up through three tiers to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].\n\nThough never a prolific player for the \"Sky Blues\", he scored a spectacular headed goal in the [[1987 FA Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which earned him [[Match of the Day]]'s [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] award. He featured in the [[1987 FA Charity Shield]], but faded from the first team picture at [[Highfield Road]], and in March 1989 he joined [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] side [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] for a fee of \u00a3325,000. He returned to England in August 1991 when he was sold to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for \u00a3100,000. After falling out with manager [[John Rudge]] he returned to Hartlepool on a free transfer in June 1993. He was appointed as player-manager in April 1995, but endured a tough time at [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool|Victoria Park]], and left the club in November 1996. He later coached at the [[Middlesbrough F.C. Reserves and Academy|Middlesbrough Academy]] and entered the property market.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Early years===\nKeith Morton Houchen was born in [[Middlesbrough]] to Ken and Vernie Houchen, who both worked in [[social club]]s, and grew up some five minutes from [[Ayresome Park]].<ref name=\"page 15\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=15}}</ref> He grew up with three brothers; Jimmy, Dennis, and Patrick, who all joined the [[Coldstream Guards]]; and one sister, Jackie.<ref name=\"page 17\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=17}}</ref> He attended [[St Mary's College, Middlesbrough|St Mary's College]] as a youth.<ref name=\"page 17\"/> A promising athlete and gifted footballer, as a youngster he travelled to London for a trial with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] along with John and [[Terry Fenwick]], but was told he was too lightweight at the time.<ref name=\"page 13\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=13}}</ref> After an unsuccessful trial with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], he became an apprentice at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in 1977.<ref name=\"page 13\"/>\n\n===Hartlepool United===\nHe was not offered a professional contract at Chesterfield by manager [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]] and so left the club without making a senior appearance at [[Saltergate]].<ref name=\"page 15\"/> However, he was soon spotted playing amateur football in [[Nunthorpe]] by [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] manager [[Billy Horner]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=26}}</ref> Houchen joined the \"Monkey Hangers\" on non-contract terms, before turning professional in February 1978, signing a one-year contract on \u00a330 a week.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=27}}</ref> When he arrived at the [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool]] were a struggling [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] club.<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=29}}</ref> He made his debut in a 1\u20131 home draw with [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].<ref name=\"page 29\"/> Though grateful for the opportunity and training, Houchen lamented that \"we used to have a mad rush to the bank to cash our cheques.

However, having scored 65 goals in 170 league appearances, Houchen wanted a move to a bigger club at a higher division; he regularly handed in transfer requests, but all were ignored by the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=51}}</ref>\n\n===Leyton Orient===\nHartlepool United were in dire financial straits by March 1982, and were \u00a360,000 in debt to the [[Inland Revenue]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=53}}</ref> This crisis at the club allowed [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] manager [[Ken Knighton]] to take Houchen to [[Brisbane Road]] for a bargain price of \u00a325,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=59}}</ref> He signed a four-year contract on \u00a3225 a week with a \u00a31,000 signing on fee.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=65}}</ref> He scored one goal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 14 appearances, as the \"O's\" finished in last place and were relegated out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1982.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=61}}</ref> He missed the start of the [[1982\u201383 Football League|1982\u201383]] campaign due to injury, but managed to hit ten goals in 38 games by the end of the season.<ref name=\"page 64\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=64}}</ref> His ten goals included one against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on the last day of the season, in a win which kept Orient in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].<ref name=\"page 64\"/> He scored ten goals in 34 games in [[1983\u201384 Football League|1983\u201384]], but was not highly rated by new boss [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=66}}</ref> For his part, Houchen said that Clark \"would shout, and rant and rave, and tactically he wasn't particularly brilliant.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=67}}</ref> He handed in a transfer request, which was accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=68}}</ref>\n\n===York City===\nOn 22 March 1984, [[York City F.C.|York City]] manager [[Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)|Denis Smith]] signed Houchen for a \u00a315,000 fee,<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=73}}</ref> later saying that \"anybody who could score sixty-five goals playing for Hartlepool must have something\".<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=69}}</ref> He signed a two-year contract on \u00a3225 a week.<ref name=\"page 74\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=74}}</ref> He scored on his debut against [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] at the [[Recreation Ground (Aldershot)|Recreation Ground]], despite missing a penalty; he replaced [[Steve Senior]] in the second half, who had broken his leg.<ref name=\"page 74\"/> The \"Minstermen\" went on to win the Fourth Division championship by a 16-point margin, with Houchen featuring mostly as a substitute in the final seven games.<ref name=\"page 75\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=75}}</ref> With [[John Byrne (footballer, born 1961)|John Byrne]] and [[Keith Walwyn]] forming an effective striking partnership, Houchen played as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]].<ref name=\"page 75\"/> He hit a hat-trick in a 7\u20131 thrashing of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] at [[Bootham Crescent]],<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=76}}</ref> and also converted a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] that he had won to knock [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] out of the [[FA Cup]] at the Fourth Round.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=81}}</ref> He scored a total of 18 goals in 45 appearances in [[1984\u201385 Football League|1984\u201385]] to become the club's [[List of York City F.C. seasons|top scorer]]. However injuries helped to limit him to eight goals in 38 games in [[1985\u201386 Football League|1985\u201386]], and he decided to accept a move back down to the Fourth Division.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=89}}</ref>\n\n===Scunthorpe United===\nHe was sold on to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] for \u00a340,000 in March 1986, signing a contract of \u00a3250 a week and receiving a car and an [[ex gratia]] payment of \u00a310,000.<ref name=\"page 93\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=93}}</ref> Houchen later said that \"it was the only time I ever gave up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere...

He bagged five goals in their [[1986\u201387 FA Cup|1986\u201387]] cup-winning run, the first being the winning goal away at [[Old Trafford]] against [[Alex Ferguson]]'s [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|pp=108}}</ref> He then scored two against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the quarter-finals, and one against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in the semi-finals, both games being held at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|pp=110\u201312}}</ref> The final and most famous goal of the run came in the [[1987 FA Cup Final]] in front of 98,000 spectators at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in a 3\u20132 win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. However Houchen almost missed the match after catching [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]] from a [[trout]] caught by reserve goalkeeper [[Jake Findlay]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=120}}</ref> The goal came from a [[Dave Bennett (footballer, born 1959)|Dave Bennett]] cross and was an instinctive full-stretch diving header that was impossible for [[Ray Clemence]] to save.<ref name=\"page 137\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=137}}</ref> It levelled the score at 2\u20132 on 63 minutes, and an own goal from [[Gary Mabbutt]] in extra time won the game for Coventry. As well as his FA Cup winning medal, Houchen's header also earned him the [[BBC]] [[Match of the Day]]'s [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] award for the 1986\u201387 season. This was due to the acrobatic effort involved and partly due to the incredible run he had made from deep midfield to meet the crossed ball. It is generally considered as one of the most famous goals scored at Wembley,<ref name=\"We\" /> and certainly the best headed goal.\n\n{{Quote|\"I never took my eyes off the ball. I ran looking over my shoulder, watching the ball on the turn, running, running, so if it came, that was where I went... I couldn't honestly say to you that I was consciously thinking that if the ball comes in I can dive and head it \u2013 it's all instinct. I think all football is instinct and the only way I could get on the end of the ball was to throw myself. It all finishes up as perfect timing \u2013 the perfect ball, the perfect run \u2013 but in a lot of ways it's a fluke. When it is all perfect timing, it is like a dance \u2013 it all comes together. I do remember actually heading it. I knew I was getting it, I knew I was going to get a good head on it, and you do think in the split second, 'Don't head it wide, don't head it over, don't miss-head it.'... I headed right past him [Clemence], right in the corner.

A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he scored 184 goals in 687 league and cup games.\n\nHe started his professional career at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in February 1978, after failing to win a contract at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]]. He was coached by [[Billy Horner]] to become a strong centre-forward, using his natural strength and power to retain possession in attacking positions. Financial difficulties forced the club to sell him on to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] for \u00a325,000 in March 1982. After failing to impress in his two years in London, he was moved on to [[York City F.C.|York City]] for \u00a315,000 in March 1984. He played seven games in the club's [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] title winning season in 1983\u201384, before transferring to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] for \u00a340,000 in March 1986. He did not settle at the club, but in the summer he was fortunate enough to win a \u00a360,000 move up through three tiers to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].\n\nThough never a prolific player for the \"Sky Blues\", he scored a spectacular headed goal in the [[1987 FA Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which earned him [[Match of the Day]]'s [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] award. He featured in the [[1987 FA Charity Shield]], but faded from the first team picture at [[Highfield Road]], and in March 1989 he joined [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] side [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] for a fee of \u00a3325,000. He returned to England in August 1991 when he was sold to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for \u00a3100,000. After falling out with manager [[John Rudge]] he returned to Hartlepool on a free transfer in June 1993. He was appointed as player-manager in April 1995, but endured a tough time at [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool|Victoria Park]], and left the club in November 1996. He later coached at the [[Middlesbrough F.C. Reserves and Academy|Middlesbrough Academy]] and entered the property market.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Early years===\nKeith Morton Houchen was born in [[Middlesbrough]] to Ken and Vernie Houchen, who both worked in [[social club]]s, and grew up some five minutes from [[Ayresome Park]].<ref name=\"page 15\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=15}}</ref> He grew up with three brothers; Jimmy, Dennis, and Patrick, who all joined the [[Coldstream Guards]]; and one sister, Jackie.<ref name=\"page 17\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=17}}</ref> He attended [[St Mary's College, Middlesbrough|St Mary's College]] as a youth.<ref name=\"page 17\"/> A promising athlete and gifted footballer, as a youngster he travelled to London for a trial with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] along with John and [[Terry Fenwick]], but was told he was too lightweight at the time.<ref name=\"page 13\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=13}}</ref> After an unsuccessful trial with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], he became an apprentice at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in 1977.<ref name=\"page 13\"/>\n\n===Hartlepool United===\nHe was not offered a professional contract at Chesterfield by manager [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]] and so left the club without making a senior appearance at [[Saltergate]].<ref name=\"page 15\"/> However, he was soon spotted playing amateur football in [[Nunthorpe]] by [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] manager [[Billy Horner]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=26}}</ref> Houchen joined the \"Monkey Hangers\" on non-contract terms, before turning professional in February 1978, signing a one-year contract on \u00a330 a week.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=27}}</ref> When he arrived at the [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool]] were a struggling [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] club.<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=29}}</ref> He made his debut in a 1\u20131 home draw with [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].<ref name=\"page 29\"/> Though grateful for the opportunity and training, Houchen lamented that \"we used to have a mad rush to the bank to cash our cheques. Only about six of them would go through and the rest would [[Non-sufficient funds|bounce]].\"<ref name=\"page 33\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=33}}</ref> He scored his first senior goal against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 24 March 1978.<ref name=\"page 33\"/> He scored further goals against [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] to end the [[1977\u201378 Football League|1977\u201378]] campaign with four goals in 13 games.<ref name=\"page 33\"/> He played regular first team football in [[1978\u201379 Football League|1978\u201379]], and scored 13 goals in 42 games to become the club's top scorer.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=38}}</ref> He then went on to score 14 goals in 44 games in [[1979\u201380 Football League|1979\u201380]], as the club finished 19th, just two points above the re-election zone.<ref name=\"page 40\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=40}}</ref> His goalscoring record attracted the attention of bigger clubs, however club chairman Vince Barker told [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] that even if Houchen was available then they would not be able to afford him.<ref name=\"page 40\"/> His exploits continued into the following season, and the club rejected bids of up to \u00a380,000 from [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=43}}</ref> He scored 17 goals in 48 appearances in [[1980\u201381 Football League|1980\u201381]], yet again becoming the club's top scorer, as Hartlepool were in the promotion hunt until a late spell of bad form sent them down the table to ninth.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=44}}</ref> He hit 19 goals in 38 games in [[1981\u201382 Football League|1981\u201382]] to become the club's top-scorer for a fourth consecutive season. However, having scored 65 goals in 170 league appearances, Houchen wanted a move to a bigger club at a higher division; he regularly handed in transfer requests, but all were ignored by the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=51}}</ref>\n\n===Leyton Orient===\nHartlepool United were in dire financial straits by March 1982, and were \u00a360,000 in debt to the [[Inland Revenue]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=53}}</ref> This crisis at the club allowed [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] manager [[Ken Knighton]] to take Houchen to [[Brisbane Road]] for a bargain price of \u00a325,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=59}}</ref> He signed a four-year contract on \u00a3225 a week with a \u00a31,000 signing on fee.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=65}}</ref> He scored one goal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 14 appearances, as the \"O's\" finished in last place and were relegated out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1982.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=61}}</ref> He missed the start of the [[1982\u201383 Football League|1982\u201383]] campaign due to injury, but managed to hit ten goals in 38 games by the end of the season.<ref name=\"page 64\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=64}}</ref> His ten goals included one against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on the last day of the season, in a win which kept Orient in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].<ref name=\"page 64\"/> He scored ten goals in 34 games in [[1983\u201384 Football League|1983\u201384]], but was not highly rated by new boss [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=66}}</ref> For his part, Houchen said that Clark \"would shout, and rant and rave, and tactically he wasn't particularly brilliant.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=67}}</ref> He handed in a transfer request, which was accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=68}}</ref>\n\n===York City===\nOn 22 March 1984, [[York City F.C.|York City]] manager [[Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)|Denis Smith]] signed Houchen for a \u00a315,000 fee,<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=73}}</ref> later saying that \"anybody who could score sixty-five goals playing for Hartlepool must have something\".<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=69}}</ref> He signed a two-year contract on \u00a3225 a week.<ref name=\"page 74\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=74}}</ref> He scored on his debut against [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] at the [[Recreation Ground (Aldershot)|Recreation Ground]], despite missing a penalty; he replaced [[Steve Senior]] in the second half, who had broken his leg.<ref name=\"page 74\"/> The \"Minstermen\" went on to win the Fourth Division championship by a 16-point margin, with Houchen featuring mostly as a substitute in the final seven games.<ref name=\"page 75\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=75}}</ref> With [[John Byrne (footballer, born 1961)|John Byrne]] and [[Keith Walwyn]] forming an effective striking partnership, Houchen played as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]].<ref name=\"page 75\"/> He hit a hat-trick in a 7\u20131 thrashing of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] at [[Bootham Crescent]],<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=76}}</ref> and also converted a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] that he had won to knock [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] out of the [[FA Cup]] at the Fourth Round.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=81}}</ref> He scored a total of 18 goals in 45 appearances in [[1984\u201385 Football League|1984\u201385]] to become the club's [[List of York City F.C. seasons|top scorer]]. However injuries helped to limit him to eight goals in 38 games in [[1985\u201386 Football League|1985\u201386]], and he decided to accept a move back down to the Fourth Division.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=89}}</ref>\n\n===Scunthorpe United===\nHe was sold on to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] for \u00a340,000 in March 1986, signing a contract of \u00a3250 a week and receiving a car and an [[ex gratia]] payment of \u00a310,000.<ref name=\"page 93\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=93}}</ref> Houchen later said that \"it was the only time I ever gave up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere...

He bagged five goals in their [[1986\u201387 FA Cup|1986\u201387]] cup-winning run, the first being the winning goal away at [[Old Trafford]] against [[Alex Ferguson]]'s [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|pp=108}}</ref> He then scored two against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the quarter-finals, and one against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in the semi-finals, both games being held at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|pp=110\u201312}}</ref> The final and most famous goal of the run came in the [[1987 FA Cup Final]] in front of 98,000 spectators at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in a 3\u20132 win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. However Houchen almost missed the match after catching [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]] from a [[trout]] caught by reserve goalkeeper [[Jake Findlay]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=120}}</ref> The goal came from a [[Dave Bennett (footballer, born 1959)|Dave Bennett]] cross and was an instinctive full-stretch diving header that was impossible for [[Ray Clemence]] to save.<ref name=\"page 137\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=137}}</ref> It levelled the score at 2\u20132 on 63 minutes, and an own goal from [[Gary Mabbutt]] in extra time won the game for Coventry. As well as his FA Cup winning medal, Houchen's header also earned him the [[BBC]] [[Match of the Day]]'s [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] award for the 1986\u201387 season. This was due to the acrobatic effort involved and partly due to the incredible run he had made from deep midfield to meet the crossed ball. It is generally considered as one of the most famous goals scored at Wembley,<ref name=\"We\" /> and certainly the best headed goal.\n\n{{Quote|\"I never took my eyes off the ball. I ran looking over my shoulder, watching the ball on the turn, running, running, so if it came, that was where I went... I couldn't honestly say to you that I was consciously thinking that if the ball comes in I can dive and head it \u2013 it's all instinct. I think all football is instinct and the only way I could get on the end of the ball was to throw myself. It all finishes up as perfect timing \u2013 the perfect ball, the perfect run \u2013 but in a lot of ways it's a fluke. When it is all perfect timing, it is like a dance \u2013 it all comes together. I do remember actually heading it. I knew I was getting it, I knew I was going to get a good head on it, and you do think in the split second, 'Don't head it wide, don't head it over, don't miss-head it.'... I headed right past him [Clemence], right in the corner. It was past him before he could move, so it was just the perfect header.\"|Houchen recalls the moment that made his name synonymous with the FA Cup.<ref name=\"page 137\"/>}}\n\nIronically, manager John Sillett spent much of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (\u00a3750,000) on [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[David Speedie]], who would replace Houchen in front of goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=154}}</ref> Sillett's one consolation to Houchen was that he would play him in the [[1987 FA Charity Shield]], which ended in a 1\u20130 defeat to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref name=\"page 155\">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=155}}</ref> The [[1987\u201388 Football League|1987\u201388]] season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, [[Gary Bannister]] and [[Cyrille Regis]] restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=158}}</ref> On 14 August 1988, he was selected by [[Graham Taylor]] to represent [[the Football League]] in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of [[Glanford Park]];
