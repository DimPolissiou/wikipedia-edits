A total of 600 R32s were built, numbered 3350\u20133949, though some cars were re-numbered. The R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949); the former was paid by the city's capital budget and the latter was paid through a revenue bond. All were arranged as married pairs. The R32s were the first mass-produced [[stainless steel]] cars built for the New York City Subway. \n\nA ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 \"Brightliners\" cars was held on September 9, 1964. Various modifications were made over the years to the R32 fleet. In the late 1980s, all of the R32 cars were rebuilt, with ten cars being rebuilt by [[General Electric]] and the remaining cars being rebuilt by [[Morrison Knudsen]]. As part of the refurbishment, the original rollsigns and express/local marker lights at the end of each car were replaced with flipdot signs. After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A cars were renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE. The [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]] replaced most of the R32s in the late 2000s, though about one-third of the original fleet remained, all being Phase I R32s. The remaining active cars are maintained at the [[207th Street Yard]]; however, they are expected to be retired in 2020 and replaced with the [[R179 (New York City Subway car)|R179]]s. Some retired R32 cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system, including as museum exhibits or work cars.\n\n==Description==\nThe R32s are numbered 3350\u20133949, but some cars have been re-numbered outside of this range or to different numbers in this range. They were the first cars to introduce all-mylar route and destination rollsigns instead of the former cotton cloth or linen type rollsigns found on prior rail cars.\n\nThe R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/R-32_(Budd,_1964) |title=R-32 (Budd, 1964) |website=nycsubway.org |language=en |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> The R32As were funded through the proceeds of a revenue bond, while the R32s were paid for out of the 1963\u20131964 New York City capital budget.

Two previous Budd orders (the [[MS Multi-section car (New York City Subway car)|BMT Zephyr]] and the [[R11/R34 (New York City Subway car)|R11s]]) were limited production and/or experimental orders.

At the time, this was the largest railcar order ever placed in the United States for subway cars. The cars were ordered for $68,820,000,<ref name=\":1\" /> of which half was provided by New York City and half through the sale of bonds by the New York City Transit Authority.<ref name=\":0\" /> Budd had bid on previous contracts with the NYCTA, but had never won a City contract for a production run of cars until the R32s, as Budd built only stainless-steel equipment and the TA refused to allow a differential in competitive bids for this higher-quality construction.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/06/26/archives/600-stainlesssteel-subway-cars-ordered-for-city-at-68-million.html |title=600 Stainless-Steel Subway Cars Ordered for City at 68 Million; Considered in Past |last=Perlmutter |first=Emanuel |date=June 26, 1963 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 27, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nBudd won the contract by offering the lowest bid of $114,700 per car. The next lowest bidder came in at $117,900 per car, which was for low-alloy steel cars. Budd low-balled the price to win the contract and introduce stainless steel equipment to the modern [[New York City Subway]] system, a plan that was met with limited success.<ref name=\":2\" /> NYCTA allowed a premium for subsequent stainless steel contracts, and all subsequent equipment was at least partly constructed of stainless steel. However, the Budd Company never benefited from the change, as they failed to win further contracts from the NYCTA, and the company has since halted production of railroad cars.\n\nThe R32 cars originally came with blue passenger doors and blue storm doors. The passenger doors of many cars were repainted silver from 1974, as the graffiti epidemic worsened.<ref name=\"nycs-19720209\">{{cite web|last=Testagrose|first=Joe|title=Image 4758|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?4758|website=nycsubway.org|accessdate=26 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226205418/https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?4758|archivedate=26 February 2020|date=9 February 1974|url-status=live}}</ref> However, some cars retained or regained blue passenger doors towards the start of the General Overhaul (GOH) program, which replaced all the doors with stainless steel versions.<ref name=\"nycs-19881102\">{{cite web|last=Barnes|first1=John|title=Image 108103|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?108103|website=nycsubway.org|accessdate=26 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226210458/https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?108103|archivedate=26 February 2020|date=2 November 1988|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn August 18, 1964, the NYCTA approved a modification to the 300 R32s already constructed. The modification was required to ensure proper clearance in tunnels. Since the cars were 4000 pounds lighter than other subway cars when new, they did not sink as low on standard trucks and springs. The modification involved the modification of the body bolster.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/19/new-subway-cars-lowered-to-avoid-any-close-scrapes.html |title=New Subway Cars Lowered to Avoid Any Close Scrapes |date=August 19, 1964 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 27, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nA ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 \"Brightliners\" cars was held on September 9, 1964, operating from the [[New York Central Railroad]]'s Mott Haven Yards in the Bronx to [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The new cars were then placed into service on the '''{{NYCS|Q}}''' on September 14, 1964, after their New York Central's spring-loaded under-running third rail shoes were replaced with gravity-type overrunning subway third rail shoes.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The R32s were originally assigned to the BMT Southern Division service only, initially on the [[BMT Brighton Line|Brighton Line]] ('''Q''' train) and the [[BMT Sea Beach Line|Sea Beach Line]] ('''{{NYCS|N}}''' train), but were eventually reassigned to the [[BMT West End Line|West End Line]] ('''{{NYCS|T}}''' and '''TT''' trains).\n\nCars 3946\u20133949 were delivered with Pioneer trucks and disc brakes in 1966.

Ten cars were rebuilt by [[General Electric]] at its facility in [[Buffalo, New York]] (cars 3594-3595, 3880-3881, 3892-3893, 3936-3937, and 3934-3935) as prototype rebuilds, and the remaining cars were rebuilt by [[Morrison\u2013Knudsen]] at its facility in [[Hornell, New York]].<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48294055022/in/album-72157709666433846/</ref> During the rebuilding process, the route and destination mylar rollsigns located above the storm doors were removed and replaced with Luminator [[Flip-disc display|flipdot]] electronic route signs that can display both letters and numbers, including zero. This is because the air conditioning evaporators mounted on the interior car ends made it difficult to change the front route and destination signs.

The R32 Phase I cars (re-built by Morrison Knudsen) have WABCO Air Brake packages, GE Master Controllers, and Thermo King HVAC units. The R32 Phase II cars (also re-built by Morrison Knudsen) had NY Air Brake equipment, Westinghouse Master Controllers, and Stone Safety HVAC units. The ten prototype rebuild R32 GE cars differ from the Phase I and II cars as they were rebuilt to [[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]] specifications. They had experimental Sigma HVAC Units powered by A/C motors and solid state inverters, original traction motors rebuilt to 115 horsepower instead of the traditional 100 horsepower units, backlit ad signs, and different bulkhead designs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?2352 |title=Showing Image 2352 |work=nycsubway.org}}</ref> Since the cars were sent out to be overhauled based on how poorly they were performing (worst first), there are R32s and R32As rebuilt in both Phase I and Phase II configurations.

A total of 600 R32s were built, numbered 3350\u20133949, though some cars were re-numbered. The R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949); the former was paid by the city's capital budget and the latter was paid through a revenue bond. All were arranged as married pairs. The R32s were the first mass-produced [[stainless steel]] cars built for the New York City Subway. \n\nA ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 \"Brightliners\" cars was held on September 9, 1964. Various modifications were made over the years to the R32 fleet. In the late 1980s, all of the R32 cars were rebuilt, with ten cars being rebuilt by [[General Electric]] and the remaining cars being rebuilt by [[Morrison Knudsen]]. As part of the refurbishment, the original rollsigns and express/local marker lights at the end of each car were replaced with flipdot signs. After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A cars were renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE. The [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]] replaced most of the R32s in the late 2000s, though about one-third of the original fleet remained, all being Phase I R32s. The remaining active cars are maintained at the [[207th Street Yard]]; however, they are expected to be retired in 2020 and replaced with the [[R179 (New York City Subway car)|R179]]s. Some retired R32 cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system, including as museum exhibits or work cars.\n\n==Description==\nThe R32s are numbered 3350\u20133949, but some cars have been re-numbered outside of this range or to different numbers in this range. They were the first cars to introduce all-mylar route and destination rollsigns instead of the former cotton cloth or linen type rollsigns found on prior rail cars.\n\nThe R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/R-32_(Budd,_1964) |title=R-32 (Budd, 1964) |website=nycsubway.org |language=en |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> The R32As were funded through the proceeds of a revenue bond, while the R32s were paid for out of the 1963\u20131964 New York City capital budget.

At the time, this was the largest railcar order ever placed in the United States for subway cars. The cars were ordered for $68,820,000,<ref name=\":1\" /> of which half was provided by New York City and half through the sale of bonds by the New York City Transit Authority.<ref name=\":0\" /> Budd had bid on previous contracts with the NYCTA, but had never won a City contract for a production run of cars until the R32s, as Budd built only stainless-steel equipment and the TA refused to allow a differential in competitive bids for this higher-quality construction.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/06/26/archives/600-stainlesssteel-subway-cars-ordered-for-city-at-68-million.html |title=600 Stainless-Steel Subway Cars Ordered for City at 68 Million; Considered in Past |last=Perlmutter |first=Emanuel |date=June 26, 1963 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 27, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nBudd won the contract by offering the lowest bid of $114,700 per car. The next lowest bidder came in at $117,900 per car, which was for low-alloy steel cars.

It features racing on a weekly basis from April to September in USRA Modified, USRA Stock Car, USRA B-Mod, E-Modifieds, Grand National and Factory Stock categories. Racing at the track is unsanctioned but follows [[United States Racing Association]] Weekly Racing Series as well as IMCA ([[International Motor Contest Association]]).\n\n==History==\nThe track originally opened on April 17, 1955, at 92nd and Leavenworth Road. However, three deaths during the 1956 racing season forced its closure. Lakeside Speedway reopened under new management in 1961 and continued at the Leavenworth Road location through 1988 when developers for [[The Woodlands (race track)|The Woodlands]] dog & horse racing track purchased the property. Lakeside Speedway then moved to its present location at 5615 Wolcott Drive, also in Kansas City, Kansas. The move enabled not only construction of modern grandstands and a press box, but also provided room for an adjacent campground for racing fans. From 1989 to 1999 Lakeside operated as a half-mile asphalt track. In 2000, it was again under new management, which converted the speedway to a high-banked 4/10-mile dirt track.<ref>http://lakesidespeedway.net/track/</ref> Flooding is an ongoing concern at the facility due to its close proximity to the [[Missouri River]].\n\n==NASCAR connection==\nThe track hosted one [[NASCAR Convertible Series]] event in 1956. The race was won by [[Frank Mundy]]. The [[NASCAR Midwest Series]] also ran one race at the speedway in 1999.\n\nAmong the notable NASCAR drivers who have raced at Lakeside Speedway is [[Clint Bowyer]]. Bowyer still holds several records at the track.\n\n==Most wins(2000-2013)==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! 1st\n! 2nd\n! 3rd\n! 4th\n! 5th\n! 6th\n! 7th\n! 8th\n! 9th\n! 10th\n!

It features racing on a weekly basis from April to September in USRA Modified, USRA Stock Car, USRA B-Mod, E-Modifieds, Grand National and Factory Stock categories. Racing at the track is unsanctioned but follows [[United States Racing Association]] Weekly Racing Series as well as IMCA [[ International Motor Contest Association]]\n\n==History==\nThe track originally opened on April 17, 1955, at 92nd and Leavenworth Road. However, three deaths during the 1956 racing season forced its closure. Lakeside Speedway reopened under new management in 1961 and continued at the Leavenworth Road location through 1988 when developers for [[The Woodlands (race track)|The Woodlands]] dog & horse racing track purchased the property. Lakeside Speedway then moved to its present location at 5615 Wolcott Drive, also in Kansas City, Kansas. The move enabled not only construction of modern grandstands and a press box, but also provided room for an adjacent campground for racing fans. From 1989 to 1999 Lakeside operated as a half-mile asphalt track. In 2000, it was again under new management, which converted the speedway to a high-banked 4/10-mile dirt track.<ref>http://lakesidespeedway.net/track/</ref> Flooding is an ongoing concern at the facility due to its close proximity to the [[Missouri River]].\n\n==NASCAR connection==\nAmong the notable NASCAR drivers who have raced at Lakeside Speedway is [[Clint Bowyer]].

Draining the central portion of New Hampshire, it once flowed southeast, leaving via what is now [[Alton Bay, New Hampshire|Alton Bay]] toward the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. When glacial debris blocked this path, flow was redirected westward through [[Paugus Bay]] into the Winnipesaukee River.

At the northern tip of Meredith Bay is the main village of the town of [[Meredith, New Hampshire|Meredith]]. [[Paugus Bay]] branches off to the south of Meredith Bay at [[Weirs Beach, New Hampshire|Weirs Beach]], near to where Meredith Bay joins the main body of the lake. Meredith Bay is separated from the Broads by a relatively narrow [[strait]] bordered by [[Governors Island (Lake Winnipesaukee)|Governors Island]] to the south and Stonedam Island to the north. The northeastern shore of Meredith Bay is a long peninsula known as Meredith Neck.\n\n=== Paugus Bay ===\n{{main|Paugus Bay}}\nFormerly a hydrologically distinct lake, Paugus Bay became joined to Winnipesaukee when the dam at [[Lakeport, New Hampshire|Lakeport]] was constructed, raising the surface of Paugus Bay to be contiguous with Winnipesaukee. Paugus Bay joins the main lake in Meredith Bay, running south from a narrow channel connecting it to Meredith Bay. At the northern end of Paugus Bay, where it joins the main lake, is [[Weirs Beach, New Hampshire|Weirs Beach]], the largest and most visited public beach on the lake. At the other end is the village of Lakeport. Both Weirs Beach and Lakeport are villages within the city of Laconia. The eastern shore of the bay is closely followed by [[U.S. Route 3]], and has numerous motels, hotels, inns, and bungalow complexes. The western shore is much less developed.\n\n=== Alton Bay ===\nAlton Bay is a narrow bay which runs due south from the southern corner of the main lake. It lies entirely within the town of [[Alton, New Hampshire|Alton]]. The village of [[Alton Bay, New Hampshire|Alton Bay]] lies at the extreme southern tip.\n\n=== Wolfeboro Bay ===\nWolfeboro Bay is a relatively small wide bay lying in the town of [[Wolfeboro, New Hampshire|Wolfeboro]], creating a small northerly bulge in the shoreline to the eastern edge of Winnipesaukee. A series of smaller lakes and streams connects Wolfeboro Bay to [[Lake Wentworth]].\n\n=== Winter Harbor ===\nWinter Harbor is a Y-shaped bay with two branches, separated from the Broads by Wolfeboro Neck and Tuftonboro Neck. Winter Harbor is surrounded by many quiet resort communities in the towns of Wolfeboro and [[Tuftonboro, New Hampshire|Tuftonboro]]. It also has panoramic views of the [[Belknap Mountains]] and looks out toward [[Rattlesnake Island (New Hampshire)|Rattlesnake Island]]. \n\n=== Moultonborough Bay ===\nThe longest bay on Winnipesaukee is Moultonborough Bay. It is connected to the Broads by some narrow straits running between a cluster of islands including Long Island (the largest island in the lake), Cow Island, Little Bear Island, Sandy Island, and dozens of smaller islands and islets. The {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=mid|-long|0}} Moultonborough Neck separates the length of the bay from the main axis of the lake, and the [[Suissevale, New Hampshire|Suissevale]] development in the town of [[Moultonborough, New Hampshire|Moultonborough]] is at the northern tip of the bay.

The area is home to numerous summer theater troupes and offers a variety of land and water recreational activities. There are numerous hiking trails in and around the surrounding mountains, which include the [[Ossipee Mountains]] to the east, the [[Belknap Range]] to the west, and Red Hill to the north.\n\n==Steamship ''Mount Washington'' and her successor==\n[[File:MountWashington.jpg|thumb|left|275px|''The Mount Washington Under Full Speed Ahead'', 2006, painted by Peter Buck]]\nThe paddlesteamer {{MS|Mount Washington}}, named after the highest of New Hampshire's [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], was launched in spring 1872 to carry mail, goods, and passengers on Lake Winnipesaukee, under the flag of the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]]. With a hull length of {{convert|178|ft|m}} and a beam of {{convert|49|ft|m}} she appeared as a typical representative of the North American sidewheelers around the second half of the century and was the largest steamer on the lake at that time. The huge paddle wheels were driven by a single-cylinder steam engine of {{convert|450|hp|abbr=on}} at approximately 26 rpm. The power was transferred from the vertical single cylinder to the wheel shaft by the walking beam, high above the upper deck, oscillating in the frequency of the paddle wheels. Known as \"The Mount\", her kitchen and restaurant service became famous.\n\nOn December 23, 1939, a nearby railroad station caught fire from an overheated stove. The fire soon spread to the ship, tied at the dock, and destroyed it. Efforts to cut ''Mount Washington'' loose were to no avail as it was a time of extremely low water and the hull was stuck fast in the mud of the lake bottom. Soon after, a local company was formed to build a new ship. Since Europe was already at war, and the US was stocking steel in a pre-war munitions build-up obtaining steel was impossible. Instead, they purchased an old sidewheel vessel on Lake Champlain: the ''Chateaugay'', a {{convert|203|ft|m|adj=on}}, iron-hulled sidewheeler that was being used as a club house for the Burlington yacht club. It was cut into sections by Boston General Ship & Engine Works and transported to Lake Winnipesaukee on rail cars. A new twin-screw vessel was designed for the hull being welded back together at Lakeport.<ref name=hedblom /> Powered by two steam engines taken from another ocean-going yacht, the new MS ''Mount Washington'' made her maiden voyage on August 15, 1940.\n\nTwo years after her launch, the new ''Mount Washington''{{'}}s engines and boilers were removed for use in a navy vessel during World War II. After the war, ''Mount Washington'' returned to the water. The ship was a success in the post-war tourist boom.<ref>Paul H. Blaisdell: ''Three Centuries on Winnipesaukee'' (1975). New Hampshire Publishing Company, Somersworth, N.H.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, ''Mount Washington'' was cut open and extended with an additional {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} hull section to add larger lounge and food service facilities.<ref name=hedblom /> Still popular, she makes one or two round trips on the lake per day during the summer season, as well as numerous dinner dance cruises in the evenings.\n\n==US mailboat M/V ''Sophie C.''==\n[[File:M.V.

A series of smaller lakes and streams connects Wolfeboro Bay to [[Lake Wentworth]].\n\n=== Winter Harbor ===\nWinter Harbor is a Y-shaped bay with two branches, separated from the Broads by Wolfeboro Neck and Tuftonboro Neck. Winter Harbor is surrounded by many quiet resort communities in the towns of Wolfeboro and [[Tuftonboro, New Hampshire|Tuftonboro]]. It also has panoramic views of the [[Belknap Mountains]] and looks out toward [[Rattlesnake Island (New Hampshire)|Rattlesnake Island]]. \n\n=== Moultonborough Bay ===\nThe longest bay on Winnipesaukee is Moultonborough Bay.

The area is home to numerous summer theater troupes and offers a variety of land and water recreational activities. There are numerous hiking trails in and around the surrounding mountains, which include the [[Ossipee Mountains]] to the east, the [[Belknap Range]] to the west, and Red Hill to the north.\n\n==Steamship ''Mount Washington'' and her successor==\n[[File:MountWashington.jpg|thumb|left|275px|''The Mount Washington Under Full Speed Ahead'', 2006, painted by Peter Buck]]\nThe paddlesteamer {{MS|Mount Washington}}, named after the highest of New Hampshire's [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], was launched in spring 1872 to carry mail, goods, and passengers on Lake Winnipesaukee, under the flag of the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]]. With a hull length of {{convert|178|ft|m}} and a beam of {{convert|49|ft|m}} she appeared as a typical representative of the North American sidewheelers around the second half of the century and was the largest steamer on the lake at that time. The huge paddle wheels were driven by a single-cylinder steam engine of {{convert|450|hp|abbr=on}} at approximately 26 rpm. The power was transferred from the vertical single cylinder to the wheel shaft by the walking beam, high above the upper deck, oscillating in the frequency of the paddle wheels. Known as \"The Mount\", her kitchen and restaurant service became famous.\n\nOn December 23, 1939, a nearby railroad station caught fire from an overheated stove. The fire soon spread to the ship, tied at the dock, and destroyed it. Efforts to cut ''Mount Washington'' loose were to no avail as it was a time of extremely low water and the hull was stuck fast in the mud of the lake bottom. Soon after, a local company was formed to build a new ship. Since Europe was already at war, and the US was stocking steel in a pre-war munitions build-up obtaining steel was impossible. Instead, they purchased an old sidewheel vessel on Lake Champlain: the ''Chateaugay'', a {{convert|203|ft|m|adj=on}}, iron-hulled sidewheeler that was being used as a club house for the Burlington yacht club. It was cut into sections by Boston General Ship & Engine Works and transported to Lake Winnipesaukee on rail cars. A new twin-screw vessel was designed for the hull being welded back together at Lakeport.<ref name=hedblom /> Powered by two steam engines taken from another ocean-going yacht, the new MS ''Mount Washington'' made her maiden voyage on August 15, 1940.\n\nTwo years after her launch, the new ''Mount Washington''{{'}}s engines and boilers were removed for use in a navy vessel during World War II. After the war, ''Mount Washington'' returned to the water. The ship was a success in the post-war tourist boom.<ref>Paul H. Blaisdell: ''Three Centuries on Winnipesaukee'' (1975). New Hampshire Publishing Company, Somersworth, N.H.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, ''Mount Washington'' was cut open and extended with an additional {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} hull section to add larger lounge and food service facilities.<ref name=hedblom /> Still popular, she makes one or two round trips on the lake per day during the summer season, as well as numerous dinner dance cruises in the evenings.\n\n==US mailboat M/V ''Sophie C.''==\n[[File:M.V.

The house is sent spinning into the air, and she awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.\n\nThe house lands in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] in the [[Land of Oz]]. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the North]] and the [[Munchkin]]s welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the [[Wicked Witch of the East]].  Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], arrives to claim her [[ruby slippers]], but Glinda transfers them onto Dorothy's feet first.  Enraged, the Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy and vanishes.  Glinda tells Dorothy to keep the slippers on and follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the [[Emerald City]], where she can ask the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] to help her return home.  On her journey, Dorothy meets the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who wants a brain, the [[Tin Woodman]], who desires a heart, and the [[Cowardly Lion]], who needs courage.  Dorothy invites them to accompany her to Emerald City, where they can also ask the Wizard for help.  Despite the Witch's attempts to stop them, they reach the Emerald City and are eventually allowed to see the Wizard, who appears as a ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke.  He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.\n\nAs the foursome and Toto make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch captures Dorothy and plots to kill her and retrieve the slippers. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don their uniforms and free Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase and surround them.  The Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, causing Dorothy to toss a bucket of water, inadvertently splashing the Witch, who melts away; the guards rejoice and give Dorothy her broomstick.\n\nUpon their return to the Emerald City, the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises until Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the \"Wizard\" as a middle-aged man operating machinery and speaking into a microphone. Admitting to being a [[humbug]], he insists that he is \"a good man but a bad wizard.\" The Wizard then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his [[hot air balloon]], revealing that he is also from Kansas and was originally a carnival worker before a tornado brought him to the Emerald City, whereupon he accepted the job as Wizard due to [[Great Depression|hard times]].\n\nAs Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto becomes distracted by a cat and leaps from Dorothy's arms. As Dorothy pursues Toto, the balloon disembarks with the Wizard, leaving her behind. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the ruby slippers have the power to return her to Kansas. After sharing a tearful farewell with Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, Dorothy follows Glinda's instructions: she must close her eyes, tap her heels together three times, and state repeatedly, \"There's no place like home.\" Dorothy complies and she wakes up in her bedroom surrounded by her family and friends, including Toto.  Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real and says she will never run away from home again before declaring, \"There's no place like home!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{For|a list of all the munchkin actors/actresses in the film|Munchkin#Actors and actresses}} <!--There were a-lot of roles with the munchkin characters-->\n\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Lahr Garland Bolger Haley 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8| The [[Cowardly Lion]], [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]], and [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]] are the film's main characters.]]\nCast listing:\n* [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as (in order of appearance) Professor Marvel/The Gatekeeper/The Carriage Driver/The Guard/[[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard of Oz]]\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as \"Hunk\" / [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]]\n* [[Jack Haley]] as \"Hickory\" / [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]]\n* [[Bert Lahr]] as \"Zeke\" / The [[Cowardly Lion]]\n* [[Billie Burke]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Miss Almira Gulch / [[Wicked Witch of the West|The Wicked Witch of the West]] \"Julia Burns\"\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]\n* [[Pat Walshe]] as Nikko the [[Winged monkeys|Winged Monkey]] King\n* [[Clara Blandick]] as [[Auntie Em]]\n* [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]\n* [[Mitchell Lewis]] as the Winkie Guard Captain (credited only in the [[IMAX]] version)\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as the voice of [[Juliet]] in the Tin Man's song \"[[If I Only Had a Heart]]\" (uncredited)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-adriana-caselotti-1277975.html |title=Obituary: Adriana Caselotti |last=Sibley |first=Brian |date=February 10, 1997 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProduction on the film began when [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could still be successful.<ref name=\"Fricke2\">{{Cite book |title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History |last=Fricke |first=John |authorlink=John Fricke |last2=Scarfone |first2=Jay |last3=Stillman |first3=William |year=1986 |publisher=Warner Books, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-446-51446-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 }}</ref><ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" /> In January 1938, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought the rights to L. Frank Baum\u2019s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|hugely popular novel]] from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for [[Eddie Cantor]] who was under contract to the Goldwyn studios and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" />\n\nThe script went through several writers and revisions before the final shooting.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s assistant, [[William Cannon (director)|William H. Cannon]], had submitted a brief four-page outline.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements of the story. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields, while the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity, torture that softened him into somebody gentler and kinder.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> His vision was similar to [[Larry Semon]]'s [[The Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] of the story in which the magical elements are absent.\n\nAfterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes and a few weeks later, a further 56 pages. He also hired [[Noel Langley]] and poet [[Ogden Nash]] to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline, Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. He{{who|date=August 2017}} turned in three more, this time incorporating the songs that had been written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]]. [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They would be responsible for making sure the story stayed true to the Baum book.

Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and [[operetta]] and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for [[Betty Jaynes (actress)|Betty Jaynes]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fordin | first = Hugh | title = World of Entertainment | publisher = Avon Books  | location =  | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-380-00754-7 }}</ref> The plan was later dropped.\n\nAnother scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene back in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I'll miss you most of all.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433010|title=Hollywood Reporter|date= October 20, 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\nMuch attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others.

Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues.\n\n[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ebsen's costume test as the Tin Man]]\n[[Ray Bolger]] was originally cast as the Tin Man and [[Buddy Ebsen]] was to play the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol [[Fred Stone]] had done [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|on stage in 1902]]; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, \"I'm not a tin performer; I'm fluid\"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired.<ref name=\"cemeteryguide.com\">[http://www.cemeteryguide.com/bolger.html Cemetery Guide, ''Hollywood Remains to Be Seen'', Mark Masek].</ref> Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous \"wobbly-walk\" of Stone's Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.<ref>Fricke, John and Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref>\n\n[[Bert Lahr]] was signed for the Cowardly Lion on July 25, 1938; the next month, [[Charles Grapewin]] was cast as Uncle Henry on August 12.\n\n[[W. C. Fields]] was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard, a role turned down by [[Ed Wynn]] as he thought the part was too small, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over Fields' fee. [[Wallace Beery]] lobbied for the role, but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule. Instead, another contract player, [[Frank Morgan]], was cast on September 22.\n\nAn extensive talent search produced over a hundred [[Dwarfism|little people]] to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor [[Jerry Maren]], the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to ${{Inflation|index=US|value=125|start_year=1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). [[Meinhardt Raabe]], who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary ''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They then had to photograph and catalog each Munchkin in his or her costume so that they could correctly apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\n\n[[Gale Sondergaard]] was originally cast as the Wicked Witch. She became unhappy when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the wicked queen in Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'') into the familiar \"ugly hag\". She turned down the role and was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] that she had no regrets about turning down the part, and would go on to play a glamorous villainess in Fox's version of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (1940 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' in 1940; Margaret Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939).\n\nAccording to Aljean Harmetz, the \"gone-to-seed\" coat worn by Morgan as the wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a concocted studio rumor.<ref>[[Michael Patrick Hearn|Hearn, Michael Patrick]].

Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage, nine days in total, involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, as well as a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue, which, though unreleased, comprises the only footage of [[Buddy Ebsen]]'s Tin Man.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Practical PHP and MySQL web site databases : a simplified approach|last=West, Adrian W.|isbn=978-1430260776|location=New York|oclc=859580733|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Ebsen replaced by Haley ====\nThe production faced the challenge of simulating the Tin Man's costume.

As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor's creative realignment, as producer LeRoy had already pronounced his satisfaction with the new course the film was taking.\n\nProduction on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939. Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to be fitted with makeup and costumes, and often did not leave until 7 pm or later. Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight-bright lighting the early Technicolor process required, which could heat the set to over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).

Therefore, while he had to be dropped from the cast due to illness from the aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained in the soundtrack (as noted in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). In the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", his voice can be heard. Haley spoke with a distinct [[Boston accent]], thus did not pronounce the ''r'' in ''wizard''. By contrast, Ebsen was a [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]], like Garland, and pronounced it. Haley rerecorded Ebsen's solo parts later.\n\nBolger's original recording of \"[[If I Only Had a Brain]]\" had been far more sedate compared to the version heard in the film; during the filming, Cukor and LeRoy decided that a more energetic rendition would better suit Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow and the song was rerecorded as such. At first thought to be lost, a copy of the original version was discovered in 2009.<ref>[http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513210807/http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain |date=May 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Song list====\n* \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale\n* Munchkinland Sequence:\n** \"Come Out&nbsp;{{nbsp}}...\" \u2013 Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins\n** \"It Really Was No Miracle\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy, Billy Bletcher and the Munchkins\n** \"We Thank You Very Sweetly\" \u2013 Frank Cucksey and Joseph Koziel\n** \"[[Ding-Dong!

Hail! The Witch is Dead!\", sung upon the return to the Emerald City]]\nSome musical pieces filmed were deleted in the editing process.\n\nThe song \"The Jitterbug\", written in a swing style, was intended for the sequence in which the group is journeying to the Witch's castle. Due to time constraints, the song was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage for the song has been lost, although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived. The sound recording for the song, however, is intact and was included in the two-CD [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] deluxe edition of the film soundtrack, as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"\n\nAnother musical number cut before release occurred right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!\" This started with the Witch's guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration of the citizens of the Emerald City singing the song as they accompany Dorothy and her friends to see the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio still exists and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record deluxe edition of the film soundtrack.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack \u2013 The Deluxe Edition'', 2-CD set, original recording remastered, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] # 71964 (July 18, 1995)</ref>\n\nIn addition, a brief reprise of \"Over the Rainbow\" was intended to be sung by Garland while Dorothy is trapped in the Witch's castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. The original soundtrack recording still exists, however, and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onwards.<ref>Warner Bros. 2005 ''The Wizard of Oz'' Deluxe DVD edition, program notes and audio extras.</ref>\n\n====Underscoring====\nExtensive edits in the film's final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully [[Underscoring|underscored]], with instrumental snippets from the film's various [[leitmotif]]s throughout. There was also some recognizable popular music, including:\n* Excerpts from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s \"The Happy Farmer\", at several points early in the film, including the opening scene when Dorothy and Toto are hurrying home after their encounter with Miss Gulch, when Toto escapes from her, and when the house is \"riding\" the tornado.\n* An excerpt of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s \"Opus 16, #2\", when Toto escapes from the Witch's castle.\n* An excerpt of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Night on Bald Mountain]]\", when Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion are trying to escape from the Witch's castle.\n* \"[[In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree]]\", when Dorothy and the Scarecrow discover the anthropomorphic apple trees.\n* \"[[Gaudeamus Igitur]]\" during the Wizard's presentation of awards to the group.\n* \"[[Home! Sweet Home!]]\", in part of the underscore of the closing scene, at Dorothy's house in Kansas.\n\n(The above list is excerpted from the liner notes on the Rhino Records collection.)\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Principal photography]] concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939; nonetheless, reshoots and pick-up shots were filmed throughout April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. After the deletion of the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise during subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back one more time to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song; the footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was simply reused.\n\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pick-ups for the scene in which she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy chose to have stand-in Betty Danko perform the scene, instead; as a result, Danko was severely injured doing the scene due to a malfunction in the smoke mechanism.<ref>''The Making of the Wizard of Oz \u2013 Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM \u2013 and the Miracle of Production #1060'', 10th Edition, Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc./Random House, 1989.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the film began a long arduous post-production. [[Herbert Stothart]] had to compose the film's background score, while [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] had to perfect the various special effects that the film required, including many of the rear projection shots. The MGM art department also had to create the various matte paintings for the background of many of the scenes.\n\nOne significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\n\n[[Test screening]]s of the film began on June 5, 1939.<ref name=\"geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|title=\"The Wizard of Oz\"...&nbsp;A Movie Timeline|author=Jim's \"Wizard of Oz\" Website Directory|publisher=geocities.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114114015/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archivedate=November 14, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2007}}</ref> ''Oz'' initially ran nearly two hours long. LeRoy and Fleming knew that at least 15 minutes needed to be deleted to get the film down to a manageable running time; the average film in 1939 ran for just about 90 minutes. Three sneak previews in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California]], helped guide LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\nOne song that was almost deleted was \"Over the Rainbow\". MGM had felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the [[Academy Award]] for Best Song of the Year, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her theme song.\n\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Wizard of Oz (Oconomowoc) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A memorial commemorating the film's world premiere at the Strand Theatre in [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin]] on August 12, 1939]]\n\nThe film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] on August 10, 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/7892|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> The film's first sneak preview was held in [[San Bernardino, California]].<ref>Down The Yellow Brick Road: The Making of The Wizard Of Oz\"McClelland, 1976 Publisher Pyramid Publications (Harcourt Brace Jonavich)</ref>\nThe film was previewed in three [[test market]]s: on August 11, 1939, at [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and [[Dennis, Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite web| title= Hello, yellow brick road | url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/51361182.html | date= July 21, 2009 | first= Scott|last= Williams | publisher= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | accessdate=October 21, 2011| quote=John Fricke, a historian who has written books about ''The Wizard of Oz'', said that MGM executives arranged advance screenings in a handful of small communities to find out how audiences would respond to the musical adventure, which cost nearly $3 million to produce.

While these were considerable earnings, the high production cost, in association with various distribution and other costs, meant the movie initially recorded a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/> It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.5|1949|r=0}}}} million today). However, for all the risks and cost that MGM undertook to produce the film, it was considered at least more successful than anyone thought it would be. According to Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography ''Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland'', \"Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.\" Finch also writes that after the success of the film, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top-ten box office stars in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finch |first=Christofer |title=Rainbow: The Stormy Life Of Judy Garland |year=1975 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-28407-5 |page=84}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and honors===\n\n====Academy Awards====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

One day, Toto bites neighbor Miss Almira Gulch on the leg, leading her to obtain an order from the sheriff to [[Animal euthanasia|euthanize]] him.  In spite of Dorothy's pleas and Aunt Em's resistance, Miss Gulch takes Toto away in a basket, but Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy; she decides to run away in order to ensure that Toto won't be euthanized.  Not far from the farm, she meets [[Professor Marvel]], a kind fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart.  Horrified, Dorothy rushes home as a storm approaches; a [[tornado]] forms, and Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the farmhands take shelter in the [[storm cellar]] as Dorothy arrives home. Unable to be heard begging for entry, Dorothy seeks shelter in her bedroom. The window is blown in from its frame and hits Dorothy on the head, knocking her unconscious.  The house is sent spinning into the air, and she awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.\n\nThe house lands in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] in the [[Land of Oz]]. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the North]] and the [[Munchkin]]s welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the [[Wicked Witch of the East]].  Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], arrives to claim her [[ruby slippers]], but Glinda transfers them onto Dorothy's feet first.  Enraged, the Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy and vanishes.  Glinda tells Dorothy to keep the slippers on and follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the [[Emerald City]], where she can ask the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] to help her return home.  On her journey, Dorothy meets the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who wants a brain, the [[Tin Woodman]], who desires a heart, and the [[Cowardly Lion]], who needs courage.  Dorothy invites them to accompany her to Emerald City, where they can also ask the Wizard for help.  Despite the Witch's attempts to stop them, they reach the Emerald City and are eventually allowed to see the Wizard, who appears as a ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke.  He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.\n\nAs the foursome and Toto make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch captures Dorothy and plots to kill her and retrieve the slippers. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don their uniforms and free Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase and surround them.  The Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, causing Dorothy to toss a bucket of water, inadvertently splashing the Witch, who melts away; the guards rejoice and give Dorothy her broomstick.\n\nUpon their return to the Emerald City, the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises until Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the \"Wizard\" as a middle-aged man operating machinery and speaking into a microphone. Admitting to being a [[humbug]], he insists that he is \"a good man but a bad wizard.\" The Wizard then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his [[hot air balloon]], revealing that he is also from Kansas and was originally a carnival worker before a tornado brought him to the Emerald City, whereupon he accepted the job as Wizard due to [[Great Depression|hard times]].\n\nAs Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto becomes distracted by a cat and leaps from Dorothy's arms. As Dorothy pursues Toto, the balloon disembarks with the Wizard, leaving her behind. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the ruby slippers have the power to return her to Kansas. After sharing a tearful farewell with Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, Dorothy follows Glinda's instructions: she must close her eyes, tap her heels together three times, and state repeatedly, \"There's no place like home.\" Dorothy complies and she wakes up in her bedroom surrounded by her family and friends, including Toto.  Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real and says she will never run away from home again before declaring, \"There's no place like home!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{For|a list of all the munchkin actors/actresses in the film|Munchkin#Actors and actresses}} <!--There were a-lot of roles with the munchkin characters-->\n\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Lahr Garland Bolger Haley 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8| The [[Cowardly Lion]], [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]], and [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]] are the film's main characters.]]\nCast listing:\n* [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as (in order of appearance) Professor Marvel/The Gatekeeper/The Carriage Driver/The Guard/[[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard of Oz]]\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as \"Hunk\" / [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]]\n* [[Jack Haley]] as \"Hickory\" / [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]]\n* [[Bert Lahr]] as \"Zeke\" / The [[Cowardly Lion]]\n* [[Billie Burke]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Miss Almira Gulch / [[Wicked Witch of the West|The Wicked Witch of the West]]\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]\n* [[Pat Walshe]] as Nikko the [[Winged monkeys|Winged Monkey]] King\n* [[Clara Blandick]] as [[Auntie Em]]\n* [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]\n* [[Mitchell Lewis]] as the Winkie Guard Captain (credited only in the [[IMAX]] version)\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as the voice of [[Juliet]] in the Tin Man's song \"[[If I Only Had a Heart]]\" (uncredited)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-adriana-caselotti-1277975.html |title=Obituary: Adriana Caselotti |last=Sibley |first=Brian |date=February 10, 1997 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProduction on the film began when [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could still be successful.<ref name=\"Fricke2\">{{Cite book |title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History |last=Fricke |first=John |authorlink=John Fricke |last2=Scarfone |first2=Jay |last3=Stillman |first3=William |year=1986 |publisher=Warner Books, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-446-51446-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 }}</ref><ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" /> In January 1938, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought the rights to L. Frank Baum\u2019s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|hugely popular novel]] from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for [[Eddie Cantor]] who was under contract to the Goldwyn studios and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" />\n\nThe script went through several writers and revisions before the final shooting.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s assistant, [[William Cannon (director)|William H. Cannon]], had submitted a brief four-page outline.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements of the story. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields, while the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity, torture that softened him into somebody gentler and kinder.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> His vision was similar to [[Larry Semon]]'s [[The Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] of the story in which the magical elements are absent.\n\nAfterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes and a few weeks later, a further 56 pages. He also hired [[Noel Langley]] and poet [[Ogden Nash]] to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline, Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. He{{who|date=August 2017}} turned in three more, this time incorporating the songs that had been written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]]. [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They would be responsible for making sure the story stayed true to the Baum book. However, producer [[Arthur Freed]] was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley.<ref name=Coan>{{cite news|last=Coan|first=Stephen|title=KZN's very own screen wizard|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&global%5B_id%5D=73897|accessdate=April 24, 2014|newspaper=The Witness|date=December 22, 2011}}</ref> During filming, [[Victor Fleming]] and [[John Lee Mahin]] revised the script further, adding and cutting some scenes.

And he \u2013 there was eleven screenwriters on that \u2013 and he pulled the whole thing together, wrote his own lines and gave the thing a coherence and unity which made it a work of art.

Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and [[operetta]] and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for [[Betty Jaynes (actress)|Betty Jaynes]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fordin | first = Hugh | title = World of Entertainment | publisher = Avon Books  | location =  | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-380-00754-7 }}</ref> The plan was later dropped.\n\nAnother scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene back in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I'll miss you most of all.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433010|title=Hollywood Reporter|date= October 20, 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\nMuch attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others.

Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues.\n\n[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ebsen's costume test as the Tin Man]]\n[[Ray Bolger]] was originally cast as the Tin Man and [[Buddy Ebsen]] was to play the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol [[Fred Stone]] had done [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|on stage in 1902]]; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, \"I'm not a tin performer; I'm fluid\"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired.<ref name=\"cemeteryguide.com\">[http://www.cemeteryguide.com/bolger.html Cemetery Guide, ''Hollywood Remains to Be Seen'', Mark Masek].</ref> Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous \"wobbly-walk\" of Stone's Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.<ref>Fricke, John and Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref>\n\n[[Bert Lahr]] was signed for the Cowardly Lion on July 25, 1938; the next month, [[Charles Grapewin]] was cast as Uncle Henry on August 12.\n\n[[W. C. Fields]] was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard, a role turned down by [[Ed Wynn]] as he thought the part was too small, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over Fields' fee. [[Wallace Beery]] lobbied for the role, but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule. Instead, another contract player, [[Frank Morgan]], was cast on September 22.\n\nAn extensive talent search produced over a hundred [[Dwarfism|little people]] to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor [[Jerry Maren]], the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to ${{Inflation|index=US|value=125|start_year=1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). [[Meinhardt Raabe]], who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary ''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They then had to photograph and catalog each Munchkin in his or her costume so that they could correctly apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\n\n[[Gale Sondergaard]] was originally cast as the Wicked Witch. She became unhappy when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the wicked queen in Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'') into the familiar \"ugly hag\". She turned down the role and was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] that she had no regrets about turning down the part, and would go on to play a glamorous villainess in Fox's version of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (1940 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' in 1940; Margaret Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939).\n\nAccording to Aljean Harmetz, the \"gone-to-seed\" coat worn by Morgan as the wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a concocted studio rumor.<ref>[[Michael Patrick Hearn|Hearn, Michael Patrick]].

Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage, nine days in total, involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, as well as a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue, which, though unreleased, comprises the only footage of [[Buddy Ebsen]]'s Tin Man.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Practical PHP and MySQL web site databases : a simplified approach|last=West, Adrian W.|isbn=978-1430260776|location=New York|oclc=859580733|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Ebsen replaced by Haley ====\nThe production faced the challenge of simulating the Tin Man's costume.

As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor's creative realignment, as producer LeRoy had already pronounced his satisfaction with the new course the film was taking.\n\nProduction on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939. Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to be fitted with makeup and costumes, and often did not leave until 7 pm or later. Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight-bright lighting the early Technicolor process required, which could heat the set to over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).

The music was composed by [[Harold Arlen]], and the lyrics were written by [[Yip Harburg]], both of whom won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song was ranked first in two lists: the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s \"[[Songs of the Century|365 Songs of the Century]]\".\n\nMGM composer [[Herbert Stothart]], a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in recognition of his original score.\n\n[[Georgie Stoll]] was associate conductor and screen credit was given to [[George Bassman]], [[Murray Cutter]], [[Ken Darby]] and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements (as usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)\n\nThe songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Therefore, while he had to be dropped from the cast due to illness from the aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained in the soundtrack (as noted in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). In the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", his voice can be heard. Haley spoke with a distinct [[Boston accent]], thus did not pronounce the ''r'' in ''wizard''. By contrast, Ebsen was a [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]], like Garland, and pronounced it. Haley rerecorded Ebsen's solo parts later.\n\nBolger's original recording of \"[[If I Only Had a Brain]]\" had been far more sedate compared to the version heard in the film; during the filming, Cukor and LeRoy decided that a more energetic rendition would better suit Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow and the song was rerecorded as such.

Due to time constraints, the song was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage for the song has been lost, although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived. The sound recording for the song, however, is intact and was included in the two-CD [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] deluxe edition of the film soundtrack, as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"\n\nAnother musical number cut before release occurred right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!\" This started with the Witch's guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration of the citizens of the Emerald City singing the song as they accompany Dorothy and her friends to see the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers.

However, the film was fully [[Underscoring|underscored]], with instrumental snippets from the film's various [[leitmotif]]s throughout. There was also some recognizable popular music, including:\n* Excerpts from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s \"The Happy Farmer\", at several points early in the film, including the opening scene when Dorothy and Toto are hurrying home after their encounter with Miss Gulch, when Toto escapes from her, and when the house is \"riding\" the tornado.\n* An excerpt of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s \"Opus 16, #2\", when Toto escapes from the Witch's castle.\n* An excerpt of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Night on Bald Mountain]]\", when Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion are trying to escape from the Witch's castle.\n* \"[[In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree]]\", when Dorothy and the Scarecrow discover the anthropomorphic apple trees.\n* \"[[Gaudeamus Igitur]]\" during the Wizard's presentation of awards to the group.\n* \"[[Home! Sweet Home!]]\", in part of the underscore of the closing scene, at Dorothy's house in Kansas.\n\n(The above list is excerpted from the liner notes on the Rhino Records collection.)\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Principal photography]] concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939; nonetheless, reshoots and pick-up shots were filmed throughout April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. After the deletion of the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise during subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back one more time to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song; the footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was simply reused.\n\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pick-ups for the scene in which she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy chose to have stand-in Betty Danko perform the scene, instead; as a result, Danko was severely injured doing the scene due to a malfunction in the smoke mechanism.<ref>''The Making of the Wizard of Oz \u2013 Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM \u2013 and the Miracle of Production #1060'', 10th Edition, Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc./Random House, 1989.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the film began a long arduous post-production. [[Herbert Stothart]] had to compose the film's background score, while [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] had to perfect the various special effects that the film required, including many of the rear projection shots. The MGM art department also had to create the various matte paintings for the background of many of the scenes.\n\nOne significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\n\n[[Test screening]]s of the film began on June 5, 1939.<ref name=\"geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|title=\"The Wizard of Oz\"...&nbsp;A Movie Timeline|author=Jim's \"Wizard of Oz\" Website Directory|publisher=geocities.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114114015/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archivedate=November 14, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2007}}</ref> ''Oz'' initially ran nearly two hours long. LeRoy and Fleming knew that at least 15 minutes needed to be deleted to get the film down to a manageable running time; the average film in 1939 ran for just about 90 minutes. Three sneak previews in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California]], helped guide LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\nOne song that was almost deleted was \"Over the Rainbow\". MGM had felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the [[Academy Award]] for Best Song of the Year, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her theme song.\n\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Wizard of Oz (Oconomowoc) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A memorial commemorating the film's world premiere at the Strand Theatre in [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin]] on August 12, 1939]]\n\nThe film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] on August 10, 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/7892|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> The film's first sneak preview was held in [[San Bernardino, California]].<ref>Down The Yellow Brick Road: The Making of The Wizard Of Oz\"McClelland, 1976 Publisher Pyramid Publications (Harcourt Brace Jonavich)</ref>\nThe film was previewed in three [[test market]]s: on August 11, 1939, at [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and [[Dennis, Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite web| title= Hello, yellow brick road | url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/51361182.html | date= July 21, 2009 | first= Scott|last= Williams | publisher= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | accessdate=October 21, 2011| quote=John Fricke, a historian who has written books about ''The Wizard of Oz'', said that MGM executives arranged advance screenings in a handful of small communities to find out how audiences would respond to the musical adventure, which cost nearly $3 million to produce.

While these were considerable earnings, the high production cost, in association with various distribution and other costs, meant the movie initially recorded a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/> It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.5|1949|r=0}}}} million today). However, for all the risks and cost that MGM undertook to produce the film, it was considered at least more successful than anyone thought it would be. According to Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography ''Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland'', \"Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.\" Finch also writes that after the success of the film, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top-ten box office stars in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finch |first=Christofer |title=Rainbow: The Stormy Life Of Judy Garland |year=1975 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-28407-5 |page=84}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and honors===\n\n====Academy Awards====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

While it remains the normal term for the latter two aspects, the language began to be called Old English towards the end of the 19th century, as a result of the increasingly strong anti-Germanic nationalism in English society of the 1890s and early 1900s. However many authors still also use the term Anglo-Saxon to refer to the language.<br/> {{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-521-53033-4}}</ref> is the earliest historical form of the [[English language]], spoken in [[England]] and southern and eastern [[Scotland]] in the early [[Middle Ages]]. It was probably brought to [[Great Britain]] by [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] in the mid-5th century, and the first [[Old English literature|Old English literary works]] date from the mid-7th century. After the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], a [[langues d'o\u00efl|relative of French]]. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as [[Middle English]].\n\nOld English developed from a set of [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] or [[Ingvaeonic]] dialects originally spoken by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes traditionally known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]. As the [[Anglo-Saxons]] became dominant in England, their language [[Celtic language-death in England|replaced]] the languages of [[Roman Britain]]: [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion]]. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]]: [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]]. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period,<ref name=\":2\" /> although the dominant forms of Middle and [[Modern English]] would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong [[Old Norse]] influence due to [[Danelaw|Scandinavian rule]] and settlement beginning in the 9th century.\n\nOld English is one of the [[West Germanic languages]], and its closest relatives are [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]]. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study. Within [[Old English grammar]] nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many [[inflection]]al endings and forms, and [[word order]] is much freer.<ref name=\":2\" /> The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic system]], but from about the 8th century this was replaced by a [[Old English Latin alphabet|version of the Latin alphabet]].\n\n==Terminology==\n''Englisc'', which the term ''English'' is [[List of English words of Anglo-Saxon origin|derived from]], means 'pertaining to the Angles'.<ref>Fennell, Barbara 1998. ''A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach''. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> In Old English, this word was derived from ''Angles'' (one of the [[Germanic tribe]]s who conquered parts of Great Britain in the 5th century).<ref>Pyles, Thomas and John Algeo 1993. ''Origins and development of the English language''. 4th edition. (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich).</ref> During the 9th century, all invading Germanic tribes were referred to as ''Englisc''. It has been hypothesised that the Angles acquired their name because their land on the coast of [[Jutland]] (now mainland [[Denmark]]) resembled a [[fishhook]]. [[Proto-Germanic]] {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*anguz}} also had the meaning of 'narrow', referring to the shallow waters near the coast. That word ultimately goes back to Proto-Indo-European ''{{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*h\u2082en\u01f5\u02b0-}}'', also meaning 'narrow'.<ref>Barber, Charles, Joan C. Beal and Philip A. Shaw 2009. ''The English language. A historical introduction''. Second edition of Barber (1993). Cambridge: University Press.</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that the derivation of 'narrow' is the more likely connection to [[angling]] (as in [[fishing]]), which itself stems from a [[Proto-Indo-European root|Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root]] meaning ''bend, angle''.<ref>Mugglestone, Lynda (ed.) 2006. ''The Oxford History of English.'' Oxford: University Press.</ref> The semantic link is the fishing hook, which is curved or bent at an angle.<ref>Hogg, Richard M. and David Denison (ed.) 2006. ''A history of the English language''. Cambridge: University Press.</ref> In any case, the Angles may have been called such because they were a [[fishing]] people or were originally descended from such, and therefore England would mean 'land of the [[fishermen]]', and English would be 'the fishermen's language'.<ref>Baugh, Albert C. and Thomas Cable 1993 ''A history of the English language''. 4th edition. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall).</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of the English language}}\n[[File:Old norse, ca 900.PNG|thumb|The approximate extent of Germanic languages in the early 10th century:\n{{legend|#ff0000|'''[[w:Old West Norse|Old West Norse]]'''}}\n{{legend|#ff9933|'''[[w:Old East Norse|Old East Norse]]'''}}\n{{legend|#ff00ff|'''[[w:Old Gutnish|Old Gutnish]]'''}}\n{{legend|#ffff00|'''[[w:Old English|Old English]]''' ([[w:North Sea Germanic|North Sea Germanic]])}}\n{{legend|#00ff00|Continental West Germanic languages ([[Old Frisian]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old Dutch]], [[Old High German]]).}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|'''[[w:Crimean Gothic|Crimean Gothic]]''' ([[w:East Germanic|East Germanic]])}}]]\n\nOld English was not static, and its usage covered a period of 700 years, from the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] in the 5th century to the late 11th century, some time after the Norman invasion. While indicating that the establishment of dates is an arbitrary process, Albert Baugh dates Old English from 450 to 1150, a period of full inflections, a [[synthetic language]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Perhaps around 85% of Old English words are no longer in use, but those that survived are basic elements of [[Modern English]] vocabulary.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOld English is a [[West Germanic language]], developing out of [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] (also known as North Sea Germanic) dialects from the 5th century. It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] which became the [[Kingdom of England]]. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern [[Scotland]], which for several centuries belonged to the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Other parts of the island \u2013 [[Wales]] and most of [[Scotland]] \u2013 continued to use [[Celtic languages]], except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements where [[Old Norse]] was spoken. Celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of England: [[Cornish language#Middle Cornish|Medieval Cornish]] was spoken all over [[Cornwall]] and in adjacent parts of [[Devon]], while [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of [[Cumbria]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] may have been spoken on the English side of the [[England\u2013Wales border|Anglo-Welsh border]]. Norse was also widely spoken in the parts of England which fell under [[Danelaw|Danish law]].\n\nAnglo-Saxon literacy developed after [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation]] in the late 7th century. The oldest surviving work of [[Old English literature]] is ''[[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]]'', which was composed between 658 and 680 but not written down until the early 8th century.<ref name=\":2\" /> There is a limited corpus of [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic inscriptions]] from the 5th to 7th centuries, but the oldest coherent runic texts (notably the inscriptions on the [[Franks Casket]]) date to the early 8th century. The [[Old English Latin alphabet]] was introduced around the 8th century.\n\n[[File:Statue d'Alfred le Grand \u00e0 Winchester.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.86|[[Alfred the Great]] statue in [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]]. The 9th-century English King proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.]]\nWith the unification of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (outside the [[Danelaw]]) by [[Alfred the Great]] in the later 9th century, the language of government and literature became standardised around the [[West Saxon dialect]] (Early West Saxon). Alfred [[Alfred the Great#Advocacy of education in the English language|advocated education in English]] alongside Latin, and had many works translated into the English language; some of them, such as [[Pope Gregory I]]'s treatise ''[[Pastoral Care]]'', appear to have been translated by Alfred himself. In Old English, typical of the development of literature, poetry arose before prose, but Alfred chiefly inspired the growth of prose.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA later literary standard, dating from the late 10th century, arose under the influence of Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold of Winchester]], and was followed by such writers as the prolific [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham]] (\"the Grammarian\").

In terms of geography the Northumbrian region lay north of the Humber River; the Mercian lay north of the Thames and South of the Humber River; West Saxon lay south and southwest of the Thames; and the smallest, Kentish region lay southeast of the Thames, a small corner of England. The Kentish region, settled by the Jutes from Jutland, has the scantiest literary remains.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEach of these four dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, Northumbria south of the [[River Tyne|Tyne]], and most of [[Mercia]], were [[Viking invasion of Britain|overrun by the Vikings]] during the 9th century. The portion of Mercia that was successfully defended, and all of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], were then integrated into Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]].\nFrom that time on, the West Saxon dialect (then in the form now known as Early West Saxon) became standardised as the language of government, and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from Latin in that period.\n\nThe later literary standard known as Late West Saxon (see [[#History|History]], above), although centred in the same region of the country, appears not to have been directly descended from Alfred's Early West Saxon. For example, the former [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/iy/}} tended to become monophthongised to {{IPA|/i/}} in EWS, but to {{IPA|/y/}} in LWS.<ref>Hogg (1992), p. 117; but for a different interpretation of this, see [[Old English phonology#Diphthongs|Old English diphthongs]].</ref>\n\nDue to the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is relatively little written record of the non-Wessex dialects after Alfred's unification. Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars.<ref>Magennis (2011), pp. 56\u201360.</ref> Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while [[Scots language|Scots]] developed from the Northumbrian dialect. It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the [[West Country dialects#History and origins|dialect of Somerset]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/somersetshiredi00bayngoog The Somersetshire dialect: its pronunciation, 2 papers (1861)] Thomas Spencer Baynes, first published 1855 & 1856</ref>\n\nFor details of the sound differences between the dialects, see [[Phonological history of Old English#Dialects|Phonological history of Old English (dialects)]].\n\n==Influence of other languages==\n{{further|Celtic influence in English|Latin influence in English|Scandinavian influence in English}}\nThe language of the Anglo-Saxon settlers appears not to have been significantly affected by the native [[British Celtic languages]] which it [[Celtic language-death in England|largely displaced]]. The number of Celtic [[loanwords]] introduced into the language is very small, although dialect and toponymic terms are more often retained in western language contact zones (Cumbria, Devon, Welsh Marches and Borders and so on) than in the east. However, various suggestions have been made concerning possible influence that Celtic may have had on developments in English [[syntax]] in the post-Old English period, such as the regular [[progressive aspect|progressive]] construction and [[Analytic language|analytic word order]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |title=Rotary-munich.de |format=PDF |accessdate=20 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327012738/http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009  }}</ref> as well as the eventual development of the periphrastic auxiliary verb \"do\".

It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral [[Angles]] and [[Saxon people|Saxons]] left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were [[Christianization of England|converted to Christianity]] and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the [[Latin alphabet]] was introduced and adapted for the [[#Orthography|writing of Old English]], replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly [[Old French]]) words into English occurred after the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and thus in the [[Middle English]] rather than the Old English period.\n\nAnother source of loanwords was [[Old Norse]], which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the [[Danelaw]] from the late 9th century, and during the rule of [[Cnut]] and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many [[toponym|place-names]] in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the [[West Saxon dialect]], away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in [[Middle English]] texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Language|last = Baugh|first = Albert|publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul|year = 1951|isbn = |location = London|pages = 60\u201383; 110\u2013130 (Scandinavian influence).}}</ref><ref name=\"Shay2008\">{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Shay |title=The history of English: a linguistic introduction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1vj0-f_U1SQC&pg=PA86 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |date=30 January 2008 |publisher=Wardja Press |isbn=978-0-615-16817-3 |page=86}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Growth and Structure of the English Language|last = Jespersen|first = Otto|publisher = B.

For sound changes before and after the Old English period, see [[Phonological history of English]].\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Old English grammar}}\n\n===Morphology===\n[[Noun]]s [[declension|decline]] for five [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]]; three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; and two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular, and plural; and are strong or weak. The instrumental is vestigial and only used with the masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the [[dative case|dative]]. Only [[pronoun]]s and strong adjectives retain separate [[instrumental case|instrumental]] forms. There is also sparse early Northumbrian evidence of a sixth case: the [[locative case|locative]]. The evidence comes from Northumbrian [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] texts  (e.g., {{script|Runr|\u16a9\u16be \u16b1\u16a9\u16de\u16c1}} ''on rodi'' \"on the Cross\").<ref>{{cite book |title=An Introduction to English Runes|last=Boydell|date=1999|page=230}}</ref>\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, number, and strong, or weak forms. [[Pronoun]]s and sometimes [[participle]]s agree in case, gender, and number. First-person and second-[[grammatical person|person]] [[personal pronoun]]s occasionally distinguish [[dual (grammatical number)|dual-number]] forms. The [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] {{lang|ang|s\u0113}} and its [[inflection]]s serve as a [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] (\"the\"), a [[demonstrative adjective]] (\"that\"), and [[Pronoun#Demonstrative|demonstrative pronoun]]. Other [[demonstrative]]s are {{lang|ang|\u00fees}} (\"this\"), and {{lang|ang|\u0121eon}} (\"yon\"). These words [[inflection|inflect]] for case, gender, number. Adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings, weak ones being used when a definite or possessive [[determiner]] is also present.\n\nVerbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, and third; two numbers: singular, plural; two [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: present, and past; three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[grammatical mood#indicative|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[imperative mood|imperative]];<ref name=\"Continuum\">{{cite web|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of British Literature|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/britlit/old_english|publisher=Continuum}}</ref> and are strong (exhibiting ablaut) or weak (exhibiting a dental suffix). Verbs have two [[infinitive]] forms: bare, and bound; and two [[participle]]s: present, and past. The subjunctive has past and present forms. Finite verbs agree with [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in person, and number. The [[future tense]], [[passive voice]], and other [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] are formed with compounds.\n[[Preposition and postposition|Adpositions]] are mostly before but often after their object. If the [[object (grammar)|object]] of an adposition is marked in the dative case, an adposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.\n\nRemnants of the Old English case system in Modern English are in the [[English personal pronouns|forms of a few pronouns]] (such as ''I/me/mine'', ''she/her'', [[Who (pronoun)|''who/whom/whose'']]) and in the [[English possessive|possessive]] ending ''-'s'', which derives from the masculine and neuter genitive ending ''-es''. The modern [[English plural]] ending ''-(e)s'' derives from the Old English ''-as'', but the latter applied only to \"strong\" masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases; different plural endings were used in other instances. Old English nouns had [[grammatical gender]], while modern English has only natural gender. Pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender when those conflicted, as in the case of {{lang|ang|\u01bf\u012bf}}, a neuter noun referring to a female person.\n\nIn Old English's verbal compound constructions are the beginnings of the [[Uses of English verb forms|compound tenses of Modern English]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Bruce |last2=Robinson |first2=Fred C |year=2002 |title=A Guide to Old English |place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |pages=109\u2013112}}</ref> Old English verbs include [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]], which form the past tense by altering the root vowel, and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]], which use a suffix such as {{lang|ang|-de}}.<ref name=\"Continuum\"/> As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular). Like today, Old English had fewer strong verbs, and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms. Then, as now, dental suffixes indicated the past tense of the weak verbs, as in ''work'' and ''worked''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Syntax===\nOld English [[syntax]] is similar to [[English grammar|that of modern English]]. Some differences are consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection, allowing freer [[word order]].\n*Default word order is [[verb-second]] in [[independent clause|main clauses]], and verb-final in [[subordinate clause]]s, being more like modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (and to a slightly lesser extent{{efn|Both German, Old English and Dutch use the same V2 word order in main clauses, but Old English (generally) and modern Dutch also use the same structure in subordinate clauses.}} the structure of  [[German language|German]]) than modern English.<ref>\u00d8ystein Heggelund (2007) Old English subordinate clauses and the shift to verb-medial order in English, English Studies, 88:3, 351-361</ref>\n*No [[do-support|''do''-support]] in questions and negatives. Questions were usually formed by [[inversion (linguistics)|inverting]] [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[finite verb]], and negatives by placing ''ne'' before the finite verb, regardless what verb. \n*Multiple negatives can stack up in a sentence intensifying each other ([[negative concord]]).\n*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type \"when X, Y\" (e.g. \"When I got home, I ate dinner\") don't use a ''wh-''type conjunction, but rather a ''th-''type [[correlative conjunction]] such as {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0101}}, otherwise meaning \"then\" (e.g. {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0101 X, \u00fe\u0101 Y}} in place of \"when X, Y\").

From around the 8th century, the runic system came to be supplanted by a (minuscule) [[half-uncial]] script of the [[Latin alphabet]] introduced by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish Christian]] missionaries.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |year=1987 |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencycl000crys |url-access=registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-26438-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencycl000crys/page/203 203]}}</ref> This was replaced by [[Insular script]], a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script. This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental [[Carolingian minuscule]] (also known as ''Caroline'') replaced the insular.\n\nThe Latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters {{angbr|j}} and {{angbr|w}}, and there was no {{angbr|v}} as distinct from {{angbr|u}}; moreover native Old English spellings did not use {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|q}} or {{angbr|z}}. The remaining 20 Latin letters were supplemented by four more: {{angbr|[[\u00e6]]}} ({{lang|ang|\u00e6sc}}, modern ''ash'') and {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00f0}}}} ({{lang|ang|\u00f0\u00e6t}}, now called [[eth (letter)|eth]] or edh), which were modified Latin letters, and [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u00fe}}}} and [[wynn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}}, which are borrowings from the futhorc. A few letter pairs were used as [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s, representing a single sound. Also used was the [[Tironian note]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u204a}}}} (a character similar to the digit 7) for the [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''and''. A common [[scribal abbreviation]] was a [[thorn with stroke|thorn with a stroke]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\ua765}}}}, which was used for the pronoun {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u00e6t}}. [[Macron (diacritic)|Macron]]s over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels (as in modern editions), but to indicate stress, or as abbreviations for a following ''m'' or ''n''.<ref>C.M. Millward, Mary Hayes, ''A Biography of the English Language'', Cengage Learning 2011, p. 96.</ref><ref>Stephen Pollington, ''First Steps in Old English'', Anglo-Saxon Books 1997, p. 138.</ref>\n\nModern editions of Old English manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions. The modern forms of Latin letters are used, including {{angbr|g}} in place of the [[insular G]], {{angle bracket|s}} for [[long S]], and others which may differ considerably from the insular script, notably {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|r}}. Macrons are used to indicate long vowels, where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals. (In some older editions an [[acute accent]] mark was used for consistency with Old Norse conventions.) Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|c}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|g}}}} by placing dots above the palatals: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u010b}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u0121}}}}. The letter wynn {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}} is usually replaced with {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|w}}}}, but {{lang|ang|\u00e6sc}}, eth and thorn are normally retained (except when eth is replaced by thorn).\n\nIn contrast with [[English orthography|Modern English orthography]], that of Old English was reasonably [[regular spelling|regular]], with a mostly predictable correspondence between letters and [[phoneme]]s. There were not usually any [[silent letter]]s\u2014in the word ''cniht'', for example, both the {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|h}} were pronounced, unlike the {{angbr|k}} and {{angbr|gh}} in the modern ''knight''.

What they contained, how important they were for an understanding of literature before the Conquest, we have no means of knowing: the scant catalogues of monastic libraries do not help us, and there are no references in extant works to other compositions....How incomplete our materials are can be illustrated by the well-known fact that, with few and relatively unimportant exceptions, all extant Anglo-Saxon poetry is preserved in four manuscripts.}}\n\nSome of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are ''[[Beowulf]]'', an [[epic poem]]; the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a record of early English history; the [[Franks Casket]], an inscribed early whalebone artefact; and [[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]], a Christian religious poem. There are also a number of extant prose works, such as sermons and saints' lives, biblical translations, and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, legal documents, such as laws and wills, and practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography. Still, poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous, with a few exceptions, such as [[Bede]] and [[C\u00e6dmon]]. C\u00e6dmon, the earliest English poet we know by name, served as a lay brother in the monastery at Whitby.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===''Beowulf''===\nThe first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic ''[[Beowulf]]'', a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of Old English.<ref name=\":2\" /> This passage describes how [[Hrothgar]]'s legendary ancestor [[Scyld]] was found as a baby, washed ashore, and adopted by a noble family. The translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order. As such, it is not typical of Old English prose. The modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem.\n\nThe words in brackets are implied in the Old English by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context. Notice how ''what'' is used by the poet where a word like ''lo'' or ''behold'' would be expected. This usage is similar to ''what-ho!'', both an expression of surprise and a call to attention.\n\nEnglish poetry is based on stress and alliteration. In alliteration, the first consonant in a word alliterates with the same consonant at the beginning of another word, as with {{lang|ang|'''G'''\u0101r-Dena}} and {{lang|ang|'''\u0121'''e\u0101r-dagum}}.

At first these were often [[marginalia|marginal]] or [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] glosses, but soon came to be gathered into word-lists such as the [[\u00c9pinal-Erfurt glossary|\u00c9pinal-Erfurt]], [[Leiden Glossary|Leiden]] and [[Corpus Glossary|Corpus]] Glossaries. Over time, these word-lists were consolidated and alphabeticised to create extensive Latin-Old English glossaries with some of the character of [[dictionary|dictionaries]], such as the [[Cleopatra Glossaries]], the [[Harley Glossary]] and the [[Brussels Glossary]].<ref>Patrizia Lendinara, \u2018Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries: An Introduction\u2019, in Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries (Aldershot: Variorum, 1999), pp. 1\u201326.</ref> In some cases, the material in these glossaries continued to be circulated and updated in [[Middle English]] glossaries, such as the [[Durham Plant-Name Glossary]] and the [[Laud Herbal Glossary]].<ref>''Das Durhamer Pflanzenglossar: lateinisch und altenglish'', ed. by Bogislav von Lindheim, Beitr\u00e4ge zur englischen Philologie, 35 (Bochum-Langendreer: Poppinghaus, 1941).</ref>\n\nOld English lexicography was revived in the early modern period, drawing heavily on Anglo-Saxons' own glossaries. The major publication at this time was [[William Somner]]'s ''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum''.<ref>William Somner, ''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum'', English Linguistics 1500\u20131800 (A Collection of Facsimile Reprints), 247 (Menston: The Scholar Press, 1970).</ref> The next substantial Old English dictionary was [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' of 1838.\n\n===Modern===\nIn modern scholarship, the following dictionaries remain current:\n\n* [[Angus Cameron (academic)|Cameron, Angus]], et al.

Various digitisations are available open-access, including at [http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/ http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/].

It was probably brought to [[Great Britain]] by [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] in the mid-5th century, and the first [[Old English literature|Old English literary works]] date from the mid-7th century. After the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], a [[langues d'o\u00efl|relative of French]]. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as [[Middle English]].\n\nOld English developed from a set of [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] or [[Ingvaeonic]] dialects originally spoken by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes traditionally known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]. As the [[Anglo-Saxons]] became dominant in England, their language [[Celtic language-death in England|replaced]] the languages of [[Roman Britain]]: [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion]]. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]]: [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]]. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period,<ref name=\":2\" /> although the dominant forms of Middle and [[Modern English]] would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong [[Old Norse]] influence due to [[Danelaw|Scandinavian rule]] and settlement beginning in the 9th century.\n\nOld English is one of the [[West Germanic languages]], and its closest relatives are [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]]. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study. Within [[Old English grammar]] nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many [[inflection]]al endings and forms, and [[word order]] is much freer.<ref name=\":2\" /> The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic system]], but from about the 8th century this was replaced by a [[Old English Latin alphabet|version of the Latin alphabet]].\n\n==Terminology==\n''Englisc'', which the term ''English'' is [[List of English words of Anglo-Saxon origin|derived from]], means 'pertaining to the Angles'.<ref>Fennell, Barbara 1998. ''A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach''. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> In Old English, this word was derived from ''Angles'' (one of the [[Germanic tribe]]s who conquered parts of Great Britain in the 5th century).<ref>Pyles, Thomas and John Algeo 1993. ''Origins and development of the English language''. 4th edition. (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich).</ref> During the 9th century, all invading Germanic tribes were referred to as ''Englisc''. It has been hypothesised that the Angles acquired their name because their land on the coast of [[Jutland]] (now mainland [[Denmark]]) resembled a [[fishhook]]. [[Proto-Germanic]] {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*anguz}} also had the meaning of 'narrow', referring to the shallow waters near the coast. That word ultimately goes back to Proto-Indo-European ''{{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*h\u2082en\u01f5\u02b0-}}'', also meaning 'narrow'.<ref>Barber, Charles, Joan C. Beal and Philip A. Shaw 2009. ''The English language. A historical introduction''. Second edition of Barber (1993). Cambridge: University Press.</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that the derivation of 'narrow' is the more likely connection to [[angling]] (as in [[fishing]]), which itself stems from a [[Proto-Indo-European root|Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root]] meaning ''bend, angle''.<ref>Mugglestone, Lynda (ed.) 2006. ''The Oxford History of English.'' Oxford: University Press.</ref> The semantic link is the fishing hook, which is curved or bent at an angle.<ref>Hogg, Richard M. and David Denison (ed.) 2006. ''A history of the English language''. Cambridge: University Press.</ref> In any case, the Angles may have been called such because they were a [[fishing]] people or were originally descended from such, and therefore England would mean 'land of the [[fishermen]]', and English would be 'the fishermen's language'.<ref>Baugh, Albert C. and Thomas Cable 1993 ''A history of the English language''. 4th edition.

While indicating that the establishment of dates is an arbitrary process, Albert Baugh dates Old English from 450 to 1150, a period of full inflections, a [[synthetic language]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Perhaps around 85% of Old English words are no longer in use, but those that survived are basic elements of [[Modern English]] vocabulary.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOld English is a [[West Germanic language]], developing out of [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] (also known as North Sea Germanic) dialects from the 5th century. It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the [[heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] which became the [[Kingdom of England]]. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern [[Scotland]], which for several centuries belonged to the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Other parts of the island \u2013 [[Wales]] and most of [[Scotland]] \u2013 continued to use [[Celtic languages]], except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements where [[Old Norse]] was spoken. Celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of England: [[Cornish language#Middle Cornish|Medieval Cornish]] was spoken all over [[Cornwall]] and in adjacent parts of [[Devon]], while [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of [[Cumbria]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] may have been spoken on the English side of the [[England\u2013Wales border|Anglo-Welsh border]]. Norse was also widely spoken in the parts of England which fell under [[Danelaw|Danish law]].\n\nAnglo-Saxon literacy developed after [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianisation]] in the late 7th century. The oldest surviving work of [[Old English literature]] is ''[[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]]'', which was composed between 658 and 680 but not written down until the early 8th century.<ref name=\":2\" /> There is a limited corpus of [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic inscriptions]] from the 5th to 7th centuries, but the oldest coherent runic texts (notably the inscriptions on the [[Franks Casket]]) date to the early 8th century. The [[Old English Latin alphabet]] was introduced around the 8th century.\n\n[[File:Statue d'Alfred le Grand \u00e0 Winchester.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.86|[[Alfred the Great]] statue in [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]].

Alfred [[Alfred the Great#Advocacy of education in the English language|advocated education in English]] alongside Latin, and had many works translated into the English language; some of them, such as [[Pope Gregory I]]'s treatise ''[[Pastoral Care]]'', appear to have been translated by Alfred himself. In Old English, typical of the development of literature, poetry arose before prose, but Alfred chiefly inspired the growth of prose.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA later literary standard, dating from the late 10th century, arose under the influence of Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold of Winchester]], and was followed by such writers as the prolific [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham]] (\"the Grammarian\"). This form of the language is known as the \"[[Winchester]] standard\", or more commonly as Late West Saxon. It is considered to represent the \"classical\" form of Old English.<ref>Hogg (1992), p. 83.</ref> It retained its position of prestige until the time of the Norman Conquest, after which English ceased for a time to be of importance as a literary language.\n\nThe history of Old English can be subdivided into:\n*Prehistoric Old English (c. 450 to 650); for this period, Old English is mostly a [[reconstructed language]] as no literary witnesses survive (with the exception of limited [[Anglo-Saxon runes|epigraphic evidence]]). This language, or closely related group of dialects, spoken by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, and pre-dating documented Old English or Anglo-Saxon, has also been called Primitive Old English.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stumpf |first=John |title=An Outline of English Literature; Anglo-Saxon and Middle English Literature |year=1970 |publisher=Forum House Publishing Company |place=London |page=7 |quote=We do not know what languages the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons spoke, nor even whether they were sufficiently similar to make them mutually intelligible, but it is reasonable to assume that by the end of the sixth century there must have been a language that could be understood by all and this we call Primitive Old English.}}</ref> \n*Early Old English (c. 650 to 900), the period of the oldest manuscript traditions, with authors such as [[C\u00e6dmon]], [[Bede]], [[Cynewulf]] and [[Aldhelm]].\n*Late Old English (c. 900 to 1170), the final stage of the language leading up to the Norman conquest of England and the subsequent transition to [[Early Middle English]].\n\nThe Old English period is followed by [[Middle English]] (12th to 15th century), [[Early Modern English]] (c. 1480 to 1650) and finally [[Modern English]] (after 1650).\n\n==Dialects==\n[[File:Her swutela\u00f0 seo gecwydr\u00e6dnes \u00f0e.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ang|Her s\u01bfutela\u00f0 seo gec\u01bfydr\u00e6dnes \u00f0e}} ('Here is manifested the Word to thee').

In terms of geography the Northumbrian region lay north of the Humber River; the Mercian lay north of the Thames and South of the Humber River; West Saxon lay south and southwest of the Thames; and the smallest, Kentish region lay southeast of the Thames, a small corner of England. The Kentish region, settled by the Jutes from Jutland, has the scantiest literary remains.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nEach of these four dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, Northumbria south of the [[River Tyne|Tyne]], and most of [[Mercia]], were [[Viking invasion of Britain|overrun by the Vikings]] during the 9th century. The portion of Mercia that was successfully defended, and all of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], were then integrated into Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]].\nFrom that time on, the West Saxon dialect (then in the form now known as Early West Saxon) became standardised as the language of government, and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from Latin in that period.\n\nThe later literary standard known as Late West Saxon (see [[#History|History]], above), although centred in the same region of the country, appears not to have been directly descended from Alfred's Early West Saxon. For example, the former [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/iy/}} tended to become monophthongised to {{IPA|/i/}} in EWS, but to {{IPA|/y/}} in LWS.<ref>Hogg (1992), p. 117; but for a different interpretation of this, see [[Old English phonology#Diphthongs|Old English diphthongs]].</ref>\n\nDue to the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is relatively little written record of the non-Wessex dialects after Alfred's unification. Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars.<ref>Magennis (2011), pp. 56\u201360.</ref> Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while [[Scots language|Scots]] developed from the Northumbrian dialect. It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the [[West Country dialects#History and origins|dialect of Somerset]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/somersetshiredi00bayngoog The Somersetshire dialect: its pronunciation, 2 papers (1861)] Thomas Spencer Baynes, first published 1855 & 1856</ref>\n\nFor details of the sound differences between the dialects, see [[Phonological history of Old English#Dialects|Phonological history of Old English (dialects)]].\n\n==Influence of other languages==\n{{further|Celtic influence in English|Latin influence in English|Scandinavian influence in English}}\nThe language of the Anglo-Saxon settlers appears not to have been significantly affected by the native [[British Celtic languages]] which it [[Celtic language-death in England|largely displaced]]. The number of Celtic [[loanwords]] introduced into the language is very small, although dialect and toponymic terms are more often retained in western language contact zones (Cumbria, Devon, Welsh Marches and Borders and so on) than in the east. However, various suggestions have been made concerning possible influence that Celtic may have had on developments in English [[syntax]] in the post-Old English period, such as the regular [[progressive aspect|progressive]] construction and [[Analytic language|analytic word order]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |title=Rotary-munich.de |format=PDF |accessdate=20 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327012738/http://www.rotary-munich.de/2005-2006/theo-vennemann.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009  }}</ref> as well as the eventual development of the periphrastic auxiliary verb \"do\". These ideas have generally not received widespread support from linguists, particularly as the aforementioned features do not become widespread until the late Middle English and Early Modern English periods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zarranz|first=Jaione Inda|title=The Progress of the English Progressive|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/84679048.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Koch|first=Anthony S.|title=Function and Grammar in the History of English: Periphrastic Do|url=https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kroch/papers/function-grammar-do.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOld English contained a certain number of loanwords from [[Latin]], which was the scholarly and diplomatic ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Western Europe. It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral [[Angles]] and [[Saxon people|Saxons]] left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were [[Christianization of England|converted to Christianity]] and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the [[Latin alphabet]] was introduced and adapted for the [[#Orthography|writing of Old English]], replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly [[Old French]]) words into English occurred after the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and thus in the [[Middle English]] rather than the Old English period.\n\nAnother source of loanwords was [[Old Norse]], which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the [[Danelaw]] from the late 9th century, and during the rule of [[Cnut]] and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many [[toponym|place-names]] in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the [[West Saxon dialect]], away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in [[Middle English]] texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Language|last = Baugh|first = Albert|publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul|year = 1951|isbn = |location = London|pages = 60\u201383; 110\u2013130 (Scandinavian influence).}}</ref><ref name=\"Shay2008\">{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Shay |title=The history of English: a linguistic introduction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1vj0-f_U1SQC&pg=PA86 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |date=30 January 2008 |publisher=Wardja Press |isbn=978-0-615-16817-3 |page=86}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Growth and Structure of the English Language|last = Jespersen|first = Otto|publisher = B.

For sound changes before and after the Old English period, see [[Phonological history of English]].\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Old English grammar}}\n\n===Morphology===\n[[Noun]]s [[declension|decline]] for five [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]]; three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; and two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular, and plural; and are strong or weak. The instrumental is vestigial and only used with the masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the [[dative case|dative]]. Only [[pronoun]]s and strong adjectives retain separate [[instrumental case|instrumental]] forms. There is also sparse early Northumbrian evidence of a sixth case: the [[locative case|locative]]. The evidence comes from Northumbrian [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] texts  (e.g., {{script|Runr|\u16a9\u16be \u16b1\u16a9\u16de\u16c1}} ''on rodi'' \"on the Cross\").<ref>{{cite book |title=An Introduction to English Runes|last=Boydell|date=1999|page=230}}</ref>\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, number, and strong, or weak forms. [[Pronoun]]s and sometimes [[participle]]s agree in case, gender, and number. First-person and second-[[grammatical person|person]] [[personal pronoun]]s occasionally distinguish [[dual (grammatical number)|dual-number]] forms. The [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] {{lang|ang|s\u0113}} and its [[inflection]]s serve as a [[article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] (\"the\"), a [[demonstrative adjective]] (\"that\"), and [[Pronoun#Demonstrative|demonstrative pronoun]]. Other [[demonstrative]]s are {{lang|ang|\u00fees}} (\"this\"), and {{lang|ang|\u0121eon}} (\"yon\"). These words [[inflection|inflect]] for case, gender, number. Adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings, weak ones being used when a definite or possessive [[determiner]] is also present.\n\nVerbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, and third; two numbers: singular, plural; two [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: present, and past; three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[grammatical mood#indicative|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[imperative mood|imperative]];<ref name=\"Continuum\">{{cite web|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of British Literature|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/britlit/old_english|publisher=Continuum}}</ref> and are strong (exhibiting ablaut) or weak (exhibiting a dental suffix). Verbs have two [[infinitive]] forms: bare, and bound; and two [[participle]]s: present, and past. The subjunctive has past and present forms. Finite verbs agree with [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in person, and number. The [[future tense]], [[passive voice]], and other [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] are formed with compounds.\n[[Preposition and postposition|Adpositions]] are mostly before but often after their object. If the [[object (grammar)|object]] of an adposition is marked in the dative case, an adposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.\n\nRemnants of the Old English case system in Modern English are in the [[English personal pronouns|forms of a few pronouns]] (such as ''I/me/mine'', ''she/her'', [[Who (pronoun)|''who/whom/whose'']]) and in the [[English possessive|possessive]] ending ''-'s'', which derives from the masculine and neuter genitive ending ''-es''. The modern [[English plural]] ending ''-(e)s'' derives from the Old English ''-as'', but the latter applied only to \"strong\" masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases; different plural endings were used in other instances. Old English nouns had [[grammatical gender]], while modern English has only natural gender. Pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender when those conflicted, as in the case of {{lang|ang|\u01bf\u012bf}}, a neuter noun referring to a female person.\n\nIn Old English's verbal compound constructions are the beginnings of the [[Uses of English verb forms|compound tenses of Modern English]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Bruce |last2=Robinson |first2=Fred C |year=2002 |title=A Guide to Old English |place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |pages=109\u2013112}}</ref> Old English verbs include [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]], which form the past tense by altering the root vowel, and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]], which use a suffix such as {{lang|ang|-de}}.<ref name=\"Continuum\"/> As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular). Like today, Old English had fewer strong verbs, and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms. Then, as now, dental suffixes indicated the past tense of the weak verbs, as in ''work'' and ''worked''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Syntax===\nOld English [[syntax]] is similar to [[English grammar|that of modern English]]. Some differences are consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection, allowing freer [[word order]].\n*Default word order is [[verb-second]] in [[independent clause|main clauses]], and verb-final in [[subordinate clause]]s, being more like modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (and to a slightly lesser extent{{efn|Both German, Old English and Dutch use the same V2 word order in main clauses, but Old English (generally) and modern Dutch also use the same structure in subordinate clauses.}} the structure of  [[German language|German]]) than modern English.<ref>\u00d8ystein Heggelund (2007) Old English subordinate clauses and the shift to verb-medial order in English, English Studies, 88:3, 351-361</ref>\n*No [[do-support|''do''-support]] in questions and negatives. Questions were usually formed by [[inversion (linguistics)|inverting]] [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[finite verb]], and negatives by placing ''ne'' before the finite verb, regardless what verb. \n*Multiple negatives can stack up in a sentence intensifying each other ([[negative concord]]).\n*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type \"when X, Y\" (e.g. \"When I got home, I ate dinner\") don't use a ''wh-''type conjunction, but rather a ''th-''type [[correlative conjunction]] such as {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0101}}, otherwise meaning \"then\" (e.g. {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u0101 X, \u00fe\u0101 Y}} in place of \"when X, Y\"). The ''wh-''words are used only as [[interrogative]]s and as [[indefinite pronouns]].\n*Similarly, ''wh-'' forms were not used as [[relative pronoun]]s. Instead, the indeclinable word {{lang|ang|\u00fee}} is used, often preceded by (or replaced by) the appropriate form of the article/demonstrative {{lang|ang|se}}.\n\n==Orthography==\n{{Anchor|alphabet}}\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon runes|Old English Latin alphabet}}\n[[File:Anglosaxonrunes.svg|upright=1.13|thumb|The [[runic alphabet]] used to write Old English before the introduction of the [[Latin alphabet]]]]\n\nOld English was first written in [[runic alphabet|runes]], using the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]] \u2013 a rune set derived from the Germanic 24-character [[elder futhark]], extended by five more runes used to represent Anglo-Saxon vowel sounds, and sometimes by several more additional characters. From around the 8th century, the runic system came to be supplanted by a (minuscule) [[half-uncial]] script of the [[Latin alphabet]] introduced by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish Christian]] missionaries.<ref name=\"Cambridge\">{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |year=1987 |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencycl000crys |url-access=registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-26438-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeencycl000crys/page/203 203]}}</ref> This was replaced by [[Insular script]], a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script. This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental [[Carolingian minuscule]] (also known as ''Caroline'') replaced the insular.\n\nThe Latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters {{angbr|j}} and {{angbr|w}}, and there was no {{angbr|v}} as distinct from {{angbr|u}}; moreover native Old English spellings did not use {{angbr|k}}, {{angbr|q}} or {{angbr|z}}. The remaining 20 Latin letters were supplemented by four more: {{angbr|[[\u00e6]]}} ({{lang|ang|\u00e6sc}}, modern ''ash'') and {{angbr|{{lang|ang|\u00f0}}}} ({{lang|ang|\u00f0\u00e6t}}, now called [[eth (letter)|eth]] or edh), which were modified Latin letters, and [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u00fe}}}} and [[wynn]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}}, which are borrowings from the futhorc. A few letter pairs were used as [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s, representing a single sound. Also used was the [[Tironian note]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u204a}}}} (a character similar to the digit 7) for the [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''and''. A common [[scribal abbreviation]] was a [[thorn with stroke|thorn with a stroke]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\ua765}}}}, which was used for the pronoun {{lang|ang|\u00fe\u00e6t}}. [[Macron (diacritic)|Macron]]s over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels (as in modern editions), but to indicate stress, or as abbreviations for a following ''m'' or ''n''.<ref>C.M. Millward, Mary Hayes, ''A Biography of the English Language'', Cengage Learning 2011, p. 96.</ref><ref>Stephen Pollington, ''First Steps in Old English'', Anglo-Saxon Books 1997, p. 138.</ref>\n\nModern editions of Old English manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions. The modern forms of Latin letters are used, including {{angbr|g}} in place of the [[insular G]], {{angle bracket|s}} for [[long S]], and others which may differ considerably from the insular script, notably {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|r}}. Macrons are used to indicate long vowels, where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals. (In some older editions an [[acute accent]] mark was used for consistency with Old Norse conventions.) Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|c}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|g}}}} by placing dots above the palatals: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u010b}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u0121}}}}. The letter wynn {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|\u01bf}}}} is usually replaced with {{angle bracket|{{lang|ang|w}}}}, but {{lang|ang|\u00e6sc}}, eth and thorn are normally retained (except when eth is replaced by thorn).\n\nIn contrast with [[English orthography|Modern English orthography]], that of Old English was reasonably [[regular spelling|regular]], with a mostly predictable correspondence between letters and [[phoneme]]s. There were not usually any [[silent letter]]s\u2014in the word ''cniht'', for example, both the {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|h}} were pronounced, unlike the {{angbr|k}} and {{angbr|gh}} in the modern ''knight''.

R.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1957|location=Oxford}}</ref>  The pagan and Christian streams mingle in Old English, one of the richest and most significant bodies of literature preserved among the early Germanic peoples.<ref name=\":2\" /> In his supplementary article to the 1935 posthumous edition of Bright's ''Anglo-Saxon Reader'', Dr. James Hulbert writes:\n\n{{quote|In such historical conditions, an incalculable amount of the writings of the Anglo-Saxon period perished. What they contained, how important they were for an understanding of literature before the Conquest, we have no means of knowing: the scant catalogues of monastic libraries do not help us, and there are no references in extant works to other compositions....How incomplete our materials are can be illustrated by the well-known fact that, with few and relatively unimportant exceptions, all extant Anglo-Saxon poetry is preserved in four manuscripts.}}\n\nSome of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are ''[[Beowulf]]'', an [[epic poem]]; the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a record of early English history; the [[Franks Casket]], an inscribed early whalebone artefact; and [[C\u00e6dmon's Hymn]], a Christian religious poem. There are also a number of extant prose works, such as sermons and saints' lives, biblical translations, and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, legal documents, such as laws and wills, and practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography. Still, poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous, with a few exceptions, such as [[Bede]] and [[C\u00e6dmon]]. C\u00e6dmon, the earliest English poet we know by name, served as a lay brother in the monastery at Whitby.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===''Beowulf''===\nThe first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic ''[[Beowulf]]'', a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of Old English.<ref name=\":2\" /> This passage describes how [[Hrothgar]]'s legendary ancestor [[Scyld]] was found as a baby, washed ashore, and adopted by a noble family. The translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order. As such, it is not typical of Old English prose. The modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem.\n\nThe words in brackets are implied in the Old English by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context. Notice how ''what'' is used by the poet where a word like ''lo'' or ''behold'' would be expected. This usage is similar to ''what-ho!'', both an expression of surprise and a call to attention.\n\nEnglish poetry is based on stress and alliteration. In alliteration, the first consonant in a word alliterates with the same consonant at the beginning of another word, as with {{lang|ang|'''G'''\u0101r-Dena}} and {{lang|ang|'''\u0121'''e\u0101r-dagum}}. Vowels alliterate with any other vowel, as with {{lang|ang|'''\u00e6'''\u00feelingas}} and {{lang|ang|'''e'''llen}}.

At first these were often [[marginalia|marginal]] or [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] glosses, but soon came to be gathered into word-lists such as the [[\u00c9pinal-Erfurt glossary|\u00c9pinal-Erfurt]], [[Leiden Glossary|Leiden]] and [[Corpus Glossary|Corpus]] Glossaries. Over time, these word-lists were consolidated and alphabeticised to create extensive Latin-Old English glossaries with some of the character of [[dictionary|dictionaries]], such as the [[Cleopatra Glossaries]], the [[Harley Glossary]] and the [[Brussels Glossary]].<ref>Patrizia Lendinara, \u2018Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries: An Introduction\u2019, in Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries (Aldershot: Variorum, 1999), pp. 1\u201326.</ref> In some cases, the material in these glossaries continued to be circulated and updated in [[Middle English]] glossaries, such as the [[Durham Plant-Name Glossary]] and the [[Laud Herbal Glossary]].<ref>''Das Durhamer Pflanzenglossar: lateinisch und altenglish'', ed. by Bogislav von Lindheim, Beitr\u00e4ge zur englischen Philologie, 35 (Bochum-Langendreer: Poppinghaus, 1941).</ref>\n\nOld English lexicography was revived in the early modern period, drawing heavily on Anglo-Saxons' own glossaries. The major publication at this time was [[William Somner]]'s ''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum''.<ref>William Somner, ''Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum'', English Linguistics 1500\u20131800 (A Collection of Facsimile Reprints), 247 (Menston: The Scholar Press, 1970).</ref> The next substantial Old English dictionary was [[Joseph Bosworth]]'s ''Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' of 1838.\n\n===Modern===\nIn modern scholarship, the following dictionaries remain current:\n\n* [[Angus Cameron (academic)|Cameron, Angus]], et al. (ed.) (1983-). ''[[Dictionary of Old English]]''. Toronto: Published for the Dictionary of Old English Project, Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Toronto by the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies. Initially issued on microfiche and subsequently as a CD-ROM, the dictionary is now primarily published online at [https://www.doe.utoronto.ca https://www.doe.utoronto.ca].

Various digitisations are available open-access, including at [http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/ http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/]. Due to errors and omissions in the 1898 publication, this needs to be read in conjunction with:\n** T. Northcote Toller. (1921). ''An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary: Supplement''.

There is also an [[:ang:H\u0113afodtramet|Old English version of Wikipedia]].

Non-player characters might be allies, bystanders or competitors to the PCs. NPCs can also be traders that trade currency for things such as equipment or gear. NPCs thus vary in their level of detail. Some may be only a brief description (\"You see a man in a corner of the tavern\"), while others may have complete game [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] and [[backstory|backstories]] of their own.\n\nThere is some debate about how much work a [[gamemaster]] should put into an important NPC's statistics; some players prefer to have every NPC completely defined with stats, skills, and gear, while others define only what is immediately necessary and fill in the rest as the game proceeds. There is also some discussion as to just how important fully defined NPCs are in any given RPG, but it is general consensus that the more \"real\" the NPCs feel, the more fun players will have interacting with them in character.\n\n===Playability===\nIn some games and in some circumstances, a player who is without a [[player character]] of their own can temporarily take control of an NPC. Reasons for this vary, but often arise from the player not maintaining a PC within the group and playing the NPC for a session or from the player's PC being unable to act for some time (for example, because they are injured or in another location). Although these characters are still designed and normally controlled by the gamemaster, when players are given the opportunity to temporarily control these non-player characters it gives them another perspective on the plot of the game. Some systems, such as ''[[Nobilis]]'', encourage this in their rules.\n\nIn less traditional RPGs, narrative control is less strictly separated between gamemaster and players. In this case, the line between PC and NPC can be vague.\n\n===Dependents===\nMany game systems have rules for characters sustaining positive allies in the form of NPC followers; hired hands, or other dependent stature to the PC. Characters may sometimes help in the design, recruitment, or development of NPCs.\n\nIn the ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' game (and related games using the [[Hero System]]), a character may have a DNPC, or \"dependent non-player character\". This is a character controlled by the GM, but for which the [[player character]] is responsible in some way, and who may be put in harm's way by the PC's choices.\n\n==Video games==\n{{see also|Video game bot|Mob (gaming)|Boss (video gaming)}}\nThe term ''non-player character'' is also used in [[video game]]s to describe entities not under the direct control of a player. The term carries a connotation that the character is not hostile towards players; hostile characters are referred to as enemies, [[Mob (computer gaming)|mobs]], or creeps. In video games, NPC is sometimes expanded as \"non-playable character\" or \"non-player class\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nNPC behavior in computer games is usually scripted and automatic, triggered by certain actions or dialogue with the player characters. In certain multi-player games (''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and ''[[Vampire: the Masquerade]]'' series, for example) a player that acts as the GM can \"possess\" both player and non-player characters, controlling their actions in order to further the storyline.  More complex games, such as the aforementioned ''Neverwinter Nights'', allow the player to customize the NPCs' behavior by modifying their default scripts or creating entirely new ones.\n\nIn some online games, such as [[MMORPG]]s, NPCs may be entirely unscripted, and are essentially regular character avatars controlled by employees of the game company. These \"non-players\" are often distinguished from player characters by avatar appearance or other visual designation, and often serve as in-game support for new players. In other cases, these \"live\" NPCs are virtual actors, playing regular characters which drive a continuing storyline (as in ''[[Myst Online: Uru Live]]'').\n\nIn early and less advanced RPGs, NPCs only had monologue. Code directs the appearance of a dialogue box, floating text, [[cutscene]], or other means of displaying the NPCs' speech or reaction to the player.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} NPC speeches of this kind are often designed to give an instant impression of the character of the speaker, providing character vignettes, but they may also advance the story or illuminate the world around the PC. Similar to this is the most common form of storytelling, non-branching dialogue, in which the means of displaying NPC speech are the same as above, but the [[player character]] or [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] responds to or initiates speech with NPCs. In addition to the purposes listed above, this enables development of the player character.\n\nMore advanced RPGs feature interactive dialogue, or [[Nonlinear gameplay|branching dialogue]] ([[Dialog tree|dialogue trees]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/27441/1/EDTree-Emotional%20Dialogue%20Trees%20for%20Game.pdf|format=PDF|title=EDTree: Emotional Dialogue Trees for Game Based Training|author1=Jay Collins|author2=William Hisrt|author3=Wen Tang|author4=Colin Luu|author5=Peter Smith|author6=Andrew Watson|author7=Reza Sahandi|website=Spirits.bournemouth.ac.uk|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> A good example are the games produced by [[Black Isle Studios]] and [[White Wolf, Inc.]]; every one of their games is multiple-choice roleplaying. When talking to an NPC, the player is presented with a list of dialogue options, and may choose between them. Each choice may result in a different response from the NPC. These choices may affect the course of the game, as well as the conversation. At the least, they provide a reference point to the player of his or her relationship with the game world.\n\n''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' is an example of a game series that has advanced from non-branching (''[[Ultima III]]'' and earlier) to branching dialogue (from ''[[Ultima IV]]'' and on). Other role-playing games with branching dialogues include ''[[Cosmic Soldier (MSX)|Cosmic Soldier]]'', ''[[Megami Tensei]]'', ''[[Fire Emblem]]'', ''[[Metal Max (series)|Metal Max]]'', ''[[Langrisser]]'', ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'', ''[[Template:Ogre Battle series|Ogre Battle]]'', ''[[Chrono (series)|Chrono]]'', ''[[Star Ocean]]'', ''[[Sakura Wars]]'', ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'', ''[[Dragon Age]]'', ''[[Radiant Historia]]'', and several ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games.\n\nCertain [[video game genres]] revolve almost entirely around interactions with non-player characters, including [[visual novel]]s such as ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' and [[dating sim]]s such as ''[[Tokimeki Memorial]]'', usually featuring complex branching dialogues and often presenting the player's possible responses word-for-word as the player character would say them. Games revolving around relationship-building, including visual novels, dating sims such as ''Tokimeki Memorial'', and some role-playing games such as ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona]]'', often give choices that have a different number of associated \"mood points\" which influence a player character's relationship and future conversations with a non-player character.
