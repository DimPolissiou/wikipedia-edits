The young man and his father both seem particularly motivated by the [[dowry]] of the young fianc\u00e9e.\n\nBut S\u00e9raphin has a rival in Albert Delpierre, a young Frenchman who is learning brewery from Ferdinand Beulemans and who is discreetly enamoured with the young woman. Albert learns S\u00e9raphin's secret that he is having an affair with a worker and that they have had a child. He promises S\u00e9raphin that he will never reveal any of it to Suzanne, but she is told by Isabelle, her maid.\n\nSuzanne breaks off the engagement with S\u00e9raphin and convinces him to return to the woman he loves and his son. This rupture leads to another between the two brewers who are both in contention for honorary presidency of the brewers society. In the final act, Suzanne and Albert strive to promote the election of Beulemans which instills him with a deep gratitude toward Albert.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Lucienne Roger, Berry et Jacque dans \"Le mariage de Mlle Beulemans\".jpg|thumb|left|Lucienne Roger, Jules Berry and Jacque at Paris' [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance]] in 1910]]\nOriginal cast members throughout the first Belgian and French runs featured:<ref name=figaro19100524/>\n\n* Lucienne Roger as Suzanne Beulemans, ''the only Beulemans daughter''\n* Jacque as Ferdinand Beulemans, ''Brussels brewer, Suzanne's father''\n* Vara as Hortense Beulemans, ''Suzanne's mother''\n* Jules Berry as Albert Delpierre, ''young Frenchman employed by Beulemans''\n* Fr\u00e9mont as Monsieur Delpierre, ''French shopkeeper, Albert's father and acquaintance of Beulemans''\n* Merin as S\u00e9raphin Meulemeester, ''Suzanne's fianc\u00e9''\n* Ambreville as Monsieur Meulemeester, ''S\u00e9raphin's father''\n* Vitry as Isabelle, ''Maid''\n* Mylo as Mostinckx, ''committee president''\n* Marmont as Verduren, ''committee secretary''\n* Daix as Baron, ''committee treasurer''\n* Duro, Delferri\u00e8re, Nobel, Lennac, Cerr\u00e9bos as ''committee members''\n* Cilly as Octavie, ''waitress''\n\nThe production crew included Frantz Fonson as [[stage director]] and [[Albert Dubosq]] as [[scenographer]].\n\n== About the play ==\nIn a message dedicated to the people of Brussels in 1960 for the 50th anniversary of ''Le Mariage de mademoiselle Beulemans,'' [[Marcel Pagnol]] himself recounted the origin of his ''Trilogie Marseillaise:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delsemme |first1=Paul |dictionary=Biographie nationale |year=1983 |title=FONSON |volume=LXIII |url=http://www.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/FichierPDFBiographieNationaleTome2101.pdf |format=PDF |pages=402\u2013420 |language=French |location=Brussels, B |publisher=[[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium|Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Thys |first1=Marianne |year=1999 |title=Belgian cinema |language=en, fr, nl |location=Brussels , B |publisher=[[Cinematek|Royal Belgian Film Archive]] |isbn=9789055442348 |page=[https://archive.org/details/brugesrenaissanc0000unse/page/992 992] |quote=And since Marcel Pagnol declared that without Beulemans he would neither have written Marius nor produced so many masterpieces, why should we throw a spanner in the works? |url=https://archive.org/details/brugesrenaissanc0000unse/page/992 }}</ref>''\n\n{{Cquote|text=<blockquote>Around 1925, because I felt exiled in Paris I realised that I loved [[Marseille]]s and I wanted to express this love by writing a Marseilles play. My friends and my family dissuaded me from it: they told me that a play so localised, that put on show characters with such a particular accent, would certainly not be understood outside of [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], and that in Marseilles itself it would be considered an amateur work. These arguments seemed sound and I gave up on my project. But in 1926 I saw ''Le Mariage de mademoiselle Beulemans''; this masterpiece was already 16 years old and its success had gone around the world.</blockquote><blockquote>That night, I realised that a local, but profoundly sincere and authentic play could sometimes have a place in the literary heritage of a country and appeal to the whole world. So I tried to do for Marseilles what Fonson and Wicheler had done for Brussels, and that's how a Belgian brewer became the father of C\u00e9sar and how the charming mademoiselle Beulemans, at 17 years old, brought Marius into the world. There is also another character who owes his life to the Brussels comedy: it is monsieur Brun who is, ironically, the illegitimate son of the Parisian Albert Delpierre. I had noticed that his accent made a pleasant contrast to that of the Beulemans family and highlighted the Brussels flavour of the play. That's why, in C\u00e9sar's Marseilles bar, I placed a man from Lyon.</blockquote>|author=Marcel Pagnol}}\n\nFrantz Fonson and Ferdinand Wicheler gave an extension to the play in the form of an [[operetta]]: ''Beulemans marie sa fille.''{{refn|group=note|''Beulemans marries his daughter''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=Frank Wadleigh |year=1931 |title=Modern continental playwrights |url=https://archive.org/details/moderncontinenta0000chan |url-access=registration |entry=FONSON, FRANZ (JEAN FRAN\u00c7OIS) |location=New York (NY), USA |publisher=Harper & Brothers |oclc=574650455 |series=Plays and playwrights series |archive-date= |page=619 |quote=Beulemans Marries His Daughter, an operetta, 1913}}</ref>}} The music was composed by Arthur van Oost.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1914 |title=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical compositions |journal=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical Compositions, Part 3 |volume=8 |series=New series |issue=13 |page=2009 |publisher=Library of Congress.

The young man and his father both seem particularly motivated by the [[dowry]] of the young fianc\u00e9e.\n\nBut S\u00e9raphin has a rival in Albert Delpierre, a young Frenchman who is learning brewery from Ferdinand Beulemans and who is discreetly enamoured with the young woman. Albert learns S\u00e9raphin's secret that he is having an affair with a worker and that they have had a child. He promises S\u00e9raphin that he will never reveal any of it to Suzanne, but she is told by Isabelle, her maid.\n\nSuzanne breaks off the engagement with S\u00e9raphin and convinces him to return to the woman he loves and his son. This rupture leads to another between the two brewers who are both in contention for honorary presidency of the brewers society. In the final act, Suzanne and Albert strive to promote the election of Beulemans which instills him with a deep gratitude toward Albert.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Lucienne Roger, Berry et Jacque dans \"Le mariage de Mlle Beulemans\".jpg|thumb|left|Lucienne Roger, Jules Berry and Jacque at Paris' [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance]] in 1910]]\nOriginal cast members throughout the first Belgian and French runs featured:<ref name=figaro19100524/>\n\n* Lucienne Roger as Suzanne Beulemans, ''the only Beulemans daughter''\n* Jacque as Ferdinand Beulemans, ''Brussels brewer, Suzanne's father''\n* Vara as Hortense Beulemans, ''Suzanne's mother''\n* Jules Berry as Albert Delpierre, ''young Frenchman employed by Beulemans''\n* Fr\u00e9mont as Monsieur Delpierre, ''French shopkeeper, Albert's father and acquaintance of Beulemans''\n* Merin as S\u00e9raphin Meulemeester, ''Suzanne's fianc\u00e9''\n* Ambreville as Monsieur Meulemeester, ''S\u00e9raphin's father''\n* Vitry as Isabelle, ''Maid''\n* Mylo as Mostinckx, ''committee president''\n* Marmont as Verduren, ''committee secretary''\n* Daix as Baron, ''committee treasurer''\n* Duro, Delferri\u00e8re, Nobel, Lennac, Cerr\u00e9bos as ''committee members''\n* Cilly as Octavie, ''waitress''\n\nThe production crew included Frantz Fonson as [[stage director]] and [[Albert Dubosq]] as [[scenographer]].\n\n== About the play ==\nIn a message dedicated to the people of Brussels in 1960 for the 50th anniversary of ''Le Mariage de mademoiselle Beulemans,'' [[Marcel Pagnol]] himself recounted the origin of his ''Trilogie Marseillaise:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delsemme |first1=Paul |dictionary=Biographie nationale |year=1983 |title=FONSON |volume=LXIII |url=http://www.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/FichierPDFBiographieNationaleTome2101.pdf |format=PDF |pages=402\u2013420 |language=French |location=Brussels, B |publisher=[[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium|Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Thys |first1=Marianne |year=1999 |title=Belgian cinema |language=en, fr, nl |location=Brussels , B |publisher=[[Cinematek|Royal Belgian Film Archive]] |isbn=9789055442348 |page=[https://archive.org/details/brugesrenaissanc0000unse/page/992 992] |quote=And since Marcel Pagnol declared that without Beulemans he would neither have written Marius nor produced so many masterpieces, why should we throw a spanner in the works? |url=https://archive.org/details/brugesrenaissanc0000unse/page/992 }}</ref>''\n\n{{Cquote|text=<blockquote>Around 1925, because I felt exiled in Paris I realised that I loved [[Marseille]]s and I wanted to express this love by writing a Marseilles play.

These arguments seemed sound and I gave up on my project. But in 1926 I saw ''Le Mariage de mademoiselle Beulemans''; this masterpiece was already 16 years old and its success had gone around the world.</blockquote><blockquote>That night, I realised that a local, but profoundly sincere and authentic play could sometimes have a place in the literary heritage of a country and appeal to the whole world. So I tried to do for Marseilles what Fonson and Wicheler had done for Brussels, and that's how a Belgian brewer became the father of C\u00e9sar and how the charming mademoiselle Beulemans, at 17 years old, brought Marius into the world. There is also another character who owes his life to the Brussels comedy: it is monsieur Brun who is, ironically, the illegitimate son of the Parisian Albert Delpierre. I had noticed that his accent made a pleasant contrast to that of the Beulemans family and highlighted the Brussels flavour of the play. That's why, in C\u00e9sar's Marseilles bar, I placed a man from Lyon.</blockquote>|author=Marcel Pagnol}}\n\nFrantz Fonson and Ferdinand Wicheler gave an extension to the play in the form of an [[operetta]]: ''Beulemans marie sa fille.''{{refn|group=note|''Beulemans marries his daughter''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=Frank Wadleigh |year=1931 |title=Modern continental playwrights |url=https://archive.org/details/moderncontinenta0000chan |url-access=registration |entry=FONSON, FRANZ (JEAN FRAN\u00c7OIS) |location=New York (NY), USA |publisher=Harper & Brothers |oclc=574650455 |series=Plays and playwrights series |archive-date= |page=619 |quote=Beulemans Marries His Daughter, an operetta, 1913}}</ref>}} The music was composed by Arthur van Oost.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1914 |title=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical compositions |journal=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical Compositions, Part 3 |volume=8 |series=New series |issue=13 |page=2009 |publisher=Library of Congress.

The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, including a large group of [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had played a major role in defeating the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} Under their first leader [[Alaric I]] they invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. Afterwards, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans, a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. \n\nDuring their governance of [[Hispania]], the Visigoths [[Visigothic art and architecture|built several churches]] that survive. They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==\nThe Visigoths are never called Visigoths, only Goths, until [[Cassiodorus]] used the term, when referring to their loss against [[Clovis I]] in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the \"[[Ostrogoths]]\", but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the 5th century poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used when referring to the Visigoths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word \"east\", and Jordanes later clearly stated in his ''Getica'' that \"Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=74 [XIV.82]}} According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east-west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Cassiodorus himself used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. In contrast, the term \"Visigoths\" was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nTwo older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the 3rd century, notably including the [[Thervingi]], who were once referred to as Goths by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}} Much less is known of the \"Vesi\" or \"Visi\", from whom the name \"Visigoths\" derives. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a late 4th or early 5th century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the \"[[Thervingi]]\" in a classical source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nAlthough he did not refer to the Tervingi or Greuthungi, the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"[[Greuthungi]]\" were used to refer to another.{{sfn|Heather|1999|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nWolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}} [[Landolfus Sagax]], writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the ''Hypogothi''.{{sfn|Friedrich|1910|p=14}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\", with the first part of the name related to Gothic ''triu'', and English \"tree\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\". Jordanes relates the tribe's name to a river, though this is most likely a [[folk etymology]] or legend like his similar story about the Greuthung name.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visigoth migrations.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Migrations of the main column of the Visigoths]]\n\n===Early origins===\nThe Visigoths emerged from the Gothic tribes, most likely a derivative name for the [[Gutones]], a people believed to have their origins in [[Scandinavia]] and who migrated southeastwards into eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=39\u201340}} Such understanding of their origins is largely the result of Gothic traditions and their true genesis as a people is as obscure as that of the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=149}} The Visigoths spoke an eastern Germanic language that was distinct by the 4th century. Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered and the Emperor [[Valens]] was killed during the fighting.{{sfn|Sarris|2002|p=36}} Precisely how Valens fell remains uncertain but Gothic legend tells of how the emperor was taken to a farmhouse, which was set on fire above his head, a tale made more popular by its symbolic representation of a heretical emperor receiving hell's torment.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=178\u2013179}} Many of Rome's leading officers and some of their most elite fighting men died during the battle which struck a major blow to Roman prestige and the Empire's military capabilities.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=179}} Adrianople shocked the Roman world and eventually forced the Romans to negotiate with and settle the tribe within the empire's boundaries, a development with far-reaching consequences for the eventual [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}}\n\nOver the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=183\u2013223}} Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton. He was succeeded by his wife's brother.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n===Visigothic Kingdom===\n{{Main|Visigothic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD]]\n\nThe Visigothic Kingdom was a Western European power in the 5th to 7th centuries, created in Gaul when the Romans lost their control of the western half of their empire. For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

It goes into more detail than a modern constitution commonly does and reveals a great deal about Visigothic social structure.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=6\u20138}}\n\nOne of the greatest contributions of the Visigoths to [[family law]] was their protection of the property rights of married women, which was continued by [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]] and ultimately evolved into the [[community property]] system now in force throughout the majority of western Europe.{{sfn|Coolidge|2011|pp=17\u201325}}\n\n===Religion===\nBefore the [[Middle Ages]], the Visigoths, as well as other Germanic peoples, followed what is now referred to as [[Germanic paganism]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=58, 66, 72\u201374}} While the Germanic peoples were slowly converted to [[Christianity]] by varying means, many elements of the pre-Christian culture and indigenous beliefs remained firmly in place after the conversion process, particularly in the more rural and distant regions.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=215\u2013225}}\n\nThe Visigoths, [[Ostrogoths]], and [[Vandals]] were [[Christianized]] while they were still outside the bounds of the [[Roman Empire]]; however, they converted to [[Arianism]] rather than to the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene version]] (Trinitarianism) followed by most Romans, who considered them [[Christian heresy|heretics]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=75\u201379}} There was a religious gulf between the Visigoths, who had for a long time adhered to Arianism, and their Catholic subjects in Hispania. There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

Cohen and D. Sorkin, ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 156.}}\n\nThe political aspects of the imposition of Church power cannot be ignored in these matters. With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]]. As far as the Visigoths were concerned, the time for religious pluralism \"was past\".{{sfn|Lim|1999|pp=209\u2013210}} By the end of the 7th century, Catholic conversion made the Visigoths less distinguishable from the indigenous Roman citizens of the Iberian peninsula; when the last Visigothic strongholds fell to the Muslim armies, whose subsequent invasions transformed Spain from the beginning of the 8th century, their Gothic identity faded.{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nIn the eighth through 11th centuries, the [[muladi|''muwallad'']] clan of the [[Banu Qasi]] claimed descent from the Visigothic [[Count Cassius]].{{sfn|Fletcher|2006|p=45}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n*[[Romano-Germanic culture]]\n*[[Germanic peoples]]\n*[[Arianism]]\n*[[Thiufa]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book| last=Arce |first=Javier| chapter=The City of Merida (Emerita) in the Vitas Patrum Emeritensium (Vith Century) | title=East and West, Modes of Communication: Proceedings of the First Plenary Conference at Merida  | editor1=Evangelos Chrysos | editor2=Ian Wood| volume=Vol. 5 [Transformation of the Roman World] | year = 1999| location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | isbn=978-9-00410-929-2|ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Burns | first=Thomas | year=2003 | title= Rome and the Barbarians, 100 B.C.\u2013A.D. 400 | place= Baltimore, MD | publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn= 978-0-80187-306-5 | ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bury | first=J.

The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, including a large group of [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had played a major role in defeating the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} Under their first leader [[Alaric I]] they invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. Afterwards, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans, a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. \n\nDuring their governance of [[Hispania]], the Visigoths [[Visigothic art and architecture|built several churches]] that survive. They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==\nThe Visigoths are never called Visigoths, only Goths, until [[Cassiodorus]] used the term, when referring to their loss against [[Clovis I]] in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the \"[[Ostrogoths]]\", but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the 5th century poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used when referring to the Visigoths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word \"east\", and Jordanes later clearly stated in his ''Getica'' that \"Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=74 [XIV.82]}} According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east-west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Cassiodorus himself used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. In contrast, the term \"Visigoths\" was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nTwo older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the 3rd century, notably including the [[Thervingi]], who were once referred to as Goths by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}} Much less is known of the \"Vesi\" or \"Visi\", from whom the name \"Visigoths\" derives. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a late 4th or early 5th century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the \"[[Thervingi]]\" in a classical source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nAlthough he did not refer to the Tervingi or Greuthungi, the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"[[Greuthungi]]\" were used to refer to another.{{sfn|Heather|1999|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nWolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}} [[Landolfus Sagax]], writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the ''Hypogothi''.{{sfn|Friedrich|1910|p=14}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\", with the first part of the name related to Gothic ''triu'', and English \"tree\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\". Jordanes relates the tribe's name to a river, though this is most likely a [[folk etymology]] or legend like his similar story about the Greuthung name.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visigoth migrations.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Migrations of the main column of the Visigoths]]\n\n===Early origins===\nThe Visigoths emerged from the Gothic tribes, most likely a derivative name for the [[Gutones]], a people believed to have their origins in [[Scandinavia]] and who migrated southeastwards into eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=39\u201340}} Such understanding of their origins is largely the result of Gothic traditions and their true genesis as a people is as obscure as that of the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=149}} The Visigoths spoke an eastern Germanic language that was distinct by the 4th century. Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered and the Emperor [[Valens]] was killed during the fighting.{{sfn|Sarris|2002|p=36}} Precisely how Valens fell remains uncertain but Gothic legend tells of how the emperor was taken to a farmhouse, which was set on fire above his head, a tale made more popular by its symbolic representation of a heretical emperor receiving hell's torment.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=178\u2013179}} Many of Rome's leading officers and some of their most elite fighting men died during the battle which struck a major blow to Roman prestige and the Empire's military capabilities.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=179}} Adrianople shocked the Roman world and eventually forced the Romans to negotiate with and settle the tribe within the empire's boundaries, a development with far-reaching consequences for the eventual [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}}\n\nOver the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=183\u2013223}} Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton. He was succeeded by his wife's brother.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n===Visigothic Kingdom===\n{{Main|Visigothic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD]]\n\nThe Visigothic Kingdom was a Western European power in the 5th to 7th centuries, created in Gaul when the Romans lost their control of the western half of their empire. For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

Theodoric's death in 526, however, enabled the Visigoths to restore their royal line and re-partition the Visigothic kingdom through Amalaric, who incidentally, was more than just Alaric II's son; he was also the grandson of Theodoric the Great through his daughter Theodegotho.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=93}} Amalaric reigned independently for five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=245}} Following Amalaric's assassination in 531, another Ostrogothic ruler, Theudis took his place.{{sfn|Carr|2004|p=421}} For the next seventeen years, Theudis held the Visigothic throne.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=94}}\n\nSometime in 549, the Visigoth [[Athanagild]] sought military assistance from Justinian I and while this aide helped Athanagild win his wars, the Romans had much more in mind.{{sfn|Carr|2004|p=421}} Granada and southernmost [[Baetica]] were lost to representatives of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (to form the province of [[Spania]]) who had been invited in to help settle this Visigothic dynastic struggle, but who stayed on, as a hoped-for spearhead to a \"Reconquest\" of the far west envisaged by emperor [[Justinian I]].{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=82\u201385}} Imperial Roman armies took advantage of Visigothic rivalries and established a government at C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|p=82}}\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|thumb|right|Visigothic Hispania and its regional divisions in 700, before the Muslim conquest]]\n\nThe last Arian Visigothic king, [[Liuvigild]], conquered most of the northern regions (Cantabria) in 574, the Suevic kingdom in 584, and regained part of the southern areas lost to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]],{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=51\u201353}} which King [[Suintila]] recovered in 624.{{sfn|Arce|1999|p=4}} The kingdom survived until 711, when King [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing an invasion from the south by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the [[Battle of Guadalete]].

There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

Cohen and D. Sorkin, ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 156.}}\n\nThe political aspects of the imposition of Church power cannot be ignored in these matters. With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]].

He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] at the age of 44 in 1957, the second-youngest recipient in history.\n\nCamus was [[pied-noir|born in Algeria]] to French [[Pied-Noir|Pieds Noirs]] parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighborhood \nand later studied philosophy at the [[University of Algiers]]. He was in Paris when the [[Battle of France|Germans invaded France]] during [[World War II]]. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the [[French Resistance]] where he served as editor-in-chief at ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active. He was part of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] that opposed the [[Soviet Union]] because of its [[totalitarianism]]. Camus was a [[Moralism|moralist]] and leaned towards [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. He was part of many organizations seeking European integration. During the [[Algerian War]], he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties.\n\nPhilosophically, Camus's views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. He is also considered to be an [[existentialist]], even though he firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years and education===\n\n[[File:Algiers The University (GRI).jpg|thumb|alt=A postcard showing the University of Algiers|A 20th-century postcard of the University of Algiers]]\nAlbert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighborhood in Mondovi (present-day [[Dr\u00e9an]]), in [[French Algeria]]. His mother, Catherine H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sint\u00e8s Camus, was of [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-([[Balearic Islands|Balearic]]) descent. His father, Lucien Camus, a poor French-Algerian agricultural worker, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during [[World War I]]. Camus never knew him. Camus, his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]]. He was a second-generation French immigrant to Algeria. His paternal grandfather, along with many others of his generation, had moved to Africa for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence, he was called {{lang-fr|[[pied-noir]]|label=none|lit='black foot'}}\u2014a slang term for French who were born in Algeria\u2014and his binational identity and his poor background had a substantial effect on his later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=7|3a1=Lottman|3y=1979|3p=11|4a1=Carroll|4y=2007|4pp=2\u20133}} Nevertheless, Camus was a French citizen, in contrast to the [[Arab]] or [[Berbers|Berber]] inhabitants of Algeria who were denied the associated privileges this brought.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=2\u20133}} During his childhood, Camus developed a love for football and swimming.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}}\n\nUnder the influence of his teacher Louis Germain, Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious [[lyceum]] (secondary school) near Algiers.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=8}} In 1930, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} Because it is a transmitted disease, he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time that Camus turned to philosophy, with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher [[Jean Grenier]]. He was impressed by [[ancient Greek philosopher]]s and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} During that time, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn 1933, Camus enrolled at the [[University of Algiers]] and completed his ''[[Licentiate (degree)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; after presenting his thesis on [[Plotinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sherman|2009|p=11|ps=: Camus' thesis was titled \"Rapports de l'hell\u00e9nisme et du christianisme \u00e0 travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian Thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\") for his ''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis).}}</ref> Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but Nietzsche and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Franz Kafka]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc=Background and Influences}} In 1933, he also met Simone Hi\u00e9, who would become his first wife.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nCamus played [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the [[Racing Universitaire d'Alger]] junior team from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously.{{sfn|Lattal|1995}} In match reports, he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} Camus drew parallels among football, human existence, morality, and personal identity. For him, the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and Church.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}}\n\n===Young Camus===\nIn 1934, aged 20, Camus was in a relationship with Simone Hi\u00e9.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1986|1p=30|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|p=9}} Simone suffered from an addiction to [[morphine]], a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains. His uncle Gustave did not approve of the relationship, but Camus married Hi\u00e9 to help her fight her addiction. He subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}} Camus was a womanizer throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=13}}\n\nCamus joined the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in early 1935. He saw it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria,\" even though he was not a [[Marxist]] and had not read ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (''Capital''). He explained: \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\" Camus left the PCF a year later.{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=12}} In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus's main role within the PCA was to organise the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Travail'' (\"Workers' Theatre\"). Camus was also close to the Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien ([[Algerian People's Party]] (PPA)), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the [[interwar period]] escalated, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus's mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Equipe (\"Theatre of the Team\"). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn 1938, Camus began working for the leftist newspaper ''[[Alger r\u00e9publicain]]'' (founded by [[Pascal Pia]]) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative [[colonialism]] as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the [[Arab-Berber|Arabs]] and Berbers by French authorities. ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' as editor-in-chief. In Paris, he almost completed his \"first cycle\" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless\u2014the novel ''L'\u00c9tranger'' (''The Outsider'' (UK), or [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''The Stranger'']] (US)), the philosophical essay ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'') and the play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]''. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay and a theatrical play.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|1p=12|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===World War II, Resistance and ''Combat''===\n\nSoon after Camus moved to Paris, the outbreak of [[World War II]] began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had suffered from tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris, Camus fled. He was laid off from ''Paris-Soir'' and ended up in [[Lyon]], where he married pianist and mathematician [[Francine Faure]] on 3 December 1940.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=13\u201314}} Camus and Faure moved back to Algeria ([[Oran]]) where he taught in primary schools.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=13}} Because of his tuberculosis, he was forced to move to the French Alps. There he began writing his second cycle of works, this time dealing with revolt\u2014a novel ''La Peste'' (''[[The Plague]]'') and a play ''Le Malentendu'' (''[[The Misunderstanding]]''). By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he met and became friends with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals including [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], and others. Among them was the actress [[Mar\u00eda Casares]], who would later have an affair with Camus.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}}\n\nCamus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the [[Occupation of France|French Occupation]]. Upon his arrival in Paris, he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}} Camus used a pseudonym for his ''Combat'' articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. During that period he composed four ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death|Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand]]'' (''Letters to a German Friend''), explaining why resistance was necessary.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=15}}\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Albert Camus2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Albert Camus in the 1950s|Albert Camus in the 1950s]]\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?97122-1/albert-camus-life Presentation by Olivier Todd on ''Albert Camus: A Life'', December 15, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\nAfter the War, Camus lived in Paris with Faure, who gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean in 1945.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the Resistance. He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more, only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies, which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the novel ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''). Camus attacked [[totalitarian]] [[communism]] while advocating [[libertarian]] [[socialism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=17}} Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with his rejection of communism, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the [[Algerian War]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nCamus was a strong supporter of European integration in various marginal organizations working towards that end.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1944, he founded the Comit\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais pour la f\u00e9deration europ\u00e9enne\u2014(CFFE (French Committee for the European Federation))\u2014declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation states become a federation.\"{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1947\u201348, he founded the Groupes de liaison internationale (GLI){{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Schaffner|2y=2006|2p=107}} a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary [[syndicalism]] (\"syndicalisme r\u00e9volutionnaire\"). According to Olivier Todd's biography ''Albert Camus, une vie'', (''Albert Camus: A Life'') it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the [[Surrealist Manifesto|Surrealist movement]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. His colleagues were [[Nicolas Lazar\u00e9vitch]], [[Louis Mercier]], Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, and [[Jean de Bo\u00eb]].{{sfn|Boulouque|2000}} His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the [[Hungary\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet intervention in Hungary]] and the totalitarian tendencies of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime in Spain.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}}\n\nCamus had numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress Mar\u00eda Casares, with whom he had an extensive correspondence.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=14\u201317|2a1=Zaretsky|2y=2018}} Faure did not take this affair lightly. She had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalization in the early 1950s. Camus, who felt guilty, withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}}\n\nIn 1957, Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] would win the prestigious award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography ''[[The First Man|Le Premier Homme]]'' (''The First Man'') in an attempt to examine \"moral learning\". He also turned to the theatre once more. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}} Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage [[Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]''. The play opened in January 1959 at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Antoine Theatre]] in Paris and was a critical success.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=18}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of Camus's gravestone| Albert Camus's gravestone]] [[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|thumb|The bronze plaque on the monument to Camus in the town of [[Villeblevin]], France.

He had spent the New Year's holiday of 1960 at his house in [[Lourmarin]], [[Vaucluse]] with his family, and his publisher [[Michel Gallimard]] of [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]], along with his wife, Janine, and daughter. Camus's wife and children went back to Paris by train on 2 January, but Camus decided to return in Gallimard's luxurious [[Facel Vega FVS|Facel Vega HK500]]. The car crashed into a [[Platanus|plane tree]] on a long straight stretch of the Route nationale 5 (now the [[Route nationale 6|RN 6]]). Camus, who was in the passenger seat and not wearing a safety belt, died instantly.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Life}} Gallimard died a few days later, although his wife and daughter were unharmed. There has been speculation that Camus was assassinated by the [[KGB]] because of his criticism of Soviet abuses.{{sfn|Catelli|2019}}{{sfn|Flood|2019}}\n\n144 pages of a handwritten manuscript entitled ''Le premier homme'' (''The First Man'') were found in the wreckage. Camus had predicted that this unfinished novel based on his childhood in Algeria would be his finest work.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Vaucluse, France, where he had lived. {{sfn|Bloom|2009|p=52}} His friend Sartre read a eulogy, paying tribute to Camus's heroic \"stubborn humanism\".{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Life}}\n\n==Literary career==\n\n[[File:Lucia 1957.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Camus crowning Stockholm's Lucia after accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature.|Camus crowning Stockholm's [[St Lucy's Day#In the Nordic countries|Lucia]] on 13 December 1957, three days after accepting the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\nCamus's first publication was a play called ''[[R\u00e9volte dans les Asturies]]'' (''Revolt in the Asturias'') written with three friends in May 1936. The subject was the 1934 revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government resulting in 1,500 to 2,000 deaths. In May 1937 he wrote his first book, ''L'Envers et l'Endroit'' (''[[Betwixt and Between]]'', also translated as ''The Wrong Side and the Right Side''). Both were published by [[Edmond Charlot]]'s small publishing house.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=11}}\n \nCamus separated his work into three cycles. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay, and a play. The first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of ''L'\u00c9tranger'', ''Le Mythe de Sysiphe'', and ''Caligula''. The second was the cycle of the revolt which included ''La Peste'' (''The Plague''), ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel''), and ''Les Justes'' (''The Just Assassins''). The third, the cycle of the love, consisted of ''Nemesis''. Each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs. {{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp=41\u201344}}\n\nThe books in the first cycle were published between 1942 and 1944, but the theme was conceived earlier, at least as far back as 1936.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=23}} With this cycle, Camus aims to pose a question on the [[human condition]], discuss the world as an absurd place, and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=41}}\n\nCamus began his work on the second cycle while he was in [[Algeria]], in the last months of 1942, just as the Germans were reaching North Africa.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=14}} In the second cycle, Camus used [[Prometheus]], who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist, to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion. He analyses various aspects of rebellion, its metaphysics, its connection to politics, and examines it under the lens of modernity, of [[historicity]] and the absence of a God.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize, Camus gathered, clarified, and published his pacifist leaning views at ''Actuelles III: Chronique alg\u00e9rienne 1939\u20131958'' (''Algerian Chronicles''). He then decided to distance himself from the Algerian War as he found the mental burden too heavy. He turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess [[Nemesis]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}}\n\nTwo of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first entitled ''La mort heureuse'' (''[[A Happy Death]]'') (1970), features a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''The Stranger''{{'}}s Meursault. There is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''Le Premier homme'' (''The First Man'') (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. It was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria.\n\nThe publication of this book in 1994 has sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus's allegedly unrepentant colonialism.{{sfn|Carroll|2007}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Works of Camus by genre and cycle, <small>according to Matthew Sharpe{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=44}}</small>\n|-\n!

While he did not deny that morals change over time, he rejected the classical [[Marxist doctrine]] that history defines morality.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nCamus was also strongly critical of authoritarian communism, especially in the case of the Soviet regime, which he considered [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. Camus rebuked Soviet apologists and their \"decision to call total servitude freedom\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=75\u201376}} As a proponent of [[libertarian socialism]], he claimed the USSR was not socialist, and the United States was not liberal.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=185\u201387}} His fierce critique of the USSR caused him to clash with others on the political left, most notably with his friend Jean-Paul Sartre.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nActive in the [[French Resistance]] to the German occupation of France during World War II, Camus wrote for and edited the famous Resistance journal ''Combat''. Of the [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers#France|French collaboration]] with the German occupiers, he wrote: \"Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.\"{{sfn|Bernstein|1997}} After France's liberation, Camus remarked, \"This country does not need a [[Talleyrand]], but a [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]].\"{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}} The reality of the bloody [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale|postwar tribunals]] soon changed his mind: Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of [[capital punishment]].{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}}\n\nCamus leaned towards anarchism, a tendency that intensified in the 1950s, when he came to believe that the Soviet model was morally bankrupt.{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1p=86|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=445}} Camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation, authority and property, bosses, the State and centralization.{{sfn|Dunwoodie|1993|p=87}} Philosophy professor David Sherman considers Camus an [[anarcho-syndicalist]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=185}} [[Graeme Nicholson]] considers Camus an [[Existentialist anarchism|existentialist anarchist]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1971|p=14}}\n\nThe anarchist [[Andr\u00e9 Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting of the Cercle des \u00c9tudiants Anarchistes (\"Anarchist Student Circle\") in 1948 as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''[[Le Libertaire]]'', ''[[La R\u00e9volution prol\u00e9tarienne]]'', and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (\"Workers' Solidarity\"), the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) (\"National Confederation of Labor\").{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1pp=87-87|1ps=: See also appendix p 97|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=18}}\n\nCamus kept a neutral stance during the [[Algerian Revolution]] (1954\u201362). While he was against the violence of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist France. He was supportive of [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France|Pierre Mend\u00e8s]]' [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU) and its approach to the crisis;\u00b7 Mendes advocated reconciliation. Camus also supported a like-minded Algerian militant, [[Aziz Kessous]]. Camus traveled to Algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=17\u201318 & 188|2a1=Cohn|2y=1986|2pp=30 & 38}} His confrontation with an Algerian nationalist during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize caused a sensation. When confronted with the dilemma of choosing between his mother and justice, his response was: \"I have always condemned [[terrorism]], and I must condemn a terrorism that works blindly in the streets of Algiers and one day might strike at my mother and family. I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother before justice.\"{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=191}} Camus' critics called it reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=584}} According to David Sherman, though, Camus tried to highlight the false dichotomy of the two choices as the use of terrorism and indiscriminate violence could not bring justice under any circumstances.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=191}}\n\nHe was sharply critical of the [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation of nuclear weapons]] and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=87}} In the 1950s, Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952, he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain, under the leadership of the [[caudillo]] General Francisco Franco, as a member.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}} Camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual, and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment entitled ''[[R\u00e9flexions sur la peine capitale]]'', published by [[Calmann-Levy]] in 1957.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=73 & 85}}\n\n==Algeria==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements fran\u00e7ais d'Alg\u00e9rie 1934-1955 map-fr.svg|thumb|alt=Map of French Algeria showing its administrative organization between 1905 and 1955 |Administrative organization of French Algeria between 1905 and 1955]]\n\nBorn in Algeria to French parents, Camus was familiar with the [[institutional racism]] of France against Arabs and Berbers, but he was not part of a rich elite. He lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of France and as such was entitled to citizens' rights; the Arab and Berbers majority of the country were not.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nCamus was a vocal advocate of the \"new Mediterranean Culture\". This was a term he used to describe his vision of embracing the multi-ethnicity of the Algerian people, in opposition to \"Latiny\", a popular pro-fascist and antisemitic ideology among other ''[[Pieds-Noirs]]''\u2014or French or Europeans born in Algeria. For Camus, this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=141-143}} His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus's most systematic statement of his views at this time. Camus also supported the [[Blum\u2013Viollette proposal]] to grant Algerians full French citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=145}} In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the [[Kabylie]] highlands. He advocated for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=356}}\n\nIn 1945, following the [[S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre]] after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony. He wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions, and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nWhen the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''Pieds-Noirs'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the \"new [[Arab imperialism]]\" led by Egypt, and an \"anti-Western\" offensive orchestrated by Russia to \"encircle Europe\" and \"isolate the United States\".{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=322}} Although favoring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist. During the war, he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians. It was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began working for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=161}} His position drew much criticism from the left who considered colonialism unacceptable. In their eyes, Camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nCamus once confided that the troubles in Algeria \"affected him as others feel pain in their lungs.\"{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=9}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n===Existentialism===\n\nEven though Camus is mostly connected to [[Absurdism]],{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=3}} he is routinely categorized as an [[Existentialist]], a term he rejected on several occasions.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=3}}\n\nCamus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient Greek philosophy, [[Nietzsche]], and 17th-century moralists whereas existentialism arises from 19th- and early 20th-century philosophy such as [[Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Sharpe|2y=2015|2p=29}} He also said his work, ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=2}} Camus was rejecting existentialism as a philosophy, but his critique was mostly focused on [[Sartre]]an existentialism, and to a lesser extent on religious existentialism. He thought that the importance of history held by Marx and Sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom.{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=3}} David Sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between Sartre and Camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=4|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} David Simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Existentialism}}\n\nOn the other hand, Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life, the inevitable ending (death) is highlighted in his acts. His belief that the absurd\u2014life being void of meaning, or man's inability to know that meaning if it were to exist\u2014was something that man should embrace. His anti-Christianity, his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1pp=5\u20136|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} More importantly, Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of [[suicide]]. He wrote: \"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.\" Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\n===Absurdism===\nMany existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd, each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camus's thoughts on the Absurd begins with his first cycle of books and the literary essay ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', (''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''), his major work on the subject. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life in ''L'\u00c9tranger''. He also wrote a play about the Roman emperor [[Caligula]], pursuing an absurd logic, which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''Betwixt and Between'') in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''[[Nuptials (Camus)|Nuptials]]''), in 1938 and ''Betwixt and Between''. In these essays, Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=23}} Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can be found in ''The Plague''.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=8}}\n\nCamus follows Sartre's definition of the Absurd: \"That which is meaningless. Thus man's existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} The Absurd is created because man, who is placed in an unintelligent universe, realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; or as Camus himself explains, the Absurd is the result of the \"confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\"{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=6}} Even though absurdity is inescapable, Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question: Why should someone continue to live? Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather, he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=7-10}}\n\nThe turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Lib\u00e9ration'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libert\u00e9s'', in 1945. The four letters were published as ''Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death''.\n\nCamus regretted the continued reference to himself as a \"philosopher of the absurd\". He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to \"Camus's Absurd\".{{sfn|Curtis|1972|p=335-348}}\n\n===Revolt===\n\nCamus is known for articulating the case for revolting against any kind of oppression, injustice, or whatever disrespects the human condition. He is cautious enough, however, to set the limits on the rebellion.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1p=18|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Revolt}} ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel'') explains in detail his thoughts on the issue. There, he builds upon the absurd (described in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'') but goes further. In the introduction, where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion, he concludes with the phrase \"I revolt, therefore we exist\" implying the recognition of a common human condition.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=55\u201356}} Camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebel's revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime. So he places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=56\u201358}} Camus poses a crucial question: Is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner, in a silent universe? According to him the answer is yes, as the experience and awareness of the Absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=43\u201344}} Camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes. First, there is the metaphysical rebellion, which is \"the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation.\" The other mode, historical rebellion, is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world. In this attempt, the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries, and not cause any unjustifiable suffering.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=50\u201355}}\n\n==Legacy==\nCamus's novels and philosophical essays are still influential. After his death, interest in Camus followed the rise (and diminution) of the [[New Left]]. Following the [[collapse of Soviet Union]], interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=207\u2013208}} He is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance, dialogue, and civil rights.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp= 241\u2013242}}\n\nAlthough Camus has been linked to anti-Soviet communism, reaching as far as anarcho-syndicalism, some neo-liberals have tried to associate him with their policies, e.g. when the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] suggested that his remains to be moved to the [[Panth\u00e9on]], an idea that angered many on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Zaretsky|1y=2013|1pp=3\u20134|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=208}}\n\n==Works==\nWorks of Albert Camus include:{{sfn|Hughes|2007|p=xvii}}\n===Novels===\n* ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (''L'\u00c9tranger'', often translated as ''The Outsider''.

He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] at the age of 44 in 1957, the second-youngest recipient in history.\n\nCamus was [[pied-noir|born in Algeria]] to French [[Pied-Noir|Pieds Noirs]] parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighborhood \nand later studied philosophy at the [[University of Algiers]]. He was in Paris when the [[Battle of France|Germans invaded France]] during [[World War II]]. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the [[French Resistance]] where he served as editor-in-chief at ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active. He was part of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] that opposed the [[Soviet Union]] because of its [[totalitarianism]]. Camus was a [[Moralism|moralist]] and leaned towards [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. He was part of many organizations seeking European integration. During the [[Algerian War]], he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties.\n\nPhilosophically, Camus's views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. He is also considered to be an [[existentialist]], even though he firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years and education===\n\n[[File:Algiers The University (GRI).jpg|thumb|alt=A postcard showing the University of Algiers|A 20th-century postcard of the University of Algiers]]\nAlbert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighborhood in Mondovi (present-day [[Dr\u00e9an]]), in [[French Algeria]]. His mother, Catherine H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sint\u00e8s Camus, was of [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-([[Balearic Islands|Balearic]]) descent. His father, Lucien Camus, a poor French-Algerian agricultural worker, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during [[World War I]]. Camus never knew him. Camus, his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]]. He was a second-generation French immigrant to Algeria. His paternal grandfather, along with many others of his generation, had moved to Africa for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence, he was called {{lang-fr|[[pied-noir]]|label=none|lit='black foot'}}\u2014a slang term for French who were born in Algeria\u2014and his binational identity and his poor background had a substantial effect on his later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=7|3a1=Lottman|3y=1979|3p=11|4a1=Carroll|4y=2007|4pp=2\u20133}} Nevertheless, Camus was a French citizen, in contrast to the [[Arab]] or [[Berbers|Berber]] inhabitants of Algeria who were denied the associated privileges this brought.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=2\u20133}} During his childhood, Camus developed a love for football and swimming.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}}\n\nUnder the influence of his teacher Louis Germain, Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious [[lyceum]] (secondary school) near Algiers.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=8}} In 1930, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} Because it is a transmitted disease, he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time that Camus turned to philosophy, with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher [[Jean Grenier]]. He was impressed by [[ancient Greek philosopher]]s and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} During that time, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn 1933, Camus enrolled at the [[University of Algiers]] and completed his ''[[Licentiate (degree)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; after presenting his thesis on [[Plotinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sherman|2009|p=11|ps=: Camus' thesis was titled \"Rapports de l'hell\u00e9nisme et du christianisme \u00e0 travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian Thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\") for his ''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis).}}</ref> Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but Nietzsche and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Franz Kafka]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc=Background and Influences}} In 1933, he also met Simone Hi\u00e9, who would become his first wife.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nCamus played [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the [[Racing Universitaire d'Alger]] junior team from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously.{{sfn|Lattal|1995}} In match reports, he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} Camus drew parallels among football, human existence, morality, and personal identity. For him, the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and Church.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}}\n\n===Young Camus===\nIn 1934, aged 20, Camus was in a relationship with Simone Hi\u00e9.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1986|1p=30|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|p=9}} Simone suffered from an addiction to [[morphine]], a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains. His uncle Gustave did not approve of the relationship, but Camus married Hi\u00e9 to help her fight her addiction. He subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}} Camus was a womanizer throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=13}}\n\nCamus joined the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in early 1935. He saw it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria,\" even though he was not a [[Marxist]] and had not read ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (''Capital''). He explained: \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\" Camus left the PCF a year later.{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=12}} In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus's main role within the PCA was to organise the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Travail'' (\"Workers' Theatre\"). Camus was also close to the Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien ([[Algerian People's Party]] (PPA)), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the [[interwar period]] escalated, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus's mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Equipe (\"Theatre of the Team\"). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn 1938, Camus began working for the leftist newspaper ''[[Alger r\u00e9publicain]]'' (founded by [[Pascal Pia]]) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative [[colonialism]] as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the [[Arab-Berber|Arabs]] and Berbers by French authorities. ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' as editor-in-chief. In Paris, he almost completed his \"first cycle\" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless\u2014the novel ''L'\u00c9tranger'' (''The Outsider'' (UK), or [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''The Stranger'']] (US)), the philosophical essay ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'') and the play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]''. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay and a theatrical play.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|1p=12|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===World War II, Resistance and ''Combat''===\n\nSoon after Camus moved to Paris, the outbreak of [[World War II]] began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had suffered from tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris, Camus fled. He was laid off from ''Paris-Soir'' and ended up in [[Lyon]], where he married pianist and mathematician [[Francine Faure]] on 3 December 1940.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=13\u201314}} Camus and Faure moved back to Algeria ([[Oran]]) where he taught in primary schools.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=13}} Because of his tuberculosis, he was forced to move to the French Alps. There he began writing his second cycle of works, this time dealing with revolt\u2014a novel ''La Peste'' (''[[The Plague]]'') and a play ''Le Malentendu'' (''[[The Misunderstanding]]''). By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he met and became friends with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals including [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], and others. Among them was the actress [[Mar\u00eda Casares]], who would later have an affair with Camus.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}}\n\nCamus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the [[Occupation of France|French Occupation]]. Upon his arrival in Paris, he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}} Camus used a pseudonym for his ''Combat'' articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. During that period he composed four ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death|Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand]]'' (''Letters to a German Friend''), explaining why resistance was necessary.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=15}}\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Albert Camus2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Albert Camus in the 1950s|Albert Camus in the 1950s]]\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?97122-1/albert-camus-life Presentation by Olivier Todd on ''Albert Camus: A Life'', December 15, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\nAfter the War, Camus lived in Paris with Faure, who gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean in 1945.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the Resistance. He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more, only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies, which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the novel ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''). Camus attacked [[totalitarian]] [[communism]] while advocating [[libertarian]] [[socialism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=17}} Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with his rejection of communism, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the [[Algerian War]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nCamus was a strong supporter of European integration in various marginal organizations working towards that end.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1944, he founded the Comit\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais pour la f\u00e9deration europ\u00e9enne\u2014(CFFE (French Committee for the European Federation))\u2014declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation states become a federation.\"{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1947\u201348, he founded the Groupes de liaison internationale (GLI){{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Schaffner|2y=2006|2p=107}} a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary [[syndicalism]] (\"syndicalisme r\u00e9volutionnaire\"). According to Olivier Todd's biography ''Albert Camus, une vie'', (''Albert Camus: A Life'') it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the [[Surrealist Manifesto|Surrealist movement]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. His colleagues were [[Nicolas Lazar\u00e9vitch]], [[Louis Mercier]], Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, and [[Jean de Bo\u00eb]].{{sfn|Boulouque|2000}} His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the [[Hungary\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet intervention in Hungary]] and the totalitarian tendencies of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime in Spain.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}}\n\nCamus had numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress Mar\u00eda Casares, with whom he had an extensive correspondence.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=14\u201317|2a1=Zaretsky|2y=2018}} Faure did not take this affair lightly. She had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalization in the early 1950s. Camus, who felt guilty, withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}}\n\nIn 1957, Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] would win the prestigious award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography ''[[The First Man|Le Premier Homme]]'' (''The First Man'') in an attempt to examine \"moral learning\". He also turned to the theatre once more. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}} Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage [[Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]''. The play opened in January 1959 at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Antoine Theatre]] in Paris and was a critical success.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=18}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of Camus's gravestone| Albert Camus's gravestone]] [[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|thumb|The bronze plaque on the monument to Camus in the town of [[Villeblevin]], France.

He had spent the New Year's holiday of 1960 at his house in [[Lourmarin]], [[Vaucluse]] with his family, and his publisher [[Michel Gallimard]] of [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]], along with his wife, Janine, and daughter. Camus's wife and children went back to Paris by train on 2 January, but Camus decided to return in Gallimard's luxurious [[Facel Vega FVS|Facel Vega HK500]]. The car crashed into a [[Platanus|plane tree]] on a long straight stretch of the Route nationale 5 (now the [[Route nationale 6|RN 6]]). Camus, who was in the passenger seat and not wearing a safety belt, died instantly.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Life}} Gallimard died a few days later, although his wife and daughter were unharmed.

Camus had predicted that this unfinished novel based on his childhood in Algeria would be his finest work.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Vaucluse, France, where he had lived. {{sfn|Bloom|2009|p=52}} His friend Sartre read a eulogy, paying tribute to Camus's heroic \"stubborn humanism\".{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Life}}\n\n==Literary career==\n\n[[File:Lucia 1957.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Camus crowning Stockholm's Lucia after accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature.|Camus crowning Stockholm's [[St Lucy's Day#In the Nordic countries|Lucia]] on 13 December 1957, three days after accepting the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\nCamus's first publication was a play called ''[[R\u00e9volte dans les Asturies]]'' (''Revolt in the Asturias'') written with three friends in May 1936. The subject was the 1934 revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government resulting in 1,500 to 2,000 deaths. In May 1937 he wrote his first book, ''L'Envers et l'Endroit'' (''[[Betwixt and Between]]'', also translated as ''The Wrong Side and the Right Side''). Both were published by [[Edmond Charlot]]'s small publishing house.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=11}}\n \nCamus separated his work into three cycles. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay, and a play. The first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of ''L'\u00c9tranger'', ''Le Mythe de Sysiphe'', and ''Caligula''. The second was the cycle of the revolt which included ''La Peste'' (''The Plague''), ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel''), and ''Les Justes'' (''The Just Assassins''). The third, the cycle of the love, consisted of ''Nemesis''. Each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs. {{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp=41\u201344}}\n\nThe books in the first cycle were published between 1942 and 1944, but the theme was conceived earlier, at least as far back as 1936.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=23}} With this cycle, Camus aims to pose a question on the [[human condition]], discuss the world as an absurd place, and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=41}}\n\nCamus began his work on the second cycle while he was in [[Algeria]], in the last months of 1942, just as the Germans were reaching North Africa.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=14}} In the second cycle, Camus used [[Prometheus]], who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist, to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion. He analyses various aspects of rebellion, its metaphysics, its connection to politics, and examines it under the lens of modernity, of [[historicity]] and the absence of a God.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize, Camus gathered, clarified, and published his pacifist leaning views at ''Actuelles III: Chronique alg\u00e9rienne 1939\u20131958'' (''Algerian Chronicles''). He then decided to distance himself from the Algerian War as he found the mental burden too heavy. He turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess [[Nemesis]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}}\n\nTwo of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first entitled ''La mort heureuse'' (''[[A Happy Death]]'') (1970), features a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''The Stranger''{{'}}s Meursault. There is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''Le Premier homme'' (''The First Man'') (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. It was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria.\n\nThe publication of this book in 1994 has sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus's allegedly unrepentant colonialism.{{sfn|Carroll|2007}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Works of Camus by genre and cycle, <small>according to Matthew Sharpe{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=44}}</small>\n|-\n!

While he did not deny that morals change over time, he rejected the classical [[Marxist doctrine]] that history defines morality.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nCamus was also strongly critical of authoritarian communism, especially in the case of the Soviet regime, which he considered [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. Camus rebuked Soviet apologists and their \"decision to call total servitude freedom\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=75\u201376}} As a proponent of [[libertarian socialism]], he claimed the USSR was not socialist, and the United States was not liberal.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=185\u201387}} His fierce critique of the USSR caused him to clash with others on the political left, most notably with his friend Jean-Paul Sartre.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nActive in the [[French Resistance]] to the German occupation of France during World War II, Camus wrote for and edited the famous Resistance journal ''Combat''. Of the [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers#France|French collaboration]] with the German occupiers, he wrote: \"Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.\"{{sfn|Bernstein|1997}} After France's liberation, Camus remarked, \"This country does not need a [[Talleyrand]], but a [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]].\"{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}} The reality of the bloody [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale|postwar tribunals]] soon changed his mind: Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of [[capital punishment]].{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}}\n\nCamus leaned towards anarchism, a tendency that intensified in the 1950s, when he came to believe that the Soviet model was morally bankrupt.{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1p=86|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=445}} Camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation, authority and property, bosses, the State and centralization.{{sfn|Dunwoodie|1993|p=87}} Philosophy professor David Sherman considers Camus an [[anarcho-syndicalist]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=185}} [[Graeme Nicholson]] considers Camus an [[Existentialist anarchism|existentialist anarchist]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1971|p=14}}\n\nThe anarchist [[Andr\u00e9 Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting of the Cercle des \u00c9tudiants Anarchistes (\"Anarchist Student Circle\") in 1948 as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''[[Le Libertaire]]'', ''[[La R\u00e9volution prol\u00e9tarienne]]'', and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (\"Workers' Solidarity\"), the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) (\"National Confederation of Labor\").{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1pp=87-87|1ps=: See also appendix p 97|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=18}}\n\nCamus kept a neutral stance during the [[Algerian Revolution]] (1954\u201362). While he was against the violence of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist France. He was supportive of [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France|Pierre Mend\u00e8s]]' [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU) and its approach to the crisis;\u00b7 Mendes advocated reconciliation. Camus also supported a like-minded Algerian militant, [[Aziz Kessous]]. Camus traveled to Algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=17\u201318 & 188|2a1=Cohn|2y=1986|2pp=30 & 38}} His confrontation with an Algerian nationalist during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize caused a sensation. When confronted with the dilemma of choosing between his mother and justice, his response was: \"I have always condemned [[terrorism]], and I must condemn a terrorism that works blindly in the streets of Algiers and one day might strike at my mother and family. I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother before justice.\"{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=191}} Camus' critics called it reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=584}} According to David Sherman, though, Camus tried to highlight the false dichotomy of the two choices as the use of terrorism and indiscriminate violence could not bring justice under any circumstances.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=191}}\n\nHe was sharply critical of the [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation of nuclear weapons]] and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=87}} In the 1950s, Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952, he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain, under the leadership of the [[caudillo]] General Francisco Franco, as a member.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}} Camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual, and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment entitled ''[[R\u00e9flexions sur la peine capitale]]'', published by [[Calmann-Levy]] in 1957.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=73 & 85}}\n\n==Algeria==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements fran\u00e7ais d'Alg\u00e9rie 1934-1955 map-fr.svg|thumb|alt=Map of French Algeria showing its administrative organization between 1905 and 1955 |Administrative organization of French Algeria between 1905 and 1955]]\n\nBorn in Algeria to French parents, Camus was familiar with the [[institutional racism]] of France against Arabs and Berbers, but he was not part of a rich elite. He lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of France and as such was entitled to citizens' rights; the Arab and Berbers majority of the country were not.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nCamus was a vocal advocate of the \"new Mediterranean Culture\". This was a term he used to describe his vision of embracing the multi-ethnicity of the Algerian people, in opposition to \"Latiny\", a popular pro-fascist and antisemitic ideology among other ''[[Pieds-Noirs]]''\u2014or French or Europeans born in Algeria. For Camus, this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=141-143}} His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus's most systematic statement of his views at this time. Camus also supported the [[Blum\u2013Viollette proposal]] to grant Algerians full French citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=145}} In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the [[Kabylie]] highlands. He advocated for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=356}}\n\nIn 1945, following the [[S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre]] after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony. He wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions, and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nWhen the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''Pieds-Noirs'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the \"new [[Arab imperialism]]\" led by Egypt, and an \"anti-Western\" offensive orchestrated by Russia to \"encircle Europe\" and \"isolate the United States\".{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=322}} Although favoring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist. During the war, he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians. It was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began working for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=161}} His position drew much criticism from the left who considered colonialism unacceptable. In their eyes, Camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nCamus once confided that the troubles in Algeria \"affected him as others feel pain in their lungs.\"{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=9}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n===Existentialism===\n\nEven though Camus is mostly connected to [[Absurdism]],{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=3}} he is routinely categorized as an [[Existentialist]], a term he rejected on several occasions.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=3}}\n\nCamus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient Greek philosophy, [[Nietzsche]], and 17th-century moralists whereas existentialism arises from 19th- and early 20th-century philosophy such as [[Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Sharpe|2y=2015|2p=29}} He also said his work, ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=2}} Camus was rejecting existentialism as a philosophy, but his critique was mostly focused on [[Sartre]]an existentialism, and to a lesser extent on religious existentialism. He thought that the importance of history held by Marx and Sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom.{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=3}} David Sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between Sartre and Camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=4|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} David Simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Existentialism}}\n\nOn the other hand, Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life, the inevitable ending (death) is highlighted in his acts. His belief that the absurd\u2014life being void of meaning, or man's inability to know that meaning if it were to exist\u2014was something that man should embrace. His anti-Christianity, his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1pp=5\u20136|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} More importantly, Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of [[suicide]]. He wrote: \"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.\" Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\n===Absurdism===\nMany existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd, each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camus's thoughts on the Absurd begins with his first cycle of books and the literary essay ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', (''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''), his major work on the subject. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life in ''L'\u00c9tranger''. He also wrote a play about the Roman emperor [[Caligula]], pursuing an absurd logic, which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''Betwixt and Between'') in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''[[Nuptials (Camus)|Nuptials]]''), in 1938 and ''Betwixt and Between''. In these essays, Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=23}} Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can be found in ''The Plague''.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=8}}\n\nCamus follows Sartre's definition of the Absurd: \"That which is meaningless. Thus man's existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} The Absurd is created because man, who is placed in an unintelligent universe, realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; or as Camus himself explains, the Absurd is the result of the \"confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\"{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=6}} Even though absurdity is inescapable, Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question: Why should someone continue to live? Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather, he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=7-10}}\n\nThe turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Lib\u00e9ration'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libert\u00e9s'', in 1945. The four letters were published as ''Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death''.\n\nCamus regretted the continued reference to himself as a \"philosopher of the absurd\". He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to \"Camus's Absurd\".{{sfn|Curtis|1972|p=335-348}}\n\n===Revolt===\n\nCamus is known for articulating the case for revolting against any kind of oppression, injustice, or whatever disrespects the human condition. He is cautious enough, however, to set the limits on the rebellion.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1p=18|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Revolt}} ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel'') explains in detail his thoughts on the issue. There, he builds upon the absurd (described in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'') but goes further. In the introduction, where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion, he concludes with the phrase \"I revolt, therefore we exist\" implying the recognition of a common human condition.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=55\u201356}} Camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebel's revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime. So he places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=56\u201358}} Camus poses a crucial question: Is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner, in a silent universe? According to him the answer is yes, as the experience and awareness of the Absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=43\u201344}} Camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes. First, there is the metaphysical rebellion, which is \"the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation.\" The other mode, historical rebellion, is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world. In this attempt, the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries, and not cause any unjustifiable suffering.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=50\u201355}}\n\n==Legacy==\nCamus's novels and philosophical essays are still influential. After his death, interest in Camus followed the rise (and diminution) of the [[New Left]]. Following the [[collapse of Soviet Union]], interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=207\u2013208}} He is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance, dialogue, and civil rights.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp= 241\u2013242}}\n\nAlthough Camus has been linked to anti-Soviet communism, reaching as far as anarcho-syndicalism, some neo-liberals have tried to associate him with their policies, e.g. when the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] suggested that his remains to be moved to the [[Panth\u00e9on]], an idea that angered many on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Zaretsky|1y=2013|1pp=3\u20134|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=208}}\n\n==Works==\nWorks of Albert Camus include:{{sfn|Hughes|2007|p=xvii}}\n===Novels===\n* ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (''L'\u00c9tranger'', often translated as ''The Outsider''.

[[Scotland]] is the only part of the [[United Kingdom]] where Humanist weddings are recognised as legal by the state and is only one of eight countries in the world where Humanist weddings are legally recognised, the others as of 2017 are: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and some states of the [[United States of America]].\n\nCelebrants differ from [[Chaplains]] in that Celebrants serve the unaffiliated public at large, while Chaplains are usually employed by an institution such as a hospital or other health care facility, the military, etc. However some celebrants of [[Humanist Society Scotland]] perform [[Chaplain]] duties at Scottish education establishments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Humanist Chaplain|url=http://www.gcu.ac.uk/student/faith/chaplains/humanistchaplain/|publisher=Glasgow Caledonian University|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Celebrant (Australia)}}\nIn Australia, Celebrants have a slightly different role, as regulated by local and national laws.\n\n==By faith==\n[[File:Ev Stadtkirche Ravensburg innen.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Lutheran]] minister in Germany marries a young couple.]]\n\n===Christianity===\n{{Further|Marriage#Christianity}}\n\n====Catholicism====\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], it is the bride and groom who perform the [[Catholic marriage|Sacrament of Matrimony]] (marriage), but a marriage can only be valid if the Church has a witness at the wedding ceremony whose function is to question the couple to ensure that they have no obstacle to marriage (such as an [[Annulment|un-annulled]] previous marriage or certain undisclosed facts between the couple) and that they are freely choosing to wed each other.\n\nAll ordained clergy (i.e. a [[deacon]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], or [[bishop]]) may witness the wedding ceremony itself, though usually the wedding ceremony occurs during a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], which deacons lack the authority or ability to celebrate; however, in weddings that take place inside Mass, the deacon may still serve as the witness to the wedding, provided that a priest or bishop celebrates the Mass; and in weddings that take place outside Mass (which usually occurs in a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Christian or, less often, non-Catholic), the ceremony is the same for deacons, priests, and bishops (with few or no changes).\n\n====Protestantism====\nProtestant weddings are conducted by a minister or pastor, depending on Christian denomination.\n\n====Quaker====\nIn [[Quaker]] weddings the couple marry each other with no third party officiating.\n\n===Islam===\nIslamic weddings are performed by Imams.\n\n===Judaism===\n{{main|Jewish wedding}}\nIn [[Judaism]], a [[Rabbi]] officiates Jewish weddings. However, the Rabbi's function is to ensure that the Jewish religious laws of the wedding ceremony are followed, particularly making sure that the Jewish witnesses are valid.  The Rabbi traditionally recites the blessing for the ceremony on behalf of the groom, although in ancient times the groom would have recited this blessing.\n\n===Non-religious===\n====Non-denominational====\nSome organizations have limited or no requirements for ordination, like [[American Marriage Ministries]] and the [[Universal Life Church]]. Such organizations may be known as [[ordination mill]]s, however in most cases, their ordinations provide the same legal standing as mainstream officiants, and marriage licenses signed such organizations are valid and recognized.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/fashion/05marry.html|title=Great Wedding! But Was It Legal?|last=Sipher|first=Devan|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany non-religious people have their weddings in non-denominational churches, mosques, and synagogues.\n\n====Humanist====\nA number of [[humanist]] organizations provide credentials to individuals who may solemnize marriages in whatever manner they choose; these are known as [[Humanist celebrant]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Celebrant (Australia)|Celebrant]], the title of a marriage officiant in

[[Scotland]] is the only part of the [[United Kingdom]] where Humanist weddings are recognised as legal by the state and is only one of eight countries in the world where Humanist weddings are legally recognised, the others as of 2017 are: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and some states of the [[United States of America]].\n\nCelebrants differ from [[Chaplains]] in that Celebrants serve the unaffiliated public at large, while Chaplains are usually employed by an institution such as a hospital or other health care facility, the military, etc. However some celebrants of [[Humanist Society Scotland]] perform [[Chaplain]] duties at Scottish education establishments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Humanist Chaplain|url=http://www.gcu.ac.uk/student/faith/chaplains/humanistchaplain/|publisher=Glasgow Caledonian University|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Celebrant (Australia)}}\nIn Australia, Celebrants have a slightly different role, as regulated by local and national laws.\n\n==By faith==\n[[File:Ev Stadtkirche Ravensburg innen.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Lutheran]] minister in Germany marries a young couple.]]\n\n===Christianity===\n{{Further|Marriage#Christianity}}\n\n====Catholicism====\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], it is the bride and groom who perform the [[Catholic marriage|Sacrament of Matrimony]] (marriage), but a marriage can only be valid if the Church has a witness at the wedding ceremony whose function is to question the couple to ensure that they have no obstacle to marriage (such as an [[Annulment|un-annulled]] previous marriage or certain undisclosed facts between the couple) and that they are freely choosing to wed each other.\n\nAll ordained clergy (i.e. a [[deacon]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], or [[bishop]]) may witness the wedding ceremony itself, though usually the wedding ceremony occurs during a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], which deacons lack the authority or ability to celebrate; however, in weddings that take place inside Mass, the deacon may still serve as the witness to the wedding, provided that a priest or bishop celebrates the Mass; and in weddings that take place outside Mass (which usually occurs in a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Christian or, less often, non-Catholic), the ceremony is the same for deacons, priests, and bishops (with few or no changes).\n\n====Protestantism====\nProtestant weddings are conducted by a minister or pastor, depending on Christian denomination.\n\n====Quaker====\nIn [[Quaker]] weddings the couple marry each other with no third party officiating.\n\n===Islam===\nIslamic weddings are performed by Imams.\n\n===Judaism===\n{{main|Jewish wedding}}\nIn [[Judaism]], a [[Rabbi]] officiates Jewish weddings. However, the Rabbi's function is to ensure that the Jewish religious laws of the wedding ceremony are followed, particularly making sure that the Jewish witnesses are valid.  The Rabbi traditionally recites the blessing for the ceremony on behalf of the groom, although in ancient times the groom would have recited this blessing.\n\n===Non-religious===\n====Non-denominational====\nSome organizations have limited or no requirements for ordination, like [[American Marriage Ministries]] and the [[Universal Life Church]]. Such organizations may be known as [[ordination mill]]s, however in most cases, their ordinations provide the same legal standing as mainstream officiants, and marriage licenses signed such organizations are valid and recognized.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/fashion/05marry.html|title=Great Wedding! But Was It Legal?|last=Sipher|first=Devan|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany non-religious people have their weddings in non-denominational churches, mosques, and synagogues.\n\n====Humanist====\nA number of [[humanist]] organizations provide credentials to individuals who may solemnize marriages in whatever manner they choose; these are known as [[Humanist celebrant]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Celebrant (Australia)|Celebrant]], the title of a marriage officiant in [[Australia]]\n*[[Officiant]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{wedding}}\n\n[[Category:Wedding ceremony participants]]\n[[Category:Marriage]]\n[[Category:Civil law (common law)]]\n", "name_user": "Waleed ramini", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBy country", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_officiant"}
