His father, the autonomous ruler of [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] and [[al-Sham|Syria]], designated him as his successor. When Ibn Tulun died in May 884, Khumarawayh succeeded him. After [[Battle of Tawahin|defeating]] an attempt to depose him, in 886 he managed to gain recognition of his rule over Egypt and Syria as a hereditary governor from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. In 893 the agreement was renewed with the new Abbasid Caliph, [[al-Mu'tadid]], and sealed with the marriage of his daughter [[Qatr al-Nada]] to the Caliph.\n\nAt the height of his power, Khumarawayh's authority expanded from the [[Byzantine]] frontier in [[Cilicia]] and the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] to [[Nubia]]. Domestically, his reign was marked by a prodigal squandering of funds on extravagant displays of wealth, construction of palaces, and the patronage of artists and poets. In combination with the need to maintain a sizeable professional army and guarantee its loyalty through rich gifts, this emptied the treasury by the end of his reign. Khumarawayh was murdered by a palace servant in 896, and was succeeded by his son [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Jaysh]], who was deposed after a few months in favour of another son, [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]]. The Tulunid state entered a period of turmoil and weakness, which culminated in its reconquest by the Abbasids in 904\u2013905.\n\n==Biography==\nKhumarawayh was born at [[Samarra]] in 864.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} His father, [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], the son of a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldier, was appointed governor of Egypt in 868. In 871 he expelled the caliphal fiscal agent and assumed direct control of Egypt's revenue, which he used to create an army of slave soldiers (''[[ghilman|ghilm\u0101n]]'') of his own. Relying on this powerful force, and exploiting the rift between the increasingly powerless Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] and his brother and ''de facto'' regent [[al-Muwaffaq]]\u2014in 882 al-Mu'tamid even tried to flee Samarra and seek refuge with Ibn Tulun\u2014he managed to gain control over [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] and the frontier zone with the [[Byzantine Empire]] (the ''[[Thughur|Thugh\u016br]]''), as well as parts of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] up to [[Raqqa]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\n===Succession and relations with the Abbasids===\nIn 882, following a failed rebellion of his elder brother [[al-Abbas ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Abbas]], who was \"regarded as cruel and untrustworthy\" ({{ill|Moritz Sobernheim|de}}), Khumarawayh was named as his father's deputy in Egypt and heir-apparent. This position was confirmed by Ibn Tulun at the request of his generals shortly before his death on 10 May 884. With the backing of the Tulunid regime's elites, Khumarawayh's succession was smooth; Abbas was forced to acknowledge Khumarawayh, but was assassinated shortly after.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}} Khumarawayh's accession was an important step in the gradual dissolution of the Abbasid Caliphate: as [[Thierry Bianquis]] explains, \"this was the first time in Abbasid history with regard to the government of so large and rich a territory, that a ''[[wali|w\u0101li]]'', whose legitimacy derived from the caliph who had designated him, was succeeded openly by an ''[[emir|am\u012br]]'' who claimed his legitimacy by inheritance\".{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=89\u201390, 104}}\n\nIn his last months, Ibn Tulun had sought to effect a reconciliation with al-Muwaffaq on the basis of the recognition of his authority over Egypt and Syria, but his death interrupted the negotiations. As Khumarawayh was young and untested, one of Ibn Tulun's senior generals, [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wasiti]], encouraged the Abbasids to attack and recover control of the Tulunid territories.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}} The generals [[Ishaq ibn Kundaj]] and [[Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj|Ibn Abi'l-Saj]] attacked the Tulunid domains in Syria. [[Damascus]] fell when its governor defected, but their initial gains were rapidly reversed. In the spring of 885, al-Muwaffaq's son Abu'l-Abbas (the future [[al-Mu'tadid]]) was sent to take charge of the invasion. He soon succeeded in defeating the Tulunids and forcing them to retreat to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], but after a quarrel with Ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abi'l-Saj, the latter abandoned the campaign and withdrew their forces. At the [[Battle of Tawahin]] on 6 April, Khumarawayh confronted Abu'l-Abbas in person. The Abbasid prince was initially victorious, forcing Khumarawayh to flee, but was in turn defeated by the Tulunid general Sa'd al-Aysar and fled the battlefield, while much of his army was taken prisoner.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=104\u2013105}} Al-Aysar then tried to rebel in Damascus, but Khumarawayh swiftly suppressed his revolt and is said to have killed the rebel with his own hands.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} \n\nKhumarawayh continued to pursue a rapprochement with the Abbasid court: he treated the prisoners of war from Tawahin with exceptional clemency, giving them the choice of either staying in Egypt under his own service or returning to Iraq without ransom. This policy eventually led to the conclusion of an agreement in December 886, whereby Khumarawayh was recognized as governor over Egypt and Syria, with the right to be succeeded by his offspring, for a period of 30 years, in exchange for an unspecified annual [[tribute]].{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}} Between 886 and 890, Khumarawayh went on to defeat Ibn Khundaj and receive the submission of the governor of the Jazira, Ibn Abi'l-Saj. At the same time, the governor of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], [[Yazaman al-Khadim]], accepted Tulunid suzerainty, bringing the [[Cilicia]]n ''Thugh\u016br'' under Tulunid control as well.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}}\n\n[[File:Tulunids 893.svg|thumb|right|280px|Map of the Tulunid domains towards the end of Khumarawayh's reign]]\nThe accession of al-Mu'tadid in 892 brought a warming of relations with the Baghdad court. Recognizing that he could not defeat the Tulunids, the new Caliph instead opted to conciliate them: in spring 893, al-Mu'tadid reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous governor over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 [[gold dinar|dinars]] and further 200,000 dinars in arrears, as well as the return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of [[Diyar Rabi'a]] and [[Diyar Mudar]]. In addition, the prestigious ''[[tiraz|\u1e6dir\u0101z]]'' factories in [[Alexandria]] and [[Fustat]], which produced government banners and [[robes of honour]], remained under caliphal control.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|pp=105\u2013106}} In order to seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, [[Qatr al-Nada]] as bride to one of the Caliph's sons, but al-Mu'tadid chose to marry her himself. Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which contrasted starkly with the impoverished caliphal court. The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry, a \"wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history\" (Bianquis), and the lavish marriage ceremonies remained the stuff of folk legends in Egypt until well into the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Egypt Eyalet|period]].{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}}{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=106}}\n\n===Domestic policies===\nThe extravagant wedding shows Khumarawayh's famous frivolity with money\u2014indeed it has been suggested that the whole affair was, in the words of the historian {{ill|Ulrich Haarmann|de}}, \"a calculated device on the part of the caliph to wreck the finances of his dangerously wealthy and powerful vassal\". Eager to display his wealth, the Tulunid ruler also built numerous palaces for himself and his favourites, and engaged in famous displays of royal extravagance, such as a [[mercury (element)|quicksilver]]-filled basin in which he was rocked to sleep on top of air-filled cushions, or the blue-eyed lion he kept as a pet at his court. In addition, according to the sources, Khumarawayh never rode the same horse twice.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}} He was nevertheless also a generous patron of the arts, of scholars and of poets. One of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was the grammarian Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Muslim, who was also tutor to his sons, while al-Qasim ibn Yahya al-Maryami wrote [[panegyric]]s in his honour.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} All of this came at a heavy price, however; by the time of his death, the Tulunid treasury (which reportedly had contained ten million gold dinars at the time of his accession{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=104}}) was empty, and the dinar had lost two-thirds of its value. His extravagance brought criticism from religious scholars and from contemporary and later historians alike.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}\n\nDomestically, his reign was one of \"luxury and decay\" ([[Hugh N. Kennedy]]), but also a time of relative tranquillity in Egypt as well as in Syria, a rather unusual occurrence for the period.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}} Khumarawayh's main power base was the powerful army built by his father, much in the model of the Abbasids themselves after the establishment of a professional military under Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}} The Tulunid army was mostly composed of Turkish, [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] (''[[R\u016bm]]''), and [[black African]] (''Sud\u0101n'') ''ghilm\u0101n'', as well as a few Byzantine mercenaries. To them Khumarawayh added a special regiment, the ''al-mukht\u0101ra'' (\"the elect, picked\"), mostly drawn from the [[Bedouins]] of the eastern [[Nile Delta]], an area of great importance as it controlled the route connecting Syria and Egypt. A thousand-strong unit made up of black Africans seems to have been a distinct sub-unit of the ''al-mukht\u0101ra''.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} Despite the undoubted military talent and personal bravery he displayed after Tawahin, Khumarawayh never enjoyed Ibn Tulun's authority over the army. This led to a policy of buying their loyalty with sumptuous [[donative]]s, which further drained the treasury.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} As Hugh N. Kennedy comments, financial difficulties seem to have been inherent in the Abbasid model the Tulunids emulated, resulting from the \"inability of the state to fund a large, mostly inactive army on a permanent basis\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}} In an attempt to find the necessary funds, the fiscal administration was entrusted to [[Ali ibn Ahmad al-Madhara'i]], marking the final rise of the [[al-Madhara'i]] family to a dominant position in the fiscal and government apparatus of Egypt for the next half-century.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}}\n\n===Death and succession===\nKhumarawayh was killed on 18 January 896 by one of his servants,{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} who had been conducting an affair with Khumarawayh's favourite wife. When Khumarawayh learned of this, the servant feared for his life, and organized a conspiracy which claimed the Tulunid ruler's life.{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}} After Khumarawayh's death, the Tulunid state entered a period of instability under his under-age heirs, with his son [[Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh]] being deposed and killed in November, in favour of his younger brother [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]] ({{reign|896|904}}). Al-Mu'tadid swiftly took advantage of this: in 897 he extended his control over the border provinces of the ''Thugh\u016br''; forced the Tulunids to hand back all of Syria north of [[Homs]]; and increased the annual tribute to 450,000 dinars in exchange for caliphal recognition of Harun.{{sfn|Bonner|2010|p=336}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=181}} Over the next few years, the Tulunid domains continued to experience domestic turmoil coupled with an escalation of [[Qarmatian]] attacks, resulting in the defection of many Tulunid followers to the resurgent Caliphate.{{sfn|Bonner|2010|p=336}} Finally, in 904\u2013905 al-Mu'tadid's successor [[al-Muktafi]] invaded Egypt and reincorporated the country fully into the Abbasid empire.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=184\u2013185}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | chapter = Autonomous Egypt from Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn to K\u0101f\u016br, 868\u2013969 | first = Thierry | last = Bianquis | authorlink = Thierry Bianquis | title = Cambridge History of Egypt, Volume One: Islamic Egypt, 640\u20131517 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | editor-last = Petry | editor-first = Carl F. | location = Cambridge | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-521-47137-0 | pages = 86\u2013119 | chapterurl = {{Gbook|y3FtXpB_tqMC|page=86|plainurl=y}} | ref=harv}}\n* {{New Cambridge History of Islam|volume=1|chapter=The Waning of Empire, 861\u2013945|pages=305\u2013359|first=Michael|last=Bonner|authorlink=Michael Bonner}}\n* {{EI2 | volume=5 | title = K\u0332h\u0332um\u0101rawayh | first = Ulrich | last = Haarmann | pages = 49\u201350 | url = http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/khumarawayh-SIM_4328}}\n* {{The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates | edition = Second}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | title = Khum\u0101rawaih | first = Moritz | last = Sobernheim | encyclopedia = E.J.

In addition, according to the sources, Khumarawayh never rode the same horse twice.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}} He was nevertheless also a generous patron of the arts, of scholars and of poets. One of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was the grammarian Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Muslim, who was also tutor to his sons, while al-Qasim ibn Yahya al-Maryami wrote [[panegyric]]s in his honour.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} All of this came at a heavy price, however; by the time of his death, the Tulunid treasury (which reportedly had contained ten million gold dinars at the time of his accession{{sfn|Bianquis|1998|p=104}}) was empty, and the dinar had lost two-thirds of its value. His extravagance brought criticism from religious scholars and from contemporary and later historians alike.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}\n\nDomestically, his reign was one of \"luxury and decay\" ([[Hugh N. Kennedy]]), but also a time of relative tranquillity in Egypt as well as in Syria, a rather unusual occurrence for the period.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}} Khumarawayh's main power base was the powerful army built by his father, much in the model of the Abbasids themselves after the establishment of a professional military under Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}} The Tulunid army was mostly composed of Turkish, [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] (''[[R\u016bm]]''), and [[black African]] (''Sud\u0101n'') ''ghilm\u0101n'', as well as a few Byzantine mercenaries. To them Khumarawayh added a special regiment, the ''al-mukht\u0101ra'' (\"the elect, picked\"), mostly drawn from the [[Bedouins]] of the eastern [[Nile Delta]], an area of great importance as it controlled the route connecting Syria and Egypt. A thousand-strong unit made up of black Africans seems to have been a distinct sub-unit of the ''al-mukht\u0101ra''.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} Despite the undoubted military talent and personal bravery he displayed after Tawahin, Khumarawayh never enjoyed Ibn Tulun's authority over the army. This led to a policy of buying their loyalty with sumptuous [[donative]]s, which further drained the treasury.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} As Hugh N. Kennedy comments, financial difficulties seem to have been inherent in the Abbasid model the Tulunids emulated, resulting from the \"inability of the state to fund a large, mostly inactive army on a permanent basis\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}} In an attempt to find the necessary funds, the fiscal administration was entrusted to [[Ali ibn Ahmad al-Madhara'i]], marking the final rise of the [[al-Madhara'i]] family to a dominant position in the fiscal and government apparatus of Egypt for the next half-century.{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=310}}\n\n===Death and succession===\nKhumarawayh was killed on 18 January 896 by one of his servants,{{sfn|Haarmann|1986|p=49}} who had been conducting an affair with Khumarawayh's favourite wife. When Khumarawayh learned of this, the servant feared for his life, and organized a conspiracy which claimed the Tulunid ruler's life.{{sfn|Sobernheim|1987|p=973}} After Khumarawayh's death, the Tulunid state entered a period of instability under his under-age heirs, with his son [[Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh]] being deposed and killed in November, in favour of his younger brother [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]] ({{reign|896|904}}). Al-Mu'tadid swiftly took advantage of this: in 897 he extended his control over the border provinces of the ''Thugh\u016br''; forced the Tulunids to hand back all of Syria north of [[Homs]]; and increased the annual tribute to 450,000 dinars in exchange for caliphal recognition of Harun.{{sfn|Bonner|2010|p=336}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=181}} Over the next few years, the Tulunid domains continued to experience domestic turmoil coupled with an escalation of [[Qarmatian]] attacks, resulting in the defection of many Tulunid followers to the resurgent Caliphate.{{sfn|Bonner|2010|p=336}} Finally, in 904\u2013905 al-Mu'tadid's successor [[al-Muktafi]] invaded Egypt and reincorporated the country fully into the Abbasid empire.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=184\u2013185}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | chapter = Autonomous Egypt from Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn to K\u0101f\u016br, 868\u2013969 | first = Thierry | last = Bianquis | authorlink = Thierry Bianquis | title = Cambridge History of Egypt, Volume One: Islamic Egypt, 640\u20131517 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | editor-last = Petry | editor-first = Carl F. | location = Cambridge | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-521-47137-0 | pages = 86\u2013119 | chapterurl = {{Gbook|y3FtXpB_tqMC|page=86|plainurl=y}} | ref=harv}}\n* {{New Cambridge History of Islam|volume=1|chapter=The Waning of Empire, 861\u2013945|pages=305\u2013359|first=Michael|last=Bonner|authorlink=Michael Bonner}}\n* {{EI2 | volume=5 | title = K\u0332h\u0332um\u0101rawayh | first = Ulrich | last = Haarmann | pages = 49\u201350 | url = http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/khumarawayh-SIM_4328}}\n* {{The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates | edition = Second}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | title = Khum\u0101rawaih | first = Moritz | last = Sobernheim | encyclopedia = E.J.

The thirteen structures comprise more than 10,500 tons of stone and, in total, the walls measure approximately {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} in length.  The structures that lie furthest apart are separated by a distance of {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|round=0.5|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nRogers' \"Rhythms of Life\" project is the largest contemporary land-art undertaking in the world, forming a chain of 51 stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe: 18 sites in disparate exotic locations from below sea level and up to altitudes of {{convert|4300|m|ft}}.  Up to three geoglyphs, ranging in size up to {{convert|40000|m2|ft2}}, are located at each site. To date the project has involved over 7,500 people in 16 countries across seven continents.\n\nMonumental geoglyphs have been constructed since 1998, forming a chain of 51 drawings on the earth visible from space. Outside Melbourne, in [[Geelong]], a \"Rhythms of Life\" site was commissioned in association with the 2006 Commonwealth Games.<ref name=\"one\">Article, The Australian: Rhythms of Life to help improve Games vibes, Katrina Strickland, 16 November 2005.</ref> In China the \"Rhythms of Life\" walls stretch {{convert|2.1|km|mi}}.\n\nIn the book \"Andrew Rogers Geoglyphs Rhythms of Life\", author Eleanor Heartney, New York-based, award-winning art writer and independent art critic, describes Rogers' land art undertaking:<ref name=\"two\">Essay: \"Rhythms of Life\", \"Andrew Rogers Geoglyphs Rhythms of Life\", Author, Eleanor Heartney. Published by Edizioni Charta Milano, 2009.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The geographic and historic sweep of the works constructed as part of the Rhythms of Life project is unprecedented in its scale and ambition. Taken together, the geoglyphs have been erected in every kind of climate, and have responded to geographical environments as distinct as Nepal\u2019s Himalayan Mountains, China\u2019s Gobi Desert, the volcanic mountains of Iceland and the harsh Israeli desert.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Hannes Sigur\u00f0sson (art historian)|Hannes Sigurdsson]], Director of the [[Akureyri Art Museum]] in Iceland:<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The Rhythms of Life project by Australian artist Andrew Rogers is the largest contemporary land-art project in the world, forming a chain of stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe. Monumental geoglyphs have been constructed in ten countries to date: Israel, Chile, Bolivia, Sri Lanka, Australia, Iceland, China, India, Turkey and Nepal. Future locations will include the United States, United Kingdom, Eastern Europe and Africa. By completion, the project will have involved over 5,000 people on six continents. The Rhythms of Life sculptures are optimistic metaphors for the eternal cycle of life and regeneration, expressive and suggestive of human striving and introspection. The geoglyphs embrace a wide cultural vision that links memory and various symbols derived from ancient rock carvings, paintings and legends in each region; they punctuate time and extend history into the distant future while delving into the depths of our heritage in pursuit of the spiritual.

He is a leading contemporary artist. \nRogers is the creator of the world's largest contemporary land art undertaking.  Titled \"Rhythms of Life,\" the project commenced in 1998 and at present comprises 51 massive stone structures across 16 countries on seven continents and has involved over 7,500 people\n\n==Rhythms of Life land art project==\n[[File:You Yangs Bunjil geoglyph.JPG|thumb|Bunjil geoglyph at the [[You Yangs]], [[Lara, Australia]], by Andrew Rogers. The creature has a wing span of 100 metres and approximately 1500 tons of rock was used to construct it.]]\n\nThe title of the project, the \"Rhythms of Life\" is derived from Rogers' early bronze sculptures.\n\nOf particular note is a site in Cappadocia, Turkey, where between 2007 and 2011 Rogers completed the \"Time and Space\" geoglyph park. The thirteen structures comprise more than 10,500 tons of stone and, in total, the walls measure approximately {{convert|4|mi|km}} in length.  The structures that lie furthest apart are separated by a distance of {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}.\n\nRogers' \"Rhythms of Life\" project is the largest contemporary land-art undertaking in the world, forming a chain of 51 stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe: 18 sites in disparate exotic locations from below sea level and up to altitudes of {{convert|4300|m|ft}}.  Up to three geoglyphs, ranging in size up to {{convert|40000|m2|ft2}}, are located at each site. To date the project has involved over 7,500 people in 16 countries across seven continents.\n\nMonumental geoglyphs have been constructed since 1998, forming a chain of 51 drawings on the earth visible from space. Outside Melbourne, in [[Geelong]], a \"Rhythms of Life\" site was commissioned in association with the 2006 Commonwealth Games.<ref name=\"one\">Article, The Australian: Rhythms of Life to help improve Games vibes, Katrina Strickland, 16 November 2005.</ref> In China the \"Rhythms of Life\" walls stretch {{convert|2.1|km|mi}}.\n\nIn the book \"Andrew Rogers Geoglyphs Rhythms of Life\", author Eleanor Heartney, New York-based, award-winning art writer and independent art critic, describes Rogers' land art undertaking:<ref name=\"two\">Essay: \"Rhythms of Life\", \"Andrew Rogers Geoglyphs Rhythms of Life\", Author, Eleanor Heartney. Published by Edizioni Charta Milano, 2009.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The geographic and historic sweep of the works constructed as part of the Rhythms of Life project is unprecedented in its scale and ambition. Taken together, the geoglyphs have been erected in every kind of climate, and have responded to geographical environments as distinct as Nepal\u2019s Himalayan Mountains, China\u2019s Gobi Desert, the volcanic mountains of Iceland and the harsh Israeli desert.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Hannes Sigur\u00f0sson (art historian)|Hannes Sigurdsson]], Director of the [[Akureyri Art Museum]] in Iceland:<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The Rhythms of Life project by Australian artist Andrew Rogers is the largest contemporary land-art project in the world, forming a chain of stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe. Monumental geoglyphs have been constructed in ten countries to date: Israel, Chile, Bolivia, Sri Lanka, Australia, Iceland, China, India, Turkey and Nepal. Future locations will include the United States, United Kingdom, Eastern Europe and Africa. By completion, the project will have involved over 5,000 people on six continents. The Rhythms of Life sculptures are optimistic metaphors for the eternal cycle of life and regeneration, expressive and suggestive of human striving and introspection. The geoglyphs embrace a wide cultural vision that links memory and various symbols derived from ancient rock carvings, paintings and legends in each region; they punctuate time and extend history into the distant future while delving into the depths of our heritage in pursuit of the spiritual. The exhibition at the Akureyri Art Museum in Iceland is the first general survey of the project\".\n</blockquote>\n\nLilly Wei, an independent curator based in New York City, writes:<ref name=\"three\">Catalogue: Rhythms of Life 1-V11 {{ISBN|978-9979-9632-7-1}}, 2007.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Rogers believes that accelerating environmental changes with their potentially catastrophic consequences are much less avoidable these days and therefore much more heeded.
