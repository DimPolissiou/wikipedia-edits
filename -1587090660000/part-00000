By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction,\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and [[Scandinavia]], they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to [[urbanization]] and decreased [[infant mortality]] rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural [[elite]]s. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility. Member states of the [[European Economic Community]] saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the [[Developed country|industrialized world]] found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

This problem is especially acute in [[Eastern Europe]], whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been born to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of [[secularism]]) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387\u201394|jstor=27896504}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018).

The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the [[Great Recession]] of 2007\u20138, with the [[youth unemployment]] rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them.

''Pictured'': The [[Redwood National and State Parks]], California.]]\nEconomist Tim Wojan and his colleagues at the Economic Research Service of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] analyzed 11,000 businesses using data collected in 2014 and classified them into three groups: substantive innovators, nominal innovators, and non-innovators. They found that 20% of the establishments hailed from rural areas compared to 30% from urban areas. In addition, large innovative firms were more likely to be found in rural areas while small and medium firms tended to come from the metropolitan areas. This is because large patent-intensive manufacturing firms \u2013 such as those manufacturing chemicals, electronic components, automotive parts, or medical equipment \u2013 were generally based in rural areas while those that provide services tend to cluster in the cities.

However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-high-price-of-a-free-college-education-in-sweden/276428/|title=The High Price of a Free College Education in Sweden|last=Philips|first=Matt|date=May 31, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Global}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems. This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, \"Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.\" Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of \u20ac8,500 as of 2005. Opponents believed fees would make it more difficult for people to study and graduate on time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-court-lifts-ban-on-student-fees/a-1468971|title=German Court Lifts Ban on Student Fees|last=|first=|date=January 26, 2005|work=DW|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Germany}}</ref> Germany also suffered from a brain drain, as many bright researchers moved abroad while relatively few international students were interested in coming to Germany.

A nominal tuition fee of \u00a31,000 was introduced in autumn 1998. Because not all parents would be able to pay all the fees in one go, monthly payment options, loans, and grants were made available. Some were concerned that making people pay for higher education may deter applicants. This turned out not to be the case. The number of applications fell by only 2.9% in 1998, and mainly due to mature students rather than 18-year-olds.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/student-choices-first-timers-face-the-test-with-tuition-fees-1153845.html|title=Student choices: First timers face the test with tuition fees|last=Hodges|first=Lucy|date=April 2, 1998|work=The Independent|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Culture}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, \u00a39,000 worth of student fees were introduced. Despite this, the number of people interested in pursuing higher education grew at a faster rate than the UK population. In 2017, almost half of Britons have received higher education by the age of 30. Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons having a university degree in 1999, though he missed the 2010 deadline. Demand for higher education in the United Kingdom remains strong, driven by the need for high-skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There is, however, a widening gender gap. As of 2017, women were more likely to attend or have attended university than men, 55% to 43%, a 12% difference.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/28/almost-half-of-all-young-people-in-england-go-on-to-higher-education|title=Almost half of all young people in England go on to higher education|last=Adams|first=Richard|date=September 28, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Higher Education}}</ref>\n\nIn Australia, university tuition fees were introduced in 1989. Regardless, the number of applicants has risen considerably. By the 1990s, students and their families were expected to pay 37% of the cost, up from a quarter in the late 1980s. The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies. Under the new funding scheme, the Government of Australia also capped the number of people eligible for higher education, enabling schools to recruits more well-financed (though not necessarily bright) students.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 53% of American Millennials attended or were enrolled in university in 2002.

Data collected by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], (UCLA) in 2011 showed that although these students typically came in with excellent high school GPAs and SAT scores, among science and engineering students, including pre-medical students, 60% changed their majors or failed to graduate, twice the attrition rate of all other majors combined. Despite their initial interest in secondary school, many university students find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of a rigorous STEM education. Some are mathematically unskilled, while others are simply lazy. The [[National Science Board]] raised the alarm all the way back in the mid-1980s that students often forget why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Many bright students had an easy time in high school and failed to develop good study habits. In contrast, Chinese, Indian, and Singaporean students are exposed to mathematics and science at a high level from a young age. Moreover, given two students who are equally prepared, the one who goes to a more prestigious university is less likely to graduate with a STEM degree than the one who attends a less difficult school. Competition can defeat even the top students. Meanwhile, grade inflation is a real phenomenon in the humanities, giving students an attractive alternative if their STEM ambitions prove too difficult to achieve. Whereas STEM classes build on top of each other \u2013 one has to master the subject matter before moving to the next course \u2013 and have black and white answers, this is not the case in the humanities, where things are a lot less clear-cut.<ref name=\":56\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html|title=Why Science Majors Change Their Minds (It's Just So Darn Hard)|last=Drew|first=Christopher|date=November 4, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Education Life}}</ref>\n\n== Historical knowledge ==\nA February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S. adults) surveyed did not know what [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] was,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/12/two-thirds-of-millennials-dont-know-what-auschwitz-is-according-to-study-of-fading-holocaust-knowledge/?noredirect=on|title=Holocaust study: Two-thirds of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is|date=April 12, 2018|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2&nbsp;million [[Jews]] or fewer were killed during [[the Holocaust]], and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/holocaust-study-millennials/|title=4 in 10 millennials don't know 6 million Jews were killed in Holocaust, study shows|date=12 April 2018|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the [[Baltic states]], which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single [[List of Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] or ghetto in [[German-occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claimscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Holocaust-Knowledge-Awareness-Study_Executive-Summary-2018.pdf|title=Holocaust Knowledge and Awareness Study|website=www.claimscon.org|publisher=Schoen Consulting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.claimscon.org/study|title=New Survey by Claims Conference Finds Significant Lack of Holocaust Knowledge in the United States|date=2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qrUxE|archivedate=12 April 2018|url-status=live|publisher=Claims Conference}}</ref> However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/holocaust-education.html|title=Holocaust Is Fading From Memory, Survey Finds|last1=Astor|first1=Maggie|date=12 April 2018|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://archive.is/uaSVa|archivedate=18 April 2018|url-status=live}}{{pb}}</ref>\n\nThe [[YouGov]] survey found that 42% of American millennials have never heard of [[Mao Zedong]], who ruled [[China]] from 1949 to 1976 and was responsible for the deaths of 20\u201345&nbsp;million people; another 40% are unfamiliar with [[Che Guevara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poll-millennials-desperately-need-to-bone-up-on-the-history-of-communism-2016-10-17|title=Poll: Millennials desperately need to bone up on the history of communism|date=21 October 2016|work=MarketWatch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/young-americans-seen-less-opposed-to-socialist-ideas/3562681.html|title=Poll Finds Young Americans More Open to Socialist Ideas|date=23 October 2016|work=VOA News}}</ref>\n\n== Political views and participation ==\n\n=== Canadian millennials ===\nHistorically, political participation among young Canadian voters has been low, no higher than 40%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2a484194-edde-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901|title=Young Canadians fall out of love with Justin Trudeau|last=Kirby|first=Jason|date=October 14, 2019|work=The Financial Times|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> However, the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]] was an exception, when 57% of the people aged 18 to 34 voted.

Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified. While this new period of political evolution was taking place, a new cohort of voters \u2013 Millennials \u2013 entered the scene and these people tend to think differently about the old issues than their elders. Moreover, they are less inclined than previous generations to identify (strongly) with a particular political party.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 6: De-alignment}}</ref>\n\nBut scholars such as [[Ronald Inglehart]] traced the roots of this new 'culture conflict' all the way back to the 1960s, which witnessed the emergence of the Baby Boomers, who were generally university-educated middle-class voters. Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century \u2013 the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation \u2013 who had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to 'post-materialist' values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of 'global citizenship'. Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various [[Media activism|political campaigns on social media]]. Inglehart called this the \"Silent Revolution.\" But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the \"Silent Counter-Revolution.\"<ref name=\":30\" /> Education plays a role in this 'culture conflict' as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset. Degree holders tend to favor tolerance, individual rights and group identities whereas non-degree holders lean towards conformity, and maintaining order, customs, and traditions.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nBy analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be replaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national-populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, [[Marine Le Pen]] and her [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 Presidential election than any other candidates. In Italy, [[Matteo Salvini]] and his [[Lega Nord|League]] have a base of support with virtually no generational gap. In Austria, more than one in two men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] in 2016. The [[Alternative for Germany]]'s strongest support came not from senior citizens but voters between 25 and 50 years of age.

In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers. Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors.

Immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth in Europe. Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. Religion can indeed grow even in otherwise secular societies, and such religious demographic changes will bring about social and political ramifications later in the century.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\nA 2017 study conducted by the Pew Research Center on 70 countries showed that between 2010 and 2015, among people aged 15 to 29, the irreligious grew by 23%, Muslims 0.3%, while Christians lost 0.7% due to religious conversion or switching.

Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and [[Scandinavia]], they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to [[urbanization]] and decreased [[infant mortality]] rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural [[elite]]s. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility. Member states of the [[European Economic Community]] saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the [[Developed country|industrialized world]] found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

This problem is especially acute in [[Eastern Europe]], whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been born to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of [[secularism]]) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387\u201394|jstor=27896504}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018). Researches by the demographers and political scientists [[Eric Kaufmann]], [[Roger Eatwell]], and [[Matthew Goodwin]] suggest that such a fast ethno-demographic change is one of the key reasons behind public backlash in the form of nationalist [[populism]] across the rich liberal democracies, an example of which is the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] (Brexit).<ref name=\":20\" />\n\nItaly is a country where the problem of an aging population is especially acute. The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the [[Great Recession]] of 2007\u20138, with the [[youth unemployment]] rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-italy-rising-anxiety-over-falling-birth-rates|title=In Italy, rising anxiety over falling birth rates|last=Livesay|first=Christopher|date=November 25, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGreece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere in the wake of the Great Recession.

In the 2010s, among the residents of Australia, 5% were born in the United Kingdom, 2.5% from China, 2.2% from India, and 1.1% from the Philippines. 84% of new arrivals in the fiscal year of 2016 were below 40 years of age, compared to 54% of those already in the country. Like other immigrant-friendly countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Australia's working-age population is expected to grow till about 2025.

They found that 20% of the establishments hailed from rural areas compared to 30% from urban areas. In addition, large innovative firms were more likely to be found in rural areas while small and medium firms tended to come from the metropolitan areas. This is because large patent-intensive manufacturing firms \u2013 such as those manufacturing chemicals, electronic components, automotive parts, or medical equipment \u2013 were generally based in rural areas while those that provide services tend to cluster in the cities. Nevertheless, rural creative centers tend to be relatively close to large urban centers.

However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008\u20139 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-high-price-of-a-free-college-education-in-sweden/276428/|title=The High Price of a Free College Education in Sweden|last=Philips|first=Matt|date=May 31, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Global}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems. This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, \"Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.\" Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of \u20ac8,500 as of 2005.

A nominal tuition fee of \u00a31,000 was introduced in autumn 1998. Because not all parents would be able to pay all the fees in one go, monthly payment options, loans, and grants were made available. Some were concerned that making people pay for higher education may deter applicants. This turned out not to be the case.

Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons having a university degree in 1999, though he missed the 2010 deadline. Demand for higher education in the United Kingdom remains strong, driven by the need for high-skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There is, however, a widening gender gap.

The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies.

Data collected by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], (UCLA) in 2011 showed that although these students typically came in with excellent high school GPAs and SAT scores, among science and engineering students, including pre-medical students, 60% changed their majors or failed to graduate, twice the attrition rate of all other majors combined. Despite their initial interest in secondary school, many university students find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of a rigorous STEM education. Some are mathematically unskilled, while others are simply lazy. The [[National Science Board]] raised the alarm all the way back in the mid-1980s that students often forget why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Many bright students had an easy time in high school and failed to develop good study habits. In contrast, Chinese, Indian, and Singaporean students are exposed to mathematics and science at a high level from a young age. Moreover, given two students who are equally prepared, the one who goes to a more prestigious university is less likely to graduate with a STEM degree than the one who attends a less difficult school. Competition can defeat even the top students. Meanwhile, grade inflation is a real phenomenon in the humanities, giving students an attractive alternative if their STEM ambitions prove too difficult to achieve. Whereas STEM classes build on top of each other \u2013 one has to master the subject matter before moving to the next course \u2013 and have black and white answers, this is not the case in the humanities, where things are a lot less clear-cut.<ref name=\":56\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html|title=Why Science Majors Change Their Minds (It's Just So Darn Hard)|last=Drew|first=Christopher|date=November 4, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Education Life}}</ref>\n\n== Historical knowledge ==\nA February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S. adults) surveyed did not know what [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] was,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/12/two-thirds-of-millennials-dont-know-what-auschwitz-is-according-to-study-of-fading-holocaust-knowledge/?noredirect=on|title=Holocaust study: Two-thirds of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is|date=April 12, 2018|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2&nbsp;million [[Jews]] or fewer were killed during [[the Holocaust]], and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/holocaust-study-millennials/|title=4 in 10 millennials don't know 6 million Jews were killed in Holocaust, study shows|date=12 April 2018|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the [[Baltic states]], which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single [[List of Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] or ghetto in [[German-occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claimscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Holocaust-Knowledge-Awareness-Study_Executive-Summary-2018.pdf|title=Holocaust Knowledge and Awareness Study|website=www.claimscon.org|publisher=Schoen Consulting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.claimscon.org/study|title=New Survey by Claims Conference Finds Significant Lack of Holocaust Knowledge in the United States|date=2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qrUxE|archivedate=12 April 2018|url-status=live|publisher=Claims Conference}}</ref> However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/holocaust-education.html|title=Holocaust Is Fading From Memory, Survey Finds|last1=Astor|first1=Maggie|date=12 April 2018|work=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://archive.is/uaSVa|archivedate=18 April 2018|url-status=live}}{{pb}}</ref>\n\nThe [[YouGov]] survey found that 42% of American millennials have never heard of [[Mao Zedong]], who ruled [[China]] from 1949 to 1976 and was responsible for the deaths of 20\u201345&nbsp;million people; another 40% are unfamiliar with [[Che Guevara]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poll-millennials-desperately-need-to-bone-up-on-the-history-of-communism-2016-10-17|title=Poll: Millennials desperately need to bone up on the history of communism|date=21 October 2016|work=MarketWatch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/young-americans-seen-less-opposed-to-socialist-ideas/3562681.html|title=Poll Finds Young Americans More Open to Socialist Ideas|date=23 October 2016|work=VOA News}}</ref>\n\n== Political views and participation ==\n\n=== Canadian millennials ===\nHistorically, political participation among young Canadian voters has been low, no higher than 40%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2a484194-edde-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901|title=Young Canadians fall out of love with Justin Trudeau|last=Kirby|first=Jason|date=October 14, 2019|work=The Financial Times|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> However, the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]] was an exception, when 57% of the people aged 18 to 34 voted.

Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified. While this new period of political evolution was taking place, a new cohort of voters \u2013 Millennials \u2013 entered the scene and these people tend to think differently about the old issues than their elders. Moreover, they are less inclined than previous generations to identify (strongly) with a particular political party.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|title=National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 6: De-alignment}}</ref>\n\nBut scholars such as [[Ronald Inglehart]] traced the roots of this new 'culture conflict' all the way back to the 1960s, which witnessed the emergence of the Baby Boomers, who were generally university-educated middle-class voters. Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century \u2013 the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation \u2013 who had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to 'post-materialist' values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of 'global citizenship'. Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various [[Media activism|political campaigns on social media]]. Inglehart called this the \"Silent Revolution.\" But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the \"Silent Counter-Revolution.\"<ref name=\":30\" /> Education plays a role in this 'culture conflict' as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset. Degree holders tend to favor tolerance, individual rights and group identities whereas non-degree holders lean towards conformity, and maintaining order, customs, and traditions.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nBy analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be replaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, [[Marine Le Pen]] and her [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 Presidential election than any other candidates. In Italy, [[Matteo Salvini]] and his [[Lega Nord|League]] have a base of support with virtually no generational gap.

They favored individual liberty, small government, low taxes, limited welfare programs, and personal responsibility. While support for increased welfare programs for the poor at the cost of potentially higher taxes has declined steadily since the 1980s among all living demographic cohorts in the U.K., Generation Y disapproved of such spending schemes the most, according to data from Ipsos MORI and the [[British Social Attitudes Survey]]. On the other hand, they had a more relaxed attitude towards alcohol consumption, [[euthanasia]], [[same-sex marriage]] and the [[legalization of drugs]]. They disliked immigration, though less than their elders. They were more likely then their elders to support [[Fiscal conservatism|public debt reduction]]. They cared about the environment, but not at the expense of economic prosperity, and they supported privatizing utilities. In other words, they were [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] or libertarians.

But when various factors \u2013 including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location \u2013 were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be. In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers. Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors. An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/03/millennial-car-ownership-driving-behavior-vehicle-data/585667/|title=Despite 'Car-Free' Hype, Millennials Drive a Lot|last=Bliss|first=Laura|date=March 27, 2019|work=CityLab|access-date=November 3, 2019|department=Transportation}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, young people are more likely to ride [[Public transportation in the United States|public transit]].

The official ''Star Trek'' website defines canon as comprising the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series|The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', as well as the [[Star Trek (film series)|films in the franchise]].<ref name=\"Canon database\">{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/sitemap|date=2017-03-21|title=Canon info database}}</ref>\n\n==Television series==\nAs a rule, all ''Star Trek'' television series that aired on broadcast TV under the original license are considered part of the canon, and it is therefore unclear if paywalled streaming productions are also canon due to inaccessibility by the general TV audience and operating under different licensees.  <ref name=\"StarTrek.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/help/faqs/faq/676.html|date=2003-07-10|title=What is considered Star Trek \"canon\"?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628174255/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/help/faqs/faq/676.html|archivedate=2010-06-28|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref>\n\nThis policy does not make clear which version of the series is the canonical one. For example, the [[Star Trek: The Original Series#Remastered edition|remastered ''TOS'' episodes]] released in 2006 present several visual differences from the episodes originally aired.<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-08-31|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/23775.html|title=Remastering Star Trek: TOS FX, Music Enhanced|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123133456/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/23775.html|archivedate=2007-01-23|accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===Roddenberry's impact===\n[[Gene Roddenberry]] was something of a [[Revisionism (fictional)|revisionist]] when it came to canonicity. People who worked with Roddenberry remember that he used to handle canonicity not on a series-by-series basis nor an episode-by-episode basis, but point by point. If he changed his mind on something, or if a fact in one episode contradicted what he considered to be a more important fact in another episode, he had no problem declaring that specific point not canonical.\n\n{{quote|See, people can easily catch us, and say \"well, wait a minute, in '[[Balance of Terror]]', they knew that the [[Romulan]]s had a [[cloaking device]], and then in '[[The Enterprise Incident]]', they don't know anything about cloaking devices, but they're gonna steal this one because it's obviously just been developed, so how the hell do you explain that?\" We can't. There are some things we just can't explain, especially when it comes from the third season. So, yes, third season is canon [''sic''] up to the point of contradiction, or where it's just so bad... you know, we kind of cringe when people ask us, \"well, what happened in '[[Plato's Stepchildren]]', and '[[And the Children Shall Lead]]', and '[[Spock's Brain]]', and so on\u2014it's like, please, he wasn't even producing it at that point. But, generally, [the canon is] the original series, not really the animated, the first movie to a certain extent, the rest of the films in certain aspects but not in all... I know that it's very difficult to understand. It literally is point by point. I sometimes do not know how he's going to answer a question when I go into his office, I really do not always know, and\u2014and I know it better probably than anybody, what it is that Gene likes and doesn't like.<ref name=\"ArnoldvLynch\">Richard Arnold, ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' research consultant and ''Star Trek'' archivist, 1991 interview with Tim Lynch.</ref>\u2014 Richard Arnold, 1991}}\n\n{{quote|Another thing that makes canon a little confusing. Gene R. himself had a habit of decanonizing things. He didn't like the way the animated series turned out, so he proclaimed that it was not canon. He also didn't like a lot of the movies. So he didn't much consider them canon either. And \u2013 okay, I'm really going to scare you with this one \u2013 after he got ''TNG'' going, he... well... he sort of decided that some of ''The Original Series'' wasn't canon either. I had a discussion with him once, where I cited a couple things that were very clearly canon in ''The Original Series'', and he told me he didn't think that way anymore, and that he now thought of ''TNG'' as canon wherever there was conflict between the two. He admitted it was revisionist thinking, but so be it.<ref name=\"PaulaBlock\">Paula Block, VCP Senior Director of Licensed Publishing, TrekBBS posts, December 2005.</ref>\u2014 Paula Block, 2005}}\n\nAdditionally, [[David Gerrold]], in an interview about ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'', commented on Roddenberry's [[wikt:parsimony|parsimony]] and how it originally affected the ''Star Trek''{{'}}s canon:\n\n{{quote|Arguments about \"canon\" are silly. I always felt that ''Star Trek Animated'' was part of ''Star Trek'' because Gene Roddenberry accepted the paycheck for it and put his name on the credits. And [[D. C. Fontana]]\u2014and all the other writers involved\u2014busted their butts to make it the best ''Star Trek'' they could.\n\nBut this whole business of \"canon\" really originated with Gene's errand boy. Gene liked giving people titles instead of raises, so the errand boy got named \"archivist\" and apparently it went to his head. Gene handed him the responsibility of answering all fan questions, silly or otherwise, and he apparently let that go to his head.<ref>[http://www.startrekanimated.com/tas_david_gerrold.html ''STAR TREK: THE ANIMATED SERIES''] interview with [[David Gerrold]]</ref>}}\n\n===From non-canon to canon===\nOccasionally, writers will draw from non-canonical works in creating new canon. Such is the case of the first names for [[Hikaru Sulu]] and [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]], which were first used in the novel ''[[The Entropy Effect]]'' and the reference book ''Star Trek II Biographies'', respectively. Several concepts that first appeared in the ''Animated Series'', which was canon when it was made, then considered non-canon for a couple of decades before being made canon again,<ref>\"Do you think the Animated series should be considered canon? Or even more so, IS the Animated Series canon?\" \"We don't consider it canon, but it's kinda cool to throw in the odd reference here and there.\" - Ronald D. Moore, AOL's \"Ask Ron D.

The transcript of the text can often be obtained through behind-the-scenes pictures and interviews. This leads to the question of whether material that is in the episodes but cannot be seen clearly should be considered canon. Often, this material tends to be inside jokes inserted by the production staff. Other kinds of information, such as the biographical information seen on a computer display in \"[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]\", has been stated to not be \"hard canon\".<ref name=\"MikeSussman\">\"I wouldn't really consider any of this 'hard canon,' so take it all with a grain of salt.

One scene, deleted from ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', revealed Peter Preston as the nephew of [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]].<ref>\"The \"Director's Edition\" version of the film is not substantively longer than the original theatrical release, as he pointed out during last week's gala premiere at Paramount.

For example, the reference book ''Star Trek Chronology'' states that Roddenberry considered elements of ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier|Star Trek V]]'' and ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|Star Trek VI]]'' to be [[apocrypha]]l, but it does not specify which particular elements in the films Roddenberry objected to.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Okuda\n|first=Michael\n|author2=Denise Okuda\n|year=1996\n|title=Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future, revised edition\n|location=New York\n|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]\n|isbn=0-671-53610-9\n|nopp=true\n|page=vii\n}}</ref>\n\nThe canonicity of [[DVD-Video#Extra features|extra features]] found on home DVD releases, such as [[deleted scene]]s, has never been explicitly addressed.\n\n===\"Reboot\" films (''Kelvin'' Timeline)===\n''Star Trek'', ''Into Darkness'' and ''Beyond'' occur in a separate timeline from the rest of the series. In June 2016, for the computer game ''Star Trek Online'', CBS has named this universe, from the ''Star Trek'' films produced by J.J.

So, for us here \u2013 [[Ronald D. Moore|Ron Moore]], [[Jeri Taylor]], everybody who works on the show \u2013 Gene is the authority. And when he says that the books, and the games, and the comics and everything else, are not gospel, but are only additional ''Star Trek'' based on his ''Star Trek'' but not part of the actual ''Star Trek'' universe that he created... they're just, you know, kinda fun to keep you occupied between episodes and between movies, whatever... but he does not want that to be considered to be sources of information for writers, working on this show, he doesn't want it to be considered part of the canon by anybody working on any other projects.<ref name=\"ArnoldvLynch\" />\u2014 Richard Arnold, 1991</blockquote>\n\nHowever, even this rule is not without rare exceptions. Two ''Voyager'' novels written by Jeri Taylor (co-creator and then producer of ''Voyager''), ''Mosaic'' and ''Pathways'', were written early on in ''Voyager''{{'}}s run and detailed the background of the series' main characters.<ref name=\"StarTrek.com\" /> These were meant to be canon, and to be used as references by the series' writers when fleshing out the characters. These two novels are sometimes named as exceptions to the \"no book is canon\" rule.<ref name=\"LangForum1\">\"Only the reference books (tech manual, encyclopedia, etc...) and two books by Jeri Taylor are considered canon outside the TV show and movies.\" - Harry Lang, Senior Director of Viacom Consumer Products Interactive division, posts on [http://www.startrek.com/ StarTrek.com] forum, January 2005.</ref> However, as some of the background information mentioned in those books was never referenced in an episode of ''Voyager'', or was contradicted in episodes written after they were published, their status as canon is still open to debate.<ref name=\"StarTrek.com\" />\n\n===Novelizations===\nThe [[novelization]]s of episodes and movies are not considered canon. This is a tradition that also goes back to Roddenberry himself. His novelization of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' includes many tangents and new information. It reveals, for instance, that the woman who dies in the transporter accident was Kirk's former spouse.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Roddenberry\n|first=Gene\n|year=1979\n|title=Star Trek: The Motion Picture\n|location=New York\n|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]\n|isbn=0-671-83088-0\n|pages=[https://archive.org/details/startrekmotionpi00rodd/page/66 66\u201367]\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/startrekmotionpi00rodd/page/66\n}}</ref> While this novel filled in many gaps left in the movie, Roddenberry is quoted as saying it should not be considered canon.<ref name=\"ArnoldvLynchNovelization\">\"The novelization that Gene wrote himself, of ''Star Trek: the Motion Picture'', he does not consider canon either, because he also went off on tangents, that he said that it's okay for individual writers to do that, and he certainly had some fun with it himself, filling in parts of the puzzle that he never would've been able to do on film, it would've been a ten-hour movie, but he doesn't want even that used for canon, because otherwise, where do you draw the line? Which books are accepted and which aren't?\" - Richard Arnold, ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' research consultant and ''Star Trek'' archivist, 1991 interview with Tim Lynch.</ref>\n\n===Reference books===\nA special case is made for \"non-fiction\" reference books such as ''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'', ''Star Trek Chronology'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual|TNG Technical Manual]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual|DS9 Technical Manual]]''. Unlike the novels and novelizations, these reference manuals have never been explicitly named as non-canon, and the fact that they were officially sanctioned by Paramount and given to episode writers as guides serves to give them an aura of credibility. Roddenberry himself considered it part of the \"background\" of ''Star Trek''.<ref name=\"RoddenberryTechManual\">\"Documents such as this Technical Manual help give some background to the vision we work so hard to create on ''Star Trek''. Rick and Mike have obviously had a lot of fun filling in the gaps and trying to find technical 'explanations' for some of our mistakes.\" - Gene Roddenberry, Introduction to the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual''</ref> Meanwhile, [[Michael Okuda]] and [[Rick Sternbach]], two art and technical consultants since ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and the authors of several of these reference books, considered their work \"pretty official\".<ref name=\"OkudaTechManual\">\"How 'official' is this stuff? Well, this is the first technical manual done by folks who actually work on ''Star Trek''.

People who worked with Roddenberry remember that he used to handle canonicity not on a series-by-series basis nor an episode-by-episode basis, but point by point. If he changed his mind on something, or if a fact in one episode contradicted what he considered to be a more important fact in another episode, he had no problem declaring that specific point not canonical.\n\n{{quote|See, people can easily catch us, and say \"well, wait a minute, in '[[Balance of Terror]]', they knew that the [[Romulan]]s had a [[cloaking device]], and then in '[[The Enterprise Incident]]', they don't know anything about cloaking devices, but they're gonna steal this one because it's obviously just been developed, so how the hell do you explain that?\" We can't. There are some things we just can't explain, especially when it comes from the third season.

I know that it's very difficult to understand. It literally is point by point.

Gene R. himself had a habit of decanonizing things. He didn't like the way the animated series turned out, so he proclaimed that it was not canon. He also didn't like a lot of the movies.

And \u2013 okay, I'm really going to scare you with this one \u2013 after he got ''TNG'' going, he... well... he sort of decided that some of ''The Original Series'' wasn't canon either. I had a discussion with him once, where I cited a couple things that were very clearly canon in ''The Original Series'', and he told me he didn't think that way anymore, and that he now thought of ''TNG'' as canon wherever there was conflict between the two.

Gene liked giving people titles instead of raises, so the errand boy got named \"archivist\" and apparently it went to his head.

It's to improve and improve.\" - Gene Roddenberry, ''The Star Trek Saga: From One Generation to the Next'', 1988.</ref> As ''Star Trek'' was constantly improved by each following generation, he expected people to look back upon its humble beginnings as just that, the simple beginnings of something much bigger and better.<ref name=\"RoddenberryFuture2\">\"There's a good chance that when I'm gone, others will come along and do so well that people will say, 'Oh, that Roddenberry.

Later, [[Marc Okrand]] proceeded to flesh out the sparse vocabulary into a real language, complete with grammar rules and [[phonology]], and went so far as to publish ''[[The Klingon Dictionary]]'' (1985, revised edition 1992); the [[Klingon Language Institute]] was created soon thereafter.<ref name=\"okrandKLI\">[http://www.kli.org/tlh/ About the Klingon Language] article at the Klingon Language Institute.

Despite these facts, however, [[Ronald D. Moore]] stated in 1997: \"Whether or not [''Trek'' writers] use the language as spelled out in Marc's dictionary is up to the individual writer,\" and that he \"find[s] the dictionary cumbersome and usually find[s] it easier to make [the language] up phonetically.\"<!-- NOT A WIKI PAGE!

It is the simplest to define, and so is given first. However, one may also have Casimir invariants of higher order, which correspond to homogeneous symmetric polynomials of higher order; their definition is given last.\n\n===Quadratic Casimir element===\nSuppose that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is an <math>n</math>-dimensional [[semisimple Lie algebra]]. Let ''B'' be a nondegenerate [[bilinear form]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> that is invariant under the [[Adjoint_representation_of_a_Lie_algebra|adjoint action]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on itself, meaning that <math>B(\\operatorname{ad}_XY, Z) + B(Y, \\operatorname{ad}_X Z) = 0</math> for all X, Y, Z in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. (The most typical choice of ''B'' is the [[Killing form]].)\nLet\n:<math>\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n</math>\nbe any [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, and\n:<math>\\{X^i\\}_{i=1}^n</math>\nbe the dual basis of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> with respect to ''B''. The '''Casimir element''' <math>\\Omega</math> for ''B'' is the element of the universal enveloping algebra <math>U(\\mathfrak{g})</math> given by the formula \n:<math>\\Omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i X^i.</math>\n\nAlthough the definition relies on a choice of basis for the Lie algebra, it is easy to show that ''\u03a9'' is independent of this choice. On the other hand, ''\u03a9''  does depend on the bilinear form ''B''. The invariance of ''B'' implies that the Casimir element commutes with all elements of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, and hence lies in the center of the universal enveloping algebra <math>U(\\mathfrak{g})</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 10.5</ref>\n\n===Casimir invariant of a linear representation and of a smooth action===\n\nGiven a [[Lie algebra representation|representation]] \u03c1 of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on a vector space V, possibly infinite-dimensional, the '''Casimir invariant''' of \u03c1 is defined to be \u03c1(\u03a9), the linear operator on V given by the formula\n\n:<math>\\rho(\\Omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\rho(X_i)\\rho(X^i).</math>\n\nHere we are assuming that ''B'' is the Killing form, otherwise ''B'' must be specified.\n\nA specific form of this construction plays an important role in differential geometry and global analysis. Suppose that a connected Lie group G with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> [[Lie group action|acts]] on a differentiable manifold ''M''. Consider the corresponding representation \u03c1 of ''G'' on the space of smooth functions on M. Then elements of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are represented by first order differential operators on M. In this situation, the Casimir invariant of \u03c1 is the G-invariant second order differential operator on ''M'' defined by the above formula. \n\nSpecializing further, if it happens that ''M'' has a [[Riemannian metric]] on which ''G'' acts transitively by isometries, and the stabilizer subgroup ''G''<sub>x</sub> of a point acts irreducibly on the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'', then the Casimir invariant of \u03c1 is a scalar multiple of the [[Laplacian operator]] coming from the metric. \n\nMore general Casimir invariants may also be defined, commonly occurring in the study of [[pseudo-differential operator]]s in [[Fredholm theory]].\n\n===General case===\nThe article on [[universal enveloping algebra]]s gives a detailed, precise definition of Casimir operators, and an exposition of some of their properties. In particular, all Casimir operators correspond to symmetric [[homogeneous polynomial]]s in the [[symmetric algebra]] of the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]] <math>\\operatorname{ad}_\\mathfrak{g}.</math>  That is, in general, one has that any Casimir operator will have the form\n\n:<math>C_{(m)} = \\kappa^{ij\\cdots k} X_i \\otimes X_j \\otimes \\cdots\\otimes X_k</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''m''}} is the order of the symmetric tensor <math>\\kappa^{ij\\cdots k}</math> and the <math>X_i</math> form a [[vector space basis]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}.</math> This corresponds to a symmetric homogeneous polynomial\n\n:<math>c_{(m)} = \\kappa^{ij\\cdots k} t_i t_j \\cdots t_k</math>\nin {{math|''m''}} indeterminate variables <math>t_i</math> in the [[polynomial algebra]] <math>K[t_i, t_j, \\cdots ,t_k]</math> over a field {{math|''K''.}} The reason for the symmetry follows from the [[PBW theorem]] and is discussed in much greater detail in the article on [[universal enveloping algebra]]s.\n\n''Not just any'' symmetric tensor (symmetric homogeneous polynomial) will do; it must explicitly commute with the Lie bracket.  That is, one ''must'' have that \n\n:<math>[C_{(m)}, X_i] = 0</math>\nfor all basis elements <math>X_i.</math> Any proposed symmetric polynomial can be explicitly checked, making use of the [[structure constants]]\n:<math>[X_i,X_j]=f_{ij}^{\\;\\; k}X_k</math>\nin order to obtain\n:<math>f_{ij}^{\\;\\; k}  \\kappa^{jl\\cdots m} \n+ f_{ij}^{\\;\\; l}  \\kappa^{kj\\cdots m} + \\cdots\n+ f_{ij}^{\\;\\; m}  \\kappa^{kl\\cdots j} = 0\n</math>\nThis result is originally due to [[Israel Gelfand]].<ref>Xavier Bekaert, \"[http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ptm/pmif/Rencontres/ModaveI/Xavier.pdf Universal enveloping algebras and some applications in physics]\" (2005) ''Lecture, Modave Summer School in Mathematical Physics''.</ref>  The commutation relation implies that the Casimir operators lie in the center of the universal enveloping algebra, and, in particular, always commute with any element of the Lie algebra. It is due to this property of commutation that allows a [[representation of a Lie algebra]] to be labelled by eigenvalues of the associated Casimir operators. \n\nAny linear combination of the symmetric polynomials described above will lie in the center as well: therefore, the Casimir operators are, by definition, restricted to that subset that span this space (that provide a basis for this space).  For a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] of rank {{math|''r'',}} there will be {{math|''r''}} Casimir invariants.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n===Uniqueness===\nSince for a simple lie algebra every invariant bilinear form is a multiple of the [[Killing form]], the corresponding Casimir element is uniquely defined up to a constant. For a general semisimple Lie algebra, the space of invariant bilinear forms has one basis vector for each simple component, and hence the same is true for the space of corresponding Casimir operators.\n\n===Relation to the Laplacian on G===\nIf <math>G</math> is a Lie group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the  choice of an invariant bilinear form on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> corresponds to a choice of bi-invariant [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] on <math>G</math>. Then under the identification of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> with the left invariant differential operators on <math>G</math>, the Casimir element of the bilinear form on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> maps to the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator|Laplacian]] of <math>G</math> (with respect to the corresponding bi-invariant metric).\n\n===Generalizations===\nThe Casimir operator is a distinguished quadratic element of the [[center (algebra)|center]] of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the Lie algebra. In other words, it is a member of the algebra of all differential operators that commutes with all the generators in the Lie algebra. In fact all quadratic elements in the center of the universal enveloping algebra arise this way.\nHowever, the center may contain other, non-quadratic, elements.\n\nBy [[Giulio Racah|Racah]]'s theorem,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Racah|first1=Giulio|title=Group theory and spectroscopy|date=1965|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}</ref> for a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] the dimension of the center of the universal enveloping algebra is equal to its [[Semisimple Lie algebra#Rank|rank]]. The Casimir operator gives the concept of the [[Laplacian]] on a general [[semisimple Lie group]]; but this way of counting shows that there may be no unique analogue of the Laplacian, for rank > 1.\n\nBy definition any member of the center of the universal enveloping algebra commutes with all other elements in the algebra. By [[Schur's Lemma]], in any [[irreducible representation]] of the Lie algebra, the Casimir operator is thus proportional to the identity.  This constant of proportionality can be used to classify the representations of the Lie algebra (and hence, also of its [[Lie group]]). Physical mass and spin are examples of these constants, as are many other [[quantum number]]s found in [[quantum mechanics]]. Superficially, [[topological quantum number]]s form an exception to this pattern; although deeper theories hint that these are two facets of the same phenomenon.{{According to whom|date=December 2013}}.\n\n== Example: <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> ==\nThe Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> is the Lie algebra of [[SO(3)]], the rotation group for three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].  It is simple of rank 1, and so it has a single independent Casimir. The Killing form for the rotation group is just the [[Kronecker delta]], and so the Casimir invariant is simply the sum of the squares of the generators <math>L_x,\\, L_y,\\, L_z</math> of the algebra.  That is, the Casimir invariant is given by\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2.</math>\n\nConsider the irreducible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> in which the largest eigenvalue of <math>L_z</math> is <math>\\ell</math>, where the possible values of <math>\\ell</math> are <math>0,1/2,1,3/2,\\ldots</math>. The invariance of the Casimir operator implies that it is a multiple of the identity operator <math>I</math>. This constant can be computed explicitly, giving the following result<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 17.8</ref>\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2=\\ell(\\ell+1)I.</math>\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], the scalar value <math>\\ell</math> is referred to as the [[total angular momentum]]. For finite-dimensional matrix-valued [[group representation|representations]] of the rotation group, <math>\\ell</math> always takes on integer values (for [[boson|bosonic representation]]s) or half-integer values (for [[fermion|fermionic representation]]s).\n\nFor a given value of <math>\\ell</math>, the matrix representation is <math>(2\\ell+1)</math>-dimensional. Thus, for example, the three-dimensional representation for <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> corresponds to <math>\\ell\\,=\\,1</math>, and is given by the generators\n\n:<math>\nL_x=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 0& -1\\\\\n0& 1& 0\n\\end{pmatrix};\\quad\nL_y=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& 0& 1\\\\\n0& 0& 0\\\\\n-1& 0& 0\n\\end{pmatrix};\\quad\nL_z=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& -1& 0\\\\\n1& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 0& 0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nwhere the factors of <math>i</math> are needed for agreement with the physics convention (used here) that the generators should be self-adjoint operators.\n\nThe quadratic Casimir invariant can then easily be computed by hand, with the result that\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2= 2\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 1& 0\\\\\n0& 0& 1\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nas <math>\\ell(\\ell+1)\\,=\\,2</math> when <math>\\ell\\,=\\,1</math>. Similarly, the two dimensional representation has a basis given by the [[Pauli matrices]], which correspond to [[spin (physics)|spin]] 1/2, and one can again check the formula for the Casimir by direct computation.\n\n==Eigenvalues==\nGiven that <math>\\Omega</math> is central in the enveloping algebra, it acts on simple modules by a scalar. Let <math>\\langle,\\rangle</math> be any bilinear symmetric non-degenerate form, by which we define <math>\\Omega</math>. Let <math>L(\\lambda)</math> be the finite dimensional highest weight module of weight <math>\\lambda</math>. Then the Casimir element <math>\\Omega</math> acts on <math>L(\\lambda)</math> by the constant \n:<math>\\langle \\lambda, \\lambda + 2 \\rho \\rangle=\\langle\\lambda+\\rho,\\lambda+\\rho\\rangle - \\langle\\rho,\\rho\\rangle ,</math> \nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the weight defined by half the sum of the positive roots.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 10.6</ref> \n\nAn important point is that if <math>L(\\lambda)</math> is nontrivial (i.e. if <math>\\lambda\\neq 0</math>), then the above constant is nonzero. After all, since <math>\\lambda</math> is dominant, if <math>\\lambda\\neq 0</math>, then <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\lambda\\rangle>0</math> and <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\rho\\rangle\\geq 0</math>, showing that <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\lambda+2\\rho\\rangle >0</math>. This observation plays an important role in the proof of [[Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility]]. It is also possible to prove the nonvanishing of the eigenvalue in a more abstract way\u2014without using an explicit formula for the eigenvalue\u2014using Cartan's criterion; see Sections 4.3 and 6.2 in the book of Humphreys.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Harish-Chandra isomorphism]]\n*[[Pauli\u2013Lubanski pseudovector]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Quantum Theory for Mathematicians|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=267|publisher=Springer|year=2013}}\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=Humphreys | first=James E. | title=Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory | edition=Second printing, revised | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | volume=9 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York | year=1978 | isbn=0-387-90053-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoli00jame }}\n* {{cite book | last=Jacobson | first=Nathan | title=Lie algebras | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1979 | isbn=0-486-63832-4 | pages=243\u2013249 }}\n\n[[Category:Representation theory of Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|distinguished element of a Lie algebra's center}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Casimir element''' (also known as a '''Casimir invariant''' or '''Casimir operator''') is a distinguished element of the [[Center (ring theory)|center]] of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a [[Lie algebra]].

However, one may also have Casimir invariants of higher order, which correspond to homogeneous symmetric polynomials of higher order; their definition is given last.\n\n===Quadratic Casimir element===\nSuppose that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is an <math>n</math>-dimensional [[semisimple Lie algebra]]. Let ''B'' be a nondegenerate [[bilinear form]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> that is invariant under the [[Adjoint_representation_of_a_Lie_algebra|adjoint action]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on itself, meaning that <math>B(\\operatorname{ad}_XY, Z) + B(Y, \\operatorname{ad}_X Z) = 0</math> for all X, Y, Z in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. (The most typical choice of ''B'' is the [[Killing form]].)\nLet\n:<math>\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n</math>\nbe any [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, and\n:<math>\\{X^i\\}_{i=1}^n</math>\nbe the dual basis of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> with respect to ''B''. The '''Casimir element''' <math>\\Omega</math> for ''B'' is the element of the universal enveloping algebra <math>U(\\mathfrak{g})</math> given by the formula \n:<math>\\Omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i X^i.</math>\n\nAlthough the definition relies on a choice of basis for the Lie algebra, it is easy to show that ''\u03a9'' is independent of this choice. On the other hand, ''\u03a9''  does depend on the bilinear form ''B''. The invariance of ''B'' implies that the Casimir element commutes with all elements of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, and hence lies in the center of the universal enveloping algebra <math>U(\\mathfrak{g})</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 10.5</ref>\n\n===Casimir invariant of a linear representation and of a smooth action===\n\nGiven a [[Lie algebra representation|representation]] \u03c1 of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on a vector space V, possibly infinite-dimensional, the '''Casimir invariant''' of \u03c1 is defined to be \u03c1(\u03a9), the linear operator on V given by the formula\n\n:<math>\\rho(\\Omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\rho(X_i)\\rho(X^i).</math>\n\nHere we are assuming that ''B'' is the Killing form, otherwise ''B'' must be specified.\n\nA specific form of this construction plays an important role in differential geometry and global analysis. Suppose that a connected Lie group G with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> [[Lie group action|acts]] on a differentiable manifold ''M''. Consider the corresponding representation \u03c1 of ''G'' on the space of smooth functions on M. Then elements of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are represented by first order differential operators on M. In this situation, the Casimir invariant of \u03c1 is the G-invariant second order differential operator on ''M'' defined by the above formula. \n\nSpecializing further, if it happens that ''M'' has a [[Riemannian metric]] on which ''G'' acts transitively by isometries, and the stabilizer subgroup ''G''<sub>x</sub> of a point acts irreducibly on the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'', then the Casimir invariant of \u03c1 is a scalar multiple of the [[Laplacian operator]] coming from the metric. \n\nMore general Casimir invariants may also be defined, commonly occurring in the study of [[pseudo-differential operator]]s in [[Fredholm theory]].\n\n===General case===\nThe article on [[universal enveloping algebra]]s gives a detailed, precise definition of Casimir operators, and an exposition of some of their properties. In particular, all Casimir operators correspond to symmetric [[homogeneous polynomial]]s in the [[symmetric algebra]] of the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]] <math>\\operatorname{ad}_\\mathfrak{g}.</math>  That is, in general, one has that any Casimir operator will have the form\n\n:<math>C_{(m)} = \\kappa^{ij\\cdots k} X_i \\otimes X_j \\otimes \\cdots\\otimes X_k</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''m''}} is the order of the symmetric tensor <math>\\kappa^{ij\\cdots k}</math> and the <math>X_i</math> form a [[vector space basis]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}.</math> This corresponds to a symmetric homogeneous polynomial\n\n:<math>c_{(m)} = \\kappa^{ij\\cdots k} t_i t_j \\cdots t_k</math>\nin {{math|''m''}} indeterminate variables <math>t_i</math> in the [[polynomial algebra]] <math>K[t_i, t_j, \\cdots ,t_k]</math> over a field {{math|''K''.}} The reason for the symmetry follows from the [[PBW theorem]] and is discussed in much greater detail in the article on [[universal enveloping algebra]]s.\n\n''Not just any'' symmetric tensor (symmetric homogeneous polynomial) will do; it must explicitly commute with the Lie bracket.  That is, one ''must'' have that \n\n:<math>[C_{(m)}, X_i] = 0</math>\nfor all basis elements <math>X_i.</math> Any proposed symmetric polynomial can be explicitly checked, making use of the [[structure constants]]\n:<math>[X_i,X_j]=f_{ij}^{\\;\\; k}X_k</math>\nin order to obtain\n:<math>f_{ij}^{\\;\\; k}  \\kappa^{jl\\cdots m} \n+ f_{ij}^{\\;\\; l}  \\kappa^{kj\\cdots m} + \\cdots\n+ f_{ij}^{\\;\\; m}  \\kappa^{kl\\cdots j} = 0\n</math>\nThis result is originally due to [[Israel Gelfand]].<ref>Xavier Bekaert, \"[http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ptm/pmif/Rencontres/ModaveI/Xavier.pdf Universal enveloping algebras and some applications in physics]\" (2005) ''Lecture, Modave Summer School in Mathematical Physics''.</ref>  The commutation relation implies that the Casimir operators lie in the center of the universal enveloping algebra, and, in particular, always commute with any element of the Lie algebra. It is due to this property of commutation that allows a [[representation of a Lie algebra]] to be labelled by eigenvalues of the associated Casimir operators. \n\nAny linear combination of the symmetric polynomials described above will lie in the center as well: therefore, the Casimir operators are, by definition, restricted to that subset that span this space (that provide a basis for this space).  For a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] of rank {{math|''r'',}} there will be {{math|''r''}} Casimir invariants.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n===Uniqueness===\nSince for a simple lie algebra every invariant bilinear form is a multiple of the [[Killing form]], the corresponding Casimir element is uniquely defined up to a constant. For a general semisimple Lie algebra, the space of invariant bilinear forms has one basis vector for each simple component, and hence the same is true for the space of corresponding Casimir operators.\n\n===Relation to the Laplacian on G===\nIf <math>G</math> is a Lie group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the  choice of an invariant bilinear form on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> corresponds to a choice of bi-invariant [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] on <math>G</math>. Then under the identification of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> with the left invariant differential operators on <math>G</math>, the Casimir element of the bilinear form on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> maps to the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator|Laplacian]] of <math>G</math> (with respect to the corresponding bi-invariant metric).\n\n===Generalizations===\nThe Casimir operator is a distinguished quadratic element of the [[center (algebra)|center]] of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the Lie algebra. In other words, it is a member of the algebra of all differential operators that commutes with all the generators in the Lie algebra. In fact all quadratic elements in the center of the universal enveloping algebra arise this way.\nHowever, the center may contain other, non-quadratic, elements.\n\nBy [[Giulio Racah|Racah]]'s theorem,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Racah|first1=Giulio|title=Group theory and spectroscopy|date=1965|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}</ref> for a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] the dimension of the center of the universal enveloping algebra is equal to its [[Semisimple Lie algebra#Rank|rank]]. The Casimir operator gives the concept of the [[Laplacian]] on a general [[semisimple Lie group]]; but this way of counting shows that there may be no unique analogue of the Laplacian, for rank > 1.\n\nBy definition any member of the center of the universal enveloping algebra commutes with all other elements in the algebra. By [[Schur's Lemma]], in any [[irreducible representation]] of the Lie algebra, the Casimir operator is thus proportional to the identity.  This constant of proportionality can be used to classify the representations of the Lie algebra (and hence, also of its [[Lie group]]). Physical mass and spin are examples of these constants, as are many other [[quantum number]]s found in [[quantum mechanics]]. Superficially, [[topological quantum number]]s form an exception to this pattern; although deeper theories hint that these are two facets of the same phenomenon.{{According to whom|date=December 2013}}.\n\n== Example: <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> ==\nThe Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> is the Lie algebra of [[SO(3)]], the rotation group for three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].  It is simple of rank 1, and so it has a single independent Casimir. The Killing form for the rotation group is just the [[Kronecker delta]], and so the Casimir invariant is simply the sum of the squares of the generators <math>L_x,\\, L_y,\\, L_z</math> of the algebra.  That is, the Casimir invariant is given by\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2.</math>\n\nConsider the irreducible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> in which the largest eigenvalue of <math>L_z</math> is <math>\\ell</math>, where the possible values of <math>\\ell</math> are <math>0,1/2,1,3/2,\\ldots</math>. The invariance of the Casimir operator implies that it is a multiple of the identity operator ''I''. This constant can be computed explicitly, giving the following result<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 17.8</ref>\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2=\\ell(\\ell+1)I.</math>\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], the scalar value <math>\\ell</math> is referred to as the [[total angular momentum]]. For finite-dimensional matrix-valued [[group representation|representations]] of the rotation group, <math>\\ell</math> always takes on integer values (for [[boson|bosonic representation]]s) or half-integer values (for [[fermion|fermionic representation]]s).\n\nFor a given value of <math>\\ell</math>, the matrix representation is <math>(2\\ell+1)</math>-dimensional. Thus, for example, the three-dimensional representation for <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> corresponds to <math>\\ell\\,=\\,1</math>, and is given by the generators\n\n:<math>\nL_x=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 0& -1\\\\\n0& 1& 0\n\\end{pmatrix};\\quad\nL_y=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& 0& 1\\\\\n0& 0& 0\\\\\n-1& 0& 0\n\\end{pmatrix};\\quad\nL_z=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& -1& 0\\\\\n1& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 0& 0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nwhere the factors of <math>i</math> are needed for agreement with the physics convention (used here) that the generators should be self-adjoint operators.\n\nThe quadratic Casimir invariant can then easily be computed by hand, with the result that\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2= 2\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 1& 0\\\\\n0& 0& 1\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nas <math>\\ell(\\ell+1)\\,=\\,2</math> when <math>\\ell\\,=\\,1</math>. Similarly, the two dimensional representation has a basis given by the [[Pauli matrices]], which correspond to [[spin (physics)|spin]] 1/2, and one can again check the formula for the Casimir by direct computation.\n\n==Eigenvalues==\nGiven that <math>\\Omega</math> is central in the enveloping algebra, it acts on simple modules by a scalar. Let <math>\\langle,\\rangle</math> be any bilinear symmetric non-degenerate form, by which we define <math>\\Omega</math>. Let <math>L(\\lambda)</math> be the finite dimensional highest weight module of weight <math>\\lambda</math>. Then the Casimir element <math>\\Omega</math> acts on <math>L(\\lambda)</math> by the constant \n:<math>\\langle \\lambda, \\lambda + 2 \\rho \\rangle=\\langle\\lambda+\\rho,\\lambda+\\rho\\rangle - \\langle\\rho,\\rho\\rangle ,</math> \nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the weight defined by half the sum of the positive roots.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 10.6</ref> \n\nAn important point is that if <math>L(\\lambda)</math> is nontrivial (i.e. if <math>\\lambda\\neq 0</math>), then the above constant is nonzero. After all, since <math>\\lambda</math> is dominant, if <math>\\lambda\\neq 0</math>, then <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\lambda\\rangle>0</math> and <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\rho\\rangle\\geq 0</math>, showing that <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\lambda+2\\rho\\rangle >0</math>. This observation plays an important role in the proof of [[Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility]]. It is also possible to prove the nonvanishing of the eigenvalue in a more abstract way\u2014without using an explicit formula for the eigenvalue\u2014using Cartan's criterion; see Sections 4.3 and 6.2 in the book of Humphreys.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Harish-Chandra isomorphism]]\n*[[Pauli\u2013Lubanski pseudovector]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Quantum Theory for Mathematicians|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=267|publisher=Springer|year=2013}}\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=Humphreys | first=James E. | title=Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory | edition=Second printing, revised | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | volume=9 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York | year=1978 | isbn=0-387-90053-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoli00jame }}\n* {{cite book | last=Jacobson | first=Nathan | title=Lie algebras | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1979 | isbn=0-486-63832-4 | pages=243\u2013249 }}\n\n[[Category:Representation theory of Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]\n", "name_user": "Enyokoyama", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExample: \\mathfrak{so}(3):add <math></math> for I", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_element"}

Position players may be activated after a minimum of 10 days on the IL. Two-way players are subject to the rules for pitchers.

The final questionnaire was standardized on normally achieving young adults ranging from 18 to 27 years of age.  Validation data was acquired from subjects with language-learning or auditory processing disorders who were either self-reported or confirmed by diagnostic testing.  A UCAPI  total score is calculated by combining the totals from the six listening conditions and provides an overall value to categorize listening abilities. Additionally, analysis of the scores from the six listening conditions provides an auditory profile for the subject. Each listening condition can then be utilized by the professional in making recommendation for diagnosing problem of learning through listening and treatment decisions.  The UCAPI provides information on listening problems in various populations that can aid examiners in making recommendations for assessment and management.\n\nAPD has been defined anatomically in terms of the integrity of the auditory areas of the [[nervous system]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rintelmann | first1 = W.F. | title = Assessment of central auditory dysfunction : foundations and clinical correlates | chapter = Monaural speech tests in the detection of central auditory disorders. |editor = Marilyn L Pinheiro |editor2=Frank E Musiek | publisher = Williams & Wilkins | year = 1985 | location = Baltimore  | pages = 173\u2013200 | isbn = 978-0-683-06887-0 | oclc= 11497885 }}</ref> However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is made on the basis of performance on behavioral auditory tests.

Both tests are standardized on a large number of subjects and include validation data on subjects with auditory processing disorders.   The SCAN test batteries include screening tests: norm-based criterion-referenced scores; diagnostic tests: scaled scores, percentile ranks and ear advantage scores for all tests except the Gap Detection test.  The four tests include four subsets on which the subject scores are derived include: discrimination of monaurally presented single words against background noise (speech in noise), acoustically degraded single words (filtered words), dichotically presented single words and sentences.\n\n2. Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT) is also a standardized test. It assesses an individual\u2019s gap detection threshold of tones and white noise. The exam includes stimuli at four different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000&nbsp;Hz) and white noise clicks of 50 ms duration. It is a useful test because it provides an index of auditory temporal resolution.

The final questionnaire was standardized on normally achieving young adults ranging from 18 to 27 years of age.  Validation data was acquired from subjects with language-learning or auditory processing disorders who were either self-reported or confirmed by diagnostic testing.  A UCAPI  total score is calculated by combining the totals from the six listening conditions and provides an overall value to categorize listening abilities. Additionally, analysis of the scores from the six listening conditions provides an auditory profile for the subject. Each listening condition can then be utilized by the professional in making recommendation for diagnosing problem of learning through listening and treatment decisions.  The UCAPI provides information on listening problems in various populations that can aid examiners in making recommendations for assessment and management.\n\nAPD has been defined anatomically in terms of the integrity of the auditory areas of the [[nervous system]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rintelmann | first1 = W.F. | title = Assessment of central auditory dysfunction : foundations and clinical correlates | chapter = Monaural speech tests in the detection of central auditory disorders. |editor = Marilyn L Pinheiro |editor2=Frank E Musiek | publisher = Williams & Wilkins | year = 1985 | location = Baltimore  | pages = 173\u2013200 | isbn = 978-0-683-06887-0 | oclc= 11497885 }}</ref> However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is made on the basis of performance on behavioral auditory tests.

Both tests are standardized on a large number of subjects and include validation data on subjects with auditory processing disorders.   The SCAN test batteries include screening tests: norm-based criterion-referenced scores; diagnostic tests: scaled scores, percentile ranks and ear advantage scores for all tests except the Gap Detection test.  The four tests include four subsets on which the subject scores are derived include: discrimination of monaurally presented single words against background noise (speech in noise), acoustically degraded single words (filtered words), dichotically presented single words and sentences.\n\n2. Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT) is also a standardized test. It assesses an individual\u2019s gap detection threshold of tones and white noise. The exam includes stimuli at four different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000&nbsp;Hz) and white noise clicks of 50 ms duration. It is a useful test because it provides an index of auditory temporal resolution. In children, an overall gap detection threshold greater than 20 ms means they have failed and may have an auditory processing disorder based on abnormal perception of sound in the time domain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muluk|first=Nuray Bayar|last2=Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya|first2=Fulya|last3=Keith|first3=Robert W.|date=February 2011|title=Random gap detection test and random gap detection test-expanded: Results in children with previous language delay in early childhood|journal=Auris Nasus Larynx|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6\u201313|doi=10.1016/j.anl.2010.05.007|pmid=20599334|issn=0385-8146}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|title=Random gap detection test|date=2011}}</ref>\n\n3.
