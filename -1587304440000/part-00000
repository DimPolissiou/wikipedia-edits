{"title_page": "Human serum albumin", "text_new": "{{Infobox_gene}}\n\n'''Human serum albumin''' is the [[serum albumin]] found in human [[blood]]. It is the most abundant [[protein]] in human [[blood plasma]]; it constitutes about half of [[serum (blood)|serum]] protein. It is produced in the [[liver]]. It is soluble in water, and it is [[monomer]]ic.\n\n[[Albumin]] transports hormones, fatty acids, and other compounds, buffers pH, and maintains [[oncotic pressure]], among other functions.\n\nAlbumin is synthesized in the liver as preproalbumin, which has an N-terminal peptide that is removed before the nascent protein is released from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The product, proalbumin, is in turn cleaved in the Golgi vesicles to produce the secreted albumin.\n\nThe [[reference range]] for albumin concentrations in serum is approximately 35\u201350&nbsp;g/L (3.5\u20135.0&nbsp;g/dL).<ref name=\"Pathology Harmony\">{{cite web|title=Harmonisation of Reference Intervals|url=http://www.acb.org.uk/docs/Pathology%20Harmony%20for%20web.pdf|work=pathologyharmony.co.uk|publisher=Pathology Harmony|access-date=23 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802082027/http://www.acb.org.uk/docs/Pathology%20Harmony%20for%20web.pdf|archive-date=2 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It has a serum half-life of approximately 21 days.<ref name=\"Medscape Reference 2019\">{{cite web | title=Hypoalbuminemia: Background, Pathophysiology, Etiology | website=Medscape Reference | date=2019-11-10 | url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/166724-overview | access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> It has a [[molecular mass]] of 66.5&nbsp;kDa.\n\nThe gene for albumin is located on chromosome 4 in locus 4q13.3 and mutations in this gene can result in anomalous proteins.
