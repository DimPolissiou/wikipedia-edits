It was the largest constituent republic in terms of population and territory. Its capital, [[Belgrade]], was also the federal capital of Yugoslavia.\n\n==History==\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{Main|Axis occupation of Serbia|Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia}}\nAfter the collapse of [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] on 18 April 1941 Yugoslavia was partitioned between Axis forces. The territory of later SR Serbia was mainly occupied by German forces, with puppet Government in Belgrade. The region of Kosovo was annexed by [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939\u20131943)|Albania]], [[Ba\u010dka]] by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Srem District|Syrmia]] by [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and southeastern parts were occupied by [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]]. [[Banat (1941\u201344)|Banat]] had its own autonomous status.\n\nIn the beginning of the occupation there were two resistance armies: [[Chetniks]] and [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. Yet, Chetniks started open collaboration with Axis forces in 1943.\n\nIn July 1941 socialist republic was founded by partisans in western Serbia, known as [[Republic of U\u017eice]]. However, the German offensive crushed this proto-state in December the same year. After this partisan main forces moved to Bosnia.\n\nTogether with Soviet and other allies first parts of Serbia were liberated in 1944. Many cities were heavily bombed by western allies. First major city to be liberated was [[Ni\u0161]] on 14 October, followed by capital [[Belgrade]] on 20 October 1944.\n\n=== Post-World War II period ===\n\n==== 1940s\u20131950s ====\n{{History of Serbia}}\nIn April 1945, the [[Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Serbia]] officially created the ''Federated State of Serbia'' ({{lang-sr|\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430}} / ''Federalna Dr\u017eava Srbija''), as a [[federated state]] within Yugoslavia. In January 1946, after the first constitution of federal Yugoslavia was adopted, the Federated State of Serbia was renamed to ''People's Republic of Serbia'' ({{lang-sr|\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430}} / ''Narodna Republika Srbija''). It also had two autonomous units, [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (1945-1963)|Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945-1963)|Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija]].\n\n==== 1960s ====\nIn 1966 one of the most prominent Serbs in the Communist party and also vice-president of Yugoslavia and founder of Yugoslav intelligence agency [[OZNA]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] was removed from positions due to allegations of spying on SFRY President [[Josip Broz Tito]].\n\n==== 1970s ====\nAfter [[Croatian Spring|the Croatian Spring]] in 1971, almost whole party leadership of Serbia was removed from office, under the charge of being \"liberal\". [[Latinka Perovi\u0107]] and [[Marko Nikezi\u0107]] were marked as leaders of this liberal movement inside League of Communists of Serbia.\n\nIn 1974 new constitution was adopted, increasing the powers of provinces, and making them ''de facto'' republics. For the first time the institution of president was formed, as [[President of the Presidency of SR Serbia|President of the Presidency of Socialist Republic of Serbia]]. Assembly was electing 15 members of the presidency and one president for a 4 -year term, and later 2-year term. The new constitution practically suspended Serbia's authority over the provinces.\n\nAfter the new constitution was adopted, mistakes became obvious. [[Dragoslav Markovi\u0107]], then President of Serbia ordered a secret study on this issue. The study was completed in 1977 and was named ''The Blue Book''. \n\n==== 1980s\u20131990s ====\nFor most of its existence in the SFRY, Serbia was loyal and generally subordinate to the federal government. This changed after the death of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in 1980, when Albanian, as well as Serbian [[nationalism]] in Kosovo arose. In 1981 a [[1981 protests in Kosovo|major protests erupted in Kosovo]] demanding the status of republic. The League of Communists was split on how to respond. At the same time, economic crisis in Yugoslavia started. The leaders of the country were unable to make any reforms, thanks to the political instability.\n\nPresident of League of Communists of Serbia [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] visited Kosovo in April 1987 and promised rapid action in order to protect peace and Serbs of Kosovo. Ethnic tensions in Kosovo were heated up when Kosovo Albanian soldier opened fire on his fellow soldiers in [[Para\u0107in]], in an event known as [[Para\u0107in massacre]]. Then [[President of Serbia]] [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]] wanted to make compromise, rather than fast solution. He found himself in a clash with Milo\u0161evi\u0107. This conflict culminated with [[8th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia|8th Session]] and replacement of Stamboli\u0107 with [[Petar Gra\u010danin]] as President of Serbia.\n\nIn 1988 and 1989 a successful [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution|round of coups in the Communist party leadership]], known as ''[[Anti-bureaucratic revolution|Antibureucratic revolution]]'', in Vojvodina, Kosovo as well as Montenegro, replaced autonomous leaderships in this regions. The coups were led by [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]; supporter of  Serbian nationalism. The events were condemned by the [[communist]] governments of the western Yugoslav republics (especially [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]), who successfully resisted the attempts to expand the revolt onto their territories, and turned against Milo\u0161evi\u0107. The rising antagonism eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1990, and subsequently in the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn 1989, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was elected as President of Serbia. He demanded that the federal Yugoslav government act for the interests of Serbia in Kosovo by sending in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] to suppress separatism in the province. At the same time, several reforms of federal electoral system were proposed, with Serbia supporting a \"one-citizen, one-vote\" system, which would have given a majority of votes to Serbs. By that time, ethnic tensions in Yugoslavia increased, and the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] collapsed, followed by the crisis of federal institutions. After these events, in 1989 Assembly of Socialist Republic of Serbia voted for constitution amendments that revoked high autonomy for provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo.\n\nAfter Slovenian authorities forbid a group of Serbs supporting his politics to gather in Ljubljana, Milosevic started a trade war with [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]] in late 1989. This Serbian-Slovenian conflict culminated in January 1990 on [[14th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] when Slovenians left the meeting followed by Croatian delegates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/28/world/upheaval-east-yugoslavia-sign-bad-times-yugoslavia-trade-war-between-two.html|title=UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Yugoslavia;   A Sign of Bad Times in Yugoslavia: Trade War Between Two Republics|last=|first=|date=28 January 1990|website=[[The New York Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1990, the state was known simply as ''[[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Republic of Serbia]]'' ({{lang-sr|\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430}} / ''Republika Srbija''), and in December of the same year, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was elected as first President of the Republic. In 1992, when the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was formed, Serbia became one of its two constituent republics. In 2003 this state union was re-formed into [[Serbia and Montenegro]], and in 2006 [[Serbia]] became an independent republic after [[Montenegro]] separated.\n[[File:Flag of the Serbian Partisans.svg|thumb|Flag of Federal State of Serbia in 1945]]\n[[File:FederalStateofSerbia.png|none|thumb|Map of Federal State of Serbia in 1945]]\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Medjuopstinske regionalne zajednice Socijalisticke Republike Srbije.png|thumb|right|220px|Administrative divisions of SR Serbia 1974\u20131990]]\n\nWithin Socialist Republic of Serbia two autonomous provinces existed: [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]]. The central part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia located outside of the two autonomous provinces was generally known as \"[[Central Serbia|Serbia proper]]\" (''\"U\u017ea Srbija\"'').\n\nGeographically SR Serbia bordered [[Hungary]] to the north, [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the east and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] to the south-west. Within Yugoslavia, it bordered [[SR Macedonia]] to the south and [[SR Montenegro]][[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina|, Bosnia and Herzegovina]] [[SR Croatia|and Croatia]] to the west.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n===1971 census===\nIn 1971, total population of the Socialist Republic of Serbia numbered 8,446,591 people, including:\n*[[Serbs]] = 6,142,071 (72.71%)\n*[[Albanians]] = 984,761 (11.66%)\n*[[Hungarians]] = 430,314 (5.10%)\n*[[Croats]] = 184,913 (2.19%)\n*[[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] = 154,330 (1.83%) \n*[[Yugoslavs]] = 123,824 (1.47%)\n*[[Slovaks]] = 76,733 (0.82%)\n*[[Romanians]] = 57,419 (0.62%)\n*[[Bulgarians]] = 53,800 (0.58%)\n*[[Romani people|Romani]] = 49,894 (0.54%)\n*[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] = 42,675 (0.46%)\n*[[Pannonian Rusyns|Rusyns]] = 20,608 (0.22%)\n*[[Turkish people|Turks]] = 18,220 (0.20%)\n*[[Slovenes]] = 15,957 (0.17%)\n*[[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] = 14,724 (0.16%)\n\n===1981 census===\nIn 1981, total population of the Socialist Republic of Serbia numbered 9,313,677 people, including:\n*[[Serbs]] = 6,331,527 (67.96%)\n*[[Albanians]] = 1,303,032 (13.99%)\n*[[Yugoslavs]] = 441,941 (4.75%)\n*[[Hungarians]] = 390,468 (4.19%)\n*[[Muslims (ethnic group)|Muslims]] = 215,166 (2.31%)\n*[[Croats]] = 149,368 (1.60%)\n*[[Romani people|Romani]] = 110,956 (1.19%)\n*[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] = 48,986 (0.53%)\n*[[Slovenes]] = 12,006 (0.13%)\n\n==Politics==\nIn the Socialist Republic, the only legal political party was the [[League of Communists of Serbia]] (SKS), which was part of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (SKJ). The party remained relatively stable and loyal to the federal party until the late 1980s, when the party became split over what action to take in Kosovo when protests and fights broke out between ethnic Albanians and Serbs.\n\nThe more traditional Communists supported President [[Ivan Stambolic]], who advocated continued neutrality as a means to solve the dispute; while more radical and nationalist-leaning members supported [[Slobodan Milosevic]], who advocated the protection of [[Kosovo Serbs]], who had claimed that their population was being pressured to leave Kosovo by Albanian separatists. Milosevic utilized public sentiment and opposition to [[Kosovo Albanian]] separatism to rally large numbers of supporters to help him overthrow the Communist leadership in Vojvodina, Kosovo and the Socialist Republic of Montenegro in what was known as the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]. Afterward, the Serbian League of Communists selected Milosevic as its leader. Milosevic took a hard stand on Albanian nationalism in Kosovo and pressured the Yugoslav government to give him emergency powers to deal with Kosovo Albanian separatists. Furthermore, he reduced the autonomy of the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina and installed politicians loyal to him to serve as their representatives.\n \nIn the congress of the Yugoslav League of Communists in 1990, Milosevic and his subordinate representatives for Vojvodina, Kosovo and the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] attempted to silence opposition from the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]] who opposed the actions taken against Kosovo Albanian leadership, by blocking all reforms proposed by the Slovene representatives. The tactic failed and Slovenia, along with its ally Croatia, abdicated from the Yugoslav Communist Party. This caused the Yugoslav Communist party to fall apart, and then the state of Yugoslavia itself one year later.\n\n==Heads of institutions==\n\n===Chairman of ASNOS (1944\u20131945)===\n*[[Sini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107]] (12 November 1944 \u2013 7 April 1945)\n\n===Presidents===\n*'''President of the Presidium of the People's Assembly (1945\u20131953)'''\n**[[Sini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107]] (7 April 1945 \u2013 March 1953)\n*'''Presidents of the National Assembly (1953\u20131974)'''\n**[[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] (December 1953 \u2013 April 1957)\n**[[Jovan Veselinov]] (April 1957 \u2013 26 June 1963)\n**[[Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107 (President of the National Assembly)|Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107]] (26 June 1963 \u2013 6 May 1967)\n**[[Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107]] (6 May 1967 \u2013 6 May 1969)\n**[[Dragoslav Markovi\u0107]] (6 May 1969 \u2013 19 April 1974)\n**[[\u017divan Vasiljevi\u0107]] (19 April \u2013 6 May 1974)\n*'''Presidents of the Presidency (1974\u20131990)'''\n**[[Dragoslav Markovi\u0107]] (6 May 1974 \u2013 5 May 1978)\n**[[Dobrivoje Vidi\u0107]] (5 May 1978 \u2013 5 May 1982)\n**[[Nikola Ljubi\u010di\u0107]] (5 May 1982 \u2013 5 May 1984)\n**[[Du\u0161an \u010ckrebi\u0107]] (5 May 1984 \u2013 5 May 1986)\n**[[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]] (5 May 1986 \u2013 14 December 1987)\n**[[Petar Gra\u010danin]] (14 December 1987 \u2013 20 March 1989)\n**[[Ljubi\u0161a Igi\u0107]] (20 March \u2013 8 May 1989) (acting)\n**[[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] (8 May 1989 \u2013 28 September 1990)\n\n===Prime Ministers===\n*'''Minister for Serbia in Yugoslav government'''\n** [[Ja\u0161a Prodanovi\u0107]] (7 March 1945 \u2013 9 April 1945)\n*'''President of the Government'''\n**[[Blagoje Ne\u0161kovi\u0107]] (9 April 1945 \u2013 5 September 1948)\n**[[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] (5 September 1948 \u2013 5 February 1953)\n*'''President of the Executive Council'''\n**[[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] (5 February 1953 \u2013 16 December 1953) \n**[[Jovan Veselinov]] (16 December 1953 \u2013 6 April 1957)\n**[[Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107]] (6 April 1957 \u2013 9 June 1962)\n**[[Slobodan Penezi\u0107 Krcun]] (9 June 1962 \u2013 6 November 1964)\n**[[Stevan Doronjski]] (Acting; 6 November 1964 \u2013 17 November 1964)\n**[[Dragi Stamenkovi\u0107]] (17 November 1964 \u2013 6 June 1967)\n**[[\u0110urica Jojki\u0107]] (6 June 1967 \u2013 7 May 1969)\n**[[Milenko Bojani\u0107]] (7 May 1969 \u2013 6 May 1974) \n**[[Du\u0161an \u010ckrebi\u0107]] (6 May 1974 \u2013 6 May 1978) \n**[[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]] (6 May 1978 \u2013 5 May 1982) \n**[[Branislav Ikoni\u0107]] (5 May 1982 \u2013 6 May 1986)\n**[[Desimir Jevti\u0107]] (6 May 1986 \u2013 5 December 1989)  \n**[[Stanko Radmilovi\u0107]] (5 December 1989 \u2013 28 September 1990)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Serbia]]\n* [[History of Serbia]]\n* [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

It was the largest constituent republic in terms of population and territory. Its capital, [[Belgrade]], was also the federal capital of Yugoslavia.\n\n==History==\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{Main|Axis occupation of Serbia|Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia}}\nAfter the collapse of [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] on 18 April 1941 Yugoslavia was partitioned between Axis forces. The territory of later SR Serbia was mainly occupied by German forces, with puppet Government in Belgrade. The region of Kosovo was annexed by [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939\u20131943)|Albania]], [[Ba\u010dka]] by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Srem District|Syrmia]] by [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and southeastern parts were occupied by [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]]. [[Banat (1941\u201344)|Banat]] had its own autonomous status.\n\nIn the beginning of the occupation there were two resistance armies: [[Chetniks]] and [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. Yet, Chetniks started open collaboration with Axis forces in 1943.\n\nIn July 1941 socialist republic was founded by partisans in western Serbia, known as [[Republic of U\u017eice]]. However, the German offensive crushed this proto-state in December the same year. After this partisan main forces moved to Bosnia.\n\nTogether with Soviet and other allies first parts of Serbia were liberated in 1944. Many cities were heavily bombed by western allies. First major city to be liberated was [[Ni\u0161]] on 14 October, followed by capital [[Belgrade]] on 20 October 1944.\n\n=== Post-World War II period ===\n\n==== 1940s\u20131950s ====\n{{History of Serbia}}\nIn April 1945, the [[Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Serbia]] officially created the ''Federated State of Serbia'' ({{lang-sr|\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430}} / ''Federalna Dr\u017eava Srbija''), as a [[federated state]] within Yugoslavia. In January 1946, after the first constitution of federal Yugoslavia was adopted, the Federated State of Serbia was renamed to ''People's Republic of Serbia'' ({{lang-sr|\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430}} / ''Narodna Republika Srbija''). It also had two autonomous units, [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (1945-1963)|Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945-1963)|Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija]].\n\n==== 1960s ====\nIn 1966 one of the most prominent Serbs in the Communist party and also vice-president of Yugoslavia and founder of Yugoslav intelligence agency [[OZNA]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] was removed from positions due to allegations of spying on SFRY President [[Josip Broz Tito]].\n\n==== 1970s ====\nAfter [[Croatian Spring|the Croatian Spring]] in 1971, almost whole party leadership of Serbia was removed from office, under the charge of being \"liberal\". [[Latinka Perovi\u0107]] and [[Marko Nikezi\u0107]] were marked as leaders of this liberal movement inside League of Communists of Serbia.\n\nIn 1974 new constitution was adopted, increasing the powers of provinces, and making them ''de facto'' republics. For the first time the institution of president was formed, as [[President of the Presidency of SR Serbia|President of the Presidency of Socialist Republic of Serbia]]. Assembly was electing 15 members of the presidency and one president for a 4 -year term, and later 2-year term. The new constitution practically suspended Serbia's authority over the provinces.\n\nAfter the new constitution was adopted, mistakes became obvious. [[Dragoslav Markovi\u0107]], then President of Serbia ordered a secret study on this issue. The study was completed in 1977 and was named ''The Blue Book''. \n\n==== 1980s\u20131990s ====\nFor most of its existence in the SFRY, Serbia was loyal and generally subordinate to the federal government. This changed after the death of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in 1980, when Albanian, as well as Serbian [[nationalism]] in Kosovo arose. In 1981 a [[1981 protests in Kosovo|major protests erupted in Kosovo]] demanding the status of republic. The League of Communists was split on how to respond. At the same time, economic crisis in Yugoslavia started. The leaders of the country were unable to make any reforms, thanks to the political instability.\n\nPresident of League of Communists of Serbia [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] visited Kosovo in April 1987 and promised rapid action in order to protect peace and Serbs of Kosovo. Ethnic tensions in Kosovo were heated up when Kosovo Albanian soldier opened fire on his fellow soldiers in [[Para\u0107in]], in an event known as [[Para\u0107in massacre]]. Then [[President of Serbia]] [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]] wanted to make compromise, rather than fast solution. He found himself in a clash with Milo\u0161evi\u0107. This conflict culminated with [[8th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia|8th Session]] and replacement of Stamboli\u0107 with [[Petar Gra\u010danin]] as President of Serbia.\n\nIn 1988 and 1989 a successful [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution|round of coups in the Communist party leadership]], known as ''[[Anti-bureaucratic revolution|Antibureucratic revolution]]'', in Vojvodina, Kosovo as well as Montenegro, replaced autonomous leaderships in this regions. The coups were led by [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]; supporter of  Serbian nationalism. The events were condemned by the [[communist]] governments of the western Yugoslav republics (especially [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]), who successfully resisted the attempts to expand the revolt onto their territories, and turned against Milo\u0161evi\u0107. The rising antagonism eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1990, and subsequently in the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn 1989, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was elected as President of Serbia. He demanded that the federal Yugoslav government act for the interests of Serbia in Kosovo by sending in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] to suppress separatism in the province. At the same time, several reforms of federal electoral system were proposed, with Serbia supporting a \"one-citizen, one-vote\" system, which would have given a majority of votes to Serbs. By that time, ethnic tensions in Yugoslavia increased, and the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] collapsed, followed by the crisis of federal institutions. After these events, in 1989 Assembly of Socialist Republic of Serbia voted for constitution amendments that revoked high autonomy for provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo.\n\nAfter Slovenian authorities forbid a group of Serbs supporting his politics to gather in Ljubljana, Milosevic started a trade war with [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]] in late 1989. This Serbian-Slovenian conflict culminated in January 1990 on [[14th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] when Slovenians left the meeting followed by Croatian delegates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/28/world/upheaval-east-yugoslavia-sign-bad-times-yugoslavia-trade-war-between-two.html|title=UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Yugoslavia;   A Sign of Bad Times in Yugoslavia: Trade War Between Two Republics|last=|first=|date=28 January 1990|website=[[The New York Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1990, the state was known simply as ''[[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Republic of Serbia]]'' ({{lang-sr|\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430}} / ''Republika Srbija''), and in December of the same year, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was elected as first President of the Republic. In 1992, when the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was formed, Serbia became one of its two constituent republics. In 2003 this state union was re-formed into [[Serbia and Montenegro]], and in 2006 [[Serbia]] became an independent republic after [[Montenegro]] separated.\n[[File:Flag of the Serbian Partisans.svg|thumb|Flag of Federal State of Serbia in 1945]]\n[[File:FederalStateofSerbia.png|none|thumb|Map of Federal State of Serbia in 1945]]\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Medjuopstinske regionalne zajednice Socijalisticke Republike Srbije.png|thumb|right|220px|Administrative divisions of SR Serbia 1974\u20131990]]\n\nWithin Socialist Republic of Serbia two autonomous provinces existed: [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]]. The central part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia located outside of the two autonomous provinces was generally known as \"[[Central Serbia|Serbia proper]]\" (''\"U\u017ea Srbija\"'').\n\nGeographically SR Serbia bordered [[Hungary]] to the north, [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the east and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] to the south-west. Within Yugoslavia, it bordered [[SR Macedonia]] to the south and [[SR Montenegro]][[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina|, Bosnia and Herzegovina]] [[SR Croatia|and Croatia]] to the west.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n===1971 census===\nIn 1971, total population of the Socialist Republic of Serbia numbered 8,446,591 people, including:\n*[[Serbs]] = 6,142,071 (72.71%)\n*[[Albanians]] = 984,761 (11.66%)\n*[[Hungarians]] = 430,314 (5.10%)\n*[[Croats]] = 184,913 (2.19%)\n*[[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] = 154,330 (1.83%) \n*[[Yugoslavs]] = 123,824 (1.47%)\n*[[Slovaks]] = 76,733 (0.82%)\n*[[Romanians]] = 57,419 (0.62%)\n*[[Bulgarians]] = 53,800 (0.58%)\n*[[Romani people|Romani]] = 49,894 (0.54%)\n*[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] = 42,675 (0.46%)\n*[[Pannonian Rusyns|Rusyns]] = 20,608 (0.22%)\n*[[Turkish people|Turks]] = 18,220 (0.20%)\n*[[Slovenes]] = 15,957 (0.17%)\n*[[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] = 14,724 (0.16%)\n\n===1981 census===\nIn 1981, total population of the Socialist Republic of Serbia numbered 9,313,677 people, including:\n*[[Serbs]] = 6,331,527 (67.96%)\n*[[Albanians]] = 1,303,032 (13.99%)\n*[[Yugoslavs]] = 441,941 (4.75%)\n*[[Hungarians]] = 390,468 (4.19%)\n*[[Muslims (ethnic group)|Muslims]] = 215,166 (2.31%)\n*[[Croats]] = 149,368 (1.60%)\n*[[Romani people|Romani]] = 110,956 (1.19%)\n*[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] = 48,986 (0.53%)\n*[[Slovenes]] = 12,006 (0.13%)\n\n==Politics==\nIn the Socialist Republic, the only legal political party was the [[League of Communists of Serbia]] (SKS), which was part of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (SKJ). The party remained relatively stable and loyal to the federal party until the late 1980s, when the party became split over what action to take in Kosovo when protests and fights broke out between ethnic Albanians and Serbs.\n\nThe more traditional Communists supported President [[Ivan Stambolic]], who advocated continued neutrality as a means to solve the dispute; while more radical and nationalist-leaning members supported [[Slobodan Milosevic]], who advocated the protection of [[Kosovo Serbs]], who had claimed that their population was being pressured to leave Kosovo by Albanian separatists. Milosevic utilized public sentiment and opposition to [[Kosovo Albanian]] separatism to rally large numbers of supporters to help him overthrow the Communist leadership in Vojvodina, Kosovo and the Socialist Republic of Montenegro in what was known as the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]. Afterward, the Serbian League of Communists selected Milosevic as its leader. Milosevic took a hard stand on Albanian nationalism in Kosovo and pressured the Yugoslav government to give him emergency powers to deal with Kosovo Albanian separatists. Furthermore, he reduced the autonomy of the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina and installed politicians loyal to him to serve as their representatives.\n \nIn the congress of the Yugoslav League of Communists in 1990, Milosevic and his subordinate representatives for Vojvodina, Kosovo and the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] attempted to silence opposition from the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]] who opposed the actions taken against Kosovo Albanian leadership, by blocking all reforms proposed by the Slovene representatives. The tactic failed and Slovenia, along with its ally Croatia, abdicated from the Yugoslav Communist Party. This caused the Yugoslav Communist party to fall apart, and then the state of Yugoslavia itself one year later.\n\n==Heads of institutions==\n\n===Chairman of ASNOS (1944\u20131945)===\n*[[Sini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107]] (12 November 1944 - 7 April 1945)\n\n===Presidents===\n*'''President of the Presidium of the People's Assembly (1945\u20131953)'''\n**[[Sini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107]] (7 April 1945 \u2013 March 1953)\n*'''Presidents of the National Assembly (1953\u20131974)'''\n**[[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] (December 1953 \u2013 April 1957)\n**[[Jovan Veselinov]] (April 1957 \u2013 26 June 1963)\n**[[Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107 (President of the National Assembly)|Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107]] (26 June 1963 \u2013 6 May 1967)\n**[[Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107]] (6 May 1967 \u2013 6 May 1969)\n**[[Dragoslav Markovi\u0107]] (6 May 1969 \u2013 19 April 1974)\n**[[\u017divan Vasiljevi\u0107]] (19 April \u2013 6 May 1974)\n*'''Presidents of the Presidency (1974\u20131990)'''\n**[[Dragoslav Markovi\u0107]] (6 May 1974 \u2013 5 May 1978)\n**[[Dobrivoje Vidi\u0107]] (5 May 1978 \u2013 5 May 1982)\n**[[Nikola Ljubi\u010di\u0107]] (5 May 1982 \u2013 5 May 1984)\n**[[Du\u0161an \u010ckrebi\u0107]] (5 May 1984 \u2013 5 May 1986)\n**[[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]] (5 May 1986 \u2013 14 December 1987)\n**[[Petar Gra\u010danin]] (14 December 1987 \u2013 20 March 1989)\n**[[Ljubi\u0161a Igi\u0107]] (20 March \u2013 8 May 1989) (acting)\n**[[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] (8 May 1989 \u2013 28 September 1990)\n\n===Prime Ministers===\n*'''Minister for Serbia in Yugoslav government'''\n** [[Ja\u0161a Prodanovi\u0107]] (7 March 1945 \u2013 9 April 1945)\n*'''President of the Government'''\n**[[Blagoje Ne\u0161kovi\u0107]] (9 April 1945 \u2013 5 September 1948)\n**[[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] (5 September 1948 \u2013 5 February 1953)\n*'''President of the Executive Council'''\n**[[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] (5 February 1953 \u2013 16 December 1953) \n**[[Jovan Veselinov]] (16 December 1953 \u2013 6 April 1957)\n**[[Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107]] (6 April 1957 \u2013 9 June 1962)\n**[[Slobodan Penezi\u0107 Krcun]] (9 June 1962 \u2013 6 November 1964)\n**[[Stevan Doronjski]] (Acting; 6 November 1964 \u2013 17 November 1964)\n**[[Dragi Stamenkovi\u0107]] (17 November 1964 \u2013 6 June 1967)\n**[[\u0110urica Jojki\u0107]] (6 June 1967 \u2013 7 May 1969)\n**[[Milenko Bojani\u0107]] (7 May 1969 \u2013 6 May 1974) \n**[[Du\u0161an \u010ckrebi\u0107]] (6 May 1974 \u2013 6 May 1978) \n**[[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]] (6 May 1978 \u2013 5 May 1982) \n**[[Branislav Ikoni\u0107]] (5 May 1982 \u2013 6 May 1986)\n**[[Desimir Jevti\u0107]] (6 May 1986 \u2013 5 December 1989)  \n**[[Stanko Radmilovi\u0107]] (5 December 1989 \u2013 28 September 1990)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Serbia]]\n* [[History of Serbia]]\n* [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

Despite lots of major outlets reporting on this, it was revealed that the budget was actually closer to \u00a3100,000,000. The lack of budget and ambition from owner [[Stan Kroenke]], led many fans to grow infuriated, and begin protesting his ownership with the hashtag #WeCareDoYou.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/15/arsenal-supporter-groups-join-together-criticism-unpopular-owner-stan-kroenke-10315047/|title=Arsenal supporter groups unite in criticism of unpopular owner Stan Kroenke|date=2019-07-15|website=Metro|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 July, Arsenal began the pre-season tour with an emphatic 3\u20130 friendly win over [[Colorado Rapids]] with Martinelli scoring on his non-competitive debut. The Arsenal players featured were mostly youth players with [[Mesut \u00d6zil]], [[Alexandre Lacazette]] and [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] also involved, being introduced from the bench.\n\nOn 17 July, Arsenal played against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in California in the [[2019 International Champions Cup]] and prevailed 2\u20131 with Eddie Nketiah scoring the winning goal. Three days later the Gunners continued this winning form with a 3\u20130 victory over [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in Charlotte with a brace by Nketiah and a goal by Joe Willock. Three more days later Arsenal faced [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in Landover in the Gunners' third and final International Champions Cup match. Arsenal were leading 2\u20130 through Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but Real hit back with the troubled [[Gareth Bale]] halving the deficit and [[Marco Asensio]] scoring the equaliser. The match ended 2\u20132 thus resulting in a penalty shootout with the Gunners subsequently losing 3\u20132. In addition both teams ended the match with 10 men. This meant that Arsenal finished in 3rd place, their best ever result in the competition.\n\nOn 25 July, Arsenal completed the signing of French teenage centre-back [[William Saliba]] from [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]] for a reported fee of \u00a327 million. However, he was loaned back to the French club for the 2019\u201320 season. Arsenal also completed a season-long loan deal for Spanish midfielder [[Dani Ceballos]] from [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]].\n\nOn 26 July, Arsenal pair [[Mesut \u00d6zil]] and [[Sead Kola\u0161inac]] were involved in a carjacking attempt by a gang of armed robbers in London near Golders Green, where there was footage of Kola\u0161inac chasing the gangsters. Both players were targeted by the gang but it was confirmed by the club that the pair escaped uninjured and were safe.\n\nOn 28 July, Arsenal played in the [[2019 Emirates Cup|Emirates Cup]] for the first time since 2017 but lost 1\u20132 at home to French team [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]. The Gunners failed to win the Emirates Cup for the first time since 2014.\n\nOn 31 July, Arsenal played a friendly game against [[Angers SCO|Angers]] who were celebrating the 100th anniversary of the French club's establishment. The match ended in a 1\u20131 draw, meaning a penalty shootout had to decide the winner. The Gunners won the shootout 4\u20133 with Arsenal goalkeeper [[Emiliano Mart\u00ednez]] saving the decisive spot-kick from ex-Arsenal player [[Jeff Reine-Adela\u00efde]].\n\nOn 1 August, Arsenal made the signing of Ivory Coast winger [[Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9]] from [[Ligue 1]] team [[Lille OSC|Lille]] for a club record \u00a372 million.\n\nOn 4 August, Arsenal also played against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on the [[Joan Gamper Trophy]] at the [[Camp Nou]]. The Gunners lost 2\u20131 with [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] scoring the only goal in the first half giving Arsenal the lead going into half time. However, a horrible own goal from [[Ainsley Maitland-Niles]] and a 90th-minute winner from [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] gave [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] the win in Arsenal's final pre-season fixture. Also during the day, [[Takuma Asano]] left the club, joining [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] for \u00a3900,000, after not playing a single minute for the Gunners in his three years at the club.\n\nOn 6 August, then-captain [[Laurent Koscielny]] left Arsenal to join [[Ligue 1]] club [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] for a reported fee of \u00a34.6 million after nine years at the club.\n\nOn 7 August, [[Carl Jenkinson]] left the club and joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] for a fee of \u00a32 million.\n\nOn 8 August, transfer deadline day, the Gunners signed left-back [[Kieran Tierney]] from [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for a reported \u00a325 million fee and centre-back [[David Luiz]] from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a reported \u00a38 million fee three hours later. Moreover, [[Alex Iwobi]] joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for \u00a328 million which could rise to \u00a335 million and the recently promoted [[Eddie Nketiah]] joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on a season long loan.\n\n===August===\n\nArsenal began the season with a 1\u20130 win at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], courtesy of a goal by [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]], in the Premier League on 11 August. The following week, the Gunners played [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in their first home match of the season on 17 August. They won 2\u20131, with goals by [[Alexandre Lacazette]] and Aubameyang. Their third match of the season came at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 24 August. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 made his first start for the club, but Arsenal ended the day losing 3\u20131 at Anfield after two goals by [[Mohamed Salah]] and a header by [[Jo\u00ebl Matip]]. [[Lucas Torreira]]'s first goal for the season was a late consolation. Arsenal ended August third in the table with six points from a possible nine in the league. On 30 August, Arsenal learned their Europa League group stage opponents. They would be [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] of Germany, [[Vit\u00f3ria S.C.|Vit\u00f3ria]] of Portugal and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] of Belgium. The following day, [[Nacho Monreal]] was surprisingly sold to [[Real Sociedad]], ending a six-and-a-half year association with the club.\n\n=== September ===\nArsenal started September with the first [[North London derby]] at the Emirates Stadium against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 1 September. An early goal by [[Christian Eriksen]] and a [[Harry Kane]] penalty made it 2\u20130 in Tottenham's favour, but Alexandre Lacazette halved the deficit during first-half stoppage-time and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored an equaliser, making it 2\u20132. A late [[Sokratis Papastathopoulos|Sokratis]] goal was disallowed for offside to deny Arsenal a comeback win, meaning that the derby ended in a 2\u20132 draw. The following day on the European transfer deadline day, Arsenal loaned [[Mohamed Elneny]] to Turkish team [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]] and [[Henrikh Mkhitaryan]] to Italian club [[AS Roma|Roma]], but no move materialised for defender [[Shkodran Mustafi]] following a summer of speculation on his future at the club.\n\nOn 15 September, following the international break Arsenal continued the Premier League campaign with a 2\u20132 draw at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], despite a double by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang putting them 2\u20130 up. \n\nAfter such a capitulation at Vicarage Road, Arsenal's spirits were dampened when they headed to Germany to face Eintracht Frankfurt in the opening Europa League group stage fixture. In one of the more high-key games, Arsenal named a young lineup packed with potential.  First, a brilliant through-ball from 18 year old academy product, Bukayo Saka, found Joe Willock. The young Englishman burst into the box, and saw his shot deflect of Eintracht defender David Abraham and put Arsenal ahead at the break. \nThe turning point came with eleven minutes to go. Already booked for a clip on Saka, Dominik Kohr was subsequently sent off for pulling back substitute Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. With five minutes remaining, Saka capped off a superb debut performance with a stunning low strike to make it 2\u20130 in Arsenals favour. Two minutes later, he slipped in Aubameyang to wrap it up, and he duly rolled home to wrap up 3\u20130 victory over the struggling ten-man Eagles. \n\nLater that week, the Gunners played host to Aston Villa in the Premier League's sixth round of fixtures. But at half-time, Arsenal found themselves a man and a goal behind after John McGinn stroked home Anwar El Ghazi's cross on twenty minutes, prior to Ainsley Maitland-Niles being sent off for a reckless challenge on Neil Taylor. \nHowever, a minute short of the hour mark, man of the match Matteo Guendouzi burst into the box before being hauled down by Villa defender Engels. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 stepped up to take the subsequent spot-kick, and duly drilled down the middle to make it 1\u20131. \nHowever, a minute later Villa were back in front through striker Wesley Morales, but Calum Chambers made it 2\u20132 nine minutes short of full-time with his first Arsenal goal in two years. \nAnd then, three minutes later, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang bent home a terrific free-kick to earn Arsenal a dramatic 3\u20132 win and become just the ninth side in Premier League history to win a match despite trailing by both a man and a goal at any point of the game. \n\nThe Gunners then recorded the largest competitive win of the Unai Emery era when they progressed to the fourth round of the Football League Cup after thrashing Championship outfit Nottingham Forest 5\u20130. Debutant Gabriel Martinelli opened and closed the scoring, first with a bullet header and then with a deflected long-range strike. Meanwhile, Kieran Tierney made his Arsenal debut whilst Rob Holding scored on his return from a long-term knee injury, planting a header home just a minute after becoming Arsenal captain. Hector Beller\u00edn then made his return from injury off the bench, marking it with an assist for Joe Willock. Meanwhile, Reiss Nelson grabbed his first Gunners goal whilst Calum Chambers made three assists in a night of positives for Arsenal. \n\nHowever, they were unable to provide such class next time out as a dull affair at Old Trafford against Manchester United ended in an uninspiring 1\u20131 stalemate. United lead 1\u20130 at the break courtesy of Scott McTominays stunning strike on the strike of half-time. However, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang levelled after Bukayo Saka pounced on a loose ball from Axel Tuanzebe to release the Gabonese. However, despite the initial decision being offside, a VAR check confirmed the goal would stand.\n\n===October===\n\nArsenal then kept up their fine midweek form with a 4\u20130 hammering of Belgian minnows Standard Li\u00e8ge in the Europa League. Gabriel Martinelli was again on the double, netting twice in the opening sixteen minutes before Joe Willock got the third after showing good composure to put away Reiss Nelson's rebounded attempt. Dani Ceballos added the fourth early in the second half with his first Gunners goal to keep them top of the group, before they then climbed to third in the Premier League ladder after David Luiz's first goal for the club on nine minutes earned them an unconvincing 1\u20130 home win against Bournemouth. Little did the Gunners know how much longer they would have to wait for a league win.\n\nAfter the international break, which saw multiple Gunners in action for their countries, Arsenal's return to action was spoiled with what was just their second defeat all season long when Sheffield United managed a 1\u20130 win at Brammall Lane, thanks to Lys Moussets clever finish on the half hour mark, replicating their famous win in 2007. \n\nAnd it looked to be two defeats from two come the restart of football after goals from Marcus Edwards and Bruno Duarte, either side of a fine Gabriel Martinelli header, had put unfancied Portuguese side Vitoria SC on the brink of a famous Europa League win at the Emirates Stadium. However, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 proved the difference of the bench when he netted to stunning, world-class free-kicks, first in the 80th minute and then again in the 92nd, to earn Arsenal a relieving 3\u20132 victory and make progression to the next round all but assured. \n\nAnd the team looked high on confidence when two goals inside the first ten minutes from defenders Sokratis Papastathopolous and David Luiz put them in firm control against a solid Crystal Palace side. However, the Eagles retorted by halving the deficit via Luka Milivojevic's penalty shortly before the break, before Andre Ayew nodded home on 52 minutes to make it 2\u20132. \nLater in the game, struggling and much-criticised Swiss captain Granit Xhaka was substituted following another poor performance, but boos echoing about the stadium didn't help matters, and after swearing at supporters, he ripped of his shirt and stormed  down the tunnel. He wouldn't appear for the side again for nearly a month and also had the captaincy title stripped from him. \nLate on, though, Papastathopolous thought he had won it after smashing home following a touchline scramble, but the goal was incorrectly disallowed by VAR due to Calum Chambers\u2019 \u201cinfringement\u201d on Luka Milivojevic. And so Arsenal has to settle for a point in a dramatic but damaging encounter at the Emirates Stadium. \n\nFollowing the Crystal Palace draw, Arsenal lay in fifth position, and results continued to downturn after the Gunners exited the League Cup after leaving Anfield empty-handed following a 5\u20134 penalty shootout defeat to Liverpool. \nBut it was  the manner of how the game descended to penalties that will make this match live long in the memory. In one of the most high-scoring encounters in Arsenal's history, the Gunners drew 5\u20135 with Jurgen Klopp's high-flying Reds side. The games opening goal came just six minutes in, when Liverpool debutant Neco Williams hurled a wonderful ball over the top to former Gunner Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who's low cross was knocked into the net by Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi. \nHowever, on nineteen minutes, Liverpool's goalkeeper Caiomhin Kelleher couldn't keep out Bukayo Saka's attempt, gifting Lucas Torreira an equaliser. Arsenal then took the lead after Gabriel Martinelli pounced on a similar goalkeeping error by the Irishman, before Martinelli notched his second to make it 3\u20131 after converting Bukayo Saka's low cross. \nNonetheless, Liverpool managed to navigate a route back into the game when Martinelli clipped Harvey Elliot in the Arsenal box. James Milner buried the subsequent spot-kick to cut the deficit to 3\u20132. \nHowever, a Milner error, an ingenious Mesut Ozil flick and a simple Maitland-Niles finish put Arsenal 4\u20132 ahead on 54 minutes. However, quickfire screamers from Oxlade-Chamberlain and Divock Origi levelled the game at 4\u20134, before Joe Willock's 30-yard rocket put Arsenal in front. \nHowever, there was stoppage-time heartbreak for the Gunners, as Origi netted his second of the night with an acrobatic volley to signal penalties at the end of the most high-scoring match in League Cup history. \nDespite the first six penalties being converted, it was Dani Ceballos who missed first, as his penalty was blocked by Kelleher. Despite Maitland-Niles converting, Curtis Jones scored the winning spot-kick as Arsenal exited the tournament in the most dramatic of fashions.\n\n\n\n===November===\n\nArsenal began November the same way they ended October: drawing two games in succession. Both matches ended 1\u20131, first at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League. Arsenal had taken the lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 50th goal for the club(in just his 78th appearance),  but were pegged back late on after Raul Jiminez nodded home Joao Moutinho lobbed cross with sixteen minutes to play. \nThe next one was against Vitoria SC, a game which also ended 1\u20131 in what could be argued as Emery's worst game at the helm of Arsenal. The Gunners managed just one shot on target and one accurate pass into the box, both of which came for the goal, as Shkodran Mustafi nodded home Nicolas Pepe's delightful free-kick delivery, but in stoppage time Bruno Duarte's acrobatic volley managed to worm its way through a crowd of Arsenal bodies on the line, with manager Unai Emery now under serious pressure. \n\nResults were not appearing to change. Later in the week, the Gunners went six games without a win after two quickfire second-half goals from Jamie Vardy and James Maddison saw Leicester City secure a 2\u20130 win over the struggling North Londoners, leaving them sixth. \n\nRumours were rife throughout the international break that Emery was on the brink of the sack, but he was still on the touchline in the Gunners' home fixture with Southampton. After an early Danny Ings goal but Saints ahead, Alexandre Lacazette got his first goal since September to level it at 1\u20131. \nHowever, with just under 20 minutes to go, Kieran Tierney clipped Ings as the visitors were gifted a chance to retake the lead. Despite Bernd Leno blocking the initial spot-kick, James Ward-Prowse scored on the rebound to make it 1\u20132. \nSouthampton seemed on the verge of collecting a famous win, however Lacazette spoiled that dream when he lashed home a Martinelli cross in the 96th minute, rescuing a point for Arsenal in a 2\u20132 draw. \n\nWith Emery now teetering on the edge, it was reported that he had one last game to save himself, namely the Europa League fixture at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Despite their recent form, Arsenal appeared as favourites, as they were chasing an eighth straight European win at the Emirates, something never managed before, and had also, of course, won the reverse fixture 3\u20130 in Germany. \nHowever, despite leading 1\u20130 at half-time through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyangs deflected strike, a swift double from Japanese international, Daichi Kamada, earned Frankfurt a shock 2\u20131 win and left Emery hanging by a thread. \n\nAt 10 AM BST, on 29th of November 2019, Unai Emery was sacked by Arsenal following the chastening Frankfurt defeat. Soon after, former assistant coach and \u201cInvincble\u201d Freddie Ljungberg earned the caretaker boss role, with his first game due to be away to struggling Norwich City.\n\n===December===\n\nFreddie Ljungberg's first match as interim boss was staged at Carrow Road against Norwich, on 1 December 2019. Despite Arsenal dominating the early exchanges, it was the home side who took the lead after Teemu Pukki's deflected strike crawled into the net. However, less than a minute later, a handball by Norwich defender Christoph Zimmerman gifted Arsenal a route back into the game via just their second penalty kick of the season. However a poor penalty by Aubameyang was blocked by Timo Krul. However, encroachment in the penalty area saw Aubameyang gifted a retake, and he buried the second attempt, making it 1\u20131. However, Norwich retook the lead in the second minute of first half stoppage time via Todd Cantwell, but Aubameyangs second goal, coupled with some super saves by Bernd Leno, saw Ljungberg's first match end in an enthralling 2\u20132 draw.\n\nLjungbergs first home match in charge of the Gunners took place against Brighton And Hove Albion on 5th December 2019, but a listless  first half performance saw Brighton lead 1\u20130 thanks to Adam Websters  fierce strike. \nHowever, a clever looping header from Alexandre Lacazette five minutes into the second half got Arsenal level,  before David Luiz had a smart header disallowed for offside. Then, man of the match Aaron Mooy bent in a terrific cross to Neal Maupay, who duly nodded home to seal a stunning 2\u20131 Brighton victory and extend Arsenal's win-less run in all competitions to nine games. \n\nAnd it  looked certain to be ten after Angelo Ogbonna's weak header had West Ham United ahead at the London Stadium on 38 minutes. It had been another lifeless performance from the Gunners, but on the hour mark, a lovely through-ball from Lucas Torreira was cut back by Sead Kolasinac to Gabriel Martinelli, who rifled home to mark his first Premier League start with a well-taken goal. \nAnd six minutes later, it was 2\u20131 after Nicolas Pepe cut away from Arthur Masuaku before bending a terrific strike into the far corner. Mesut Ozil's  pass was then played on to Pepe by an Aubameyang back-heel three minutes later, with the Ivorian's  lofted cross volleyed home by Aubameyang, sealing a much-needed 3\u20131 victory and restore the Gunners to the top ten. \n\nHigh on spirits following the West Ham victory, Arsenal travelled to Belgium to face Standard Liege. So long as  they avoided a five-goal defeat the Gunners would qualify, whilst top spot would be assured with a win, or failure for Eintracht Frankfurt to beat bottom-placed Vitoria at home. \n\nAfter a dead first-half, Standard Liege took a much-needed lead on 47 minutes after Samuel Bastien's deflected attempted hobbled over the line. And  when Selim Amallah made it 2\u20130 with  a similarly deflected effort on 69 minutes, and Frankfurt leading 2\u20131, it seemed as though Arsenal  would have to settle for second place. \nHowever, a wonderful Bukayo Saka cross was powered home by the head of Alexandre Lacazette, before, with nine minutes to go, Arsenal completed the comeback when a quick one-two between Saka and Gabriel Martinelli saw the former's low shot skim into the net, as the match ended 2\u20132. That, coupled with Eintrachts 2\u20133 home loss to Vitoria, meant Arsenal finished top of Group F, having accrued 11 points from three wins, two draws and one loss. \n\nDespite the recent upturn in results, the Gunners were brought right back down to earth when a first-half blitz from champions Manchester City saw the Citizens run out 3\u20130 winners at Emirates Stadium. An individual masterclass from Kevin De Bruyne was the foundation for City's victory, with the Belgian play-maker opening and closing the scoring with stunning strikes, whilst also setting up Raheem Sterling's  goal on fifteen minutes. \n\nOn the sixteenth of December 2019, the UEFA Europa League Round-of-32 draw was made. Arsenal, as a seeded side, avoided the big guns such as Sevilla, Manchester United, Ajax or Inter Milan. They were drawn against Greek giants and established European side Olympiacos, with the first leg to be staged in Athens.\n\nAfter leading them to just one win in five games as caretaker, Freddie Ljungberg was unable to become Arsenals new long-term boss, as former player Mikel Arteta was appointed as the new manager on the 20th December 2019. After retirement in May 2016, Arteta had spent three years as assistant coach of Manchester City, winning two Premier League titles, seven trophies and was widely praised by manager Pep Guardiola and several other players.\n\nDespite the appointment, Arteta was obliged to watch Freddie Ljungbergs final Arsenal game from the stands, in a tricky trip to an Everton side in a similar predicament to the Gunners. However, a listless performance from both sides saw a dull game end 0\u20130, the Gunners first goalless stalemate since December 2017, when they drew 0\u20130 at West Ham United.\n\nAfter the Christmas Day break, the Gunners were back in action away to AFC Bournemouth on Boxing Day in Mikel Arteta's first game as new boss. After going behind 35 minutes courtesy of a Dan Gosling tap-in, Arsenal drew level after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted similarly easy tap-in, as a high-edged encounter ended 1\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2019/12/report-bournemouth-1-1-arsenal-inc-goals/|title=Report: Bournemouth 1-1 Arsenal (inc.goals)|website=arseblog.news|publisher=Arseblog|date=26 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Gunners final match of the year was staged at the Emirates Stadium against off-colour rivals Chelsea in Mikel Arteta's first home test. However, despite taking a 13th-minute lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyangs header, late goals from Jorginho and Tammy Abraham earned the visitors a 2\u20131 comeback win and denied what would have been a deserving victory for Arsenal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50882583|title=Mikel Arteta loses first home game as Gunners boss|website=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===January===\n\nIf 2019 had ended badly, Arsenal started 2020 in flying fashion, beating Manchester United 2\u20130 to secure a vital New Year's Day win. The Gunners took the lead on eight minutes after Nicolas Pepe guided home Sead Kolasinac's deflected cross, before grabbing the second just before half-time, Greek defender Sokratis Papastathopolous hammering in after David de Gea spilled Alexandre Lacazette's header.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50908732|title=Arsenal 2-0 Man Utd: Gunners secure first win under Mikel Arteta|website=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the euphoria of the United victory, Arsenal faced another fallen giant in the form of Leeds United at home in the third round of the Emirates FA Cup. It was the 17th meeting between the two sides in world football's oldest competition, and the fourth since 2011. That year, Arsenal had won a replay 3\u20131 at Elland Road after a 1\u20131 draw at the Emirates Stadium, and the following year a late Thierry Henry goal sent them through. \n\nHowever, this match had a very different script in contrast to the dominant first-half Man. United display. Arsenal were unable to build out from the back and often succumbed to Leeds' high press, and should have been behind at the break if not for a crossbar and two remarkable Emiliano Mart\u00ednez saves. However, Arsenal did eventually claw their way to a 1\u20130 win, courtesy of Reiss Nelson's scrappy finish early on in the second half, on the receiving end of a deflected cross from man-of-the-match Alexandre Lacazette. The Gunners were duly drawn away to AFC Bournemouth in the following round. \n\nThe Gunners sent both young potentials Tyreece John-Jules and Emile Smith-Rowe on loan for the rest of the season on the 10th of January, to Lincoln City and Huddersfield Town respectively. \n\nArsenal's first match in the road in 2020 was staged at Selhurst Park against an injury-hit Crystal Palace team. Arsenal took a deserved 1\u20130 lead into the break after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang rolled in his 14th goal of the season-and 16th in all competitions, finishing off an 18-pass team move. However, the Gunners conceded their first goal of 2020, with a bloated deflection guiding Jordan Ayew's effort home. Arsenal were then reduced to ten men after captain and goalscorer Aubameyang committed a wild studs-up tackle on Max Meyer. The game finished 1\u20131.\n\nOn the 13th of January, young Arsenal centre-back Konstantinos Mavropanos moved on loan to 1. FC Nurnburg, before Dejan Iliev went on loan to Jagiellonia Bialystok the next day. \n\nWhen back in action, Gabriel Martinelli netted his second Premier League goal in Arsenal's next match, at home to Sheffield United, poking home Bukayo Saka's deflected cross. However, his goal proved fruitless as a late John Fleck goal earned the visitors a 1\u20131 draw.\n\nArsenal faced a tricky trip to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea just over three weeks after losing to the Blues at the Emirates Stadium. They faced a similar outcome after a dreadful back-pass from Shkodran Mustafi left Bernd Leno stranded and Tammy Abraham through on goal. David Luiz hauled him down and received a straight red card, Arsenal's second in two away matches, and gifted Chelsea a penalty. \nJorginho slotted home, and at the break the Gunners trailed 1\u20130. However, after Mustafi cleared from a corner, Gabriel Martinelli picked up the ball 67 yards from goal, and thirteen seconds later, after darting past three players, he coolly passed it past Kepa Arrizabalaga to level things up. But Chelsea regained the lead with six minutes to play after Cesar Azpilicueta poked home a low Callum Hudson-Odoi cross. But in the 87th minute, captain on the night Hector Bellerin scored with what was just Arsenal's second shot of the match, as the ten-man Gunners fought back to earn a highly creditable 2\u20132 draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/21/chelsea-v-arsenal-premier-league-live|title=Chelsea 2-2 Arsenal : Premier League \u2013 as it happened|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nArsenal continued their strong start to 2020 when early goals from Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah-recalled recently from his Leeds United loan spell-ultimately earned them a 2\u20131 win at AFC Bournemouth in the FA Cup fourth round. \nThe Gunners took a fifth-minute lead after a 22-pass move involving all ten outfield players culminated in Saka lashing home off the crossbar. Nketiah then made it 2\u20130 after he laid of to Willock in the area, and Willocks pass to Saka was drilled into Nketiah, who tapped home easily.  \nAfter an insipid first half display, a more courageous Bournemouth team earned a consolation goal via Sam Surridges first for the club in the 94th minute, with the Englishman rounding Emiliano Martinez to slot home.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/27/bournemouth-v-arsenal-fa-cup-fourth-round-live|title=Bournemouth 1-2 Arsenal: FA Cup fourth round \u2013 as it happened|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 January 2020}}</ref> \nThe next day, the Gunners sent James Olayinka to League Two side Northampton Town on loan for the remainder of the season. \n\nOn the 30th of January, Arsenal finally sealed their first signing of the Winter window, bringing in Spanish defender Pablo Mari on loan for the remainder of the season, with an option to buy at the end, from Brazilian side Flamengo. \nOn deadline day, the Gunners completed a second loan until the end of the season with an option to buy. This time it was Southampton full-back Cedric Soares who arrived, a Portuguese right-footer with 120 Premier League appearances to his name already.\n\n===February===\n\nArsenal extended their six-game unbeaten run under Mikel Arteta to seven matches, but were unable to find a winner in a lacklustre goalless draw at Burnley. Despite missing several good chances early on, the Gunners soon found themselves on the back foot, with the Clarets dominating proceedings. They had a number of opportunities to snatch a winner, most notably when Jay Rodriguez hit the bar from six yards out, but ultimately had to settle for a point in what was a dull affair. \n\nAfter the two week winter break, in which the Gunners chiefly spent at a training camp in Dubai, Arsenal played host to Newcastle United in the Premier League. After a dull first half ended goalless, with neither side able to exploit the other, Arsenal took the lead on 54 minutes. Shortly after Nketiah had smacked the crossbar, Nicolas Pepe floated in an enticing cross which Aubameyang nodded home with a firm header. \nThe lead was doubled three minutes later, Pepe drilling home a low Saka cross after good work from the eighteen year old. \nAllan Saint-Maximin hit the post as Newcastle went close a few times, before Mesut Ozil scuffed home substitute Alexandre Lacazette's cross for his first goal in ten months to make it 3\u20130. The build-up to the goal involved all eleven players and 35 passes, the most of any Premier League goal this season. \nThe Gunners grabbed a fourth in the 95th minute, Lacazette getting his first goal in ten games, hammering Pepe's low pass home, wrapping up a thumping, morale boosting 4\u20130 win. \n\nThe big news aside from the Newcastle match, though, was the declaration that Manchester City, placed second in the Premier League, has been banned from the Champions League by UEFA for the next two seasons. That meant if, as was likely, the Citizens retained their second-placed position, then fifth place would ensure Champions League qualification for next season. It was a major boost for the Gunners, who sat just six points away from fifth-placed Spurs, certainly not an insurmountable gap. \n\nBut the second route to Europe's premier club competition in 2020/21 was via winning the UEFA Europa League. To this competition the Gunners turned their attention in the first leg of their last-32 tie against Greeks Olympiacos, in Athens. Once again under Arteta the defence proved steady, but the attack was blunt throughout a dull first half, which ended 0-0. \nThe second half was following a similar script and the  match seemed destined to end goalless, but with nine minutes to play Aubameyang played a neat ball into Saka, who's low cross across goal resulted in his 9th assist of the season, with Lacazette arriving at the near post to grab the winner. \n\nThe Gunners has just three days of respite prior to their massive home clash with European rivals Everton. The Toffees were two points clear of Arsenal in ninth position, and might have further extended their advantage after Dominic Calvert-Lewin's bicycle kick gave the visitors the lead after just 50 seconds, and it might have been more after some counter-attacking openings later on. \nBut Arsenal were not to be denied, and soon drew level after Bukayo Saka, released down the left by Granit Xhaka, bent a terrific cross into Eddie Nketiah, who deftly touched the ball in to level it at one apiece. \nAnd six minutes later, a wonderful David Luiz through-ball released Aubameyang, who raced clear and slotted home for 2\u20131. \nHowever, Everton managed to claw level before half-time, finishing the half as they had started it's: with a goal. This time it was Richarlison, squeezing the ball past Leno after Yerry Mina nodded down Djibril Sidibe's hooked lob. \nBut if Everton had started the first half well, it was Arsenal's turn in the second, with Aubameyang racing ahead of Sidibe to nod Nicolas Pepe's cross home after just twenty-five seconds. Everton searched in vain for an equalizer, with Calvert-Lewin twice going close and Bernd Leno making some remarkable saves. However, Arsenal had the best chance after a giveaway from visiting keeper Jordan Pickford, but Nketiah's attempt bounced off the crossbar, and the relentless Gunners held on for a vital 3\u20132 win. This marked the first time Arsenal has won two consecutive Premier League games since the first two games of the season. \n\nBut all Arsenal's  good form was undone in the second leg of their UEFA Europa League tie against Olympiacos in the last-32. After a goalless first period, and unmarked Pape Cisse header gifted the visiting Greeks a 1\u20130 lead and duly saw them earn extra-time. But when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang notched his 20th goal of the season with a fabulous bicycle kick in the 113th minute, few would have expected what happened next. But it did, with Youssef El-Arabi stretching to slide home a last-gasp winner for Olympiacos; 2\u20131 on the night and away goals on aggregate.\n\n===March===\nWith it mathematically impossible to win the Premier League and out of both the League Cup and Europa League, Arsenal's last chance of a trophy in 2019\u201320 came in the form of the FA Cup. To reach the last eight they needed first to navigate a way past [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] at [[Fratton Park]], a side they had not lost to in 21 games, since a 5\u20134 defeat in 1958. Their most recent encounter had come in 2009, with the Gunners triumphing 4\u20131. Though less stylish, the Gunners nonetheless claimed the necessary result, a routine 2\u20130 win, to earn a spot in the quarter-final draw. They had taken the lead in the fourth minute of first half stoppage time, Sokratis Papastathopolous sweeping home his third of the season with a crisp volley from a low Reiss Nelson cross, before a deflected cross from the English winger on 51 minutes saw Eddie Nketiah taking a touch before flinging the ball into the roof of the net, sealing the win.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Begley |first1=Emlyn |title=Portsmouth 0 Arsenal 2 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51697793 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=3 March 2020 |date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn reward for the win, the Gunners were drawn against fellow Premier League side Sheffield United in the quarter-finals, with the match to be staged at Brammal Lane on the 21st of March. Arsenal had lost there, 1\u20130, in late October, but their most recent encounter with the Blades had come in January, when a late John Fleck goal cancelled out Gabriel Martinelli's opener as the spoils were shared in a 1\u20131 draw. \n\nAs for Arsenal's other goal, a top-five spot in the Premier League, their hopes were significantly boosted with another win (their sixth in eight matches) and clean sheet (their fifth in seven) against West Ham United at the Emirates Stadium. For much of the contest, though, it seemed as if the struggling Hammers would come out on top, but in the end, with the help of VAR, the Gunners eked out the win. Lacazette was the hero, with a winner off the bench on 78 minutes, slotting Mesut \u00d6zil's header into the corner. \n[[David Moyes]], the visiting manager, rued numerous missed chances for the Hammers after his winless run away to Arsenal in the Premier League extended to sixteen games, stating that his side \"did not deserve to lose\", per the BBC,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685402|title=Arsenal 1-0 West Ham: Alexandre Lacazette gives Gunners victory|website=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=7 March 2020|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> whilst Mikel Arteta noted his Arsenal team had \"turned a corner\", now just five points of the top four.\n\nJust a day prior to their trip to Manchester City, it was revealed by Olympiacos and Nottingham Forest owner [[Evangelos Marinakis]] that he had contracted [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], a disease caused by the [[SARS-CoV-2]] virus which causes flu-like symptoms and may be fatal. \nThis, with two days of the total fourteen-day quarantine left, Arsenal postponed their match against Manchester City for the second time that season. \nAnd Arsenal were affected by the virus even more when it was announced that manager Mikel Arteta had tested positive for the virus. Arsenal's entire first-team squad and several staff members were placed into isolation.\n\nLater, when other sides` players, including the whole Chelsea squad, were placed into isolation, a Premier League shareholders meeting concluded that the season could not be continued, and would be postponed until April 3rd. Another shareholders meeting agreed that, with the virus still infecting thousands of people around the world, the deadline for the resumption of league matches would be further extended, until April 30th.\n\n==Players==\n{{Further||Arsenal F.C.#Players}}\n{{Fb si header |age=y}}\n{{Fb si player |bg=y |p={{sortname|Bernd|Leno}} |nb=GER |n=1 |pos=GK  |eu=y |age={{Age|1992|3|4}} |s=2018 |a=66 |g=0 |e=2023 |f=\u00a322.5M}}\n{{Fb si player |bg= |p={{sortname|H\u00e9ctor|Beller\u00edn}} |nb=ESP |n=2 |pos=DF |eu=y |age={{Age|1995|03|19}} |s=2013 |a=195 |g=8 |e=2023 |f=[[Arsenal F.C.

overall season in the top flight and 100th consecutive season in the top flight of English football. The club is participating in the [[2019\u201320 Premier League|Premier League]], the [[2019\u201320 FA Cup|FA Cup]], the [[2019\u201320 EFL Cup|EFL Cup]], and the [[2019-20 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]].\n\n==Review==\n===Pre-season===\n\nArsenal began their off-season by completing some squad alterations. [[Bernd Leno]], [[Reiss Nelson]], [[Joe Willock]], [[Eddie Nketiah]], [[Emile Smith Rowe]] and [[Matt Macey]] all received new squad numbers, the latter five being promoted to the first team from the academy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/arsenal-squad-numbers-player-shirts-15144876|title=Arsenal squad numbers 2018/19|last=Johnson|first=Greg|date=2018-09-12|website=footballlondon|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nArsenal's pre-season tour in America got off to a shaky start with club captain, [[Laurent Koscielny]], refusing to travel. He believed that over his 9 years of service to the club, he had earned the right to terminate his contract despite still having a year left. This led to the club taking disciplinary actions, which included stripping Koscielny of the club captaincy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/soccer/laurent-koscielny-to-be-stripped-of-arsenal-captaincy-with-two-stars-considered-to-take-over/ar-AAEsakT|title=Laurent Koscielny to Be Stripped of Arsenal Captaincy With Two Stars Considered to Take Over|website=www.msn.com|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nArsenal's first summer signing was young Brazilian forward, [[Gabriel Martinelli]], from [[Ituano FC]], for a \u00a36,000,000 fee. The summer was dominated by headlines stating that Arsenal's transfer budget was only \u00a345,000,000. Despite lots of major outlets reporting on this, it was revealed that the budget was actually closer to \u00a3100,000,000. The lack of budget and ambition from owner [[Stan Kroenke]], led many fans to grow infuriated, and begin protesting his ownership with the hashtag #WeCareDoYou.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/15/arsenal-supporter-groups-join-together-criticism-unpopular-owner-stan-kroenke-10315047/|title=Arsenal supporter groups unite in criticism of unpopular owner Stan Kroenke|date=2019-07-15|website=Metro|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 July, Arsenal began the pre-season tour with an emphatic 3\u20130 friendly win over [[Colorado Rapids]] with Martinelli scoring on his non-competitive debut. The Arsenal players featured were mostly youth players with [[Mesut \u00d6zil]], [[Alexandre Lacazette]] and [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] also involved, being introduced from the bench.\n\nOn 17 July, Arsenal played against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in California in the [[2019 International Champions Cup]] and prevailed 2\u20131 with Eddie Nketiah scoring the winning goal. Three days later the Gunners continued this winning form with a 3\u20130 victory over [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in Charlotte with a brace by Nketiah and a goal by Joe Willock. Three more days later Arsenal faced [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in Landover in the Gunners' third and final International Champions Cup match. Arsenal were leading 2\u20130 through Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but Real hit back with the troubled [[Gareth Bale]] halving the deficit and [[Marco Asensio]] scoring the equaliser. The match ended 2\u20132 thus resulting in a penalty shootout with the Gunners subsequently losing 3\u20132. In addition both teams ended the match with 10 men. This meant that Arsenal finished in 3rd place, their best ever result in the competition.\n\nOn 25 July, Arsenal completed the signing of French teenage centre-back [[William Saliba]] from [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]] for a reported fee of \u00a327 million. However, he was loaned back to the French club for the 2019\u201320 season. Arsenal also completed a season-long loan deal for Spanish midfielder [[Dani Ceballos]] from [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]].\n\nOn 26 July, Arsenal pair [[Mesut \u00d6zil]] and [[Sead Kola\u0161inac]] were involved in a carjacking attempt by a gang of armed robbers in London near Golders Green, where there was footage of Kola\u0161inac chasing the gangsters. Both players were targeted by the gang but it was confirmed by the club that the pair escaped uninjured and were safe.\n\nOn 28 July, Arsenal played in the [[2019 Emirates Cup|Emirates Cup]] for the first time since 2017 but lost 1\u20132 at home to French team [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]. The Gunners failed to win the Emirates Cup for the first time since 2014.\n\nOn 31 July, Arsenal played a friendly game against [[Angers SCO|Angers]] who were celebrating the 100th anniversary of the French club's establishment. The match ended in a 1\u20131 draw, meaning a penalty shootout had to decide the winner. The Gunners won the shootout 4\u20133 with Arsenal goalkeeper [[Emiliano Mart\u00ednez]] saving the decisive spot-kick from ex-Arsenal player [[Jeff Reine-Adela\u00efde]].\n\nOn 1 August, Arsenal made the signing of Ivory Coast winger [[Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9]] from [[Ligue 1]] team [[Lille OSC|Lille]] for a club record \u00a372 million.\n\nOn 4 August, Arsenal also played against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on the [[Joan Gamper Trophy]] at the [[Camp Nou]]. The Gunners lost 2\u20131 with [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] scoring the only goal in the first half giving Arsenal the lead going into half time. However, a horrible own goal from [[Ainsley Maitland-Niles]] and a 90th-minute winner from [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] gave [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] the win in Arsenal's final pre-season fixture. Also during the day, [[Takuma Asano]] left the club, joining [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] for \u00a3900,000, after not playing a single minute for the Gunners in his three years at the club.\n\nOn 6 August, then-captain [[Laurent Koscielny]] left Arsenal to join [[Ligue 1]] club [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] for a reported fee of \u00a34.6 million after nine years at the club.\n\nOn 7 August, [[Carl Jenkinson]] left the club and joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] for a fee of \u00a32 million.\n\nOn 8 August, transfer deadline day, the Gunners signed left-back [[Kieran Tierney]] from [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for a reported \u00a325 million fee and centre-back [[David Luiz]] from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a reported \u00a38 million fee three hours later. Moreover, [[Alex Iwobi]] joined [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for \u00a328 million which could rise to \u00a335 million and the recently promoted [[Eddie Nketiah]] joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on a season long loan.\n\n===August===\n\nArsenal began the season with a 1\u20130 win at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], courtesy of a goal by [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]], in the Premier League on 11 August. The following week, the Gunners played [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in their first home match of the season on 17 August. They won 2\u20131, with goals by [[Alexandre Lacazette]] and Aubameyang. Their third match of the season came at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 24 August. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 made his first start for the club, but Arsenal ended the day losing 3\u20131 at Anfield after two goals by [[Mohamed Salah]] and a header by [[Jo\u00ebl Matip]]. [[Lucas Torreira]]'s first goal for the season was a late consolation. Arsenal ended August third in the table with six points from a possible nine in the league. On 30 August, Arsenal learned their Europa League group stage opponents. They would be [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] of Germany, [[Vit\u00f3ria S.C.|Vit\u00f3ria]] of Portugal and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] of Belgium. The following day, [[Nacho Monreal]] was surprisingly sold to [[Real Sociedad]], ending a six-and-a-half year association with the club.\n\n=== September ===\nArsenal started September with the first [[North London derby]] at the Emirates Stadium against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 1 September. An early goal by [[Christian Eriksen]] and a [[Harry Kane]] penalty made it 2\u20130 in Tottenham's favour, but Alexandre Lacazette halved the deficit during first-half stoppage-time and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored an equaliser, making it 2\u20132. A late [[Sokratis Papastathopoulos|Sokratis]] goal was disallowed for offside to deny Arsenal a comeback win, meaning that the derby ended in a 2\u20132 draw. The following day on the European transfer deadline day, Arsenal loaned [[Mohamed Elneny]] to Turkish team [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]] and [[Henrikh Mkhitaryan]] to Italian club [[AS Roma|Roma]], but no move materialised for defender [[Shkodran Mustafi]] following a summer of speculation on his future at the club.\n\nOn 15 September, following the international break Arsenal continued the Premier League campaign with a 2\u20132 draw at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], despite a double by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang putting them 2\u20130 up. \n\nAfter such a capitulation at Vicarage Road, Arsenal's spirits were dampened when they headed to Germany to face Eintracht Frankfurt in the opening Europa League group stage fixture. In one of the more high-key games, Arsenal named a young lineup packed with potential.  First, a brilliant through-ball from 18 year old academy product, Bukayo Saka, found Joe Willock. The young Englishman burst into the box, and saw his shot deflect of Eintracht defender David Abraham and put Arsenal ahead at the break. \nThe turning point came with eleven minutes to go. Already booked for a clip on Saka, Dominik Kohr was subsequently sent off for pulling back substitute Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. With five minutes remaining, Saka capped off a superb debut performance with a stunning low strike to make it 2\u20130 in Arsenals favour. Two minutes later, he slipped in Aubameyang to wrap it up, and he duly rolled home to wrap up 3\u20130 victory over the struggling ten-man Eagles. \n\nLater that week, the Gunners played host to Aston Villa in the Premier League's sixth round of fixtures. But at half-time, Arsenal found themselves a man and a goal behind after John McGinn stroked home Anwar El Ghazi's cross on twenty minutes, prior to Ainsley Maitland-Niles being sent off for a reckless challenge on Neil Taylor. \nHowever, a minute short of the hour mark, man of the match Matteo Guendouzi burst into the box before being hauled down by Villa defender Engels. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 stepped up to take the subsequent spot-kick, and duly drilled down the middle to make it 1\u20131. \nHowever, a minute later Villa were back in front through striker Wesley Morales, but Calum Chambers made it 2\u20132 nine minutes short of full-time with his first Arsenal goal in two years. \nAnd then, three minutes later, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang bent home a terrific free-kick to earn Arsenal a dramatic 3\u20132 win and become just the ninth side in Premier League history to win a match despite trailing by both a man and a goal at any point of the game. \n\nThe Gunners then recorded the largest competitive win of the Unai Emery era when they progressed to the fourth round of the Football League Cup after thrashing Championship outfit Nottingham Forest 5\u20130. Debutant Gabriel Martinelli opened and closed the scoring, first with a bullet header and then with a deflected long-range strike. Meanwhile, Kieran Tierney made his Arsenal debut whilst Rob Holding scored on his return from a long-term knee injury, planting a header home just a minute after becoming Arsenal captain. Hector Beller\u00edn then made his return from injury off the bench, marking it with an assist for Joe Willock. Meanwhile, Reiss Nelson grabbed his first Gunners goal whilst Calum Chambers made three assists in a night of positives for Arsenal. \n\nHowever, they were unable to provide such class next time out as a dull affair at Old Trafford against Manchester United ended in an uninspiring 1\u20131 stalemate. United lead 1\u20130 at the break courtesy of Scott McTominays stunning strike on the strike of half-time. However, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang levelled after Bukayo Saka pounced on a loose ball from Axel Tuanzebe to release the Gabonese. However, despite the initial decision being offside, a VAR check confirmed the goal would stand.\n\n===October===\n\nArsenal then kept up their fine midweek form with a 4\u20130 hammering of Belgian minnows Standard Li\u00e8ge in the Europa League. Gabriel Martinelli was again on the double, netting twice in the opening sixteen minutes before Joe Willock got the third after showing good composure to put away Reiss Nelson's rebounded attempt. Dani Ceballos added the fourth early in the second half with his first Gunners goal to keep them top of the group, before they then climbed to third in the Premier League ladder after David Luiz's first goal for the club on nine minutes earned them an unconvincing 1\u20130 home win against Bournemouth. Little did the Gunners know how much longer they would have to wait for a league win.\n\nAfter the international break, which saw multiple Gunners in action for their countries, Arsenal's return to action was spoiled with what was just their second defeat all season long when Sheffield United managed a 1\u20130 win at Brammall Lane, thanks to Lys Moussets clever finish on the half hour mark, replicating their famous win in 2007. \n\nAnd it looked to be two defeats from two come the restart of football after goals from Marcus Edwards and Bruno Duarte, either side of a fine Gabriel Martinelli header, had put unfancied Portuguese side Vitoria SC on the brink of a famous Europa League win at the Emirates Stadium. However, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 proved the difference of the bench when he netted to stunning, world-class free-kicks, first in the 80th minute and then again in the 92nd, to earn Arsenal a relieving 3\u20132 victory and make progression to the next round all but assured. \n\nAnd the team looked high on confidence when two goals inside the first ten minutes from defenders Sokratis Papastathopolous and David Luiz put them in firm control against a solid Crystal Palace side. However, the Eagles retorted by halving the deficit via Luka Milivojevic's penalty shortly before the break, before Andre Ayew nodded home on 52 minutes to make it 2\u20132. \nLater in the game, struggling and much-criticised Swiss captain Granit Xhaka was substituted following another poor performance, but boos echoing about the stadium didn't help matters, and after swearing at supporters, he ripped of his shirt and stormed  down the tunnel. He wouldn't appear for the side again for nearly a month and also had the captaincy title stripped from him. \nLate on, though, Papastathopolous thought he had won it after smashing home following a touchline scramble, but the goal was incorrectly disallowed by VAR due to Calum Chambers\u2019 \u201cinfringement\u201d on Luka Milivojevic. And so Arsenal has to settle for a point in a dramatic but damaging encounter at the Emirates Stadium. \n\nFollowing the Crystal Palace draw, Arsenal lay in fifth position, and results continued to downturn after the Gunners exited the League Cup after leaving Anfield empty-handed following a 5\u20134 penalty shootout defeat to Liverpool. \nBut it was  the manner of how the game descended to penalties that will make this match live long in the memory. In one of the most high-scoring encounters in Arsenal's history, the Gunners drew 5\u20135 with Jurgen Klopp's high-flying Reds side. The games opening goal came just six minutes in, when Liverpool debutant Neco Williams hurled a wonderful ball over the top to former Gunner Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who's low cross was knocked into the net by Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi. \nHowever, on nineteen minutes, Liverpool's goalkeeper Caiomhin Kelleher couldn't keep out Bukayo Saka's attempt, gifting Lucas Torreira an equaliser. Arsenal then took the lead after Gabriel Martinelli pounced on a similar goalkeeping error by the Irishman, before Martinelli notched his second to make it 3\u20131 after converting Bukayo Saka's low cross. \nNonetheless, Liverpool managed to navigate a route back into the game when Martinelli clipped Harvey Elliot in the Arsenal box. James Milner buried the subsequent spot-kick to cut the deficit to 3\u20132. \nHowever, a Milner error, an ingenious Mesut Ozil flick and a simple Maitland-Niles finish put Arsenal 4\u20132 ahead on 54 minutes. However, quickfire screamers from Oxlade-Chamberlain and Divock Origi levelled the game at 4\u20134, before Joe Willock's 30-yard rocket put Arsenal in front. \nHowever, there was stoppage-time heartbreak for the Gunners, as Origi netted his second of the night with an acrobatic volley to signal penalties at the end of the most high-scoring match in League Cup history. \nDespite the first six penalties being converted, it was Dani Ceballos who missed first, as his penalty was blocked by Kelleher. Despite Maitland-Niles converting, Curtis Jones scored the winning spot-kick as Arsenal exited the tournament in the most dramatic of fashions.\n\n\n\n===November===\n\nArsenal began November the same way they ended October: drawing two games in succession. Both matches ended 1\u20131, first at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League. Arsenal had taken the lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 50th goal for the club(in just his 78th appearance),  but were pegged back late on after Raul Jiminez nodded home Joao Moutinho lobbed cross with sixteen minutes to play. \nThe next one was against Vitoria SC, a game which also ended 1\u20131 in what could be argued as Emery's worst game at the helm of Arsenal. The Gunners managed just one shot on target and one accurate pass into the box, both of which came for the goal, as Shkodran Mustafi nodded home Nicolas Pepe's delightful free-kick delivery, but in stoppage time Bruno Duarte's acrobatic volley managed to worm its way through a crowd of Arsenal bodies on the line, with manager Unai Emery now under serious pressure. \n\nResults were not appearing to change. Later in the week, the Gunners went six games without a win after two quickfire second-half goals from Jamie Vardy and James Maddison saw Leicester City secure a 2\u20130 win over the struggling North Londoners, leaving them sixth. \n\nRumours were rife throughout the international break that Emery was on the brink of the sack, but he was still on the touchline in the Gunners' home fixture with Southampton. After an early Danny Ings goal but Saints ahead, Alexandre Lacazette got his first goal since September to level it at 1\u20131. \nHowever, with just under 20 minutes to go, Kieran Tierney clipped Ings as the visitors were gifted a chance to retake the lead. Despite Bernd Leno blocking the initial spot-kick, James Ward-Prowse scored on the rebound to make it 1\u20132. \nSouthampton seemed on the verge of collecting a famous win, however Lacazette spoiled that dream when he lashed home a Martinelli cross in the 96th minute, rescuing a point for Arsenal in a 2\u20132 draw. \n\nWith Emery now teetering on the edge, it was reported that he had one last game to save himself, namely the Europa League fixture at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Despite their recent form, Arsenal appeared as favourites, as they were chasing an eighth straight European win at the Emirates, something never managed before, and had also, of course, won the reverse fixture 3\u20130 in Germany. \nHowever, despite leading 1\u20130 at half-time through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyangs deflected strike, a swift double from Japanese international, Daichi Kamada, earned Frankfurt a shock 2\u20131 win and left Emery hanging by a thread. \n\nAt 10 AM BST, on 29th of November 2019, Unai Emery was sacked by Arsenal following the chastening Frankfurt defeat. Soon after, former assistant coach and \u201cInvincble\u201d Freddie Ljungberg earned the caretaker boss role, with his first game due to be away to struggling Norwich City.\n\n===December===\n\nFreddie Ljungberg's first match as interim boss was staged at Carrow Road against Norwich, on 1 December 2019. Despite Arsenal dominating the early exchanges, it was the home side who took the lead after Teemu Pukki's deflected strike crawled into the net. However, less than a minute later, a handball by Norwich defender Christoph Zimmerman gifted Arsenal a route back into the game via just their second penalty kick of the season. However a poor penalty by Aubameyang was blocked by Timo Krul. However, encroachment in the penalty area saw Aubameyang gifted a retake, and he buried the second attempt, making it 1\u20131. However, Norwich retook the lead in the second minute of first half stoppage time via Todd Cantwell, but Aubameyangs second goal, coupled with some super saves by Bernd Leno, saw Ljungberg's first match end in an enthralling 2\u20132 draw.\n\nLjungbergs first home match in charge of the Gunners took place against Brighton And Hove Albion on 5th December 2019, but a listless  first half performance saw Brighton lead 1\u20130 thanks to Adam Websters  fierce strike. \nHowever, a clever looping header from Alexandre Lacazette five minutes into the second half got Arsenal level,  before David Luiz had a smart header disallowed for offside. Then, man of the match Aaron Mooy bent in a terrific cross to Neal Maupay, who duly nodded home to seal a stunning 2\u20131 Brighton victory and extend Arsenal's win-less run in all competitions to nine games. \n\nAnd it  looked certain to be ten after Angelo Ogbonna's weak header had West Ham United ahead at the London Stadium on 38 minutes. It had been another lifeless performance from the Gunners, but on the hour mark, a lovely through-ball from Lucas Torreira was cut back by Sead Kolasinac to Gabriel Martinelli, who rifled home to mark his first Premier League start with a well-taken goal. \nAnd six minutes later, it was 2\u20131 after Nicolas Pepe cut away from Arthur Masuaku before bending a terrific strike into the far corner. Mesut Ozil's  pass was then played on to Pepe by an Aubameyang back-heel three minutes later, with the Ivorian's  lofted cross volleyed home by Aubameyang, sealing a much-needed 3\u20131 victory and restore the Gunners to the top ten. \n\nHigh on spirits following the West Ham victory, Arsenal travelled to Belgium to face Standard Liege. So long as  they avoided a five-goal defeat the Gunners would qualify, whilst top spot would be assured with a win, or failure for Eintracht Frankfurt to beat bottom-placed Vitoria at home. \n\nAfter a dead first-half, Standard Liege took a much-needed lead on 47 minutes after Samuel Bastien's deflected attempted hobbled over the line. And  when Selim Amallah made it 2\u20130 with  a similarly deflected effort on 69 minutes, and Frankfurt leading 2\u20131, it seemed as though Arsenal  would have to settle for second place. \nHowever, a wonderful Bukayo Saka cross was powered home by the head of Alexandre Lacazette, before, with nine minutes to go, Arsenal completed the comeback when a quick one-two between Saka and Gabriel Martinelli saw the former's low shot skim into the net, as the match ended 2\u20132. That, coupled with Eintrachts 2\u20133 home loss to Vitoria, meant Arsenal finished top of Group F, having accrued 11 points from three wins, two draws and one loss. \n\nDespite the recent upturn in results, the Gunners were brought right back down to earth when a first-half blitz from champions Manchester City saw the Citizens run out 3\u20130 winners at Emirates Stadium. An individual masterclass from Kevin De Bruyne was the foundation for City's victory, with the Belgian play-maker opening and closing the scoring with stunning strikes, whilst also setting up Raheem Sterling's  goal on fifteen minutes. \n\nOn the sixteenth of December 2019, the UEFA Europa League Round-of-32 draw was made. Arsenal, as a seeded side, avoided the big guns such as Sevilla, Manchester United, Ajax or Inter Milan. They were drawn against Greek giants and established European side Olympiacos, with the first leg to be staged in Athens.\n\nAfter leading them to just one win in five games as caretaker, Freddie Ljungberg was unable to become Arsenals new long-term boss, as former player Mikel Arteta was appointed as the new manager on the 20th December 2019. After retirement in May 2016, Arteta had spent three years as assistant coach of Manchester City, winning two Premier League titles, seven trophies and was widely praised by manager Pep Guardiola and several other players.\n\nDespite the appointment, Arteta was obliged to watch Freddie Ljungbergs final Arsenal game from the stands, in a tricky trip to an Everton side in a similar predicament to the Gunners. However, a listless performance from both sides saw a dull game end 0\u20130, the Gunners first goalless stalemate since December 2017, when they drew 0\u20130 at West Ham United.\n\nAfter the Christmas Day break, the Gunners were back in action away to AFC Bournemouth on Boxing Day in Mikel Arteta's first game as new boss. After going behind 35 minutes courtesy of a Dan Gosling tap-in, Arsenal drew level after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted similarly easy tap-in, as a high-edged encounter ended 1\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arseblog.news/2019/12/report-bournemouth-1-1-arsenal-inc-goals/|title=Report: Bournemouth 1-1 Arsenal (inc.goals)|website=arseblog.news|publisher=Arseblog|date=26 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Gunners final match of the year was staged at the Emirates Stadium against off-colour rivals Chelsea in Mikel Arteta's first home test. However, despite taking a 13th-minute lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyangs header, late goals from Jorginho and Tammy Abraham earned the visitors a 2\u20131 comeback win and denied what would have been a deserving victory for Arsenal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50882583|title=Mikel Arteta loses first home game as Gunners boss|website=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===January===\n\nIf 2019 had ended badly, Arsenal started 2020 in flying fashion, beating Manchester United 2\u20130 to secure a vital New Year's Day win. The Gunners took the lead on eight minutes after Nicolas Pepe guided home Sead Kolasinac's deflected cross, before grabbing the second just before half-time, Greek defender Sokratis Papastathopolous hammering in after David de Gea spilled Alexandre Lacazette's header.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50908732|title=Arsenal 2-0 Man Utd: Gunners secure first win under Mikel Arteta|website=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the euphoria of the United victory, Arsenal faced another fallen giant in the form of Leeds United at home in the third round of the Emirates FA Cup. It was the 17th meeting between the two sides in world football's oldest competition, and the fourth since 2011. That year, Arsenal had won a replay 3\u20131 at Elland Road after a 1\u20131 draw at the Emirates Stadium, and the following year a late Thierry Henry goal sent them through. \n\nHowever, this match had a very different script in contrast to the dominant first-half Man. United display. Arsenal were unable to build out from the back and often succumbed to Leeds' high press, and should have been behind at the break if not for a crossbar and two remarkable Emiliano Mart\u00ednez saves. However, Arsenal did eventually claw their way to a 1\u20130 win, courtesy of Reiss Nelson's scrappy finish early on in the second half, on the receiving end of a deflected cross from man-of-the-match Alexandre Lacazette. The Gunners were duly drawn away to AFC Bournemouth in the following round. \n\nThe Gunners sent both young potentials Tyreece John-Jules and Emile Smith-Rowe on loan for the rest of the season on the 10th of January, to Lincoln City and Huddersfield Town respectively. \n\nArsenal's first match in the road in 2020 was staged at Selhurst Park against an injury-hit Crystal Palace team. Arsenal took a deserved 1\u20130 lead into the break after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang rolled in his 14th goal of the season-and 16th in all competitions, finishing off an 18-pass team move. However, the Gunners conceded their first goal of 2020, with a bloated deflection guiding Jordan Ayew's effort home. Arsenal were then reduced to ten men after captain and goalscorer Aubameyang committed a wild studs-up tackle on Max Meyer. The game finished 1\u20131.\n\nOn the 13th of January, young Arsenal centre-back Konstantinos Mavropanos moved on loan to 1. FC Nurnburg, before Dejan Iliev went on loan to Jagiellonia Bialystok the next day. \n\nWhen back in action, Gabriel Martinelli netted his second Premier League goal in Arsenal's next match, at home to Sheffield United, poking home Bukayo Saka's deflected cross. However, his goal proved fruitless as a late John Fleck goal earned the visitors a 1\u20131 draw.\n\nArsenal faced a tricky trip to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea just over three weeks after losing to the Blues at the Emirates Stadium. They faced a similar outcome after a dreadful back-pass from Shkodran Mustafi left Bernd Leno stranded and Tammy Abraham through on goal. David Luiz hauled him down and received a straight red card, Arsenal's second in two away matches, and gifted Chelsea a penalty. \nJorginho slotted home, and at the break the Gunners trailed 1\u20130. However, after Mustafi cleared from a corner, Gabriel Martinelli picked up the ball 67 yards from goal, and thirteen seconds later, after darting past three players, he coolly passed it past Kepa Arrizabalaga to level things up. But Chelsea regained the lead with six minutes to play after Cesar Azpilicueta poked home a low Callum Hudson-Odoi cross. But in the 87th minute, captain on the night Hector Bellerin scored with what was just Arsenal's second shot of the match, as the ten-man Gunners fought back to earn a highly creditable 2\u20132 draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/21/chelsea-v-arsenal-premier-league-live|title=Chelsea 2-2 Arsenal : Premier League \u2013 as it happened|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nArsenal continued their strong start to 2020 when early goals from Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah-recalled recently from his Leeds United loan spell-ultimately earned them a 2\u20131 win at AFC Bournemouth in the FA Cup fourth round. \nThe Gunners took a fifth-minute lead after a 22-pass move involving all ten outfield players culminated in Saka lashing home off the crossbar. Nketiah then made it 2\u20130 after he laid of to Willock in the area, and Willocks pass to Saka was drilled into Nketiah, who tapped home easily.  \nAfter an insipid first half display, a more courageous Bournemouth team earned a consolation goal via Sam Surridges first for the club in the 94th minute, with the Englishman rounding Emiliano Martinez to slot home.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/27/bournemouth-v-arsenal-fa-cup-fourth-round-live|title=Bournemouth 1-2 Arsenal: FA Cup fourth round \u2013 as it happened|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 January 2020}}</ref> \nThe next day, the Gunners sent James Olayinka to League Two side Northampton Town on loan for the remainder of the season. \n\nOn the 30th of January, Arsenal finally sealed their first signing of the Winter window, bringing in Spanish defender Pablo Mari on loan for the remainder of the season, with an option to buy at the end, from Brazilian side Flamengo. \nOn deadline day, the Gunners completed a second loan until the end of the season with an option to buy. This time it was Southampton full-back Cedric Soares who arrived, a Portuguese right-footer with 120 Premier League appearances to his name already.\n\n===February===\n\nArsenal extended their six-game unbeaten run under Mikel Arteta to seven matches, but were unable to find a winner in a lacklustre goalless draw at Burnley. Despite missing several good chances early on, the Gunners soon found themselves on the back foot, with the Clarets dominating proceedings. They had a number of opportunities to snatch a winner, most notably when Jay Rodriguez hit the bar from six yards out, but ultimately had to settle for a point in what was a dull affair. \n\nAfter the two week winter break, in which the Gunners chiefly spent at a training camp in Dubai, Arsenal played host to Newcastle United in the Premier League. After a dull first half ended goalless, with neither side able to exploit the other, Arsenal took the lead on 54 minutes. Shortly after Nketiah had smacked the crossbar, Nicolas Pepe floated in an enticing cross which Aubameyang nodded home with a firm header. \nThe lead was doubled three minutes later, Pepe drilling home a low Saka cross after good work from the eighteen year old. \nAllan Saint-Maximin hit the post as Newcastle went close a few times, before Mesut Ozil scuffed home substitute Alexandre Lacazette's cross for his first goal in ten months to make it 3\u20130. The build-up to the goal involved all eleven players and 35 passes, the most of any Premier League goal this season. \nThe Gunners grabbed a fourth in the 95th minute, Lacazette getting his first goal in ten games, hammering Pepe's low pass home, wrapping up a thumping, morale boosting 4\u20130 win. \n\nThe big news aside from the Newcastle match, though, was the declaration that Manchester City, placed second in the Premier League, has been banned from the Champions League by UEFA for the next two seasons. That meant if, as was likely, the Citizens retained their second-placed position, then fifth place would ensure Champions League qualification for next season. It was a major boost for the Gunners, who sat just six points away from fifth-placed Spurs, certainly not an insurmountable gap. \n\nBut the second route to Europe's premier club competition in 2020/21 was via winning the UEFA Europa League. To this competition the Gunners turned their attention in the first leg of their last-32 tie against Greeks Olympiacos, in Athens. Once again under Arteta the defence proved steady, but the attack was blunt throughout a dull first half, which ended 0-0. \nThe second half was following a similar script and the  match seemed destined to end goalless, but with nine minutes to play Aubameyang played a neat ball into Saka, who's low cross across goal resulted in his 9th assist of the season, with Lacazette arriving at the near post to grab the winner. \n\nThe Gunners has just three days of respite prior to their massive home clash with European rivals Everton. The Toffees were two points clear of Arsenal in ninth position, and might have further extended their advantage after Dominic Calvert-Lewin's bicycle kick gave the visitors the lead after just 50 seconds, and it might have been more after some counter-attacking openings later on. \nBut Arsenal were not to be denied, and soon drew level after Bukayo Saka, released down the left by Granit Xhaka, bent a terrific cross into Eddie Nketiah, who deftly touched the ball in to level it at one apiece. \nAnd six minutes later, a wonderful David Luiz through-ball released Aubameyang, who raced clear and slotted home for 2\u20131. \nHowever, Everton managed to claw level before half-time, finishing the half as they had started it's: with a goal. This time it was Richarlison, squeezing the ball past Leno after Yerry Mina nodded down Djibril Sidibe's hooked lob. \nBut if Everton had started the first half well, it was Arsenal's turn in the second, with Aubameyang racing ahead of Sidibe to nod Nicolas Pepe's cross home after just twenty-five seconds. Everton searched in vain for an equalizer, with Calvert-Lewin twice going close and Bernd Leno making some remarkable saves. However, Arsenal had the best chance after a giveaway from visiting keeper Jordan Pickford, but Nketiah's attempt bounced off the crossbar, and the relentless Gunners held on for a vital 3\u20132 win. This marked the first time Arsenal has won two consecutive Premier League games since the first two games of the season. \n\nBut all Arsenal's  good form was undone in the second leg of their UEFA Europa League tie against Olympiacos in the last-32. After a goalless first period, and unmarked Pape Cisse header gifted the visiting Greeks a 1\u20130 lead and duly saw them earn extra-time. But when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang notched his 20th goal of the season with a fabulous bicycle kick in the 113th minute, few would have expected what happened next. But it did, with Youssef El-Arabi stretching to slide home a last-gasp winner for Olympiacos; 2\u20131 on the night and away goals on aggregate.\n\n===March===\nWith it mathematically impossible to win the Premier League and out of both the League Cup and Europa League, Arsenal's last chance of a trophy in 2019\u201320 came in the form of the FA Cup. To reach the last eight they needed first to navigate a way past [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] at [[Fratton Park]], a side they had not lost to in 21 games, since a 5\u20134 defeat in 1958. Their most recent encounter had come in 2009, with the Gunners triumphing 4\u20131. Though less stylish, the Gunners nonetheless claimed the necessary result, a routine 2\u20130 win, to earn a spot in the quarter-final draw. They had taken the lead in the fourth minute of first half stoppage time, Sokratis Papastathopolous sweeping home his third of the season with a crisp volley from a low Reiss Nelson cross, before a deflected cross from the English winger on 51 minutes saw Eddie Nketiah taking a touch before flinging the ball into the roof of the net, sealing the win.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Begley |first1=Emlyn |title=Portsmouth 0 Arsenal 2 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51697793 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=3 March 2020 |date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn reward for the win, the Gunners were drawn against fellow Premier League side Sheffield United in the quarter-finals, with the match to be staged at Brammal Lane on the 21st of March. Arsenal had lost there, 1\u20130, in late October, but their most recent encounter with the Blades had come in January, when a late John Fleck goal cancelled out Gabriel Martinelli's opener as the spoils were shared in a 1\u20131 draw. \n\nAs for Arsenal's other goal, a top-five spot in the Premier League, their hopes were significantly boosted with another win (their sixth in eight matches) and clean sheet (their fifth in seven) against West Ham United at the Emirates Stadium. For much of the contest, though, it seemed as if the struggling Hammers would come out on top, but in the end, with the help of VAR, the Gunners eked out the win. Lacazette was the hero, with a winner off the bench on 78 minutes, slotting Mesut \u00d6zil's header into the corner. \n[[David Moyes]], the visiting manager, rued numerous missed chances for the Hammers after his winless run away to Arsenal in the Premier League extended to sixteen games, stating that his side \"did not deserve to lose\", per the BBC,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51685402|title=Arsenal 1-0 West Ham: Alexandre Lacazette gives Gunners victory|website=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=7 March 2020|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> whilst Mikel Arteta noted his Arsenal team had \"turned a corner\", now just five points of the top four.\n\nJust a day prior to their trip to Manchester City, it was revealed by Olympiacos and Nottingham Forest owner [[Evangelos Marinakis]] that he had contracted [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], a disease caused by the [[SARS-CoV-2]] virus which causes flu-like symptoms and may be fatal. \nThis, with two days of the total fourteen-day quarantine left, Arsenal postponed their match against Manchester City for the second time that season. \nAnd Arsenal were affected by the virus even more when it was announced that manager Mikel Arteta had tested positive for the virus. Arsenal's entire first-team squad and several staff members were placed into isolation.\n\nLater, when other sides` players, including the whole Chelsea squad, were placed into isolation, a Premier League shareholders meeting concluded that the season could not be continued, and would be postponed until April 3rd. Another shareholders meeting agreed that, with the virus still infecting thousands of people around the world, the deadline for the resumption of league matches would be further extended, until April 30th.\n\n==Players==\n{{Further||Arsenal F.C.#Players}}\n{{Fb si header |age=y}}\n{{Fb si player |bg=y |p={{sortname|Bernd|Leno}} |nb=GER |n=1 |pos=GK  |eu=y |age={{Age|1992|3|4}} |s=2018 |a=66 |g=0 |e=2023 |f=\u00a322.5M}}\n{{Fb si player |bg= |p={{sortname|H\u00e9ctor|Beller\u00edn}} |nb=ESP |n=2 |pos=DF |eu=y |age={{Age|1995|03|19}} |s=2013 |a=195 |g=8 |e=2023 |f=[[Arsenal F.C.

In total, the label group has nearly three hundred artists on its roster.\n\n==History==\nIn 2004, [[Time Warner]] sold Warner Music to group of private investors. As a cost-cutting maneuver, the new owners of Warner Music Group merged Atlantic Records with its [[Elektra Records]] sister to form The Atlantic Records Group. Upon the merger, Elektra became largely dormant, with most of its retained roster absorbed by Atlantic.  In the years to follow, Atlantic Records Group would add a host of other labels to its umbrella, including: [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]], [[Fueled by Ramen]], [[Custard Records|Custard]] and [[Maybach Music Group|Maybach]].

Splitting off from Atlantic Records Group, EMG will take with it five labels that previously operated under the Atlantic group (including Elektra Records), three label's staff and handful of major artists. Elektra's independence renews the WEA (Warner-Elektra-Atlantic) triad that had for decades mark the original company organization.

In total, the label group has nearly three hundred artists on its roster.\n\n==History==\nIn 2004, [[Time Warner]] sold Warner Music to group of private investors. As a cost-cutting maneuver, the new owners of Warner Music Group merged Atlantic Records with its [[Elektra Records]] sister to form The Atlantic Records Group. Upon the merger, Elektra became largely dormant, with most of its retained roster absorbed by Atlantic.  In the years to follow, Atlantic Records Group would add a host of other labels to its umbrella, including: [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]], [[Fueled by Ramen]], [[Custard Records|Custard]] and [[Maybach Music Group|Maybach]]. Elektra was reactivated as a brand of Atlantic Records Group in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martens |first1=Todd |title=Dangerbird co-founder Jeff Castelaz to head Elektra Records |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/04/entertainment/la-et-ms-dangerbird-cofounder-jeff-castelaz-to-head-elektra-records-20121003 |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 4, 2012}}</ref> The same year Atlantic's [[dance music|dance]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] imprint [[Big Beat Records (American record label)|Big Beat Records]], which scored notable success for most of the 1990s (but had been in hibernation since 1998) was also relaunched.\n\nOn June 18, 2018,  Warner Music Group announced the formation of Elektra Music Group to be launched as a stand-alone, independently-managed primary label at WMG on October 1.  Splitting off from Atlantic Records Group, EMG will take with it five labels that previously operated under the Atlantic group (including Elektra Records), three label's staff and handful of major artists.

Dr. Cameron Goodkin, a brilliant neuroscientist, assists Kirsten in the secret program headed by Maggie Baptiste, a skilled covert operator. The program also includes Linus Ahluwalia, a bioelectrical engineer and communications technician. Camille, Kirsten's roommate and a computer science grad student, is also recruited to assist Kirsten as a \"stitcher\". LAPD Detective Quincy Fisher is recruited and added to the team after crossing paths with Kirsten.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Emma Ishta]] as Kirsten Clark, a [[Caltech]] student recruited to the secret Stitchers program. She was given a diagnosis of temporal dysplasia, a fictional condition in which a person could not sense the passing of time, at the age of eight after her father attempted to stitch her into her mother while she was still alive, resulting in the death of her mother and the loss of Kirsten's memories of her parents. This condition hinders her ability to form relationships as her lack of temporal perception hinders her emotional connection to others; as described by her when she witnessed her dead foster father, from her perspective the moment she was told he was dead he had been dead forever. She eventually begins a relationship with Cameron in the third season.\n* [[Kyle Harris]] as Cameron Goodkin, a brilliant neuroscientist who is part of the Stitchers program. He had heart valve surgery at a young age leading to his first meeting Kirsten. Born under the name Cameron Miller but took his mother's surname when his father was sent to prison for fraud.

She develops a more removed approach after she becomes head of the program overall, requiring her to attend meetings in Washington and other matters on a more regular basis. \n* [[Allison Scagliotti]] as Camille Engelson, roommate of Kirsten and talented graduate student of computer science. It was revealed that Maggie assigned her to keep an eye on Kirsten by paying off her student loans and living accommodation. She has been trained by Cameron to operate the equipment guiding Kirsten through the stitch in his absence. She and Linus had an on-off relationship for the first two seasons, but in the third season she begins dating the program's new medical examiner.\n* Damon Dayoub as Detective Quincy Fisher  (recurring, season 1; regular, season 2\u20133),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stitchers-promotes-damon-dayoub-series-811381|title='Stitchers' Promotes Damon Dayoub to Series Regular (Exclusive)|date=July 27, 2015|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref> an LAPD officer who is later recruited into the Stitchers program to act as their 'public face', essentially taking official credit for the arrests carried out based on the evidence acquired through stitching.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Hugh Armstrong (actor)|Hugo Armstrong]] as Ed Clark, Kirsten's non-biological father.
