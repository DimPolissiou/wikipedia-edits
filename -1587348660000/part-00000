[[Anthracite coal]] deposits are plentiful in the region. The population was 4,397 at the 2010 census.\n\n==History==\nIn the year 1783, a settler by the name of Thomas Reed traveled through the valley between the Thomaston Mountains and the Gap Rocks.  At this junction, several mountain streams converged where this settler built a log cabin and a sawmill on the west Branch of the Schuylkill River, just below the mouth of Wolf Creek.<ref>Norwegian Township Administration, The History of Norwegian Township, 2016</ref>  Shortly thereafter, he built a tavern on the South Side of the Sunbury Trail on the present site of the Saint Michael the Archangel Church.\n\nThis tavern was referred to as the \"Half Way House\", because it was half-way between Reading and [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]].<ref>W W Munsell, History of Schuylkill County, PA with illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of its Prominent Pioneers, New York 1881</ref>  The Sunbury Trail was the first road through Schuylkill County and was known as the Kings Highway which was authorized by the Crown of England, King George III in 1770.The early settlers engaged in timbering as their first livelihood, but experienced difficulty in transporting the heavy logs out of the valley.  The rough timber was floated by raft to Schuylkill Haven to the Schuylkill Canal and on to Reading where it was sold or traded for other products. Necho Allen discovered coal in 1799, but it was not until 1814 that any actual mining took place.  Dr. McFarland, a scientist, opened a vein at York Farm near Pottsville.  Later, in 1818, Jacob Reed, son of the original founder, opened another vein in the Minersville Area.<ref>Minersville Borough, Minersville Borough History web site, 2016</ref>\n[[File:English Baptist Church, Minersville PA 01.JPG|left|thumb|English Baptist Church.]]\nThe completion of the Schuylkill Haven and Mine Hill Railroad provided the means to transport the coal produced in the region.  The development of the coal industry grew rapidly and attracted many immigrants.  Experienced English and Welsh miners arrived first from their home lands.  Next arrivals were the Germans and Irishman, soon to be followed by many other ethnic groups that make up the community. The influx of inhabitants to the community promoted the need to begin municipal planning.  Titus Bennett laid out the town in 1830 on parts of two tracts of land patented to Lawrence Lewis and Robert M. Lewis on July 20, 1829, at that time part of Branch Township. On May 2, 1830, Minersville citizens held an election at the  home of David Buckwater for the purpose of electing a Burgess.  Samuel Richert was elected to this position, as well as the following men who served on the first Council: John Provst, John Patrick, Dr. Anthony Steinberger, John L. Swaine, John B. Hahn, David Buckwater and Daniel R. Bennet. The first president of the Town Council was Daniel R. Bennet; first treasurer, Thomas J. Harman, Clerk, and Milligan G. Gable, High Constable. Minersville was incorporated as a borough on April 1, 1831 by Act of the legislature approved by Governor George Wolf. Minersville School District was involved in a national court case gaining much attention; [[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]], 1940.<ref>[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]</ref>  This case dealt with a family whose children would not salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance because of their religious beliefs (they were Jehovah's Witnesses).  This case would put Minersville \"on the map,\" as it reached all the way to the Supreme Court.  The final verdict was that the school district could, in fact, make students stand, salute, and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  This decision came under much scrutiny and would not stay long, as it would be overturned shortly thereafter by [[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]].\n[[Image:Minersville,1889.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]\n\n==Geography==\nMinersville is located at {{Coord|40|41|26|N|76|15|37|W|type:city}} (40.690455, -76.260242).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 1265\n|1850= 2951\n|1860= 4024\n|1870= 3699\n|1880= 3249\n|1890= 3504\n|1900= 4815\n|1910= 7240\n|1920= 7845\n|1930= 9392\n|1940= 8686\n|1950= 7783\n|1960= 6606\n|1970= 6012\n|1980= 5635\n|1990= 4877\n|2000= 4552\n|2010= 4397\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4177\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 4,552 people, 2,041 households, and 1,226 families residing in the borough.

[[Anthracite coal]] deposits are plentiful in the region. The population was 4,397 at the 2010 census.\n\n==History==\nIn the year 1783, a settler by the name of Thomas Reed traveled through the valley between the Thomaston Mountains and the Gap Rocks.  At this junction, several mountain streams converged where this settler built a log cabin and a sawmill on the west Branch of the Schuylkill River, just below the mouth of Wolf Creek.<ref>Norwegian Township Administration, The History of Norwegian Township, 2016</ref>  Shortly thereafter, he built a tavern on the South Side of the Sunbury Trail on the present site of the Saint Michael the Archangel Church.\n\nThis tavern was referred to as the \"Half Way House\", because it was half-way between Reading and [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]].<ref>W W Munsell, History of Schuylkill County, PA with illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of its Prominent Pioneers, New York 1881</ref>  The Sunbury Trail was the first road through Schuylkill County and was known as the Kings Highway which was authorized by the Crown of England, King George III in 1770.The early settlers engaged in timbering as their first livelihood, but experienced difficulty in transporting the heavy logs out of the valley.  The rough timber was floated by raft to Schuylkill Haven to the Schuylkill Canal and on to Reading where it was sold or traded for other products. Necho Allen discovered coal in 1799, but it was not until 1814 that any actual mining took place.  Dr. McFarland, a scientist, opened a vein at York Farm near Pottsville.  Later, in 1818, Jacob Reed, son of the original founder, opened another vein in the Minersville Area.<ref>Minersville Borough, Minersville Borough History web site, 2016</ref>\n[[File:English Baptist Church, Minersville PA 01.JPG|left|thumb|English Baptist Church.]]\nThe completion of the Schuylkill Haven and Mine Hill Railroad provided the means to transport the coal produced in the region.  The development of the coal industry grew rapidly and attracted many immigrants.  Experienced English and Welsh miners arrived first from their home lands.  Next arrivals were the Germans and Irishman, soon to be followed by many other ethnic groups that make up the community. The influx of inhabitants to the community promoted the need to begin municipal planning.  Titus Bennett laid out the town in 1830 on parts of two tracts of land patented to Lawrence Lewis and Robert M. Lewis on July 20, 1829, at that time part of Branch Township. On May 2, 1830, Minersville citizens held an election at the  home of David Buckwater for the purpose of electing a Burgess.  Samuel Richert was elected to this position, as well as the following men who served on the first Council: John Provst, John Patrick, Dr. Anthony Steinberger, John L. Swaine, John B. Hahn, David Buckwater and Daniel R. Bennet. The first president of the Town Council was Daniel R. Bennet; first treasurer, Thomas J. Harman, Clerk, and Milligan G. Gable, High Constable. Minersville was incorporated as a borough on April 1, 1831 by Act of the legislature approved by Governor George Wolf. Minersville School District was involved in a national court case gaining much attention; [[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]], 1940.<ref>[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]</ref>  This case dealt with a family whose children would not salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance because of their religious beliefs (they were Jehovah's Witnesses).  This case would put Minersville \"on the map,\" as it reached all the way to the Supreme Court.  The final verdict was that the school district could, in fact, make students stand, salute, and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  This decision came under much scrutiny and would not stay long, as it would be overturned shortly thereafter by [[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]].\n[[Image:Minersville,1889.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]\n\n==Geography==\nMinersville is located at {{Coord|40|41|26|N|76|15|37|W|type:city}} (40.690455, -76.260242).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 1265\n|1850= 2951\n|1860= 4024\n|1870= 3699\n|1880= 3249\n|1890= 3504\n|1900= 4815\n|1910= 7240\n|1920= 7845\n|1930= 9392\n|1940= 8686\n|1950= 7783\n|1960= 6606\n|1970= 6012\n|1980= 5635\n|1990= 4877\n|2000= 4552\n|2010= 4397\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4177\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 4,552 people, 2,041 households, and 1,226 families residing in the borough.

At Yale, he was tapped into the secret society [[Scroll and Key]]. His mentors at Yale included [[Josef Albers]], [[Richard Lindner (painter)|Richard Lindner]] and [[Vincent Scully]].\n\nInspired by earlier trips to Africa in both 1955 and 1960, Beard traveled to [[Kenya]] upon graduation.

These volumes contain newspaper clippings, dried leaves, insects, old [[sepia tone|sepia]]-toned photos, transcribed telephone messages, [[marginalia]] in India ink, photographs of women, quotes, found objects, and the like; these become incorporated, with original drawings and collage by Beard.

Having made his fortune in the railroad business, James Jerome Hill was a great patron of the arts.  All of his heirs were exposed to and owned great collections, presumably having a strong influence on Beard\u2019s interests in the arts and beauty.\n\nBeard married his first wife (Minnie Cushing Beard Coleman) in 1967; their marriage lasted only briefly. His second wife was [[supermodel]] [[Cheryl Tiegs]], from 1982 to 1986.\n\nIn 1986, he married Nejma Khanum.

(One account of this visit indicates that he purchased a sizable portion of the land he explored in the area from the Indians who had served as his guides on his journey.) Although he returned to Delaware after this initial visit, he returned the following year with his son Thomas and built a log cabin on the property. The entire Eves family arrived the next year, in 1772, and began tilling the fields adjacent to the cabin as soon as they could be cleared.\n\nIn 1774, the Eves family received a deed for their {{convert|1203|acre|km2|adj=on}} property in the valley, the largest land holding at the time in what would later become Columbia County. Title for the land, originally obtained by William and Elizabeth McMean in 1769, was passed to Reuben Haines, and then to John Eves.\n\nAn Indian uprising, the [[Battle of Wyoming]], in mid-summer of 1778, caused the Eves family to flee their home in the valley and take refuge at a [[stockade]] near [[Washingtonville, Pennsylvania|Washingtonville]]. Upon their return in 1785, they found their cabin burned and their fields overgrown, but immediately set about to recreate their homestead.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Millville PA Friends 1795.jpg|[[Millville Friends Meeting House]], established in 1795\n</gallery>\nWhen the Eves family returned in the mid-1780s, they were determined to make the settlement permanent. They were accompanied or were soon followed by several other families, including Masters, Kisner, Battin, Parker, Lundy, Lemon, Oliver, and Rich. With 17 children and 104 grandchildren, John Eves looked after the building of homes for the family, a [[gristmill]] that was to stand for 100 years, and later a [[sawmill]] and several other essential structures.\n\nGrowth of the community was slow because it was not located along a main traveled route or major waterway. Until 1798, Indian trails, which crossed at Millville, were the only accessways to the area. In that year, a road was surveyed across the Mount Pleasant hills to the [[Susquehanna River]]. It was 1856 through before the road from [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]] to [[Laporte, Pennsylvania|Laporte]] was laid out through Millville.\n\nEarly residents were almost entirely [[self-sufficient]]. Thomas Eves succeeded his father in ownership of the grist mill and built the first house in what is now Millville Borough. According to an early historian, David and Andrew Eves opened the first store in the area in 1827. David Eves was also commissioned the first postmaster in 1831, followed by his brother Andrew some years later.\n\nWhile the early population was scattered, provision was made for both worship and education. In the early years of the community, services and classes were held in the homes, but in 1785, a school was started in Millville and a [[Millville Friends Meeting House|two-room meeting house]] was erected in 1795.\n\nLocal industry at the time consisted of those operations which were necessary to meet the needs of the early population. Sawmills and grist mills were the first, followed by a [[woolen mill]], started in 1813 by John Watson, several [[brick]] plants, and a wagon shop, established by Charles Eves, in 1837.\n\nOne spurt of growth in Millville occurred in 1856 when the road from Bloomsburg to Laporte was constructed. The town experienced considerable growth in the years following construction of this roadway because the community now had adequate access to markets and other transportation links in Bloomsburg. A second period of growth was experienced in 1887 when the [[railroad]] was constructed through town. Numerous businesses and industries were created and buildings were erected to service the railroad. A local newspaper, the ''Weekly Tablet'', published its first edition in April 1887.\n\n==Geography==\nMillville is located in northwestern Columbia County at {{coord|41|7|22|N|76|31|40|W|type:city}} (41.122785, -76.527650),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> on the east side of [[Little Fishing Creek]], which flows south to join [[Fishing Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River)|Fishing Creek]] just north of the [[Susquehanna River]] in Bloomsburg.

(One account of this visit indicates that he purchased a sizable portion of the land he explored in the area from the Indians who had served as his guides on his journey.) Although he returned to Delaware after this initial visit, he returned the following year with his son Thomas and built a log cabin on the property. The entire Eves family arrived the next year, in 1772, and began tilling the fields adjacent to the cabin as soon as they could be cleared.\n\nIn 1774, the Eves family received a deed for their {{convert|1203|acre|km2|sing=on}} property in the valley, the largest land holding at the time in what would later become Columbia County. Title for the land, originally obtained by William and Elizabeth McMean in 1769, was passed to Reuben Haines, and then to John Eves.\n\nAn Indian uprising, the [[Battle of Wyoming]], in mid-summer of 1778, caused the Eves family to flee their home in the valley and take refuge at a [[stockade]] near [[Washingtonville, Pennsylvania|Washingtonville]]. Upon their return in 1785, they found their cabin burned and their fields overgrown, but immediately set about to recreate their homestead.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Millville PA Friends 1795.jpg|[[Millville Friends Meeting House]], established in 1795\n</gallery>\nWhen the Eves family returned in the mid-1780s, they were determined to make the settlement permanent. They were accompanied or were soon followed by several other families, including Masters, Kisner, Battin, Parker, Lundy, Lemon, Oliver, and Rich. With 17 children and 104 grandchildren, John Eves looked after the building of homes for the family, a [[gristmill]] that was to stand for 100 years, and later a [[sawmill]] and several other essential structures.\n\nGrowth of the community was slow because it was not located along a main traveled route or major waterway. Until 1798, Indian trails, which crossed at Millville, were the only accessways to the area. In that year, a road was surveyed across the Mount Pleasant hills to the [[Susquehanna River]]. It was 1856 through before the road from [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]] to [[Laporte, Pennsylvania|Laporte]] was laid out through Millville.\n\nEarly residents were almost entirely [[self-sufficient]]. Thomas Eves succeeded his father in ownership of the grist mill and built the first house in what is now Millville Borough. According to an early historian, David and Andrew Eves opened the first store in the area in 1827. David Eves was also commissioned the first postmaster in 1831, followed by his brother Andrew some years later.\n\nWhile the early population was scattered, provision was made for both worship and education. In the early years of the community, services and classes were held in the homes, but in 1785, a school was started in Millville and a [[Millville Friends Meeting House|two-room meeting house]] was erected in 1795.\n\nLocal industry at the time consisted of those operations which were necessary to meet the needs of the early population. Sawmills and grist mills were the first, followed by a [[woolen mill]], started in 1813 by John Watson, several [[brick]] plants, and a wagon shop, established by Charles Eves, in 1837.\n\nOne spurt of growth in Millville occurred in 1856 when the road from Bloomsburg to Laporte was constructed. The town experienced considerable growth in the years following construction of this roadway because the community now had adequate access to markets and other transportation links in Bloomsburg. A second period of growth was experienced in 1887 when the [[railroad]] was constructed through town. Numerous businesses and industries were created and buildings were erected to service the railroad.
