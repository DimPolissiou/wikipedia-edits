{"title_page": "Spain in the Middle Ages", "text_new": "{{History of Spain|image= |caption= }}\nIn many ways, the history of Spain is marked by waves of conquerors who brought their distinct cultures to the peninsula.  After the passage of the [[Vandal#Iberia|Vandals]] and [[Alans]] down the Mediterranean coast of [[Hispania]] from 408, the history of '''medieval Spain''' begins with the Iberian kingdom of the [[Arianism|Arian]]ist [[Visigoth]]s (507\u2013711), who were [[Christianization|converted to Catholicism]] with their king [[Reccared I|Reccared]] in 587. Visigothic culture in Spain can be seen as a phenomenon of [[Late Antiquity]] as much as part of the [[Age of Migrations]].\n \nFrom Northern Africa in 711, the Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate]] crossed into Spain, at the invitation of a Visigothic clan to assist it in rising against King [[Roderic]]. Over the period 711-788, the Umayyads conquered most of the lands of the Visigothic kingdom of Hispania and established the territory known as [[Al-Andalus]]. A revolt during the conquest established the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in the North of Spain.\n\nMuch of the period is marked by conflict between the Muslim and Christian states of Spain, referred to as the [[Reconquista]], or the Reconquest (i.e.: The Christians \"reconquering\" their lands as a religious crusade). The border between Muslim and Christian lands wavered southward through 700 years of war, which marked the peninsula as a militarily contested space. The medieval centuries also witnessed episodes of warfare between Spain's Christian states. Wars between the [[Crown of Aragon]] and the [[Crown of Castile]] were sparked by dynastic rivalries or disagreements over tracts of land conquered or to be conquered from the Muslim south.\n\nThe Middle Ages in Spain are often said to end in 1492 with the [[Granada War|final acts of the Reconquista]] in the capitulation of the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] [[Emirate of Granada]] and the [[Alhambra decree]] ordering the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|expulsion of the Jews]]. [[Early Modern]] Spain was first united as an institution in the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] as Charles I of Spain.\n\n\n\n <3 you Wikipedia\n\n==Early medieval Spain==\nWhen the [[Germanic peoples]] invaded the provinces of the Roman Empire, the hordes, urged forward by the pressure of the [[Huns]] in their rear, hurled themselves for the first time upon the Pyrenean Peninsula \u2013 the [[Alani]], a people of Scythian, or Tatar, race; the [[Vandals]] and [[Suebians]], Germanic races. The Alani were, for the most part, quickly brought into subjection. The Vandals, after establishing themselves in [[Baetica]], to which they gave the name of Vandalusia (Andalusia), passed on into Africa, while the [[Visigoths]] hemmed in the Suebi in Galicia until the latter were completely brought under control. These Visigoths, or Western Goths, after [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacking Rome]] under the leadership of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] (410), turned towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with [[Athaulf]] for their leader, and occupied the northeastern portion. [[Wallia]] extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia. [[Theodoric I]] took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], where [[Attila]] was routed.<ref name=Spain>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spain}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n[[Euric]] (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia. Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths. In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] against the [[Arianism]] of the Visigoths, and in the [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|wars]] which ensued [[Alaric II]] and [[Amalaric]] lost their lives.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[Image:STA. COMBA DE BANDE - Vista exterior.jpg|thumb|Visigothic church of Santa Comba de Bande, Ourense. Galicia, Spain.]]\n[[Athanagild]], having risen against King [[Agila]], called in the Byzantine Greeks and, in payment for the succour they gave him, ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast (554). [[Liuvigild]] restored the political unity of the peninsula, subduing the Suebians, but the religious divisions of the country, reaching even the royal family, brought on a civil war. [[St. Hermengild]], the king's son, putting himself at the head of the Catholics, was defeated and taken prisoner, and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the Arians. [[Reccared]], son of Liuvigild and brother of St. Hermengild, added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father, accepting the Catholic faith in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589). The religious unity established by this council was the basis of that fusion of Goths with Hispano-Romans which produced the medieval Spanish nation.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[Sisebut]] and [[Suintila]] completed the expulsion of the Byzantines from Spain.

These elements, however, were as yet uncombined, and still lacked that thorough fusion which was to make one people out of them, with a character and historical destiny of its own. The  [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim invasion]] encouraged the Goths and Hispano-Romans, in the mountains of the north, became one people with one religion and one national aspiration, to reconquer their Spanish fatherland and make the Cross triumph over the Crescent.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nThough already morally a unit, the Spanish people were still eight centuries away from political unity, and the Reconquest was begun from four distinct centres. Chief among these four centres was [[Asturias]]. The fugitive Goths found a retreat in those mountains where the Romans had never been able to effectively establish their authority; only a few years after the [[Battle of Guadalete]], they gained a victory over [[Al Qama]] in the portentous [[Battle of Covadonga]]. [[Don Pelayo]], or Pelagius, the Gothic chieftain who was victor at Covadonga, was acclaimed king, and took up his residence at [[Cangas de On\u00eds]]. His son [[Favila]] was killed while hunting, torn to pieces by a bear, and was succeeded by [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso I]], son-in-law of Don Pelayo, who set about pushing the Reconquest as far as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Tierra de Campos]] (the \"Gothic Fields\" or Campos G\u00f3ticos).<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[Fruela I]] (727\u2013728) founded [[Oviedo]]. He was assassinated, and was succeeded by several petty kings ([[Aurelius of Asturias|Aurelius]], [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]], [[Mauregato]], and [[Bermudo I of Asturias|Bermudo I, the Deacon]]) and at last [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II, the Chaste]], who set up his court at Oviedo, recommenced the great expeditions against the Muslims, and seems to have invited [[Charlemagne]] to come to Asturias, thus occasioning the Frankish monarch's expedition which ended in the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass|disaster of Roncevaux]]. The Vikings invaded Galicia in 844 but were expelled by [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] from [[A Coru\u00f1a]]. 70 Viking ships were captured and burned.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Haywood |first1=John |title=Northmen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGmoCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT189#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Vikings returned to Galicia in 859, during the reign of [[Ordo\u00f1o I]]. They were faced with an army led by Don Pedro who dispersed them and destroyed 38 of their ships. [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III, the Great]], continued the forays as far as the Sierra Morena, and founded Burgos, the future capital of Castile. His sons rebelled against him, and he abdicated the crown, dividing his dominions among them. With him ended the Kingdom of Asturias, the territory of which soon became subject to Le\u00f3n.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nAnother rallying-point of the Reconquest was Arag\u00f3n; the other two, Navarre and Catalonia, were placed by the circumstances of their origin in peculiar relations with France. The Basques on either side of the Western Pyrenees dissatisfied with Frankish rule, rebelled on several occasions. At Roncevaux they annihilated the forces of Charlemagne, and in 824 another victory secured the independence of the Basques of Pamplona. The names and dates of their kings, or chieftains, are very uncertain until we come to [[Sancho II of Pamplona|Sancho II, Abarca]]. He abdicated in favour of his son, [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez II of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda II, the Trembler]], in whose time the Le\u00f3nese and Navarrese together were [[Battle of Valdejunquera|routed at Valdejunquera]].<ref name=Spain/> [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho III, the Great]], was one of the monarchs who most influenced Spanish history; he was eventually King of Navarre, Castile, Arag\u00f3n, and Sobrarbe. At his death (1035) he divided his kingdoms, giving Navarre to his eldest son Garc\u00eda, Castile, with the title of King, to Fernando, Arag\u00f3n to Ramiro, and Sobrarbe to Gonz\u00e1lo. This fashion of regarding the various states as patrimonial possessions \u2013 an idea borrowed from French feudalism, and previously unknown in the Spanish kingdoms \u2013 was introduced at this time; it resulted in the numerous divisions which led to so many wars and which long formed an obstacle to the unity of the Reconquest in the West.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n===The Unification of Spain===\nSeveral difficulties stood in the way of the union of the various states formed in Spain by the Reconquest; the diversity of its points of departure was the principal. Navarre and Catalonia were in particularly close contact with France, and the marriage of Ram\u00f3n Berenguer the Great with Dulcia, heiress of Provence, made the relations between the peoples of the ''langue d'oc'' so close that the subsequent development of Catalonia was connected rather with that of the South of France. In Navarre, again, when the dynasty of Sancho the Elder became extinct, the Crown passed in succession to the houses of [[House of Blois|Blois]] (1234), of France, and of [[House of \u00c9vreux|\u00c9vreux]] (1349\u20131441), with the result that Navarre, until the fifteenth century, lived in much closer relations with the French monarchy than with the Spanish states. On the other hand, the feudal usages introduced in the Western Kingdoms by the House of Navarre brought about repeated partitions of states. [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand I]] divided his kingdom into five parts, Castile, Le\u00f3n, Galicia, Zamora, and Toro, though, in the event his son [[Sancho II of Castile and Le\u00f3n|Sancho the Strong]] despoiled his brothers and restored the kingdom to unity. But [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alonso VII, the Emperor]], again separated Castile and Le\u00f3n, leaving the former to his son [[Sancho III of Castile|Sancho]], and the latter to Ferdinand.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nAnother result of feudal customs introduced by the Burgundian princes was the separation of Portugal. For [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]] gave his daughters [[Urraca of Le\u00f3n|Urraca]] and [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa]] in marriage to [[Raymond of Burgundy|Raymond]] and [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]], who founded two dynasties: that of Portugal, and that of Castile and Le\u00f3n, which began with Alfonso VII. The Kingdoms of Asturias, Galicia, Le\u00f3n, and Castile were definitively united under [[Ferdinand III of Castile|St. Ferdinand]], heir of Le\u00f3n through his father [[Alfonso IX]], and of Castile through his mother Berenguela. In the same way Catalonia and Arag\u00f3n were definitively united by the marriage of Ram\u00f3n Berenguer, the Saint, with Do\u00f1a Petronila, daughter of Ramiro, the Monk, of Arag\u00f3n, of whom legend says that he made the famous \"Bell of Huesca\" out of the heads of rebellious nobles. These three rebellious states, to which the divisions of the peninsula had been reduced, completed the Reconquest; they were not united, to form Iberian national unity, until three centuries later.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nThe kingdom formed by the union of Arag\u00f3n and Catalonia was the first to complete that portion of the Reconquest which the geographical conditions assigned to it; then it directed its strength eastward. [[Peter II of Aragon|Peter II, the Catholic]], sovereign of Arag\u00f3n and Catalonia, went to Rome to seek the annulment of his marriage with [[Maria of Montpellier]], and to have himself crowned by the pope. The former purpose he failed to accomplish; the latter occasioned him a great deal of trouble, as the Arag\u00f3nese nobles refused to recognize the position of vassalage to the Holy See in which Peter had placed his kingdom. These nobles then forced for the first time that union, or confederation, which was the cause of such serious disturbances until [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]] with his dagger cut in pieces the document which recorded it. Peter II, the Catholic, fell in the [[Battle of Muret]] (1213), defending his Albigensian kinsmen against [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], whom [[Innocent III]] had sent against them. His son, [[James I of Aragon|James I, the Conqueror]], completed the Catalan-Arag\u00f3nese Reconquest, winning Majorca (1228) and Valencia (1238) besides helping his son-in-law, [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X, the Wise]], to complete the [[Conquest of Murcia (1265\u201366)|conquest of Murcia]]. His son and successor gave a new direction to Catalan-Arag\u00f3nese policy by enforcing the rights of his wife, [[Constance of Sicily, Queen of Aragon|Constance]], to the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]. Profiting by the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers|rising of the Sicilian Vespers]] against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] (1282), he possessed himself of Sicily and attacked Naples.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[File:Castello di reggio calabria, esterno 01.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Aragonese Castle (Reggio Calabria)|Aragonese Castle]] in Reggio Calabria, Italy]]\nThis conquest, however, placed the kings of Arag\u00f3n in a position of antagonism with the popes, who defended the rights of the House of Anjou. [[Martin IV]] having excommunicated [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]], the Arag\u00f3nese nobles took advantage of the fact to extend their privileges at the expense of the royal power. The demands of the nobles increased in the reign of [[Alfonso III of Aragon|Alfonso III]], who was forced to confirm to them the famous Privilegio de la Union. [[James II of Aragon|James II]] became reconciled with the Holy See, accepting Corsica and Sardinia in lieu of Sicily. Peter IV, the Ceremonious, defeated the nobles at Epila (1348) and used his dagger to cut in pieces the charter they had extorted from his predecessors. In the meantime the Catalans and Arag\u00f3nese who were left in Sicily offered themselves to the Emperor Andronicus Palaeologus to [[Catalan campaign in Asia Minor|fight the Turks]]. Having conquered these, they turned their arms against the Greeks, who treacherously slew their leaders; but for this treachery the Spaniards, under Bernard of Rocafort and Berenguer of Entenca, exacted the terrible penalty celebrated in history as \"The Catalan Vengeance\" and moreover seized the Duchies of [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatras]] (1313). The royal line of Arag\u00f3n became extinct with [[Martin the Humane]], and the [[Compromise of Caspe]] gave the Crown to the dynasty of Castile, thus preparing the final union. [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso V, the Magnanimous]], once more turned Arag\u00f3nese policy in the direction of Italy, where he possessed the Kingdom of Sicily and acquired that of Naples by having himself made adoptive son of Queen Joanna. With these events began the Italian wars which were not to end until the eighteenth century.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[File:Spanish kingdoms 1360.jpg|thumb|260px|The Spanish kingdoms in 1360]]\nMeanwhile the Reconquest languished in Castile; at first, because of the candidacy of Alfonso X for the crown of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in which candidacy he had secured a majority of the electoral princes. This was followed by a disputed succession to the throne, the rival claimants being the Cerda heirs (sons of [[Ferdinand de la Cerda|Fernando]], the eldest son of Alfonso X) and the second son of [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]]. Next came the minorities of [[Ferdinand IV of Castile|Ferdinand IV]], [[Alfonso XI]], [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]], and [[John II of Castile|John II]], and fresh civil strife in the reigns of [[Pedro the Cruel]] and of [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]]. [[Ferdinand IV of Castile|Ferdinand IV]] succeeded to the throne at the age of nine, being under the tutelage of his mother [[Mar\u00eda de Molina]]. Alfonso XI was little more than one year old when his father died (1312); and though his reign was in many respects glorious, and he overcame the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] in the [[Battle of R\u00edo Salado]] (1340), still his amours with [[Eleanor de Guzm\u00e1n]], by whom he had several children, resulted in the wars of the following reign, that of Pedro the Cruel, who was at last slain by his bastard brother, Henry of Trast\u00e1mara, and succeeded on the throne by him under the title of [[Henry II of Castile|Henry II]]. [[John I of Castile|John I]], who married [[Beatrice of Portugal]] (1383), sought to unite the two kingdoms on the death of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand]], the last King of Portugal of the Burgundian line. The Portuguese, however, defeated John of Castile at the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]], and the Portuguese Crown went to the Master of Aviz, who became [[John I of Portugal]] (1385). Henry III, who married [[Catherine of Lancaster]], was the first to take the title of [[Prince of Asturias]] as heir to the Crown, which he inherited during his minority, as did his son, John II.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nNational unity was eventually attained by the most unexpected means: [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]], who was not the heiress of [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]], married [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Arag\u00f3n]], who was not the heir of [[John II of Aragon|John II]], and the tragic death of the [[Prince of Viana]], on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the no less tragic fate of [[Joanna la Beltraneja]] contributed to a result which no doubt entered into the designs of Providence.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n==Medieval Spanish culture==\nIn the post-Roman period before 711, the [[history of the Spanish language]] began with [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]]; the other Latin-derived Hispanic languages with a considerable body of literature are [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (which had a relevant golden age of [[Valencian language|Valencian]]), and to a lesser degree [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]. [[Asturian Medieval Spanish]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language|Basque]] languages were primarily oral.\n\n==Main Spanish cities in the Middle Ages==\nMedieval Spain was as much as a network of cities as it was interconnected provinces. Cities were cultural and administrative centers, the seats of bishops and sometimes kings, with markets and housing expanding from a central fortified stronghold.

After the passage of the [[Vandal#Iberia|Vandals]] and [[Alans]] down the Mediterranean coast of [[Hispania]] from 408, the history of '''medieval Spain''' begins with the Iberian kingdom of the [[Arianism|Arian]]ist [[Visigoth]]s (507\u2013711), who were [[Christianization|converted to Catholicism]] with their king [[Reccared I|Reccared]] in 587. Visigothic culture in Spain can be seen as a phenomenon of [[Late Antiquity]] as much as part of the [[Age of Migrations]].\n \nFrom Northern Africa in 711, the Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate]] crossed into Spain, at the invitation of a Visigothic clan to assist it in rising against King [[Roderic]]. Over the period 711-788, the Umayyads conquered most of the lands of the Visigothic kingdom of Hispania and established the territory known as [[Al-Andalus]]. A revolt during the conquest established the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in the North of Spain.\n\nMuch of the period is marked by conflict between the Muslim and Christian states of Spain, referred to as the [[Reconquista]], or the Reconquest (i.e.: The Christians \"reconquering\" their lands as a religious crusade). The border between Muslim and Christian lands wavered southward through 700 years of war, which marked the peninsula as a militarily contested space. The medieval centuries also witnessed episodes of warfare between Spain's Christian states. Wars between the [[Crown of Aragon]] and the [[Crown of Castile]] were sparked by dynastic rivalries or disagreements over tracts of land conquered or to be conquered from the Muslim south.\n\nThe Middle Ages in Spain are often said to end in 1492 with the [[Granada War|final acts of the Reconquista]] in the capitulation of the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] [[Emirate of Granada]] and the [[Alhambra decree]] ordering the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|expulsion of the Jews]]. [[Early Modern]] Spain was first united as an institution in the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] as Charles I of Spain.\n\n==Early medieval Spain==\nWhen the [[Germanic peoples]] invaded the provinces of the Roman Empire, the hordes, urged forward by the pressure of the [[Huns]] in their rear, hurled themselves for the first time upon the Pyrenean Peninsula \u2013 the [[Alani]], a people of Scythian, or Tatar, race; the [[Vandals]] and [[Suebians]], Germanic races. The Alani were, for the most part, quickly brought into subjection. The Vandals, after establishing themselves in [[Baetica]], to which they gave the name of Vandalusia (Andalusia), passed on into Africa, while the [[Visigoths]] hemmed in the Suebi in Galicia until the latter were completely brought under control. These Visigoths, or Western Goths, after [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacking Rome]] under the leadership of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] (410), turned towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with [[Athaulf]] for their leader, and occupied the northeastern portion. [[Wallia]] extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia. [[Theodoric I]] took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], where [[Attila]] was routed.<ref name=Spain>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spain}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n[[Euric]] (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia. Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths. In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] against the [[Arianism]] of the Visigoths, and in the [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|wars]] which ensued [[Alaric II]] and [[Amalaric]] lost their lives.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[Image:STA.

[[Liuvigild]] restored the political unity of the peninsula, subduing the Suebians, but the religious divisions of the country, reaching even the royal family, brought on a civil war. [[St. Hermengild]], the king's son, putting himself at the head of the Catholics, was defeated and taken prisoner, and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the Arians. [[Reccared]], son of Liuvigild and brother of St. Hermengild, added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father, accepting the Catholic faith in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589). The religious unity established by this council was the basis of that fusion of Goths with Hispano-Romans which produced the medieval Spanish nation.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[Sisebut]] and [[Suintila]] completed the expulsion of the Byzantines from Spain.

His son [[Favila]] was killed while hunting, torn to pieces by a bear, and was succeeded by [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso I]], son-in-law of Don Pelayo, who set about pushing the Reconquest as far as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Tierra de Campos]] (the \"Gothic Fields\" or Campos G\u00f3ticos).<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[Fruela I]] (727\u2013728) founded [[Oviedo]]. He was assassinated, and was succeeded by several petty kings ([[Aurelius of Asturias|Aurelius]], [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]], [[Mauregato]], and [[Bermudo I of Asturias|Bermudo I, the Deacon]]) and at last [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II, the Chaste]], who set up his court at Oviedo, recommenced the great expeditions against the Muslims, and seems to have invited [[Charlemagne]] to come to Asturias, thus occasioning the Frankish monarch's expedition which ended in the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass|disaster of Roncevaux]]. The Vikings invaded Galicia in 844 but were expelled by [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] from [[A Coru\u00f1a]]. 70 Viking ships were captured and burned.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Haywood |first1=John |title=Northmen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGmoCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT189#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Vikings returned to Galicia in 859, during the reign of [[Ordo\u00f1o I]]. They were faced with an army led by Don Pedro who dispersed them and destroyed 38 of their ships. [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III, the Great]], continued the forays as far as the Sierra Morena, and founded Burgos, the future capital of Castile. His sons rebelled against him, and he abdicated the crown, dividing his dominions among them. With him ended the Kingdom of Asturias, the territory of which soon became subject to Le\u00f3n.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nAnother rallying-point of the Reconquest was Arag\u00f3n; the other two, Navarre and Catalonia, were placed by the circumstances of their origin in peculiar relations with France. The Basques on either side of the Western Pyrenees dissatisfied with Frankish rule, rebelled on several occasions. At Roncevaux they annihilated the forces of Charlemagne, and in 824 another victory secured the independence of the Basques of Pamplona. The names and dates of their kings, or chieftains, are very uncertain until we come to [[Sancho II of Pamplona|Sancho II, Abarca]]. He abdicated in favour of his son, [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez II of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda II, the Trembler]], in whose time the Le\u00f3nese and Navarrese together were [[Battle of Valdejunquera|routed at Valdejunquera]].<ref name=Spain/> [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho III, the Great]], was one of the monarchs who most influenced Spanish history; he was eventually King of Navarre, Castile, Arag\u00f3n, and Sobrarbe. At his death (1035) he divided his kingdoms, giving Navarre to his eldest son Garc\u00eda, Castile, with the title of King, to Fernando, Arag\u00f3n to Ramiro, and Sobrarbe to Gonz\u00e1lo. This fashion of regarding the various states as patrimonial possessions \u2013 an idea borrowed from French feudalism, and previously unknown in the Spanish kingdoms \u2013 was introduced at this time; it resulted in the numerous divisions which led to so many wars and which long formed an obstacle to the unity of the Reconquest in the West.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n===The Unification of Spain===\nSeveral difficulties stood in the way of the union of the various states formed in Spain by the Reconquest; the diversity of its points of departure was the principal. Navarre and Catalonia were in particularly close contact with France, and the marriage of Ram\u00f3n Berenguer the Great with Dulcia, heiress of Provence, made the relations between the peoples of the ''langue d'oc'' so close that the subsequent development of Catalonia was connected rather with that of the South of France. In Navarre, again, when the dynasty of Sancho the Elder became extinct, the Crown passed in succession to the houses of [[House of Blois|Blois]] (1234), of France, and of [[House of \u00c9vreux|\u00c9vreux]] (1349\u20131441), with the result that Navarre, until the fifteenth century, lived in much closer relations with the French monarchy than with the Spanish states. On the other hand, the feudal usages introduced in the Western Kingdoms by the House of Navarre brought about repeated partitions of states. [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand I]] divided his kingdom into five parts, Castile, Le\u00f3n, Galicia, Zamora, and Toro, though, in the event his son [[Sancho II of Castile and Le\u00f3n|Sancho the Strong]] despoiled his brothers and restored the kingdom to unity. But [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alonso VII, the Emperor]], again separated Castile and Le\u00f3n, leaving the former to his son [[Sancho III of Castile|Sancho]], and the latter to Ferdinand.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nAnother result of feudal customs introduced by the Burgundian princes was the separation of Portugal. For [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]] gave his daughters [[Urraca of Le\u00f3n|Urraca]] and [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa]] in marriage to [[Raymond of Burgundy|Raymond]] and [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]], who founded two dynasties: that of Portugal, and that of Castile and Le\u00f3n, which began with Alfonso VII. The Kingdoms of Asturias, Galicia, Le\u00f3n, and Castile were definitively united under [[Ferdinand III of Castile|St. Ferdinand]], heir of Le\u00f3n through his father [[Alfonso IX]], and of Castile through his mother Berenguela. In the same way Catalonia and Arag\u00f3n were definitively united by the marriage of Ram\u00f3n Berenguer, the Saint, with Do\u00f1a Petronila, daughter of Ramiro, the Monk, of Arag\u00f3n, of whom legend says that he made the famous \"Bell of Huesca\" out of the heads of rebellious nobles. These three rebellious states, to which the divisions of the peninsula had been reduced, completed the Reconquest; they were not united, to form Iberian national unity, until three centuries later.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nThe kingdom formed by the union of Arag\u00f3n and Catalonia was the first to complete that portion of the Reconquest which the geographical conditions assigned to it; then it directed its strength eastward. [[Peter II of Aragon|Peter II, the Catholic]], sovereign of Arag\u00f3n and Catalonia, went to Rome to seek the annulment of his marriage with [[Maria of Montpellier]], and to have himself crowned by the pope. The former purpose he failed to accomplish; the latter occasioned him a great deal of trouble, as the Arag\u00f3nese nobles refused to recognize the position of vassalage to the Holy See in which Peter had placed his kingdom. These nobles then forced for the first time that union, or confederation, which was the cause of such serious disturbances until [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]] with his dagger cut in pieces the document which recorded it. Peter II, the Catholic, fell in the [[Battle of Muret]] (1213), defending his Albigensian kinsmen against [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], whom [[Innocent III]] had sent against them. His son, [[James I of Aragon|James I, the Conqueror]], completed the Catalan-Arag\u00f3nese Reconquest, winning Majorca (1228) and Valencia (1238) besides helping his son-in-law, [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X, the Wise]], to complete the [[Conquest of Murcia (1265\u201366)|conquest of Murcia]]. His son and successor gave a new direction to Catalan-Arag\u00f3nese policy by enforcing the rights of his wife, [[Constance of Sicily, Queen of Aragon|Constance]], to the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]. Profiting by the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers|rising of the Sicilian Vespers]] against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] (1282), he possessed himself of Sicily and attacked Naples.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[File:Castello di reggio calabria, esterno 01.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Aragonese Castle (Reggio Calabria)|Aragonese Castle]] in Reggio Calabria, Italy]]\nThis conquest, however, placed the kings of Arag\u00f3n in a position of antagonism with the popes, who defended the rights of the House of Anjou. [[Martin IV]] having excommunicated [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]], the Arag\u00f3nese nobles took advantage of the fact to extend their privileges at the expense of the royal power. The demands of the nobles increased in the reign of [[Alfonso III of Aragon|Alfonso III]], who was forced to confirm to them the famous Privilegio de la Union. [[James II of Aragon|James II]] became reconciled with the Holy See, accepting Corsica and Sardinia in lieu of Sicily. Peter IV, the Ceremonious, defeated the nobles at Epila (1348) and used his dagger to cut in pieces the charter they had extorted from his predecessors. In the meantime the Catalans and Arag\u00f3nese who were left in Sicily offered themselves to the Emperor Andronicus Palaeologus to [[Catalan campaign in Asia Minor|fight the Turks]]. Having conquered these, they turned their arms against the Greeks, who treacherously slew their leaders; but for this treachery the Spaniards, under Bernard of Rocafort and Berenguer of Entenca, exacted the terrible penalty celebrated in history as \"The Catalan Vengeance\" and moreover seized the Duchies of [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatras]] (1313). The royal line of Arag\u00f3n became extinct with [[Martin the Humane]], and the [[Compromise of Caspe]] gave the Crown to the dynasty of Castile, thus preparing the final union. [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso V, the Magnanimous]], once more turned Arag\u00f3nese policy in the direction of Italy, where he possessed the Kingdom of Sicily and acquired that of Naples by having himself made adoptive son of Queen Joanna. With these events began the Italian wars which were not to end until the eighteenth century.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n[[File:Spanish kingdoms 1360.jpg|thumb|260px|The Spanish kingdoms in 1360]]\nMeanwhile the Reconquest languished in Castile; at first, because of the candidacy of Alfonso X for the crown of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in which candidacy he had secured a majority of the electoral princes. This was followed by a disputed succession to the throne, the rival claimants being the Cerda heirs (sons of [[Ferdinand de la Cerda|Fernando]], the eldest son of Alfonso X) and the second son of [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]]. Next came the minorities of [[Ferdinand IV of Castile|Ferdinand IV]], [[Alfonso XI]], [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]], and [[John II of Castile|John II]], and fresh civil strife in the reigns of [[Pedro the Cruel]] and of [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]]. [[Ferdinand IV of Castile|Ferdinand IV]] succeeded to the throne at the age of nine, being under the tutelage of his mother [[Mar\u00eda de Molina]]. Alfonso XI was little more than one year old when his father died (1312); and though his reign was in many respects glorious, and he overcame the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] in the [[Battle of R\u00edo Salado]] (1340), still his amours with [[Eleanor de Guzm\u00e1n]], by whom he had several children, resulted in the wars of the following reign, that of Pedro the Cruel, who was at last slain by his bastard brother, Henry of Trast\u00e1mara, and succeeded on the throne by him under the title of [[Henry II of Castile|Henry II]]. [[John I of Castile|John I]], who married [[Beatrice of Portugal]] (1383), sought to unite the two kingdoms on the death of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand]], the last King of Portugal of the Burgundian line. The Portuguese, however, defeated John of Castile at the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]], and the Portuguese Crown went to the Master of Aviz, who became [[John I of Portugal]] (1385). Henry III, who married [[Catherine of Lancaster]], was the first to take the title of [[Prince of Asturias]] as heir to the Crown, which he inherited during his minority, as did his son, John II.<ref name=Spain/>\n\nNational unity was eventually attained by the most unexpected means: [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]], who was not the heiress of [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]], married [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Arag\u00f3n]], who was not the heir of [[John II of Aragon|John II]], and the tragic death of the [[Prince of Viana]], on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the no less tragic fate of [[Joanna la Beltraneja]] contributed to a result which no doubt entered into the designs of Providence.<ref name=Spain/>\n\n==Medieval Spanish culture==\nIn the post-Roman period before 711, the [[history of the Spanish language]] began with [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]]; the other Latin-derived Hispanic languages with a considerable body of literature are [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (which had a relevant golden age of [[Valencian language|Valencian]]), and to a lesser degree [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]. [[Asturian Medieval Spanish]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language|Basque]] languages were primarily oral.\n\n==Main Spanish cities in the Middle Ages==\nMedieval Spain was as much as a network of cities as it was interconnected provinces. Cities were cultural and administrative centers, the seats of bishops and sometimes kings, with markets and housing expanding from a central fortified stronghold.

They were organized in small [[Satrapy|K\u0161atrapies]]/[[Voivodeship]]s sometimes uniting into a bigger [[Mandala]] to repel surrounding despotic empires trying to annex their homelands. Only the pastoral part of the population and military troops migrated frequently but most of the population lived in organized agricultural and industrial small scale townships, called in Europe [[Gord (archaeology)|grods]], e.g. the oases of [[Sogdia]] and [[Bactria|Sparia]] along the [[Silk Road]] ([[Saka|\u015aaka]], [[Tocharians|Tokarians/Tokharians]]\u2026) and around the [[Tarim Basin]] ([[Tarim mummies]], [[Kingdom of Khotan]]) or the rural areas of [[Europe]] ([[Sarmatians|Sarmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Silesia|Vysperia]], [[Speyergau|Spyrgowa/Spirgovia]], [[Bavaria|Boioaria/Boghoaria]]\u2026) and [[Indian subcontinent]] ([[Kashmir|Ka\u015bperia]], [[Punjab (region)|Pand\u017eab]]\u2026). Due to growing (since the 2nd century BC) number of [[Turkic migration|Turkic nomads]] and invaders among them, who adopted their horse-riding, metallurgy, technologies, clothing and customs, they were also often confused with the later, which mostly occurs in the case of the [[Scythians]] ([[Saka|\u015aaka]], [[Sarmatians]], Skolotoi, [[Iazyges]]\u2026). In [[India]] the [[Saka|\u015aaka]], although known earlier as [[Shakya|\u015aakya]] as well as [[Kambojas]], forming now the [[Kushan Empire]] were confused with the [[Xionites]] invading them and were called [[Mleccha]]. The Turkic invaders exploit the subdued sedentary Indo-Europeans in agriculture, industry and warfare ([[Mamluk]], [[Janissaries]]). In some rare cases the enslaved Indo-Europeans may rise to power, e.g. Aleksandra (I\u0161kandara) Lisowska alias [[Roxelana]].\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* [[Reuven Amitai|Amitai, Reuven]]; [[Michal Biran|Biran, Michal]] (editors).

Right after the fall of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1368, the succeeding [[Ming dynasty]] established by [[Han Chinese]] rebuilt the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], which had been begun many hundreds of years earlier to keep the northern nomads out of [[China proper]]. During the subsequent centuries the Mongols, who were then based in Mongolia as the Northern Yuan dynasty, tended to continue their independent, nomadic way of life as much as possible.<ref>Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania, by Barbara A. West, p. 558</ref> On the other hand, the [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] were a confederation of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes who formed and maintained the last horse archer empire from the early 17th century to the middle 18th century. They emerged in the early 17th century to fight the [[Altan Khan of the Khalkha]], the [[Jasaghtu Khan]] and their [[Manchu]] patrons for dominion and control over the Mongolian people and territories. In 1756 this last nomadic power was dissolved due to the Oirat princes' succession struggle and costly war with the [[Qing dynasty]].\n\n===Medieval Turkic khanates===\n{{Main|Kazakh Khanate|Nogai Horde|Crimean Khanate}}\nThe '''Kazakh Khanate'''  ({{lang-kk|\u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u0425\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b\u0493\u044b}}, {{lang|kk-Latn|Qazaq Handy\u01f5y}}, {{lang|kk-Arab|\u0642\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0642 \u062d\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0649\u0639\u0649}}) was a successor of the [[Golden Horde]] existing from the 15th to 19th century, located roughly on the territory of the present-day [[Kazakhstan|Republic of Kazakhstan]]. At its height, the khanate ruled from eastern [[Cumania]] (modern-day West Kazakhstan) to most of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Karakalpakstan]] and the [[Syr Darya]] river with military confrontation as far as [[Astrakhan]] and [[Khorasan Province]], which are now in Russia and Iran, respectively. The Khanate also engaged in slavery and raids in its neighboring countries of [[Russia]] and [[Central Asia]], and was later weakened by a series of [[Oirats|Oirat]] and [[Kazakh-Dzungar Wars|Dzungar invasions]]. These resulted in a decline and further disintegration into three [[J\u00fcz]]-es, which gradually lost their sovereignty and were incorporated to the expanding [[Russian Empire]].

They were organized in small [[Satrapy|K\u0161atrapies]]/[[Voivodeship]]s sometimes uniting into a bigger [[Mandala]] to repel surrounding despotic empires trying to annex their homelands. Only the pastoral part of the population and military troops migrated frequently but most of the population lived in organized agricultural and industrial small scale townships, called in Europe [[Gord (archaeology)|grods]], e.g. the oases of [[Sogdia]] and [[Bactria|Sparia]] along the [[Silk Road]] ([[Saka|\u015aaka]], [[Tocharians|Tokarians/Tokharians]]\u2026) and around the [[Tarim Basin]] ([[Tarim mummies]], [[Kingdom of Khotan]]) or the rural areas of [[Europe]] ([[Sarmatians|Sarmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Silesia|Vysperia]], [[Speyergau|Spyrgowa/Spirgovia]], [[Bavaria|Boioaria/Boghoaria]]\u2026) and [[Indian subcontinent]] ([[Kashmir|Ka\u015bperia]], [[Punjab (region)|Pand\u017eab]]\u2026). Due to growing (since the 2nd century BC) number of [[Turkic migration|Turkic nomads]] and invaders among them, who adopted their horse-riding, metallurgy, technologies, clothing and customs, they were also often confused with the later, which mostly occurs in the case of the [[Scythians]] ([[Saka|\u015aaka]], [[Sarmatians]], Skolotoi, [[Iazyges]]\u2026). In [[India]] the [[Saka|\u015aaka]], although known earlier as [[Shakya|\u015aakya]] as well as [[Kambojas]], forming now the [[Kushan Empire]] were confused with the [[Xionites]] invading them and were called [[Mleccha]]. The Turkic invaders exploit the subdued sedentary Indo-Europeans in agriculture, industry and warfare ([[Mamluk]], [[Janissaries]]). In some rare cases the enslaved Indo-Europeans may rise to power, e.g. Aleksandra (I\u0161kandara) Lisowska alias [[Roxelana]].\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* [[Reuven Amitai|Amitai, Reuven]]; [[Michal Biran|Biran, Michal]] (editors).

{"title_page": "Theoretical key", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=December 2018}}\nIn [[music theory]], a '''theoretical key''' or '''impossible key''' is a [[key (music)|key]] whose [[key signature]] has at least one [[Flat (music)|double-flat]] ({{Music|bb}}) or [[Sharp (music)|double-sharp]] ({{Music|##}}).\n \nDouble-flats and double-sharps are often used as [[accidental (music)|accidentals]], but placing them in the key signature (in music that uses [[equal temperament]]) makes the music generally impractical to read.\n\n==Enharmonic equivalence==\n{{Multiple image|total_width=360\n|image1=G-sharp-major e-sharp-minor.png|caption1=G-sharp major, a key signature with a double-sharp\n|image2=A-flat-major f-minor.svg|caption2=A-flat major, equivalent key}}\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|G{{Music|#}} major:||G{{Music|#}}||A{{Music|#}}||B{{Music|#}}||C{{Music|#}}||D{{Music|#}}||E{{Music|#}}||F{{Music|doublesharp}}\n|-\n|A{{music|b}} major:||A{{music|b}}||B{{Music|b}}||C||D{{music|b}}||E{{music|b}}||F||G\n|}\nFor example, the key of [[G-sharp major]] is a key of this type, because its corresponding [[key signature]] has an F{{Music|doublesharp}} (on its [[leading-tone]]), giving it eight sharps. An equal-tempered [[Scale (music)|scale]] of G-sharp major scale consists of the same pitches as the [[A-flat major]] scale, so that the two scales sound exactly the same; such key pairs are said to be [[enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]]. Consequently, the theoretical key of G-sharp major is usually notated as A-flat major which has four flats.\n\nEven when enharmonic equivalence is not resorted to, it is more common to use either no key signature or one with single-sharps and to provide accidentals as needed for the F{{music|doublesharp}}s, than to incorporate double-sharps into the key signature. Nevertheless, examples of the latter can be found (see below).\n\n===Modulation===\n[[File:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|Circle of fifths showing major and minor keys]]\nWhile a piece of Western music generally has a [[Tonic (music)|home key]], a passage within it may [[modulate (music)|modulate]] to another key, which is usually [[closely related key|closely related]] to the home key (in the Baroque and early Classical eras), that is, close to the original around the [[circle of fifths]]. When the key is near the top of the circle (a key signature of zero or few accidentals), the notation of both keys is straightforward.  But if the home key is near the bottom of the circle (a key signature of many accidentals), and particularly if the new key is on the opposite side (in the late Classical and Romantic eras), it becomes necessary to consider enharmonic equivalence (if double accidentals are to be avoided).\n\nIn each of the bottom three places on the circle of fifths the two enharmonic equivalents can be notated entirely with single accidentals and so do not classify as 'theoretical keys':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Major (minor) || Key signature || &nbsp; || Major (minor) || Key signature\n|-\n|[[B major|B]] ([[G-sharp minor|g{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 5 [[sharp (music)|sharps]] || &nbsp; || [[C-flat major|C{{Music|flat}}]] ([[A-flat minor|a{{Music|flat}}]]) || 7 [[flat (music)|flats]]\n|-\n|[[F-sharp major|F{{Music|sharp}}]] ([[D-sharp minor|d{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 6 sharps || &nbsp; || [[G-flat major|G{{Music|flat}}]] ([[E-flat minor|e{{Music|flat}}]]) || 6 flats\n|-\n|[[C-sharp major|C{{Music|sharp}}]] [[A-sharp minor|(a{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 7 sharps || &nbsp; || [[D-flat major|D{{Music|flat}}]] ([[B-flat minor|b{{Music|flat}}]]) || 5 flats\n|}\n\n==The need to consider theoretical keys==\nHowever, when a parallel key ascends the opposite side of the circle from its home key, then theory suggests that double-sharps and double-flats would have to be incorporated into the notated key signature. The following keys (six of which are the [[parallel key|parallel]] major/minor keys of those above) would require up to seven double-sharps or double-flats: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"\n!Key||Key signature||[[Relative key]]\n|-\n|[[D-flat minor|D{{Music|flat}} minor]] ([[C-sharp minor|C{{Music|sharp}} minor]])|| 8 flats || [[F-flat major|F{{Music|flat}} major]] ([[E major]])\n|-\n|G{{Music|flat}} minor ([[F-sharp minor|F{{Music|sharp}} minor]])|| 9 flats || B{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[A major]])\n|-\n|C{{Music|flat}} minor ([[B minor]])|| 10 flats || E{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[D major]])\n|-\n|F{{Music|flat}} minor ([[E minor]])|| 11 flats || A{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[G major]])\n|-\n|B{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[A minor]])|| 12 flats || D{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[C major]])\n|-\n|E{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[D minor]])|| 13 flats || G{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[F major]])\n|-\n|A{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[G minor]])|| 14 flats || C{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]])\n|-\n|[[G-sharp major|G{{Music|sharp}} major]] ([[A-flat major|A{{Music|flat}} major]])|| 8 sharps || E{{Music|sharp}} minor ([[F minor]]) \n|-\n|D{{Music|sharp}} major ([[E-flat major|E{{Music|flat}} major]])|| 9 sharps || B{{Music|sharp}} minor ([[C minor]])\n|-\n|A{{Music|sharp}} major ([[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]])|| 10 sharps || F{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[G minor]])\n|-\n|E{{Music|sharp}} major ([[F major]])|| 11 sharps || C{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[D minor]])\n|-\n|B{{Music|sharp}} major ([[C major]])|| 12 sharps || G{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[A minor]])\n|-\n|F{{Music|doublesharp}} major ([[G major]])|| 13 sharps || D{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[E minor]])\n|-\n|C{{Music|doublesharp}} major ([[D major]])|| 14 sharps || A{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[B minor]])\n|}\nFor example, pieces in the major mode commonly modulate up a [[perfect fifth|fifth]] to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]]; for a key with sharps in the signature this leads to a key whose key signature has an additional sharp. A piece in C-sharp that performs this modulation would lead to the theoretical key of G-sharp major, requiring eight sharps, meaning an F{{Music|x}} in place of the F{{Music|#}} already present. To write that passage with a new key signature would require recasting the new section using the enharmonically equivalent key signature of A-flat major. An example of such recasting is [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Suite bergamasque]]'': in the third movement \"Clair de lune\" the key shifts for a few measures from D-flat major to D-flat minor (eight flats), but the passage is notated in C-sharp minor (four sharps) for ease of reading; the same happens in the final movement \"Passepied\", which reaches theoretical G-sharp major written as A-flat major.\n\n==Notation==\nSuch passages may instead be notated with the use of double-sharp or double-flat accidentals, as in this example from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', in G-sharp major (the overall key is C-sharp major):\n\n[[File:G-sharp major example 2.png]]\n\nIn very few cases, theoretical keys are in fact used directly, putting the necessary double-accidentals in the key signature. The final pages of [[John Foulds]]' ''[[A World Requiem]]'' are written in G{{music|#}} major (with F{{music|x}} in the key signature), and the third movement of [[Victor Ewald]]'s Brass Quintet Op. 8 is written in F{{music|b}} major (with B{{music|bb}} in the key signature).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enspub.com/pages/93/93503.htm|title=Ewald, Victor: Quintet No 4 in A{{music|b}}, op 8|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=Ensemble Publications|access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref> Examples of theoretical key signatures are pictured below:\n<score>\n\\relative c' { \\hide Staff.TimeSignature \\set Staff.printKeyCancellation = ##f\n  \\key gis   \\major <gis'  bis   dis>_\\markup { \\halign #0.2 \"G# maj\" } \\bar \"||\"\n  \\key dis   \\major <dis   fisis ais>_\\markup { \\halign #0.2 \"D# maj\" } \\bar \"||\"\n  \\key fes   \\major <fes   as    ces>_\\markup { \\halign #0.2 \"Fb maj\" } \\bar \"||\"\n  \\key beses \\major <beses des   fes>_\\markup { \\halign #0.2 \"Bbb maj\" }\n}\n</score>\n\nThere does not appear to be a standard on how to notate theoretical key signatures:\n\n*The default behaviour of [[LilyPond]] (pictured above) writes all single sharps (flats) in the circle-of-fifths order, before proceeding to the double sharps.

For example, in [[19 tone equal temperament]], the key of B{{Music|doubleflat}} major (9 flats) is equivalent to A-sharp major (10 sharps). Thus in non-12-tone tuning systems, keys that are enharmonic in a 12 tone system (for example, A-flat and G-sharp major) may be notated completely differently.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Closely related key]]\n*[[Diatonic function]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Theoretical Key}}\n[[Category:Musical keys]]\n[[Category:Musical notation]]\n[[Category:Music theory]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2018}}\nIn [[music theory]], a '''theoretical key''' or '''impossible key''' is a [[key (music)|key]] whose [[key signature]] has at least one [[Flat (music)|double-flat]] ({{Music|bb}}) or [[Sharp (music)|double-sharp]] ({{Music|##}}).\n \nDouble-flats and double-sharps are often used as [[accidental (music)|accidentals]], but placing them in the key signature (in music that uses [[equal temperament]]) makes the music generally impractical to read.\n\n==Enharmonic equivalence==\n{{Multiple image|total_width=360\n|image1=G-sharp-major e-sharp-minor.png|caption1=G-sharp major, a key signature with a double-sharp\n|image2=A-flat-major f-minor.svg|caption2=A-flat major, equivalent key}}\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|G{{Music|#}} major:||G{{Music|#}}||A{{Music|#}}||B{{Music|#}}||C{{Music|#}}||D{{Music|#}}||E{{Music|#}}||F{{Music|doublesharp}}\n|-\n|A{{music|b}} major:||A{{music|b}}||B{{Music|b}}||C||D{{music|b}}||E{{music|b}}||F||G\n|}\nFor example, the key of [[G-sharp major]] is a key of this type, because its corresponding [[key signature]] has an F{{Music|doublesharp}} (on its [[leading-tone]]), giving it eight sharps. An equal-tempered [[Scale (music)|scale]] of G-sharp major scale consists of the same pitches as the [[A-flat major]] scale, so that the two scales sound exactly the same; such key pairs are said to be [[enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]]. Consequently, the theoretical key of G-sharp major is usually notated as A-flat major which has four flats.\n\nEven when enharmonic equivalence is not resorted to, it is more common to use either no key signature or one with single-sharps and to provide accidentals as needed for the F{{music|doublesharp}}s, than to incorporate double-sharps into the key signature. Nevertheless, examples of the latter can be found (see below).\n\n===Modulation===\n[[File:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|Circle of fifths showing major and minor keys]]\nWhile a piece of Western music generally has a [[Tonic (music)|home key]], a passage within it may [[modulate (music)|modulate]] to another key, which is usually [[closely related key|closely related]] to the home key (in the Baroque and early Classical eras), that is, close to the original around the [[circle of fifths]]. When the key is near the top of the circle (a key signature of zero or few accidentals), the notation of both keys is straightforward.  But if the home key is near the bottom of the circle (a key signature of many accidentals), and particularly if the new key is on the opposite side (in the late Classical and Romantic eras), it becomes necessary to consider enharmonic equivalence (if double accidentals are to be avoided).\n\nIn each of the bottom three places on the circle of fifths the two enharmonic equivalents can be notated entirely with single accidentals and so do not classify as 'theoretical keys':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Major (minor) || Key signature || &nbsp; || Major (minor) || Key signature\n|-\n|[[B major|B]] ([[G-sharp minor|g{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 5 [[sharp (music)|sharps]] || &nbsp; || [[C-flat major|C{{Music|flat}}]] ([[A-flat minor|a{{Music|flat}}]]) || 7 [[flat (music)|flats]]\n|-\n|[[F-sharp major|F{{Music|sharp}}]] ([[D-sharp minor|d{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 6 sharps || &nbsp; || [[G-flat major|G{{Music|flat}}]] ([[E-flat minor|e{{Music|flat}}]]) || 6 flats\n|-\n|[[C-sharp major|C{{Music|sharp}}]] [[A-sharp minor|(a{{Music|sharp}}]]) || 7 sharps || &nbsp; || [[D-flat major|D{{Music|flat}}]] ([[B-flat minor|b{{Music|flat}}]]) || 5 flats\n|}\n\n==The need to consider theoretical keys==\nHowever, when a parallel key ascends the opposite side of the circle from its home key, then theory suggests that double-sharps and double-flats would have to be incorporated into the notated key signature. The following keys (six of which are the [[parallel key|parallel]] major/minor keys of those above) would require up to seven double-sharps or double-flats: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"\n!Key||Key signature||[[Relative key]]\n|-\n|[[D-flat minor|D{{Music|flat}} minor]] ([[C-sharp minor|C{{Music|sharp}} minor]])|| 8 flats || [[F-flat major|F{{Music|flat}} major]] ([[E major]])\n|-\n|G{{Music|flat}} minor ([[F-sharp minor|F{{Music|sharp}} minor]])|| 9 flats || B{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[A major]])\n|-\n|C{{Music|flat}} minor ([[B minor]])|| 10 flats || E{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[D major]])\n|-\n|F{{Music|flat}} minor ([[E minor]])|| 11 flats || A{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[G major]])\n|-\n|B{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[A minor]])|| 12 flats || D{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[C major]])\n|-\n|E{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[D minor]])|| 13 flats || G{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[F major]])\n|-\n|A{{Music|doubleflat}} minor ([[G minor]])|| 14 flats || C{{Music|doubleflat}} major ([[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]])\n|-\n|[[G-sharp major|G{{Music|sharp}} major]] ([[A-flat major|A{{Music|flat}} major]])|| 8 sharps || E{{Music|sharp}} minor ([[F minor]]) \n|-\n|D{{Music|sharp}} major ([[E-flat major|E{{Music|flat}} major]])|| 9 sharps || B{{Music|sharp}} minor ([[C minor]])\n|-\n|A{{Music|sharp}} major ([[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]])|| 10 sharps || F{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[G minor]])\n|-\n|E{{Music|sharp}} major ([[F major]])|| 11 sharps || C{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[D minor]])\n|-\n|B{{Music|sharp}} major ([[C major]])|| 12 sharps || G{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[A minor]])\n|-\n|F{{Music|doublesharp}} major ([[G major]])|| 13 sharps || D{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[E minor]])\n|-\n|C{{Music|doublesharp}} major ([[D major]])|| 14 sharps || A{{Music|doublesharp}} minor ([[B minor]])\n|}\nFor example, pieces in the major mode commonly modulate up a [[perfect fifth|fifth]] to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]]; for a key with sharps in the signature this leads to a key whose key signature has an additional sharp. A piece in C-sharp that performs this modulation would lead to the theoretical key of G-sharp major, requiring eight sharps, meaning an F{{Music|x}} in place of the F{{Music|#}} already present. To write that passage with a new key signature would require recasting the new section using the enharmonically equivalent key signature of A-flat major. An example of such recasting is [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Suite bergamasque]]'': in the third movement \"Clair de lune\" the key shifts for a few measures from D-flat major to D-flat minor (eight flats), but the passage is notated in C-sharp minor (four sharps) for ease of reading; the same happens in the final movement \"Passepied\", which reaches theoretical G-sharp major written as A-flat major.\n\n==Notation==\nSuch passages may instead be notated with the use of double-sharp or double-flat accidentals, as in this example from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', in G-sharp major (the overall key is C-sharp major):\n\n[[File:G-sharp major example 2.png]]\n\nIn very few cases, theoretical keys are in fact used directly, putting the necessary double-accidentals in the key signature.
