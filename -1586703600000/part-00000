It is widely used ornamentally in [[aquariums]], because it is considered attractive and neat in arrangement, and is easy to establish and care for. The alga has a stem (rhizome) which spreads horizontally just above the seafloor. From this stem grow vertical fern-like [[pinnation|pinnae]], whose blades are flat like those of the [[Taxus|yew]] (''Taxus''), hence the species name ''taxifolia''.\n\nIt is one of two algae on the [[list of the world's 100 worst invasive species]] compiled by the [[IUCN]] Invasive Species Specialist Group.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Icones of Japanese algae (Pl.

Behind this appearance, the plant is a typical macro alga, without the [[vascular system]] to transmit nutrients and cells that plants originally evolved on land have. ''Caulerpa taxifolia'' is a single celled organism, but this is often overlooked because of its complexity and size.\n\n''Caulerpa taxifolia'' has been described as storing in its \"leaves\" a single chemical, '[[caulerpicin]]', that is noxious to [[fish]] and other would-be predators, though not toxic to the water around it. This is in contrast to plants which produce a variety of toxins, but in reduced amounts. On the other hand, studies have found that there is reduced pollution and toxicity in waters where it grows invasively, as around port cities in the [[Mediterranean]]. Original concerns about it  decreasing biodiversity of fauna have also been allayed, as species counts have shown this remains about the same.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Introduced species==\nIn 1980, the staff at the [[Wilhelma Zoo]] in [[Stuttgart, Germany]] found that a specific strain of this alga thrived in cold [[aquarium]] environments.

Thus, in contrast to widely publicized reports to the contrary, the species appears to have many beneficial ecological effects on aquatic communities in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAquarist Jean Jaubert, director of the aforementioned Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, has said that the affected areas in the nearby Bay of Menton have been exaggerated 100-fold.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Reproduction mechanism===\nThe aquarium strain reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], that is, vegetatively: the viscous, elastic white fluid inside the stem was found under the microscope to contain only male [[gamete]]s. Rate of growth can be as fast as a centimeter per day. If any small part is severed from the rest of the alga, this small part will regrow into another alga. Anchors of ships and fishing nets can serve as carriers for ''Caulerpa''. Thus, this alga has been found to jump from the coast of one port city to the coast of another port city. The natural strain has both male and female individuals and additionally reproduces sexually. Gametes are expelled from each sex and meet to form a zygote which then goes through two larval stages before becoming an adult.\n\n===Other introductions===\nIn 2000, the strain was found on the coast of [[California]] (U.S.), near [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], and also on the coast of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The California colonization was small enough to be considered controllable: it was covered with [[tarpaulin]] which was held down with sandbags at the edges of the infestation. Then [[chlorine]] was poured in through tubes which fed into certain openings in the tarpaulin: the interior of the tarpaulin filled up with chlorine and killed living organisms inside it, not only the unwanted alga but also fish, invertebrates and other seaweeds. The killing of such other organisms was not desirable but was deemed preferable to letting the algae grow unchecked.\n\nThe appearance off the California coast was most probably caused by an aquarium owner improperly dumping the contents, allowing ''C. taxifolia'' to flow through a [[storm sewer]] into the lagoon where the invasion was discovered. California has since passed a law forbidding the possession, sale or transport of ''Caulerpa taxifolia'' within the state. There is also a federal law under the [[Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974|Noxious Weed Act]] forbidding interstate sale and transport of the aquarium strain ''Caulerpa''.\n\nIn July 2006, the alga had been declared eradicated from the two Southern California locations (Agua Hedionda Lagoon in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] and Seagate Lagoon in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]]).\n\n===Possible natural control method===\nResearchers at the [[University of Nice]] in France have been studying a tiny aquatic slug which is a natural predator of ''C. taxifolia''.<ref>Thibaut, T. 2001.

This slug is believed to feed exclusively on ''C. taxifolia'', by sticking its [[proboscis]] into the stem and sucking out the white viscous liquid inside the stem: this causes the alga to become limp, discolored, and dead. As the slug does so, it absorbs the alga's poison. The slug has an [[enzyme]] which neutralizes the noxious effect of the poison, and at the same time, the poison protects the slug from being eaten by fish. However, this slug cannot survive in the cooler waters of the Mediterranean and, therefore, is unable to control the invasive alga there.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Caulerpa taxifolia - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07620.JPG|''C. taxifolia'' on display at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan.\nFile:CaulerpaTaxifolia.jpg|A field of ''C. taxifolia'' amongst [[seagrass]].\nFile:Lysmata amboinensis on Caulerpa taxifolia.jpg|A [[Pacific cleaner shrimp]] (''Lysmata amboinensis'') on top of a ''C. taxifolia'' specimen within a [[marine aquarium]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n* Peplow, M. 2005.

The story is a sequel to Moore's previous story ''[[Alan Moore's The Courtyard]]'' and part of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. Moore later continued the sequence with his comic ''[[Providence (Avatar Press)|Providence]]''.\n\nOn March 2012 it became the first recipient of the newly created \"Graphic Novel\" category at the [[Bram Stoker Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Keith |last=Davidsen |url=http://www.avatarpress.com/2012/04/alan-moore-accepts-first-ever-gn-bram-stoker-award-for-neonomicon/ |title=Alan Moore Accepts First-Ever GN Bram Stoker Award for Neonomicon |publisher=[[Avatar Press]] |date=1 April 2012 |accessdate=29 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Lamper and Brears visit [[Alan Moore's The Courtyard|Aldo Sax]] at a psychiatric hospital, where he has been detained since committing two murders. They are investigating a copycat killer, and want to question Sax about his motives. Sax speaks seemingly unintelligible gibberish. After studying Sax's previous investigation, Lamper and Brears decide to track down drug dealer Johnny Carcosa in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]], [[Brooklyn]]. Carcosa escapes into a mural in the courtyard of his apartment building. The agents track Carcosa's disturbing sex paraphernalia to a specialty shop in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]]. \n\nGoing undercover as husband and wife, Lamper and Brears attend an [[orgy]] hosted by the owners of the shop, members of the [[Esoteric Order of Dagon]], who regularly indulge in sex rituals to attract the sexual attention of a race of [[Deep Ones|fishmen]]. Lamper and Brears are exposed as agents and Lamper is killed by the cultists.  Brears is locked in a room with a fishman, which rapes her continuously for several days. During this ordeal Brears has a vision of Carcosa, who reveals himself as an avatar of [[Nyarlathotep]], one of the [[Great Old Ones]].\n\nThe creature tastes a drop of Brears' urine and determines that she is pregnant. It helps her escape through underwater tunnels into the ocean. Brears returns to the city and contacts the FBI, instructing them to raid the specialty shop. They find that the cultists have been killed by the fishman, which is gunned down by the agents. Three months later, Brears visits Sax and is able to understand his gibberish as [[Aklo]], the language of the fishmen. She tells him that she is pregnant with the child of the fishman. She realizes that the events in Lovecraft's fiction are actually premonitions of a future apocalypse that will be heralded by the birth of her child, [[Cthulhu]].\n\n==Publication history==\nMoore talked about the genesis of the project in an interview with [[Wired Magazine|''Wired'' magazine]]: \"It was just at the time when I finally parted company with DC Comics over something dreadful that happened around the [[Watchmen (film)|''Watchmen'' film]] [...] I had a tax bill coming up, and I needed some money quickly. So I happened to be talking to William [A. Christensen] from [[Avatar Press]], and he suggested that he could provide some if I was up for doing a four-part series, so I did. So although I took it to pay off the tax bill, I\u2019m always going to make sure I try and make it the best possible story I can.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Thill |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/08/alan-moore/all/1 |title=Alan Moore Gets Psychogeographical With Unearthing |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=9 August 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\nMoore wanted to elaborate on some of the ideas presented in ''The Courtyard'' while at the same time telling a modern story that did not rely upon a 1930s atmosphere. Another idea was to use some of the elements he felt Lovecraft himself and pastiche writers censored or left out of the stories, such as the racism and sexual phobias. Moore explains: \"Lovecraft was sexually squeamish; would only talk of \u2018certain nameless rituals.\u2019 Or he\u2019d use some euphemism: \u2018blasphemous rites.\u2019 It was pretty obvious, given that a lot of his stories detailed the inhuman offspring of these \u2018blasphemous rituals\u2019 that sex was probably involved somewhere along the line. But that never used to feature in Lovecraft\u2019s stories, except as a kind of suggested undercurrent. So I thought, let\u2019s put all of the unpleasant racial stuff back in, let\u2019s put sex back in.

In 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] paid a British transfer record of \u00a3440,000 to bring Dalglish to Liverpool. His years at Liverpool were among the club's most successful periods, as he won six [[list of English football champions|English league championships]], the [[FA Cup]], four [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]s, five [[FA Charity Shield]]s, three [[European Cup]]s and one [[European Super Cup]]. In international football, Dalglish made 102 appearances and scored 30 goals for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] between 1971 and 1986, becoming their most [[Cap (sport)|capped]] player and joint-leading goalscorer (with [[Denis Law]]).\n\nDalglish became [[player-manager]] of Liverpool in 1985 after the resignation of [[Joe Fagan]], winning a further three First Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning in 1991. Eight months later, Dalglish made a return to football management with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C|Blackburn Rovers]], whom he led from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] to win the [[Premier League]] in 1995. Soon afterwards, he stepped down as manager to become [[Director of Football]] at the club, before leaving altogether in 1996.

Newcastle finished runners-up in the Premier League during his first season, but they only finished 13th in [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]], which led to his dismissal the following season. Dalglish went on to be appointed [[Director of Football]] at Celtic in 1999, and later manager, where he won the [[Scottish League Cup]] before an acrimonious departure the following year.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Dalglish focused on charitable concerns, founding The Marina Dalglish Appeal with his wife to raise money for cancer care.

''Reina Cristina'' spent her early years in Spanish waters.  In 1894 she was transferred to the [[Spanish Navy]]'s Asiatic Squadron to deter any aggressive moves the [[German Empire]] might take against the Spanish-owned [[Caroline Islands]] in the [[Pacific]]. When [[Spain]] faced the \"Tagalog Revolt\" (1896\u20131897) \u2013 the Spanish name for the first two years of the [[Philippine Revolution]] \u2013 in the [[Philippine Islands]], ''Reina Cristina'' was actively involved in the Spanish campaign to put down the revolt.  In addition to patrolling Philippine waters to prevent the smuggling of contraband to the insurgents, she also supported [[Spanish Army]] actions against them at [[Cavite]], [[Novaleta]], and [[Binacayan]], including the provision of naval gunfire support to Spanish troops ashore.\n\nShe was later sunk in the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] by the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Asiatic Squadron]] under [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] in the first major engagement of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\n==Technical characteristics==\n''Reina Cristina'' was built at the naval shipyard at [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] and launched 2 May 1887.<ref name=\"Conway p. 384\"/>  She had two funnels.  Her main armament was built by [[Hontoria]] and sponson-mounted. Her five [[torpedo tube]]s were all fixed; two were forward, one was on each beam, and one was aft. Although unprotected and therefore lacking armor, she had 12 watertight compartments built in a French-style cellular system to help her resist flooding.<ref>''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905'' p. 384</ref>  She was designed for colonial service, intercepting smugglers and pirates and supporting small naval actions by combining high speed with a moderate level of armament, but due to chronic boiler problems, however, her designed top speed proved unattainable, and in practice her top speed was about {{convert|10|kn|lk=in}}.  Her unarmored design made her unsuited for a pitched battle with the squadron of heavily armed and armored ships she was destined to meet in [[Battle of Manila Bay (1898)|Manila Bay]] in 1898.<ref name=\"spanamwar.com\">[http://spanamwar.com/Reinacristina.htm The Spanish\u2013American War Centennial Website ''Reina Cristina'']</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n''Reina Cristina'' spent her early years in Spanish waters.  In 1894 she was transferred to the [[Spanish Navy]]'s Asiatic Squadron to deter any aggressive moves the [[German Empire]] might take against the Spanish-owned [[Caroline Islands]] in the [[Pacific]].  She became flagship of the squadron.<ref name=\"spanamwar.com\" />\n\nWhen [[Spain]] faced the \"Tagalog Revolt\" (1896\u20131897) \u2013 the Spanish name for the first two years of the [[Philippine Revolution]] \u2013 in the [[Philippine Islands]], ''Reina Cristina'' was actively involved in the Spanish campaign to put down the revolt.

At 1100 hours on 25 April 1898, ''Reina Cristina'' and the rest of the squadron departed [[Manila Bay]] en route [[Subic Bay]], where Montojo thought he could take advantage of a minefield and coastal defense guns in the face of the American naval attack he believed his squadron soon would face.  However, when Montojo arrived at Subic Bay, he found that few of the mines had been laid and the coastal battery had not yet been mounted.\n[[File:Castilla view aboard wreck.jpg|thumb|right|A view aboard the wreck of ''Castilla''.]]\n\n[[File:Battle of Manila Bay by W. G. Wood.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''Reina Cristina'' (foreground) in action against Dewey's squadron (right) in a painting by W. G. Wood. {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Isla de Cuba||2}} and {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Isla de Luz\u00f3n||2}} at left.]]\nOn 28 April 1898 Montojo decided that the Spanish squadron would be better off if it returned to Manila Bay and offered battle at [[Cavite]], where coastal guns could support him and where the shallow water would reduce the loss of life if his ships were sunk. At 1030 on 29 April 1898, ''Reina Cristina'' and the rest of the squadron departed Subic Bay. Her squadron mate, the wooden cruiser {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Castilla||2}}, was unable to get underway due to engine trouble, so ''Reina Cristina'' took her under tow for the voyage.  The squadron arrived at Cavite later that day and anchored in [[Ca\u00f1acao Bay]] under the lee of the [[Cavite Peninsula]] east of [[Sangley Point]], [[Luzon]], eight miles southwest of [[Manila]].\n\nAt 0400 hours on 1 May 1898, Montojo's squadron was still anchored there when he signalled all ships to prepare for action, and ''Reina Cristina'' readied herself to meet an imminent American attack. Just before 0500 hours, the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Asiatic Squadron]] under [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] was sighted, approaching to attack the Spanish ships in their anchorage. In a few minutes, the first shots of the [[Battle of Manila Bay]], the first major engagement of the Spanish\u2013American War, were fired.\n\n[[File:Sunken Reina Cristina 3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The wreck of ''Reina Cristina''.]]\n''Reina Cristina'' slipped her mooring cables and prepared to maneuver.  At 0520 hours, she opened fire along with the rest of her squadron and the Spanish coastal batteries, although Dewey's ships were out of range.  Finally, at 0540 hours, the U.S. squadron returned fire, with the [[protected cruiser]]s {{USS|Olympia|C-6|6}}, {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|6}}, and {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} concentrating their fire on ''Reina Cristina''.  Soon thereafter, ''Reina Cristina'' was hit twice in rapid succession as Dewey's squadron steamed past; the hits knocked out several of her light guns and started fires, although her crew quickly put the fires out. The American squadron then reversed course and made a second pass. This time, ''Reina Cristina''{{'}}s casualties began to mount as she took numerous hits, including to her forecastle and hull; new fires broke out, and Montojo ordered her after magazine flooded to prevent a catastrophic magazine explosion. Dewey's ships then again reversed course and made a third firing pass.\n\n[[File:View aboard wreck of Reina Cristina.jpg|thumb|300px|left|View aboard the wreck of ''Reina Cristina'' looking aft. The direction of the leaning funnel suggests the image may be reversed.]]\nAs the American squadron again reversed course to make a fourth pass, Montojo ordered ''Reina Cristina'' to get underway. She steamed slowly toward Dewey's [[flagship]], ''Olympia'', with an intention of ramming ''Olympia''. This prompted Dewey to order his squadron to close with and concentrate fire on ''Reina Cristina'', and the range of the one-sided fight quickly closed to {{convert|1,200|yd|m}}.

In addition to patrolling Philippine waters to prevent the smuggling of contraband to the insurgents, she also supported [[Spanish Army]] actions against them at [[Cavite]], [[Novaleta]], and [[Binacayan]], including the provision of naval gunfire support to Spanish troops ashore.\n\nShe was later sunk in the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] by the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Asiatic Squadron]] under [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] in the first major engagement of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].\n\n==Technical characteristics==\n''Reina Cristina'' was built at the naval shipyard at [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] and launched 2 May 1887.<ref name=\"Conway p. 384\"/>  She had two funnels.  Her main armament was built by [[Hontoria]] and sponson-mounted. Her five [[torpedo tube]]s were all fixed; two were forward, one was on each beam, and one was aft. Although unprotected and therefore lacking armor, she had 12 watertight compartments built in a French-style cellular system to help her resist flooding.<ref>''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905'' p. 384</ref>  She was designed for colonial service, intercepting smugglers and pirates and supporting small naval actions by combining high speed with a moderate level of armament, but due to chronic boiler problems, however, her designed top speed proved unattainable, and in practice her top speed was about {{convert|10|kn|lk=in}}.

At 1100 hours on 25 April 1898, ''Reina Cristina'' and the rest of the squadron departed [[Manila Bay]] en route [[Subic Bay]], where Montojo thought he could take advantage of a minefield and coastal defense guns in the face of the American naval attack he believed his squadron soon would face.  However, when Montojo arrived at Subic Bay, he found that few of the mines had been laid and the coastal battery had not yet been mounted.\n[[File:Castilla view aboard wreck.jpg|thumb|right|A view aboard the wreck of ''Castilla''.]]\n\n[[File:Battle of Manila Bay by W.

Wood. {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Isla de Cuba||2}} and {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Isla de Luz\u00f3n||2}} at left.]]\nOn 28 April 1898 Montojo decided that the Spanish squadron would be better off if it returned to Manila Bay and offered battle at [[Cavite]], where coastal guns could support him and where the shallow water would reduce the loss of life if his ships were sunk. At 1030 on 29 April 1898, ''Reina Cristina'' and the rest of the squadron departed Subic Bay. Her squadron mate, the wooden cruiser {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Castilla||2}}, was unable to get underway due to engine trouble, so ''Reina Cristina'' took her under tow for the voyage.  The squadron arrived at Cavite later that day and anchored in [[Ca\u00f1acao Bay]] under the lee of the [[Cavite Peninsula]] east of [[Sangley Point]], [[Luzon]], eight miles southwest of [[Manila]].\n\nAt 0400 hours on 1 May 1898, Montojo's squadron was still anchored there when he signalled all ships to prepare for action, and ''Reina Cristina'' readied herself to meet an imminent American attack. Just before 0500 hours, the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Asiatic Squadron]] under [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] was sighted, approaching to attack the Spanish ships in their anchorage. In a few minutes, the first shots of the [[Battle of Manila Bay]], the first major engagement of the Spanish\u2013American War, were fired.\n\n[[File:Sunken Reina Cristina 3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The wreck of ''Reina Cristina''.]]\n''Reina Cristina'' slipped her mooring cables and prepared to maneuver.  At 0520 hours, she opened fire along with the rest of her squadron and the Spanish coastal batteries, although Dewey's ships were out of range.  Finally, at 0540 hours, the U.S. squadron returned fire, with the [[protected cruiser]]s {{USS|Olympia|C-6|6}}, {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|6}}, and {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} concentrating their fire on ''Reina Cristina''.  Soon thereafter, ''Reina Cristina'' was hit twice in rapid succession as Dewey's squadron steamed past; the hits knocked out several of her light guns and started fires, although her crew quickly put the fires out. The American squadron then reversed course and made a second pass. This time, ''Reina Cristina''{{'}}s casualties began to mount as she took numerous hits, including to her forecastle and hull; new fires broke out, and Montojo ordered her after magazine flooded to prevent a catastrophic magazine explosion. Dewey's ships then again reversed course and made a third firing pass.\n\n[[File:View aboard wreck of Reina Cristina.jpg|thumb|300px|left|View aboard the wreck of ''Reina Cristina'' looking aft. The direction of the leaning funnel suggests the image may be reversed.]]\nAs the American squadron again reversed course to make a fourth pass, Montojo ordered ''Reina Cristina'' to get underway. She steamed slowly toward Dewey's [[flagship]], ''Olympia'', with an intention of ramming ''Olympia''. This prompted Dewey to order his squadron to close with and concentrate fire on ''Reina Cristina'', and the range of the one-sided fight quickly closed to {{convert|1,200|yd|m}}.

The 23-stop, 12.8-kilometre route is the first operational line on the [[Light Rail in Sydney|Sydney light rail network]].\n\nMost of the Inner West Light Rail is built on the path of the former [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]]. The line opened in 1997 and was extended in 2000 and 2014. Operation and maintenance of the line is contracted to the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium by the New South Wales Government's transport authority, [[Transport for NSW]]. Services are operated by [[Transdev Sydney]] as a member of ALTRAC Light Rail.\n\n==Background==\nMost of the alignment of the Dulwich Hill Line had its origins as the Metropolitan Goods railway line. From the time when the [[Sydney Railway Company]] was formed in 1848, it had been the intention of the company to build a freight terminal at [[Darling Harbour]]. To this end, a railway line was constructed between the Sydney railway station (the predecessor to Central railway station) and Darling Harbour, which opened on 26 September 1855.<ref name=\"ST97\">Forsyth, J.H.

The port closed and the area was redeveloped in the 1980s.\n\n==Construction==\nConstruction and conversion of the first section of line from Central station to [[Wentworth Park]] started on 25 January 1996 and took 16 months to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/sydney/|title=Sydney Light Rail Construction and Extension|publisher=Railway Technology}}</ref><ref>\"Sydney Light Rail Construction Commences\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' March 1996 page 6</ref> The {{convert|3.6|km|mi|adj=on}} line reused the former Darling Harbour goods railway line and the tram loop at Central station originally built for [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney's former tram network]], with a new section of track built along Hay Street to connect the two.\n\nThe original route opened for public operation with a limited 09:00 to 17:00 service on 11 August 1997 with three weeks of testing.<ref name=DigestSep97/><ref name=SLRfan>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleeper.apana.org.au/railway/slr/|title=Sydney Light Rail|first=Matthew|last=Geier}}</ref> The official public opening was conducted by [[Premier of New South Wales|State Premier]] [[Bob Carr]] on 31 August 1997.<ref name=DigestSep97/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sleeper.apana.org.au/railway/slr/official-opening.html|title=Sydney Light Rail's Official Opening |first=Matthew |last=Geier}}</ref>\n\nBuoyed by the success of the original line, a 3.6-kilometre, four stop extension of the route opened on 13 August 2000.<ref name=SLRfan/><ref>\"Sydney's Tram Extension Opens\" ''Railway Digest'' September 2000 page 4</ref> This saw the light rail reach Lilyfield, which was then the limit of the closed section of the goods line.\n\n===Extension to Dulwich Hill===\n{{Multiple image\n| align    = right\n| image1   = Dulwich Hill 24-02-10 (4833721233).jpg\n| width1   = 200\n| image2   = Arlington light rail stop 2013-08-07.JPG\n| width2   = 200\n| footer   = The light rail corridor at the [[#Arlington|Arlington]] light rail stop before (February 2010) and during construction (August 2013).\n}}\n\nIn 2009 goods traffic on the line between Rozelle and Dulwich Hill ceased and in February 2010 the [[Keneally ministry|Keneally Government]] announced a {{convert|5.6|km|mi|adj=on}} extension of the light rail from Lilyfield to Dulwich Hill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transportnsw.info/en/transport-status/news/2014/light-rail-extension.page?%0A%09%09%09%09%09%09%09%09%09%09 |title=Inner West Light rail extension now complete |publisher=[[Transport for New South Wales]] |date=27 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327044022/http://www.transportnsw.info/en/transport-status/news/2014/light-rail-extension.page |archivedate=27 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWork to upgrade the track and remove the overhead wiring began in August 2010.<ref>\"Community Update: Light Rail Extension \u2013 Inner West.

However it was impossible to introduce more peak hour services, which run every eight minutes. This is because of constraints associated with the single track near Dulwich Hill, stabling capacity, power, signalling, maintenance facilities and fleet size. The power supply limits frequency to six minutes, while the single track terminus at Dulwich Hill and fleet size limit frequency to eight minutes. The report suggested it would be possible to have more services per hour if shuttle services were to run between Central and Lilyfield.

The track crossing is located between the northern end of the City platform and the southern end of the Dulwich Hill platform. Access to the stop from the Summer Hill side is via a pathway through the grounds of the former Mungo Scott flour mill.\n\nThe stop sits in a medium density residential area which was subject to urban renewal soon after the stop opened. The area on the Lewisham side of the stop featured various light industrial buildings. The Summer Hill side of the stop is dominated by the former flour mill complex, which underwent redevelopment. The mill provided the final traffic for the freight railway line, and the cessation of traffic after the mill's closure provided the catalyst for conversion of the line to light rail. The stop is located adjacent to the flour mill, within walking distance of [[Lewisham railway station, Sydney|Lewisham railway station]] on the [[Inner West & Leppington Line]]. The 2014 extension's Product Definition Report describes the positioning of the stop:\n<blockquote>\nThe site provides the most practical balance between meeting the interchange opportunity with Lewisham Station and the opportunities of the catchment and its two known developments.\n\nPatronage at this location is currently predicted to come approximately equally from walk-up catchment and from interchange. Future redevelopment will see this balance tip significantly in favour of catchment with the stop potentially becoming a focus of the local area.<ref>Sydney Light Rail Extension \u2013 Stage 1, Inner West Extension \u2013 Product Definition Report \u2013 p.19 \u2013 Transport NSW</ref>\n</blockquote>\nAccess to the city is quickest via the heavy rail line, but the light rail provides north-south transport, in contrast to the heavy rail's east-west route.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Waratah Mills===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center; width: 450px; float:right\"\n| rowspan='6'|[[File:Waratah Mills light rail station March 2014.JPG|250px]]\n!

The 23-stop, 12.8-kilometre route is the first operational line on the [[Light Rail in Sydney|Sydney light rail network]].\n\nMost of the Inner West Light Rail is built on the path of the former [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]]. The line opened in 1997 and was extended in 2000 and 2014. Operation and maintenance of the line is contracted to the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium by the New South Wales Government's transport authority, [[Transport for NSW]]. Services are operated by [[Transdev Sydney]] as a member of ALTRAC Light Rail.\n\n==Background==\nMost of the alignment of the Dulwich Hill Line had its origins as the Metropolitan Goods railway line. From the time when the [[Sydney Railway Company]] was formed in 1848, it had been the intention of the company to build a freight terminal at [[Darling Harbour]]. To this end, a railway line was constructed between the Sydney railway station (the predecessor to Central railway station) and Darling Harbour, which opened on 26 September 1855.<ref name=\"ST97\">Forsyth, J.H.

Since the opening of the 2014 extension to Dulwich Hill, passenger-facing branding of the line has referred to it as the Dulwich Hill Line. The line was given the number L1 as part of a broader program to also number all [[Sydney Trains]] and [[Sydney Ferries]] routes.\n\n===Patronage===\nA transport plan released by the New South Wales Government in 1998 reported that the line carried an average of 5,000 passengers on weekdays.<ref>{{cite book|title=Action for Transport 2010: an integrated transport plan for Sydney|date=1998|publisher=New South Wales Government|page=6}}</ref> 2.8 million journeys were made in 2009-10, increasing to 4.2 million in 2012-13.

However it was impossible to introduce more peak hour services, which run every eight minutes. This is because of constraints associated with the single track near Dulwich Hill, stabling capacity, power, signalling, maintenance facilities and fleet size. The power supply limits frequency to six minutes, while the single track terminus at Dulwich Hill and fleet size limit frequency to eight minutes. The report suggested it would be possible to have more services per hour if shuttle services were to run between Central and Lilyfield.

The area on the Lewisham side of the stop featured various light industrial buildings. The Summer Hill side of the stop is dominated by the former flour mill complex, which underwent redevelopment. The mill provided the final traffic for the freight railway line, and the cessation of traffic after the mill's closure provided the catalyst for conversion of the line to light rail. The stop is located adjacent to the flour mill, within walking distance of [[Lewisham railway station, Sydney|Lewisham railway station]] on the [[Inner West & Leppington Line]].

Future redevelopment will see this balance tip significantly in favour of catchment with the stop potentially becoming a focus of the local area.<ref>Sydney Light Rail Extension \u2013 Stage 1, Inner West Extension - Product Definition Report - p.19 - Transport NSW</ref>\n</blockquote>\nAccess to the city is quickest via the heavy rail line, but the light rail provides north-south transport, in contrast to the heavy rail's east-west route.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Waratah Mills===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center; width: 450px; float:right\"\n| rowspan='6'|[[File:Waratah Mills light rail station March 2014.JPG|250px]]\n!

The stop sits at the end of Bedford Crescent, where the Rozelle branch line joined the main [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] and is thus the terminus of the light rail.<ref>[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10101462#/ Dulwich Hill Light Rail Stop] Transport for NSW</ref>\n\nIn the 2014 extension's Environmental Assessment the stop was proposed to be located parallel to the railway station with direct access from Wardell Road. This was to have been achieved by widening the cutting used by the railway lines and removing angle parking on Bedford Crescent. It was proposed to construct an island platform with two tracks.\n\nThe design was altered after a review favoured moving the stop to the end of Bedford Crescent.<ref>[http://majorprojects.planning.nsw.gov.au/files/67448/2%20Submissions%20Report%20-%20Appendix%20A%20(Part%201).pdf Submissions Report Appendix A (Part 1)] p 71.

I p. 160}}.</ref>\n\nShortly before Douglas was born, [[William Douglas, 9th Earl of Angus|his grandfather]] inherited the [[Earl of Angus|Earldom of Angus]] and Lordship of Douglas from a distant cousin; in 1591, his father in turn succeeded to the titles as 10th Earl, and the boy adopted the [[courtesy title|style]] of \"Master of Angus\" or \"Lord Douglas\".\n\nThe 10th Earl was a notable convert from state-sanctioned [[Presbyterianism]] to [[Catholicism]], and the family were not trusted by the [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]] due to his religious position. The prestigious public duties he had inherited, holding the first seat and vote in the [[King's Council]] and [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]], leading the vanguard of the Scots army, and bearing the [[Crown of Scotland]], also brought him into conflict with the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]], who had been granted a conflicting [[Order of precedence|precedence]] and ceremonial role.{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, pp. 383\u2013384}} The scandal of the [[Spanish Blanks]] in 1593\u20131595 made Angus a rebel, and although he eventually recovered his position, and succeeded in defending his inheritance, he chose to go into exile in [[Paris]] in 1608 to obtain [[freedom of conscience]].{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, pp. 385\u2013395, 398\u2013404}}\n\nAll this had an effect on Douglas' childhood; he was separated from his father during the Earl's periods of [[house arrest]], and in 1596 the Douglas inheritance was briefly conferred on him in his father's place. The next year, when his father was restored to favour, the Master of Angus sent away to live with his Protestant cousin and [[Godparent|godfather]], the [[William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]], though he soon returned home after breaking his leg in an accident.{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, pp. 412\u2013413}} In 1601, at the very young age of twelve, the Master of Angus was married to Margaret Hamilton, daughter of [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley]] \u2013 a match that was designed as a Catholic alliance, and also gained the protection of the bride's powerful kinsman, [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Lord Fyvie]].{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, p. 413}}\n\n===Earl of Angus===\nDouglas succeeded his father as [[Earl of Angus]] in 1611; his father had made arrangements to ensure that his inheritance was largely free of the debts that had previously burdened it.{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, p. 413}} However, he was immediately embroiled in legal dispute with his tenants the [[Clan Kerr|Kers of Ferniehirst]] over rights to hold courts in the [[Scottish feudal lordship|Bailiary]] of [[Jedforest]]. This dispute resulted in a severe outbreak of violence in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]], and the case was presented to the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]]. The Lords of Session found in favour of Angus, although his brother James was remanded at [[Blackness Castle]] for threatening one of the Kers. Angus maintained his right to hold courts, and the Kers had to post [[Pound Scots|\u00a310,000]] Scots as security to keep the peace.{{sfn|Balfour Paul|1904|loc=vol I, pp. 202\u2013203}}\n\nNot of a healthy constitution and unhappy with the religious climate at home, Angus was given leave by [[James VI of Scotland]], to travel to Europe, which he did in 1616, returning by 1620; and again in 1623, he was given an 11-year leave of absence to travel to the continent, leaving his estates to  be run by his brother Lord Mordington, and his cousin [[William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton]]. Whilst in France, he corresponded with Marc Antonio Scoto d'[[Agazzano]] and Italian nobleman from [[Piacenza]], who claimed ancient kinship with Angus (cf.

Angus===\nWilliam Douglas was the eldest son of [[William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus]] and his Countess, Elizabeth Oliphant, eldest daughter of [[Laurence Oliphant, 4th Lord Oliphant]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lundy|2015}} cites {{harvnb|Mosley1|999|p=1282}} and {{harvnb|Cokayne|2000|loc=vol.

I p. 160}}.</ref>\n\nShortly before Douglas was born, [[William Douglas, 9th Earl of Angus|his grandfather]] inherited the [[Earl of Angus|Earldom of Angus]] and Lordship of Douglas from a distant cousin; in 1591, his father in turn succeeded to the titles as 10th Earl, and the boy adopted the [[courtesy title|style]] of \"Master of Angus\" or \"Lord Douglas\".\n\nThe 10th Earl was a notable convert from state-sanctioned [[Presbyterianism]] to [[Catholicism]], and the family were not trusted by the [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]] due to his religious position. The prestigious public duties he had inherited, holding the first seat and vote in the [[King's Council]] and [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]], leading the vanguard of the Scots army, and bearing the [[Crown of Scotland]], also brought him into conflict with the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]], who had been granted a conflicting [[Order of precedence|precedence]] and ceremonial role.{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, pp. 383\u2013384}} The scandal of the [[Spanish Blanks]] in 1593\u20131595 made Angus a rebel, and although he eventually recovered his position, and succeeded in defending his inheritance, he chose to go into exile in [[Paris]] in 1608 to obtain [[freedom of conscience]].{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, pp. 385\u2013395, 398\u2013404}}\n\nAll this had an effect on Douglas' childhood; he was separated from his father during the Earl's periods of [[house arrest]], and in 1596 the Douglas inheritance was briefly conferred on him in his father's place. The next year, when his father was restored to favour, the Master of Angus sent away to live with his Protestant cousin and [[Godparent|godfather]], the [[William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]], though he soon returned home after breaking his leg in an accident.{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, pp. 412\u2013413}} In 1601, at the very young age of twelve, the Master of Angus was married to Margaret Hamilton, daughter of [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley]] \u2013 a match that was designed as a Catholic alliance, and also gained the protection of the bride's powerful kinsman, [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Lord Fyvie]].{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, p. 413}}\n\n===Earl of Angus===\nDouglas succeeded his father as [[Earl of Angus]] in 1611; his father had made arrangements to ensure that his inheritance was largely free of the debts that had previously burdened it.{{sfn|Fraser|1885|loc=vol II, p. 413}} However, he was immediately embroiled in legal dispute with his tenants the [[Clan Kerr|Kers of Ferniehirst]] over rights to hold courts in the [[Scottish feudal lordship|Bailiary]] of [[Jedforest]]. This dispute resulted in a severe outbreak of violence in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]], and the case was presented to the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]]. The Lords of Session found in favour of Angus, although his brother James was remanded at [[Blackness Castle]] for threatening one of the Kers. Angus maintained his right to hold courts, and the Kers had to post [[Pound Scots|\u00a310,000]] Scots as security to keep the peace.{{sfn|Balfour Paul|1904|loc=vol I, pp. 202\u2013203}}\n\nNot of a healthy constitution and unhappy with the religious climate at home, Angus was given leave by [[James VI of Scotland]], to travel to Europe, which he did in 1616, returning by 1620; and again in 1623, he was given an 11-year leave of absence to travel to the continent, leaving his estates to  be run by his brother Lord Mordington, and his cousin [[William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton]]. Whilst in France, he corresponded with Marc Antonio Scoto d'[[Agazzano]] and Italian nobleman from [[Piacenza]], who claimed ancient kinship with Angus (cf. The legend of [[Sholto Douglas]]).{{sfn|Maxwell|1902|loc=vol II, p. 188}}\n\nAngus did not stay on the continent for the full 11 years, but returned to Britain following the death of King James in 1625.

In the early 19th century, cells were recognized as being separate entities, unconnected, and bound by individual cell walls after it was found that plant cells could be separated. This theory extended to include animal cells to suggest a universal mechanism for cell protection and development. By the second half of the 19th century, microscopy was still not advanced enough to make a distinction between cell membranes and cell walls. However, some microscopists correctly identified at this time that while invisible, it could be inferred that cell membranes existed in animal cells due to intracellular movement of components internally but not externally and that membranes were not the equivalent of a cell wall to plant cell. It was also inferred that cell membranes were not vital components to all cells. Many refuted the existence of a cell membrane still towards the end of the 19th century. In 1890, an update to the Cell Theory stated that cell membranes existed, but were merely secondary structures. It was not until later studies with osmosis and permeability that cell membranes gained more recognition.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lombard J | title = Once upon a time the cell membranes: 175\u00a0years of cell boundary research | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 9 | pages = 32 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25522740 | pmc = 4304622 | doi = 10.1186/s13062-014-0032-7 }}</ref> In 1895, [[Ernest Overton]] proposed that cell membranes were made of lipids.<ref>Leray, C.

In an attempt to accept or reject the hypothesis, researchers measured membrane thickness.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1925 it was determined by Fricke that the thickness of erythrocyte and yeast cell membranes ranged between 3.3 and 4&nbsp;nm, a thickness compatible with a lipid monolayer. The choice of the dielectric constant used in these studies was called into question but future tests could not disprove the results of the initial experiment. Independently, the leptoscope was invented in order to measure very thin membranes by comparing  the intensity of light reflected from a sample to the intensity of a membrane standard of known thickness. The instrument could resolve thicknesses that depended on pH measurements and the presence of membrane proteins that ranged from 8.6 to 23.2&nbsp;nm, with the lower measurements supporting the lipid bilayer hypothesis. Later in the 1930s, the membrane structure model developed in general agreement to be the [[paucimolecular model]] of [[Hugh Davson|Davson]] and [[James Danielli|Danielli]] (1935). This model was based on studies of surface tension between oils and [[echinoderm]] eggs. Since the surface tension values appeared to be much lower than would be expected for an oil\u2013water interface, it was assumed that some substance was responsible for lowering the interfacial tensions in the surface of cells. It was suggested that a lipid bilayer was in between two thin protein layers. The paucimolecular model immediately became popular and it dominated cell membrane studies for the following 30 years, until it became rivaled by the fluid mosaic model of [[Seymour Jonathan Singer|Singer]] and [[Garth L. Nicolson|Nicolson]] (1972).<ref name=\"Singer1972\">S J Singer and G L Nicolson.\"The fluid mosaic model of the structure of cell membranes.\" Science. (1972) 175. 720-731.</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDespite the numerous models of the cell membrane proposed prior to the [[fluid mosaic model]], it remains the primary archetype for the cell membrane long after its inception in the 1970s.<ref name=\":2\" /> Although the [[fluid mosaic model]] has been modernized to detail contemporary discoveries, the basics have remained constant: the membrane is a lipid bilayer composed of hydrophilic exterior heads and a hydrophobic interior where proteins can interact with hydrophilic heads through polar interactions, but proteins that span the bilayer fully or partially have hydrophobic amino acids that interact with the non-polar lipid interior. The [[fluid mosaic model]] not only provided an accurate representation of membrane mechanics, it enhanced the study of hydrophobic forces, which would later develop into an essential descriptive limitation to describe biological [[macromolecule]]s.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor many centuries, the scientists cited disagreed with the significance of the structure they were seeing as the cell membrane. For almost two centuries, the membranes were seen but mostly disregarded this as an important structure with cellular function. It was not until the 20th century that the significance of the cell membrane as it was acknowledged. Finally, two scientists Gorter and Grendel (1925) made the discovery that the membrane is \u201clipid-based\u201d. From this, they furthered the idea that this structure would have to be in a formation that mimicked layers. Once studied further, it was found by comparing the sum of the cell surfaces and the surfaces of the lipids, a 2:1 ratio was estimated; thus, providing the first basis of the bilayer structure known today. This discovery initiated many new studies that arose globally within various fields of scientific studies, confirming that the structure and functions of the cell membrane are widely accepted.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe structure has been variously referred to by different writers as the ectoplast ([[Hugo de Vries|de Vries]], 1885),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Vries H | year = 1885 | title = Plasmolytische Studien \u00fcber die Wand der Vakuolen | url = | journal = Jahrb.

In [[red blood cell|RBC]] studies, 30% of the plasma membrane is lipid. However, for the majority of eukaryotic cells, the composition of plasma membranes is about half lipids and half proteins by weight.\n\nThe fatty chains in [[phospholipid]]s and [[glycolipid]]s usually contain an even number of carbon atoms, typically between 16 and 20. The 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids are the most common. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated, with the configuration of the double bonds nearly always \"cis\". The length and the degree of unsaturation of fatty acid chains have a profound effect on membrane fluidity as unsaturated lipids create a kink, preventing the fatty acids from packing together as tightly, thus decreasing the [[melting point|melting temperature]] (increasing the fluidity) of the membrane.<ref name=\"Lodish\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> The ability of some organisms to regulate [[Membrane fluidity|the fluidity of their cell membranes]] by altering lipid composition is called [[homeoviscous adaptation]].\n\nThe entire membrane is held together via [[non-covalent]] interaction of hydrophobic tails, however the structure is quite fluid and not fixed rigidly in place. Under [[physiological condition]]s phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane are in the [[Liquid crystal|liquid crystalline state]]. It means the lipid molecules are free to diffuse and exhibit rapid lateral diffusion along the layer in which they are present.<ref name=\"Lodish\" /> However, the exchange of phospholipid molecules between intracellular and extracellular leaflets of the bilayer is a very slow process. [[Lipid rafts]] and caveolae are examples of [[cholesterol]]-enriched microdomains in the cell membrane.<ref name=\":4\" /> Also, a fraction of the lipid in direct contact with integral membrane proteins,  which is tightly bound to the protein surface is called [[annular lipid shell]]; it behaves as a part of protein complex.\n\nIn animal cells cholesterol is normally found dispersed in varying degrees throughout cell membranes, in the irregular spaces between the hydrophobic tails of the membrane lipids, where it confers a stiffening and strengthening effect on the membrane.<ref name=\"MBOC\" /> Additionally, the amount of cholesterol in biological membranes varies between organisms, cell types, and even in individual cells. Cholesterol, a major component of animal plasma membranes, regulates the fluidity of the overall membrane, meaning that cholesterol controls the amount of movement of the various cell membrane components based on its  concentrations.<ref name=\"MBOC\" /> In high temperatures, cholesterol inhibits the movement of phospholipid fatty acid chains, causing a reduced permeability to small molecules and reduced membrane fluidity. The opposite is true for the role of cholesterol in cooler temperatures. Cholesterol production, and thus concentration, is up-regulated (increased) in response to cold temperature. At cold temperatures, cholesterol interferes with fatty acid chain interactions. Acting as antifreeze, cholesterol maintains the fluidity of the membrane. Cholesterol is more abundant in cold-weather animals than warm-weather animals. In plants, which lack cholesterol, related compounds called sterols perform the same function as cholesterol.<ref name=\"MBOC\" />\n\n=== Phospholipids forming lipid vesicles ===\nLipid vesicles or [[liposome]]s are approximately spherical pockets that are enclosed by a lipid bilayer.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal |last=Lodish |first=Harvey |last2=Berk |first2=Arnold |last3=Zipursky |first3=S.

Lipid vesicles and liposomes are formed by first suspending a lipid in an aqueous solution then agitating the mixture through [[sonication]], resulting in a vesicle. By measuring the rate of [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] from that of the inside of the vesicle to the ambient solution, allows researcher to better understand membrane permeability. Vesicles can be formed with molecules and ions inside the vesicle by forming the vesicle with the desired molecule or ion present in the solution. Proteins can also be embedded into the membrane through solubilizing the desired proteins in the presence of detergents and attaching them to the phospholipids in which the liposome is formed.

Processes such as electron transport and generating ATP use proton pumps.<ref name=\"MBOC\" /> A G-protein coupled receptor is a single polypeptide chain that crosses the lipid bilayer seven times responding to signal molecules (i.e. hormones and neurotransmitters). G-protein coupled receptors are used in processes such as cell to cell signaling, the regulation of the production of cAMP, and the regulation of ion channels.<ref name=\"MBOC\" />\n\nThe cell membrane, being exposed to the outside environment, is an important site of cell\u2013cell communication.

The cell membrane also plays a role in anchoring the [[cytoskeleton]] to provide shape to the cell, and in attaching to the [[extracellular matrix]] and other cells to hold them together to form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. [[Fungi]], [[bacteria]], most [[archaea]], and [[plant]]s also have a [[cell wall]], which provides a mechanical support to the cell and precludes the passage of [[macromolecule|larger molecules]].\n\nThe cell membrane is [[Semipermeable membrane|selectively permeable]] and able to regulate what enters and exits the cell, thus facilitating the [[membrane transport|transport]] of materials needed for survival. The movement of substances across the membrane can be either \"[[passive transport|passive]]\", occurring without the input of cellular energy, or \"[[active transport|active]]\", requiring the cell to expend energy in transporting it. The membrane also maintains the [[Membrane potential|cell potential]]. The cell membrane thus works as a selective filter that allows only certain things to come inside or go outside the cell. The cell employs a number of transport mechanisms that involve biological membranes:\n\n1. Passive [[osmosis]] and [[diffusion]]: Some substances (small molecules, ions) such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), can move across the plasma membrane by diffusion, which is a passive transport process. Because the membrane acts as a barrier for certain molecules and ions, they can occur in different concentrations on the two sides of the membrane. Diffusion occurs when small molecules and ions move freely from high concentration to low concentration in order to equilibrate the membrane. It is considered a passive transport process because it does not require energy and is propelled by the concentration gradient created by each side of the membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey M. |date=2000|title=Transport of Small Molecules|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9847/|journal=The Cell: A Molecular Approach |edition=2nd|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605030211/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9847/|archive-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> Such a concentration gradient across a semipermeable membrane sets up an [[osmotic pressure|osmotic flow]] for the water.

Such molecules can diffuse passively through protein channels such as [[aquaporins]] in [[facilitated diffusion]] or are pumped across the membrane by [[Membrane transport protein|transmembrane transporters]]. Protein channel proteins, also called ''permeases'', are usually quite specific, and they only recognize and transport a limited variety of  chemical substances, often limited to a single substance. Another example of a transmembrane protein is a cell-surface receptor, which allow cell signaling molecules to communicate between cells.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n3. [[Endocytosis]]: Endocytosis is the process in which cells absorb molecules by engulfing them. The plasma membrane creates a small deformation inward, called an invagination, in which the substance to be transported is captured.This invagination is caused by proteins on the outside on the cell membrane, acting as receptors and clustering into depressions that eventually promote accumulation of more proteins and lipids on the cytosolic side of the membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alberts |first=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Raff |first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter |first6=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=2002|title=Transport into the Cell from the Plasma Membrane: Endocytosis |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26870/ |journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605030211/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26870/|archive-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> The deformation then pinches off from the membrane on the inside of the cell, creating a vesicle containing the captured substance. Endocytosis is a pathway for internalizing solid particles (\"cell eating\" or [[phagocytosis]]), small molecules and ions (\"cell drinking\" or [[pinocytosis]]), and macromolecules. Endocytosis requires energy and is thus a form of active transport.\n\n4. [[Exocytosis]]: Just as material can be brought into the cell by invagination and formation of a vesicle, the membrane of a vesicle can be fused with the plasma membrane, extruding its contents to the surrounding medium. This is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis occurs in various cells to remove undigested residues of substances brought in by endocytosis, to secrete substances such as hormones and enzymes, and to transport a substance completely across a cellular barrier. In the process of exocytosis, the undigested waste-containing food vacuole or the secretory vesicle budded from [[Golgi apparatus]], is first moved by cytoskeleton from the interior of the cell to the surface. The vesicle membrane comes in contact with the plasma membrane. The lipid molecules of the two bilayers rearrange themselves and the two membranes are, thus, fused. A passage is formed in the fused membrane and the vesicles discharges its contents outside the cell.\n\n== Prokaryotes ==\n[[Prokaryote]]s are divided into two different groups, [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], with bacteria dividing further into [[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]]. [[Gram-negative bacteria]] have both a plasma membrane and an [[bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] separated by [[periplasm]], however, other [[prokaryotes]] have only a plasma membrane. These two membranes differ in many aspects. The outer membrane of the gram-negative bacteria differ from other prokaryotes due to [[phospholipid]]s forming the exterior of the bilayer, and [[lipoprotein]]s and phospholipids forming the interior.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8477/|title=Medical Microbiology|last=Salton|first=Milton R.

The inner, plasma membrane is also generally symmetric whereas the outer membrane is asymmetric because of proteins such as the aforementioned.  Also, for the prokaryotic membranes, there are multiple things that can affect the fluidity.  One of the major factors that can affect the fluidity is fatty acid composition.  For example, when the bacteria ''Staphylococcus aureus'' was grown in 37<sup>\u25e6</sup>C for 24h, the membrane exhibited a more fluid state instead of a gel-like state. This supports the concept that in higher temperatures, the membrane is more fluid than in colder temperatures. When the membrane is becoming more fluid and needs to become more stabilized, it will make longer fatty acid chains or saturated fatty acid chains in order to help stabilize the membrane.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mishra NN, Liu GY, Yeaman MR, Nast CC, Proctor RA, McKinnell J, Bayer AS | title = Carotenoid-related alteration of cell membrane fluidity impacts Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility to host defense peptides | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 526\u201331 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21115796 | pmc = 3028772 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00680-10 }}</ref>  [[Bacteria]] are also surrounded by a [[cell wall]] composed of [[peptidoglycan]] (amino acids and sugars).

J. Singer]] and [[Garth L. Nicolson|G. L.

Examples of such structures are protein-protein complexes, pickets and fences formed by the actin-based [[cytoskeleton]], and potentially [[lipid raft]]s.\n\n===Lipid bilayer===\n[[Image:Fluid Mosaic.svg|thumb|200px|right|Diagram of the arrangement of amphipathic lipid molecules to form a [[lipid bilayer]]. The yellow [[Chemical polarity|polar]] head groups separate the grey hydrophobic tails from the aqueous cytosolic and extracellular environments.]]\n[[Lipid bilayer]]s form through the process of [[self-assembly]]. The cell membrane consists primarily of a thin layer of [[amphipathic]] [[phospholipids]] that spontaneously arrange so that the hydrophobic \"tail\" regions are isolated from the surrounding water while the hydrophilic \"head\" regions interact with the intracellular (cytosolic) and extracellular faces of the resulting bilayer. This forms a continuous, spherical [[lipid bilayer]]. Hydrophobic interactions (also known as the [[hydrophobic effect]]) are the major driving forces in the formation of lipid bilayers.  An increase in interactions between  hydrophobic molecules (causing clustering of hydrophobic regions) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other, increasing the entropy of the system.  This complex interaction can include noncovalent interactions such as [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]], electrostatic and hydrogen bonds.\n\nLipid bilayers are generally impermeable to ions and polar molecules. The arrangement of hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails of the lipid bilayer prevent polar solutes (ex. amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, and ions) from diffusing across the membrane, but generally allows for the passive diffusion of hydrophobic molecules. This affords the cell the ability to control the movement of these substances via [[transmembrane protein]] complexes such as pores, channels and gates.\n[[Flippase]]s and [[scramblase]]s concentrate [[phosphatidyl serine]], which carries a negative charge, on the inner membrane. Along with [[sialic acid|NANA]], this creates an extra barrier to charged [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] moving through the membrane.\n\nMembranes serve diverse functions in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells. One important role is to regulate the movement of materials into and out of cells. The phospholipid bilayer structure (fluid mosaic model) with specific membrane proteins accounts for the selective permeability of the membrane and passive and active transport mechanisms. In addition, membranes in prokaryotes and in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes facilitate the synthesis of ATP through chemiosmosis.\n\n===Membrane polarity===\n{{See also|Epithelial polarity}}\n<!-- Apical_Membrane redirects here --><!-- Basolateral_Membrane redirects here --><!-- Basolateral redirects here -->\n[[Image:Alpha Intercalated Cell Cartoon.svg|thumb|300px|Alpha intercalated cell]]\nThe apical membrane of a polarized cell is the surface of the plasma membrane that faces inward to the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. This is particularly evident in [[epithelial cell|epithelial]] and [[endothelial cell]]s, but also describes other polarized cells, such as [[neuron]]s. The [[Epithelial polarity#Basolateral membranes|basolateral membrane]] of a polarized cell is the surface of the plasma membrane that forms its basal and lateral surfaces. It faces outwards, towards the [[interstitium]], and away from the lumen. Basolateral membrane is a compound phrase referring to the terms \"basal (base) membrane\" and \"lateral (side) membrane\", which, especially in epithelial cells, are identical in composition and activity. Proteins (such as ion channels and [[Ion pump (biology)|pumps]]) are free to move from the basal to the lateral surface of the cell or vice versa in accordance with the [[fluid mosaic model]]. [[Tight junction]]s join epithelial cells near their apical surface to prevent the migration of proteins from the basolateral membrane to the apical membrane. The basal and lateral surfaces thus remain roughly equivalent{{clarify|date=October 2012}} to one another, yet distinct from the apical surface.\n\n===Membrane structures===\n[[File:Cell membrane drawing-en.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of the Cell Membrane's structures and their function.]]\nCell membrane can form different types of \"supramembrane\" structures such as [[caveola]], [[postsynaptic density]], [[podosome]], [[invadopodium]], [[focal adhesion]], and different types of [[cell junctions]]. These structures are usually responsible for [[cell adhesion]], communication, [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]]. They can be visualized by [[electron microscopy]] or [[fluorescence microscopy]]. They are composed of specific proteins, such as [[integrins]] and [[cadherins]].\n\n===Cytoskeleton===\nThe [[cytoskeleton]] is found underlying the cell membrane in the cytoplasm and provides a scaffolding for membrane proteins to anchor to, as well as forming [[organelle]]s that extend from the cell. Indeed, cytoskeletal elements interact extensively and intimately with the cell membrane.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doherty GJ, McMahon HT | title = Mediation, modulation, and consequences of membrane-cytoskeleton interactions | journal = Annual Review of Biophysics | volume = 37 | pages = 65\u201395 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18573073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125912 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9354ffa9f16172aec8551dc208b43d94b087e2af }}</ref> Anchoring proteins restricts them to a particular cell surface &mdash; for example, the apical surface of epithelial cells that line the [[vertebrate]] [[gastrointestinal tract|gut]] &mdash; and limits how far they may diffuse within the bilayer. The cytoskeleton is able to form appendage-like organelles, such as [[cilia]], which are [[microtubule]]-based extensions covered by the cell membrane, and [[filopodia]], which are [[actin]]-based extensions. These extensions are ensheathed in membrane and project from the surface of the cell in order to sense the external environment and/or make contact with the substrate or other cells. The apical surfaces of epithelial cells are dense with actin-based finger-like projections known as [[microvilli]], which increase cell surface area and thereby increase the absorption rate of nutrients. Localized decoupling of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane results in formation of a [[bleb (cell biology)|bleb]].\n\n===Intracellular membranes===\nThe content of the cell, inside the cell membrane, is composed of numerous membrane-bound organelles, which contribute to the overall function of the cell. The origin, structure, and function of each organelle leads to a large variation in the cell composition due to the individual uniqueness associated with each organelle. \n* Mitochondria and chloroplasts are considered to have evolved from bacteria, known as the [[Symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic theory]]. This theory arose from the idea that ''Paracoccus'' and ''Rhodopseaudomonas'', types of bacteria, share similar functions to mitochondria and blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, share similar functions to chloroplasts. The [[Symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic theory]] proposes that through the course of evolution, a eukaryotic cell engulfed these 2 types of bacteria, leading to the formation of mitochondria and chloroplasts inside eukaryotic cells. This engulfment lead to the 2 membranes systems of these organelles in which the outer membrane originated from the host's plasma membrane and the inner membrane was the endosymbiont's plasma membrane. Considering that mitochondria and chloroplasts both contain their own DNA is further support that both of these organelles evolved from engulfed bacteria that thrived inside a eukaryotic cell.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Whatley JM, John P, Whatley FR | title = From extracellular to intracellular: the establishment of mitochondria and chloroplasts | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The protein composition of the nucleus can vary greatly from the cytosol as many proteins are unable to cross through pores via diffusion. Within the nuclear membrane, the inner and outer membranes vary in protein composition, and only the outer membrane is continuous with the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) membrane.

The inability of charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane results in [[pH partition]] of substances throughout the [[fluid compartment]]s of the body.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Annular lipid shell]]\n* [[Artificial cell]]\n* [[Bacterial cell structure]]\n* [[Bangstad syndrome]]\n* [[Cell cortex]]\n* [[Cell damage]], including damage to cell membrane\n* [[Cell theory]]\n* [[Cytoneme]]\n* [[Elasticity of cell membranes]]\n* [[Gram-positive bacteria]]\n* [[Membrane models]]\n* [[Membrane nanotubule]]\n* [[History of cell membrane theory]]\n* [[Lipid raft]]\n* [[Trogocytosis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Cell membrane}}\n{{wikiversity|The Cell Membrane}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050621082405/http://www.biochemweb.org/lipids_membranes.shtml Lipids, Membranes and Vesicle Trafficking - The Virtual Library of Biochemistry and Cell Biology]\n* [http://www.westernblotting.org/protocol%20membrane%20extraction.htm Cell membrane protein extraction protocol]\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/tension.html Membrane homeostasis, tension regulation, mechanosensitive membrane exchange and membrane traffic]\n* [http://opm.phar.umich.edu/localization.php?localization=Eukaryotic%20plasma%20membrane 3D structures of proteins associated with plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells]\n*[http://opm.phar.umich.edu/atlas.php?membrane=Eukaryotic%20plasma%20membrane Lipid composition and proteins of some eukariotic membranes]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110924181859/http://www.etap.org/demo/biology1/instruction3tutor.html]\n\n{{Organelles}}\n{{Structures of the cell membrane}}\n{{Membrane transport}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cell Membrane}}\n[[Category:Membrane biology]]\n[[Category:Organelles]]\n[[Category:Cell anatomy]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Biological membrane that separates the interior of a cell from its outside environment}}\n[[Image:Cell membrane detailed diagram 4.svg|thumb|400px|Illustration of a [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cell membrane]]\n[[Image:Celltypes.svg|thumb|right|400px|Comparison of [[Eukaryotes]] vs. [[Prokaryotes]]]]\nThe '''cell membrane''' (also known as the '''plasma membrane''' ('''PM''') or '''cytoplasmic membrane,''' and historically referred to as the '''plasmalemma''') is a [[biological membrane]] that separates the [[cytoplasm|interior]] of all [[Cell (biology)|cells]] from the [[extracellular space|outside environment]] (the extracellular space) which protects the cell from its environment.<ref>[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/CellMembranes.html Kimball's Biology pages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125224255/http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/CellMembranes.html |date=2009-01-25 }}, Cell Membranes</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Singleton P |title=Bacteria in Biology, Biotechnology and Medicine |edition=5th |isbn=978-0-471-98880-9 |year=1999 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York}}</ref> Cell membrane consists of a [[lipid bilayer]], including [[cholesterol]]s (a lipid component) that sit between [[phospholipid]]s to maintain their [[Membrane fluidity|fluidity]] under various temperature, in combination with [[membrane protein]]s such as [[integral protein]]s, and [[peripheral protein]]s that go across inside and outside of the membrane serving as [[membrane transporter]], and loosely attached to the outer (peripheral) side of the cell membrane acting as several kinds of [[enzyme]]s shaping the cell, respectively.<ref name=\"Tom Herrmann 2019\">{{cite journal| authors=Tom Herrmann1; Sandeep Sharma2. | journal=StatPearls | date=March 2, 2019 | location=1 SIU School of Medicine 2 Baptist Regional Medical Center | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538211/ | pmid=30855799 | title=Physiology, Membrane }}</ref> The cell membrane [[membrane transport|controls the movement of substances]] in and out of cells and organelles.

In the early 19th century, cells were recognized as being separate entities, unconnected, and bound by individual cell walls after it was found that plant cells could be separated. This theory extended to include animal cells to suggest a universal mechanism for cell protection and development. By the second half of the 19th century, microscopy was still not advanced enough to make a distinction between cell membranes and cell walls. However, some microscopists correctly identified at this time that while invisible, it could be inferred that cell membranes existed in animal cells due to intracellular movement of components internally but not externally and that membranes were not the equivalent of a cell wall to plant cell. It was also inferred that cell membranes were not vital components to all cells. Many refuted the existence of a cell membrane still towards the end of the 19th century. In 1890, an update to the Cell Theory stated that cell membranes existed, but were merely secondary structures. It was not until later studies with osmosis and permeability that cell membranes gained more recognition.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lombard J | title = Once upon a time the cell membranes: 175\u00a0years of cell boundary research | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 9 | pages = 32 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25522740 | pmc = 4304622 | doi = 10.1186/s13062-014-0032-7 }}</ref> In 1895, [[Ernest Overton]] proposed that cell membranes were made of lipids.<ref>Leray, C.

In an attempt to accept or reject the hypothesis, researchers measured membrane thickness.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1925 it was determined by Fricke that the thickness of erythrocyte and yeast cell membranes ranged between 3.3 and 4&nbsp;nm, a thickness compatible with a lipid monolayer. The choice of the dielectric constant used in these studies was called into question but future tests could not disprove the results of the initial experiment. Independently, the leptoscope was invented in order to measure very thin membranes by comparing  the intensity of light reflected from a sample to the intensity of a membrane standard of known thickness. The instrument could resolve thicknesses that depended on pH measurements and the presence of membrane proteins that ranged from 8.6 to 23.2&nbsp;nm, with the lower measurements supporting the lipid bilayer hypothesis. Later in the 1930s, the membrane structure model developed in general agreement to be the [[paucimolecular model]] of [[Hugh Davson|Davson]] and [[James Danielli|Danielli]] (1935). This model was based on studies of surface tension between oils and [[echinoderm]] eggs. Since the surface tension values appeared to be much lower than would be expected for an oil\u2013water interface, it was assumed that some substance was responsible for lowering the interfacial tensions in the surface of cells. It was suggested that a lipid bilayer was in between two thin protein layers. The paucimolecular model immediately became popular and it dominated cell membrane studies for the following 30 years, until it became rivaled by the fluid mosaic model of [[Seymour Jonathan Singer|Singer]] and [[Garth L. Nicolson|Nicolson]] (1972).<ref name=\"Singer1972\">S J Singer and G L Nicolson.\"The fluid mosaic model of the structure of cell membranes.\" Science. (1972) 175. 720-731.</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDespite the numerous models of the cell membrane proposed prior to the [[fluid mosaic model]], it remains the primary archetype for the cell membrane long after its inception in the 1970s.<ref name=\":2\" /> Although the [[fluid mosaic model]] has been modernized to detail contemporary discoveries, the basics have remained constant: the membrane is a lipid bilayer composed of hydrophilic exterior heads and a hydrophobic interior where proteins can interact with hydrophilic heads through polar interactions, but proteins that span the bilayer fully or partially have hydrophobic amino acids that interact with the non-polar lipid interior. The [[fluid mosaic model]] not only provided an accurate representation of membrane mechanics, it enhanced the study of hydrophobic forces, which would later develop into an essential descriptive limitation to describe biological [[macromolecule]]s.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor many centuries, the scientists cited disagreed with the significance of the structure they were seeing as the cell membrane. For almost two centuries, the membranes were seen but mostly disregarded this as an important structure with cellular function. It was not until the 20th century that the significance of the cell membrane as it was acknowledged. Finally, two scientists Gorter and Grendel (1925) made the discovery that the membrane is \u201clipid-based\u201d. From this, they furthered the idea that this structure would have to be in a formation that mimicked layers. Once studied further, it was found by comparing the sum of the cell surfaces and the surfaces of the lipids, a 2:1 ratio was estimated; thus, providing the first basis of the bilayer structure known today. This discovery initiated many new studies that arose globally within various fields of scientific studies, confirming that the structure and functions of the cell membrane are widely accepted.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe structure has been variously referred to by different writers as the ectoplast ([[Hugo de Vries|de Vries]], 1885),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Vries H | year = 1885 | title = Plasmolytische Studien \u00fcber die Wand der Vakuolen | url = | journal = Jahrb.

In [[red blood cell|RBC]] studies, 30% of the plasma membrane is lipid. However, for the majority of eukaryotic cells, the composition of plasma membranes is about half lipids and half proteins by weight.\n\nThe fatty chains in [[phospholipid]]s and [[glycolipid]]s usually contain an even number of carbon atoms, typically between 16 and 20. The 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids are the most common. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated, with the configuration of the double bonds nearly always \"cis\". The length and the degree of unsaturation of fatty acid chains have a profound effect on membrane fluidity as unsaturated lipids create a kink, preventing the fatty acids from packing together as tightly, thus decreasing the [[melting point|melting temperature]] (increasing the fluidity) of the membrane.<ref name=\"Lodish\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> The ability of some organisms to regulate [[Membrane fluidity|the fluidity of their cell membranes]] by altering lipid composition is called [[homeoviscous adaptation]].\n\nThe entire membrane is held together via [[non-covalent]] interaction of hydrophobic tails, however the structure is quite fluid and not fixed rigidly in place. Under [[physiological condition]]s phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane are in the [[Liquid crystal|liquid crystalline state]]. It means the lipid molecules are free to diffuse and exhibit rapid lateral diffusion along the layer in which they are present.<ref name=\"Lodish\" /> However, the exchange of phospholipid molecules between intracellular and extracellular leaflets of the bilayer is a very slow process. [[Lipid rafts]] and caveolae are examples of [[cholesterol]]-enriched microdomains in the cell membrane.<ref name=\":4\" /> Also, a fraction of the lipid in direct contact with integral membrane proteins,  which is tightly bound to the protein surface is called [[annular lipid shell]]; it behaves as a part of protein complex.\n\nIn animal cells cholesterol is normally found dispersed in varying degrees throughout cell membranes, in the irregular spaces between the hydrophobic tails of the membrane lipids, where it confers a stiffening and strengthening effect on the membrane.<ref name=\"MBOC\" /> Additionally, the amount of cholesterol in biological membranes varies between organisms, cell types, and even in individual cells. Cholesterol, a major component of animal plasma membranes, regulates the fluidity of the overall membrane, meaning that cholesterol controls the amount of movement of the various cell membrane components based on its  concentrations.<ref name=\"MBOC\" /> In high temperatures, cholesterol inhibits the movement of phospholipid fatty acid chains, causing a reduced permeability to small molecules and reduced membrane fluidity. The opposite is true for the role of cholesterol in cooler temperatures. Cholesterol production, and thus concentration, is up-regulated (increased) in response to cold temperature. At cold temperatures, cholesterol interferes with fatty acid chain interactions. Acting as antifreeze, cholesterol maintains the fluidity of the membrane. Cholesterol is more abundant in cold-weather animals than warm-weather animals. In plants, which lack cholesterol, related compounds called sterols perform the same function as cholesterol.<ref name=\"MBOC\" />\n\n=== Phospholipids forming lipid vesicles ===\nLipid vesicles or [[liposome]]s are approximately spherical pockets that are enclosed by a lipid bilayer.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal |last=Lodish |first=Harvey |last2=Berk |first2=Arnold |last3=Zipursky |first3=S.

Lipid vesicles and liposomes are formed by first suspending a lipid in an aqueous solution then agitating the mixture through [[sonication]], resulting in a vesicle. By measuring the rate of [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] from that of the inside of the vesicle to the ambient solution, allows researcher to better understand membrane permeability. Vesicles can be formed with molecules and ions inside the vesicle by forming the vesicle with the desired molecule or ion present in the solution. Proteins can also be embedded into the membrane through solubilizing the desired proteins in the presence of detergents and attaching them to the phospholipids in which the liposome is formed.

The cell membrane also plays a role in anchoring the [[cytoskeleton]] to provide shape to the cell, and in attaching to the [[extracellular matrix]] and other cells to hold them together to form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. [[Fungi]], [[bacteria]], most [[archaea]], and [[plant]]s also have a [[cell wall]], which provides a mechanical support to the cell and precludes the passage of [[macromolecule|larger molecules]].\n\nThe cell membrane is [[Semipermeable membrane|selectively permeable]] and able to regulate what enters and exits the cell, thus facilitating the [[membrane transport|transport]] of materials needed for survival. The movement of substances across the membrane can be either \"[[passive transport|passive]]\", occurring without the input of cellular energy, or \"[[active transport|active]]\", requiring the cell to expend energy in transporting it. The membrane also maintains the [[Membrane potential|cell potential]]. The cell membrane thus works as a selective filter that allows only certain things to come inside or go outside the cell. The cell employs a number of transport mechanisms that involve biological membranes:\n\n1. Passive [[osmosis]] and [[diffusion]]: Some substances (small molecules, ions) such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), can move across the plasma membrane by diffusion, which is a passive transport process. Because the membrane acts as a barrier for certain molecules and ions, they can occur in different concentrations on the two sides of the membrane. Diffusion occurs when small molecules and ions move freely from high concentration to low concentration in order to equilibrate the membrane. It is considered a passive transport process because it does not require energy and is propelled by the concentration gradient created by each side of the membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey M. |date=2000|title=Transport of Small Molecules|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9847/|journal=The Cell: A Molecular Approach |edition=2nd|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605030211/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9847/|archive-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> Such a concentration gradient across a semipermeable membrane sets up an [[osmotic pressure|osmotic flow]] for the water. Osmosis, in biological systems involves a solvent, moving through a semipermeable membrane similarly to passive diffusion as the solvent still moves with the concentration gradient and requires no energy. While water is the most common solvent in cell, it can also be other liquids as well as supercritical liquids and gases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kramer EM, Myers DR | title = Osmosis is not driven by water dilution | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 195\u20137 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23298880 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2012.12.001 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n2. [[Ion channels|Transmembrane protein channels]] and [[membrane transport protein|transporters]]: Transmembrane proteins extend through the lipid bilayer of the membranes; they function on both sides of the membrane to transport molecules across it.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Alberts |first=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Raff |first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter |first6=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=2002|title=Membrane Proteins |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26878/ |journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th  |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605030211/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26878/|archive-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> Nutrients, such as sugars or amino acids, must enter the cell, and certain products of metabolism must leave the cell. Such molecules can diffuse passively through protein channels such as [[aquaporins]] in [[facilitated diffusion]] or are pumped across the membrane by [[Membrane transport protein|transmembrane transporters]]. Protein channel proteins, also called ''permeases'', are usually quite specific, and they only recognize and transport a limited variety of  chemical substances, often limited to a single substance. Another example of a transmembrane protein is a cell-surface receptor, which allow cell signaling molecules to communicate between cells.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n3. [[Endocytosis]]: Endocytosis is the process in which cells absorb molecules by engulfing them. The plasma membrane creates a small deformation inward, called an invagination, in which the substance to be transported is captured.This invagination is caused by proteins on the outside on the cell membrane, acting as receptors and clustering into depressions that eventually promote accumulation of more proteins and lipids on the cytosolic side of the membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alberts |first=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Raff |first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter |first6=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=2002|title=Transport into the Cell from the Plasma Membrane: Endocytosis |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26870/ |journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605030211/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26870/|archive-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> The deformation then pinches off from the membrane on the inside of the cell, creating a vesicle containing the captured substance. Endocytosis is a pathway for internalizing solid particles (\"cell eating\" or [[phagocytosis]]), small molecules and ions (\"cell drinking\" or [[pinocytosis]]), and macromolecules. Endocytosis requires energy and is thus a form of active transport.\n\n4. [[Exocytosis]]: Just as material can be brought into the cell by invagination and formation of a vesicle, the membrane of a vesicle can be fused with the plasma membrane, extruding its contents to the surrounding medium. This is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis occurs in various cells to remove undigested residues of substances brought in by endocytosis, to secrete substances such as hormones and enzymes, and to transport a substance completely across a cellular barrier. In the process of exocytosis, the undigested waste-containing food vacuole or the secretory vesicle budded from [[Golgi apparatus]], is first moved by cytoskeleton from the interior of the cell to the surface. The vesicle membrane comes in contact with the plasma membrane. The lipid molecules of the two bilayers rearrange themselves and the two membranes are, thus, fused. A passage is formed in the fused membrane and the vesicles discharges its contents outside the cell.\n\n== Prokaryotes ==\n[[Prokaryote]]s are divided into two different groups, [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], with bacteria dividing further into [[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]]. [[Gram-negative bacteria]] have both a plasma membrane and an [[bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] separated by [[periplasm]], however, other [[prokaryotes]] have only a plasma membrane. These two membranes differ in many aspects. The outer membrane of the gram-negative bacteria differ from other prokaryotes due to [[phospholipid]]s forming the exterior of the bilayer, and [[lipoprotein]]s and phospholipids forming the interior.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8477/|title=Medical Microbiology|last=Salton|first=Milton R.

The inner, plasma membrane is also generally symmetric whereas the outer membrane is asymmetric because of proteins such as the aforementioned.  Also, for the prokaryotic membranes, there are multiple things that can affect the fluidity.  One of the major factors that can affect the fluidity is fatty acid composition.  For example, when the bacteria ''Staphylococcus aureus'' was grown in 37<sup>\u25e6</sup>C for 24h, the membrane exhibited a more fluid state instead of a gel-like state. This supports the concept that in higher temperatures, the membrane is more fluid than in colder temperatures. When the membrane is becoming more fluid and needs to become more stabilized, it will make longer fatty acid chains or saturated fatty acid chains in order to help stabilize the membrane.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mishra NN, Liu GY, Yeaman MR, Nast CC, Proctor RA, McKinnell J, Bayer AS | title = Carotenoid-related alteration of cell membrane fluidity impacts Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility to host defense peptides | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 526\u201331 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21115796 | pmc = 3028772 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00680-10 }}</ref>  [[Bacteria]] are also surrounded by a [[cell wall]] composed of [[peptidoglycan]] (amino acids and sugars).

J. Singer]] and [[Garth L. Nicolson|G. L.

Examples of such structures are protein-protein complexes, pickets and fences formed by the actin-based [[cytoskeleton]], and potentially [[lipid raft]]s.\n\n===Lipid bilayer===\n[[Image:Fluid Mosaic.svg|thumb|200px|right|Diagram of the arrangement of amphipathic lipid molecules to form a [[lipid bilayer]]. The yellow [[Chemical polarity|polar]] head groups separate the grey hydrophobic tails from the aqueous cytosolic and extracellular environments.]]\n[[Lipid bilayer]]s form through the process of [[self-assembly]]. The cell membrane consists primarily of a thin layer of [[amphipathic]] [[phospholipids]] that spontaneously arrange so that the hydrophobic \"tail\" regions are isolated from the surrounding water while the hydrophilic \"head\" regions interact with the intracellular (cytosolic) and extracellular faces of the resulting bilayer. This forms a continuous, spherical [[lipid bilayer]]. Hydrophobic interactions (also known as the [[hydrophobic effect]]) are the major driving forces in the formation of lipid bilayers.  An increase in interactions between  hydrophobic molecules (causing clustering of hydrophobic regions) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other, increasing the entropy of the system.  This complex interaction can include noncovalent interactions such as [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]], electrostatic and hydrogen bonds.\n\nLipid bilayers are generally impermeable to ions and polar molecules. The arrangement of hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails of the lipid bilayer prevent polar solutes (ex. amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, and ions) from diffusing across the membrane, but generally allows for the passive diffusion of hydrophobic molecules. This affords the cell the ability to control the movement of these substances via [[transmembrane protein]] complexes such as pores, channels and gates.\n[[Flippase]]s and [[scramblase]]s concentrate [[phosphatidyl serine]], which carries a negative charge, on the inner membrane. Along with [[sialic acid|NANA]], this creates an extra barrier to charged [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] moving through the membrane.\n\nMembranes serve diverse functions in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells. One important role is to regulate the movement of materials into and out of cells. The phospholipid bilayer structure (fluid mosaic model) with specific membrane proteins accounts for the selective permeability of the membrane and passive and active transport mechanisms. In addition, membranes in prokaryotes and in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes facilitate the synthesis of ATP through chemiosmosis.\n\n===Membrane polarity===\n{{See also|Epithelial polarity}}\n<!-- Apical_Membrane redirects here --><!-- Basolateral_Membrane redirects here --><!-- Basolateral redirects here -->\n[[Image:Alpha Intercalated Cell Cartoon.svg|thumb|300px|Alpha intercalated cell]]\nThe apical membrane of a polarized cell is the surface of the plasma membrane that faces inward to the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. This is particularly evident in [[epithelial cell|epithelial]] and [[endothelial cell]]s, but also describes other polarized cells, such as [[neuron]]s. The [[Epithelial polarity#Basolateral membranes|basolateral membrane]] of a polarized cell is the surface of the plasma membrane that forms its basal and lateral surfaces. It faces outwards, towards the [[interstitium]], and away from the lumen. Basolateral membrane is a compound phrase referring to the terms \"basal (base) membrane\" and \"lateral (side) membrane\", which, especially in epithelial cells, are identical in composition and activity. Proteins (such as ion channels and [[Ion pump (biology)|pumps]]) are free to move from the basal to the lateral surface of the cell or vice versa in accordance with the [[fluid mosaic model]]. [[Tight junction]]s join epithelial cells near their apical surface to prevent the migration of proteins from the basolateral membrane to the apical membrane. The basal and lateral surfaces thus remain roughly equivalent{{clarify|date=October 2012}} to one another, yet distinct from the apical surface.\n\n===Membrane structures===\n[[File:Cell membrane drawing-en.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of the Cell Membrane's structures and their function.]]\nCell membrane can form different types of \"supramembrane\" structures such as [[caveola]], [[postsynaptic density]], [[podosome]], [[invadopodium]], [[focal adhesion]], and different types of [[cell junctions]]. These structures are usually responsible for [[cell adhesion]], communication, [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]]. They can be visualized by [[electron microscopy]] or [[fluorescence microscopy]]. They are composed of specific proteins, such as [[integrins]] and [[cadherins]].\n\n===Cytoskeleton===\nThe [[cytoskeleton]] is found underlying the cell membrane in the cytoplasm and provides a scaffolding for membrane proteins to anchor to, as well as forming [[organelle]]s that extend from the cell. Indeed, cytoskeletal elements interact extensively and intimately with the cell membrane.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doherty GJ, McMahon HT | title = Mediation, modulation, and consequences of membrane-cytoskeleton interactions | journal = Annual Review of Biophysics | volume = 37 | pages = 65\u201395 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18573073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125912 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9354ffa9f16172aec8551dc208b43d94b087e2af }}</ref> Anchoring proteins restricts them to a particular cell surface &mdash; for example, the apical surface of epithelial cells that line the [[vertebrate]] [[gastrointestinal tract|gut]] &mdash; and limits how far they may diffuse within the bilayer. The cytoskeleton is able to form appendage-like organelles, such as [[cilia]], which are [[microtubule]]-based extensions covered by the cell membrane, and [[filopodia]], which are [[actin]]-based extensions. These extensions are ensheathed in membrane and project from the surface of the cell in order to sense the external environment and/or make contact with the substrate or other cells. The apical surfaces of epithelial cells are dense with actin-based finger-like projections known as [[microvilli]], which increase cell surface area and thereby increase the absorption rate of nutrients. Localized decoupling of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane results in formation of a [[bleb (cell biology)|bleb]].\n\n===Intracellular membranes===\nThe content of the cell, inside the cell membrane, is composed of numerous membrane-bound organelles, which contribute to the overall function of the cell. The origin, structure, and function of each organelle leads to a large variation in the cell composition due to the individual uniqueness associated with each organelle. \n* Mitochondria and chloroplasts are considered to have evolved from bacteria, known as the [[Symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic theory]]. This theory arose from the idea that ''Paracoccus'' and ''Rhodopseaudomonas'', types of bacteria, share similar functions to mitochondria and blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, share similar functions to chloroplasts. The [[Symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic theory]] proposes that through the course of evolution, a eukaryotic cell engulfed these 2 types of bacteria, leading to the formation of mitochondria and chloroplasts inside eukaryotic cells. This engulfment lead to the 2 membranes systems of these organelles in which the outer membrane originated from the host's plasma membrane and the inner membrane was the endosymbiont's plasma membrane. Considering that mitochondria and chloroplasts both contain their own DNA is further support that both of these organelles evolved from engulfed bacteria that thrived inside a eukaryotic cell.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Whatley JM, John P, Whatley FR | title = From extracellular to intracellular: the establishment of mitochondria and chloroplasts | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The protein composition of the nucleus can vary greatly from the cytosol as many proteins are unable to cross through pores via diffusion. Within the nuclear membrane, the inner and outer membranes vary in protein composition, and only the outer membrane is continuous with the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) membrane.  Like the ER, the outer membrane also possesses ribosomes responsible for producing and transporting proteins into the space between the two membranes.

The inability of charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane results in [[pH partition]] of substances throughout the [[fluid compartment]]s of the body.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Annular lipid shell]]\n* [[Artificial cell]]\n* [[Bacterial cell structure]]\n* [[Bangstad syndrome]]\n* [[Cell cortex]]\n* [[Cell damage]], including damage to cell membrane\n* [[Cell theory]]\n* [[Cytoneme]]\n* [[Elasticity of cell membranes]]\n* [[Gram-positive bacteria]]\n* [[Membrane models]]\n* [[Membrane nanotubule]]\n* [[History of cell membrane theory]]\n* [[Lipid raft]]\n* [[Trogocytosis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Cell membrane}}\n{{wikiversity|The Cell Membrane}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050621082405/http://www.biochemweb.org/lipids_membranes.shtml Lipids, Membranes and Vesicle Trafficking - The Virtual Library of Biochemistry and Cell Biology]\n* [http://www.westernblotting.org/protocol%20membrane%20extraction.htm Cell membrane protein extraction protocol]\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/tension.html Membrane homeostasis, tension regulation, mechanosensitive membrane exchange and membrane traffic]\n* [http://opm.phar.umich.edu/localization.php?localization=Eukaryotic%20plasma%20membrane 3D structures of proteins associated with plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells]\n*[http://opm.phar.umich.edu/atlas.php?membrane=Eukaryotic%20plasma%20membrane Lipid composition and proteins of some eukariotic membranes]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110924181859/http://www.etap.org/demo/biology1/instruction3tutor.html]\n\n{{Organelles}}\n{{Structures of the cell membrane}}\n{{Membrane transport}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cell Membrane}}\n[[Category:Membrane biology]]\n[[Category:Organelles]]\n[[Category:Cell anatomy]]\n", "name_user": "Andrewbt", "label": "safe", "comment": "Editing 2nd sentence (now 2nd & 3rd) for readability.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"}
