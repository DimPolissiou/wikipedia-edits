At Rome, according to the ''Golden Legend'' he preserved the \"cardinal of Angleria in Lombardy\"<ref>Perhaps Angera was intended.</ref> by making the mark of the cross on his forehead, which miraculously remained. Ministering at [[Piacenza]] he himself finally fell ill. He was expelled from the town; and withdrew into the forest, where he made himself a hut of boughs and leaves, which was miraculously supplied with water by a spring that arose in the place; he would have perished had not a dog belonging to a nobleman named Gothard Palastrelli supplied him with bread and licked his wounds, healing them. Count Gothard, following his hunting dog that carried the bread, discovered Saint Roch and became his acolyte.\n\nOn his return incognito to Montpellier he was arrested as a spy (by orders of his own uncle) and thrown into prison, where he languished five years and died on 16 August 1327, without revealing his name, to avoid worldly glory. (Evidence suggests, as mentioned earlier, that the previous events occurred, instead at Voghera in the 1370s.)\nAfter his death, according to the ''Golden Legend'';{{quote|anon an angel brought from heaven a table divinely written with letters of gold into the prison, which he laid under the head of S.

The 16th-century [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] and the adjacent [[San Rocco, Venice|church of San Rocco]] were dedicated to him by a confraternity at [[Venice]], where his body was said to have been surreptitiously translated and was triumphantly inaugurated in 1485;{{sfnp|Marshall|1994|p=505}} the ''[[Scuola Grande di San Rocco|Scuola Grande]]'' is famous for its sequence of paintings by [[Tintoretto]], who painted St. Roch in glory in a ceiling canvas (1564).\n[[Image:St Rochus.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of St. Roch, B\u00edl\u00e1 Hora, Prague (1751)]]\nWe know for certain that the body of St. Roch was carried from Voghera, instead of Montpellier as previously thought, to Venice in 1485. [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492\u20131503) built a church and a hospital in his honor. [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) instituted a [[confraternity]] of St. Roch.

New York: Robert Appleton Co. 1913.</ref> Saint Roch had not been officially recognized as yet, however. In 1590 the Venetian ambassador at Rome reported back to the Serenissima that he had been repeatedly urged to present the witnesses and documentation of the life and miracles of San Rocco, already deeply entrenched in the Venetian life, because [[Pope Sixtus V]] \"is strong in his opinion either to canonize him or else to remove him from the ranks of the saints;\" the ambassador had warned a cardinal of the general scandal that would result if the widely venerated San Rocco were impugned as an impostor.

He is usually represented in the garb of a pilgrim, often lifting his tunic to demonstrate the plague sore, or [[bubo]], in his thigh, and accompanied by a dog carrying a loaf in its mouth. The [[Third Order of Saint Francis]], by tradition, claims him as a member and includes his feast on its own [[calendar of saints]], observing it on August 17.\n\n==Saint Roch in art==\n[[File:Ribalta-san roque.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Roch, by [[Francesc Ribalta|Francesco Ribalta]], ca. 1625, Museo de Bellas Artes, Valencia.]]\nFollowing the Black Death, especially the Italian plague epidemic of 1477\u201379, new images of Christian martyrs and saints appeared and Saint Roch gained new fame and popularity. The religious art of the time emphasized the importance of the saint to plague-ridden Christians.\n\nThe new plague-related images of Saint Roch were drawn from a variety of sources. Plague texts dating from ancient and classical times, as well as Christian, scientific and folk beliefs, all contributed to this emerging visual tradition.  Some of the most popular symbols of plague were swords, darts, and most especially arrows.  There was also a prevalence of [[memento mori]] themes, dark clouds, and astrological signs (signa magna) such as comets, which were often referenced by physicians and writers of plague tracts as causes of plague. The physical symptoms of plague \u2013 a raised arm, a tilted head, or a collapsed body \u2013 began to symbolize plague in post-Black Death painting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boeckl|first=Christine M.|title=Images of Plague and Pestilence: Iconography and Iconology|year=2000|publisher=Truman State University Press|location=Kirksville, MO}}</ref>\n\nPlague saints offered hope and healing before, during, and after times of plague.  A specific style of painting, the plague votive, was considered a talisman for warding off plague. It portrayed a particular saint as an intercessor between God and the person or persons who commissioned the painting \u2013 usually a town, government, lay confraternity, or religious order to atone for the \"collective guilt\" of the community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worcester|first=Thomas W.|title=Hope and Healing: Painting in Italy in a Time of Plague, 1500\u20131800|year=2005|publisher=Worcester Art Museum|location=Worcester, MA|page=153}}</ref>\n\nThese plague votives worked as a psychological defense against disease in which people attempted to manipulate their situation through requesting the intercession of a saint against the arrows of plague.  Rather than a society depressed and resigned to repeated epidemics, these votives represent people taking positive steps to regain control over their environment. Paintings of St. Roch represent the confidence in which renaissance worshipers sought to access supernatural aid in overcoming the ravages of plague.\n\nThe very abundance of means by which people invoked the aid of the celestial court is essential in understanding Renaissance responses to the disease.  Rather than depression or resignation, people \"possessed a confidence that put even an apocalyptic disaster of the magnitude of the Black Death into perspective of God's secure and benevolent plan for humankind.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Aberth|first=John|title=The Black Death: The Great Mortality of 1348\u20131350: A Brief History with Documents|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}}</ref>\n\nThe plague votives functioned both to request intercessory aid from plague saints and to provide catharsis for a population that had just witnessed the profound bodily destruction of the plague. By showing plague saints such as St. Roch and St. Sebastian, votives influenced the distribution of God's mercy by invoking the memory of the human suffering experienced by Christ during the Passion. In the art of St. Roch after 1477 the saint displayed the wounds of his martyrdom without evidence of pain or suffering. Roch actively lifted his clothing to display the plague bubo in his thigh. This display of his plague bubo showed that \"he welcomed his disease as a divinely sent opportunity to imitate the sufferings of Christ\u2026 [his] patient endurance [of the physical suffering of plague was] a form of martyrdom.\"<ref name=\"Marshall 1994 505\">{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Louise|title=Manipulating the Sacred: Image and Plague in Renaissance Italy|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|year=1994|volume=47|issue=3|pages=485\u2013532|doi=10.2307/2863019|jstor=2863019|ref=harv|postscript=,}} p.&nbsp;505</ref>\n\nRoch's status as a pilgrim who suffered plague is paramount in his iconography. \"The sight of Roch scarred by the plague yet alive and healthy must have been an emotionally-charged image of a promised cure.

At Rome, according to the ''Golden Legend'' he preserved the \"cardinal of Angleria in Lombardy\"<ref>Perhaps Angera was intended.</ref> by making the mark of the cross on his forehead, which miraculously remained. Ministering at [[Piacenza]] he himself finally fell ill. He was expelled from the town; and withdrew into the forest, where he made himself a hut of boughs and leaves, which was miraculously supplied with water by a spring that arose in the place; he would have perished had not a dog belonging to a nobleman named Gothard Palastrelli supplied him with bread and licked his wounds, healing them. Count Gothard, following his hunting dog that carried the bread, discovered Saint Roch and became his acolyte.\n\nOn his return incognito to Montpellier he was arrested as a spy (by orders of his own uncle) and thrown into prison, where he languished five years and died on 16 August 1327, without revealing his name, to avoid worldly glory. (Evidence suggests, as mentioned earlier, that the previous events occurred, instead at Voghera in the 1370s.)\nAfter his death, according to the ''Golden Legend'';{{quote|anon an angel brought from heaven a table divinely written with letters of gold into the prison, which he laid under the head of S.

The 16th-century [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] and the adjacent [[San Rocco, Venice|church of San Rocco]] were dedicated to him by a confraternity at [[Venice]], where his body was said to have been surreptitiously translated and was triumphantly inaugurated in 1485;{{sfnp|Marshall|1994|p=505}} the ''[[Scuola Grande di San Rocco|Scuola Grande]]'' is famous for its sequence of paintings by [[Tintoretto]], who painted St. Roch in glory in a ceiling canvas (1564).\n[[Image:St Rochus.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of St. Roch, B\u00edl\u00e1 Hora, Prague (1751)]]\nWe know for certain that the body of St. Roch was carried from Voghera, instead of Montpellier as previously thought, to Venice in 1485. [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492\u20131503) built a church and a hospital in his honor. [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) instituted a [[confraternity]] of St. Roch. This was raised to an arch-confraternity in 1556 by [[Pope Paul IV]]; it still thrives today.<ref>\"St. Roch\", ''Catholic Encyclopedia.'' New York: Robert Appleton Co. 1913.</ref> Saint Roch had not been officially recognized as yet, however. In 1590 the Venetian ambassador at Rome reported back to the Serenissima that he had been repeatedly urged to present the witnesses and documentation of the life and miracles of San Rocco, already deeply entrenched in the Venetian life, because [[Pope Sixtus V]] \"is strong in his opinion either to canonize him or else to remove him from the ranks of the saints;\" the ambassador had warned a cardinal of the general scandal that would result if the widely venerated San Rocco were impugned as an impostor. Sixtus did not pursue the matter but left it to later popes to proceed with the canonization process.<ref>{{harvp|Marshall|1994|loc=p.&nbsp;503, note 43}}.

He is usually represented in the garb of a pilgrim, often lifting his tunic to demonstrate the plague sore, or [[bubo]], in his thigh, and accompanied by a dog carrying a loaf in its mouth. The [[Third Order of Saint Francis]], by tradition, claims him as a member and includes his feast on its own [[calendar of saints]], observing it on August 17.\n\n==Saint Roch in art==\n[[File:Ribalta-san roque.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Roch, by [[Francesc Ribalta|Francesco Ribalta]], ca. 1625, Museo de Bellas Artes, Valencia.]]\nFollowing the Black Death, especially the Italian plague epidemic of 1477\u201379, new images of Christian martyrs and saints appeared and Saint Roch gained new fame and popularity. The religious art of the time emphasized the importance of the saint to plague-ridden Christians.\n\nThe new plague-related images of Saint Roch were drawn from a variety of sources. Plague texts dating from ancient and classical times, as well as Christian, scientific and folk beliefs, all contributed to this emerging visual tradition.  Some of the most popular symbols of plague were swords, darts, and most especially arrows.  There was also a prevalence of [[memento mori]] themes, dark clouds, and astrological signs (signa magna) such as comets, which were often referenced by physicians and writers of plague tracts as causes of plague. The physical symptoms of plague \u2013 a raised arm, a tilted head, or a collapsed body \u2013 began to symbolize plague in post-Black Death painting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boeckl|first=Christine M.|title=Images of Plague and Pestilence: Iconography and Iconology|year=2000|publisher=Truman State University Press|location=Kirksville, MO}}</ref>\n\nPlague saints offered hope and healing before, during, and after times of plague.  A specific style of painting, the plague votive, was considered a talisman for warding off plague. It portrayed a particular saint as an intercessor between God and the person or persons who commissioned the painting \u2013 usually a town, government, lay confraternity, or religious order to atone for the \"collective guilt\" of the community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worcester|first=Thomas W.|title=Hope and Healing: Painting in Italy in a Time of Plague, 1500\u20131800|year=2005|publisher=Worcester Art Museum|location=Worcester, MA|page=153}}</ref>\n\nThese plague votives worked as a psychological defense against disease in which people attempted to manipulate their situation through requesting the intercession of a saint against the arrows of plague.  Rather than a society depressed and resigned to repeated epidemics, these votives represent people taking positive steps to regain control over their environment. Paintings of St. Roch represent the confidence in which renaissance worshipers sought to access supernatural aid in overcoming the ravages of plague.\n\nThe very abundance of means by which people invoked the aid of the celestial court is essential in understanding Renaissance responses to the disease.  Rather than depression or resignation, people \"possessed a confidence that put even an apocalyptic disaster of the magnitude of the Black Death into perspective of God's secure and benevolent plan for humankind.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Aberth|first=John|title=The Black Death: The Great Mortality of 1348\u20131350: A Brief History with Documents|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}}</ref>\n\nThe plague votives functioned both to request intercessory aid from plague saints and to provide catharsis for a population that had just witnessed the profound bodily destruction of the plague. By showing plague saints such as St. Roch and St. Sebastian, votives influenced the distribution of God's mercy by invoking the memory of the human suffering experienced by Christ during the Passion. In the art of St. Roch after 1477 the saint displayed the wounds of his martyrdom without evidence of pain or suffering. Roch actively lifted his clothing to display the plague bubo in his thigh. This display of his plague bubo showed that \"he welcomed his disease as a divinely sent opportunity to imitate the sufferings of Christ\u2026 [his] patient endurance [of the physical suffering of plague was] a form of martyrdom.\"<ref name=\"Marshall 1994 505\">{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Louise|title=Manipulating the Sacred: Image and Plague in Renaissance Italy|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|year=1994|volume=47|issue=3|pages=485\u2013532|doi=10.2307/2863019|jstor=2863019|ref=harv|postscript=,}} p.&nbsp;505</ref>\n\nRoch's status as a pilgrim who suffered plague is paramount in his iconography. \"The sight of Roch scarred by the plague yet alive and healthy must have been an emotionally-charged image of a promised cure. Here was literal proof that one could survive the plague, a saint who had triumphed over the disease in his own flesh.\"<ref name=\"Marshall 1994 505\"/>\n\n==Saint Roch in Literature==\n\n[[F.&nbsp;T.

{"title_page": "Tissue stress", "text_new": "'''Tissue stress''' (tissue adaptive syndrome) is an unspecific adaptive reaction universal for all tissues of adult organism which forms in tissue as a response to various external influences. The latter are tissue cells\u2019 damage, overload of their specialized functions or regulatory influences.\n\n==Tissue stress mechanism==\nAccording to tissue adaptive syndrome (TAS) concept, this adaptive mechanism (see adaptation) comes into effect in damaged tissue (see [[Tissue (biology)]]) as a result of concurrence of two events. The first one is accumulation of TAS effectors in tissue ([[comuton]]s, [[chalone (protein)|chalone]]s, and [[contactin]]s), which possess a unique feature of tissue specificity in their action on homologous tissue cells without species specificity. The second one is increase in sensitivity of damaged cells to these regulators, as it was demonstrated on the example of comuton. These effectors cause tissuespecific self-damage of homologous cells via disturbance of their ion homeostasis and energy-production processes. As a result, unspecific reaction to damage (CURD) is activated in the cells. This universal physiological reaction plays a role of TAS executive mechanism. Thus, the adaptive function of tissue stress is brought into action using such CURD properties as increase of cell unspecific resistance, as well as influence on the rate of cell metabolic processes. It is obvious that in the case of TAS these changes have to be tissuespecific, since they are initiated by way of cell self-damage under tissuespecific influence of TAS effectors.\n\nAs is well known the CURD consists of two phases. In the process of a slight damage of the cell the phase of metabolism stimulation is forming in it. When the cell is slightly damaged, it begins to form the phase of metabolism stimulation. Strong damaging influences initiate the CURD phase of metabolism inhibition in the cell.\n\nAccording to the TAS concept, the protective effect of the tissue stress is realized in the case of forming of CURD metabolism stimulation phase by TAS effectors as a result of acceleration of reparative processes in the damaged cell. In the process of forming of CURD phase of metabolism inhibition by the above effectors the protective influence of tissue stress develops a result of cell reactivity decrease in response to the external damaging influences.\n\n==The place of the tissue stress in line of the unspecific adaptive reactions==\nThe main feature of the tissue stress is its formation with participation of the tissuespecific effectors of intratissue intercellular interactions \u2013 comutons, chalones and contactins, which are produced by the cells of a tissue under a stressor's influence. This distinguishes the tissue stress from the general adaptive syndrome, which is realized via hormones \u2013 effectors of interorgan interactions (see [[Stress (biological)]]). Regional (local) stress forms with participation of not one but several tissues making up an organ or a body part. This is why it can be believed that regional stress-reaction is realized with the participation of effectors of intraorgan intertissue interactions. Finally, the cell stress is realized via intracellular mechanisms, without any participation of intercellular interactions. In the latter case the CURD formation and synthesis of heat shock proteins act as \u201cself-defense\u201d mechanism of the cell.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of tissue stress is the principle of formation of its executive mechanism, the CURD, via tissuespecific self-damage of homologous tissue cells. Despite the fact that TAS, just as the cell stress, is realized via CURD, the TAS has a variety of features which distinguish it from the cell stress, the key one being the tissue-selectivity of CURD initiation under TAS effectors influence. In addition, under cell stress the cell protection is realized with CURD participation only via \u201cpassive\u201d mechanism. It consists in the formation of the protective phase of this physiological reaction. Meanwhile, under tissue stress, its protective function may be carried out both the \u201cpassive\u201d and \u201cactive\u201d CURD-induced mechanisms. Thus, the cell stress mechanism is just one of the two instruments with which TAS protects the cells of homologous tissue. The third difference between tissue and cell stresses lies in ability of the former not only to increase but also to decrease the unspecific resistance of the cells. Meanwhile, the cell stress concept considers only the first possibility.\n\nAt the present moment, two physiological functions of tissue stress, which are realized in the process of participation of its adaptive mechanism, can be considered. One of them is expressed in an increase of cell specialized functions stability in the conditions of prolonged functional load. Another tissue stress function is to regulate homologous tissue cell mass in various physiological conditions.\n\n==Tissue stress function on homologous tissue cells specialized functions stability improvement==\nIt is well known that only some part of tissue functional units participate in its cells specialized functions realization (Barcroft, 1937). Because of universality of this phenomenon it was named \u201cthe law of intermittent activity of functioning structures\u201d (Kryshanovskii, 1973; Kryshanovskii, 1974). According to this law, functional units of actively functioning tissue (or cells) form two populations where one is in \u201cintensive functioning\u201d state and the other one \u2013 is in \u201cresting\u201d state.\nThereat the \u201crest\u201d is not a passive state since there active reparation of cellular structures occurs damaged in the course of specialized functions performing by cells. \u201cIntermittent\u201d pattern of tissue cells specialized functions realization is that the cells pass from one population to another when the tissue is in intensive functioning mode. In such a way the cells damaged in consequence of intensive functioning gain an offing to recover in \u201cresting\u201d population. Meanwhile, recovered cells pass from the \u201cresting\u201d population into \u201cintensively functioning\u201d one. It is safe to say that such organization of tissue functioning favors stability of its cells functions performance. Yet, the mechanisms which regulate cells passage from one population to another on intratissue level are unknown.\n\nConsidering the law of \u201cintermittent activity of functioning structures\u201d one can talk about two results of the TAS mechanism action on the cells of actively functioning tissue. In conditions where the TAS effector (effectors) forms CURD phase of metabolism stimulation one should expect an acceleration of reparative processes in the cells of \u201cresting\u201d population. Obviously that will promote accelerated recovery of such cells and their pass to intensively functioning cell population. In case if TAS mechanism forms the CURD phase of metabolism inhibition in intensively functioning cells population this will lead to cell signaling inhibition and promote cells \u201cautonomy\u201d from other external influences. Such autonomy may provoke an inhibition of cell's specialized functions in mentioned population in case if they are stimulated by external regulatory influences. An inhibition of cells specialized functions by the TAS mechanism may promote defense of intensively functioning cells from self-damage and also their pass into the \u201cresting\u201d state. Thus, the properties of tissue stress executive mechanism \u2013 CURD \u2013 allow it to raise tissue functions stability in conditions of continuous intensive activity in many ways.\n\n==Tissue stress function on regulation of homologous tissue cell mass==\nAccording to the TAS concept, tissue stress possess the ability to regulate the cell mass of homologous tissue via executive mechanism described above \u2013 the CURD. As in the case of cells specialized functions regulation there are two ways of tissue-specific control of homologous tissue cell mass. These are cells unspecific resistance modulation and influencing the speed of physiological processes occurring in the cell.\n\nTissue stress mechanism able to control tissue cell mass influencing both its mitotic and apoptotic (see [[Apoptosis]]) activities tissue-specifically. In case if TAS effectors form CURD phase of metabolism stimulation one should expect acceleration of proliferative (see [[cell growth|Proliferation]]) pool cells passage through mitotic cycle (MC). Herewith there will be also an acceleration of cells maturation and ageing. This will provoke an increase of both mitotic and apoptotic activity in tissue. On the contrary, formation of CURD phase of metabolism protective inhibition should result in opposite results \u2013 an inhibition of all mentioned processes and, as a result, to inhibition of both mitotic and apoptotic activities. One cannot exclude the possibility that tissue stress mechanism considered able to regulate apoptosis through inhibition of its energy-dependent stage. As concerns the modulation of cells unspecific resistance by tissue stress mechanism, this property of CURD allows to regulate cells entrance into MC as well as their entrance into apoptosis.\n\nRegulation of tissue cell mass by the TAS mechanism can be carried out in two physiological regimes \u2013 ether by formation of \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cdynamic\u201d phase of this adaptive reaction. TAS conservative phase is forming under the influence of \u201cweak\u201d unspecific external damaging or \u201cload\u201d influences on cells specialized functions. Here tissue stress provides intratissue adaptation by preservation of the existing cell population in the tissue. It is achieved by raise of cells unspecific resistance under the influence of tissue-specific self-damage of cells by TAS effectors. This prevents entrance of postmitotic cells both into MC and apoptosis. The TAS dynamic phase forms under \u201cstrong\u201d external unspecific damaging or \u201cloading\u201d influences on cells specialized functions. According to TAS concept in dynamic phase of tissue stress a summation of damaging influence of stressor (stressors) with cells self-damage by TAS effectors occurs. This leads to stimulation of proliferation (see [[cell growth|Proliferation]]) and to an increase of apoptotic activity (see [[Apoptosis]]) simultaneously. Thus, in above case adaptive function of tissue stress realizes by replacement of damaged, dying cells by descendants of cells more resistant to stressor(s) influence.\n\nAs is clear from the foregoing according the TAS concept tissue stress mechanism effect on homologous tissue cells is multifarious. It may protect them against the unspecific damaging influences as well as to increase stability of tissue specialized functions in the conditions of prolonged intensive functional activity. Simultaneously, the same mechanism performs intratissue control of cell mass of homologous tissue.\n\n==References==\n*''G.M. Elbakidze, A.G.

The Eighth Air Force includes the heart of America's heavy bomber force: the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber, the [[B-1 Lancer]] supersonic bomber, and the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] heavy bomber aircraft.\n\nEstablished on 22 February 1944 by the redesignation of '''VIII Bomber Command''' at [[RAF Daws Hill]] in [[High Wycombe, England|High Wycombe]], England, the '''Eighth Army Air Force''' (8 AAF) was a [[United States Army Air Forces]] combat air force in the [[European Theater of World War II]] (1939/41\u20131945), engaging in operations primarily in the Northern Europe [[area of responsibility]]; carrying out [[strategic bombing]] of enemy targets in France, the [[Low Countries]], and Germany;<ref>{{cite video | year =1945 | title =Video: Allies Pierce Siegfried Line | url =https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39156 | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]] | accessdate =21 February 2012}}</ref> and engaging in air-to-air fighter combat against enemy aircraft until the German capitulation in May 1945. It was the largest of the deployed combat Army Air Forces in numbers of personnel, aircraft, and equipment.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131991), 8 AF was one of three Numbered Air Forces of the United States Air Force's [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), with a three-star general headquartered at [[Westover AFB]], [[Massachusetts]] commanding USAF strategic bombers and missiles on a global scale. Elements of 8 AF engaged in combat operations during the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953); [[Vietnam War]] (1961\u20131975), as well as [[Operation Desert Storm]] (1990\u20131991) over Iraq and occupied Kuwait in the [[Gulf War|First Persian Gulf War]].\n\n==Overview==\nEighth Air Force is one of two active duty numbered air forces in Air Force Global Strike Command. Eighth Air Force, with headquarters at Barksdale AFB, in the [[Bossier City]] \u2013 [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], metro area, supports U.S. Strategic Command, and is designated as U.S. Strategic Command's Task Force 204, providing on-alert, combat-ready forces to the president. The mission of \"The Mighty Eighth\" is to safeguard America's interests through strategic deterrence and global combat power. Eighth Air Force controls long-range nuclear-capable bomber assets throughout the United States and overseas locations. Its flexible, conventional and nuclear deterrence mission provides the capability to deploy forces and engage enemy threats from home station or forward positioned, anywhere, any time. The 8th Air Force motto is \"Peace Through Strength.\"\n\nThe Eighth Air Force team consists of more than 16,000 Regular Air Force (e.g., active duty), [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve]] professionals operating and maintaining a variety of aircraft capable of deploying air power to any area of the world. This air power includes the heart of America's heavy bomber force, deploying the [[B-1 Lancer]], [[B-2 Spirit]] and the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. The Mighty Eighth's B-52 force consists of 76 bombers assigned to two active duty wings, the [[2d Bomb Wing]] at [[Barksdale AFB]], Louisiana and the [[5th Bomb Wing]] at [[Minot AFB]], North Dakota, and one reserve wing, the [[307th Bomb Wing]] at [[Barksdale AFB]], Louisiana. The B-2 force consists of 20 bombers assigned to the active duty [[509th Bomb Wing]] along with the [[Missouri Air National Guard]]'s associate [[131st Bomb Wing]] at [[Whiteman AFB]], Missouri. The B-1 force consists of 62 bombers assigned to the active duty [[7th Bomb Wing]] at [[Dyess AFB]], Texas and the [[28th Bomb Wing]] at [[Ellsworth AFB]], South Dakota.  The 131st Bomb Wing is operationally-gained by AFGSC and 8 AF from the [[Air National Guard]], while the 307th Bomb Wing is operationally-gained from [[Air Force Reserve Command]] and [[10th Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.8af.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=17064|title=Factsheets : Eighth Air Force|website=|publisher=8af.af.mil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193045/http://www.8af.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=17064|archive-date=3 March 2016|access-date=|accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104500/b-1b-lancer/|title=B-1B Lancer}}</ref>\n\nMajor General James Dawkins Jr. was named Commander of 8th Air Force on 20 August 2018, after having served as the Deputy Director for Nuclear, Homeland Defense, and Current Operations on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.\n\n==History==\n:''For additional history and lineage, see [[United States Air Forces in Europe]]''\n\nEighth Air Force was established as VIII Bomber Command on 19 January 1942 and activated at [[Langley Field]], Virginia on 1 February.  It was reassigned to Savannah Air Base, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on 10 February 1942. An advanced detachment of VIII Bomber Command was established at [[RAF Bomber Command]] Headquarters at [[RAF Daws Hill]] England on 23 February in preparation for its units to arrive in the United Kingdom from the United States. The first combat group of VIII Bomber Command to arrive in the United Kingdom was the ground echelon of the [[97th Bombardment Group]], which arrived at [[RAF Polebrook]] on 9 June 1942.\n\n===Start of offensive operations against Nazi-occupied territory===\n\nRegular combat operations by the VIII Bomber Command began on 17 August 1942, when the 97th Bombardment Group flew 12 B-17Es on the first VIII Bomber Command heavy bomber mission of the war from RAF Polebrook, attacking the [[Rouen]]-Sotteville [[marshalling yard]]s in France.\n\n[[File:B-17 Flying Fortress.jpg|thumb|right|B-17 Flying Fortresses Over Europe during World War II]]\nDuring World War II, the offensive air forces of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) came to be classified as strategic or tactical. A strategic air force was that with a mission to attack an enemy's war effort beyond his front-line forces, predominantly production and supply facilities, whereas a tactical air force supported ground campaigns, usually with objectives selected through co-operation with the armies.\n\nIn Europe, Eighth Air Force was the first USAAF strategic air force, with a mission to support an invasion of continental Europe from the British Isles. Eighth Air Force carried out strategic daytime strategic bombing operations in Western Europe from [[airfield]]s in eastern England.\n\n===World War II (1944\u20131945)===\n[[File:Eighth_Air_Force_-_Emblem_(World_War_II).png|left|125px]]\n[[File:Living Legends.jpg|thumb|[[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es from the [[398th Air Expeditionary Group|398th Bombardment Group]] fly a bombing run to [[Neum\u00fcnster]], Germany, on 13 April 1945. On 8 May, Germany surrendered, and [[Victory in Europe Day]] was declared.]]\n{{ external media\n| align  = right\n| width  = \n| video1 = {{YouTube|V9klkEF7Y7g&t|Target For Today \u2013 1943 VIII Bomber Command film}}\n}}\nOn 4 January 1944, the B-24s and B-17s based in England flew their last mission as a subordinate part of VIII Bomber Command. On 22 February 1944, a massive reorganization of American airpower took place in Europe. The original Eighth Air Force was redesignated as the [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF).  VIII Bomber Command, redesignated as Eighth Air Force, and [[Ninth Air Force]] were assigned to (USSTAF).\n\nVIII Bomber Command, after redesignation as Eighth Air Force, was assigned VIII Fighter and VIII Air Support Commands under its command. This is from where the present-day Eighth Air Force's history, lineage and honors derive.\n\nGeneral [[Carl Spaatz]] returned to England to command the USSTAF. Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle]] relinquished command of the Fifteenth Air Force to Major General [[Nathan F. Twining]] and took over command of the Eighth Air Force from [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Ira C. Eaker]] at [[RAF Daws Hill]]. Doolittle was well known to American airmen as the famous \"Tokyo Raider\" and former air racer. His directive was simple: 'Win the air war and isolate the battlefield'.\n\nSpaatz and Doolittle's plan was to use the US Strategic Air Forces in a series of co-ordinated raids, code-named Operation 'Argument' and supported by RAF night bombing, on the German aircraft industry at the earliest possible date.\n\n====Big Week====\nCold and clear weather was predicted for the last week of February 1944 and Operation Argument became known as \"[[Big Week]]\". On the night of 19\u201320 February, the RAF [[Bombing of Leipzig in World War II|bombed Leipzig]]. Eighth Air Force put up over 1,000 B-17s and B-24s and over 800 fighters and the RAF provided sixteen squadrons of [[P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. In all, twelve aircraft factories were attacked, with the B-17s heading to Leipzig (Allgemeine Transportanlagen-Gesellschaft \u2013 [[Junkers Ju 88]] production and Erla Maschinenwerk \u2013 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]]), [[Bernburg]]-Strenzfeld ([[Junkers]] [[Ju 88]] plant) and [[Oschersleben]] ([[AGO Flugzeugwerke|AGO]] plant making Focke-Wulf [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190A]] fighters), while the B-24s hitting the [[Gothaer Waggonfabrik]] (production of [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]), the Fw 190 [[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]] plant at [[Tutow]] and the [[Heinkel]] firm's ''\"Heinkel-Nord\"'' headquarters at [[Rostock]] (production of [[Heinkel He 111|He 111]]). As a contrast, the Luftwaffe was undertaking the [[Operation Steinbock#20/21 February|sixth major raid of the \"Baby Blitz\"]] the following night (20/21 February), with only some 165 German aircraft sortieing against British targets.\n\nThe raids on the German aircraft industry comprising much of \"Big Week\" caused so much damage that the Germans were forced to disperse aircraft manufacturing eastward, to safer parts of the Reich.\n\nThe next day, over 900 bombers and 700 fighters of Eighth Air Force hit more aircraft factories in the [[Braunschweig]] area. Over 60 [[Luftwaffe]] fighters were shot down with a loss of 19 US bombers and 5 US fighters. On 24 February, with the weather clearing over central Germany, Eighth Air Force sent over 800 bombers, hitting [[Schweinfurt]] and attacks on the Baltic coast, with a total of 11 B-17s being lost. Some 230 B-24s hit the Messerschmitt Bf 110 assembly plant at [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] with a loss of 24 aircraft.\n\nOn 22 February 1944, due to many mistakes, Nijmegen was bombarded by 12 aircraft of the 446th Bomb Group and 2 aircraft of the 453rd. They did not realize that they were above Dutch ground. 850 civilians, including children on their way to school, were among the casualties.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nOn 25 February, both Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces hit numerous targets at [[F\u00fcrth]] airfield, [[Augsburg]] and [[Regensburg]], attacking Messerschmitt Bf 110 and [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]] plants. The 8th lost 31 bombers, the 15th lost 33.\n\n====Berlin====\n[[File:Molesw-hellsangels.jpg|thumb|Aircraft and ground crew of Boeing B-17F-25-BO Fortress \"Hell's Angels\" (AAF Ser. No. ''41-24577'') of the 358th Bomb Squadron, 303d Bomb Group, RAF Molesworth. This was first B-17 to complete 25 combat missions in the 8th Air Force, on 13 May 1943. After completing 48 missions, the aircraft returned to the U.S. on 20 January 1944, for a publicity tour]]\n\nLess than a week after \"Big Week\", Eighth Air Force made its first attack on the Reich's capital, Berlin. The RAF had been making night raids on Berlin [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|since 1940]], (with [[Battle of Berlin (air)|heavy raids in 1943]]) and nuisance Mosquito raids in daylight, but this was the first major daylight bombing raid on the German capital. On 6 March 1944, over 700 heavy bombers along with 800 escort fighters of the Eighth Air Force hit numerous targets within Berlin, dropping the first American bombs on the capital of the [[Third Reich]]. On 8 March, another raid of 600 bombers and 200 fighters hit the Berlin area again, destroying the VKF ball-bearing plant at [[Erkner]]. The following day, on 9 March, [[H2X radar]]-equipped B-17s mounted a third attack on the Reich capital through clouds. Altogether, the Eighth Air Force dropped over 4,800 tons of high explosive on Berlin during the first week of March. The photograph shows housing destroyed by the RAF during night raids.\n\nOn 22 March, over 800 bombers, led by H2X radar equipped bombers hit Berlin yet again, bombing targets through a thick rainy overcast causing more destruction to various industries. Because of the thick clouds and rain over the area the Luftwaffe did not attack the American bomber fleet, as the Germans believed that because of the weather the American bombers would be incapable of attacking their targets. Even so, the \"pathfinder\" bombers of the [[RAF Alconbury]]-based 482d Bomb Group proved very capable of finding the targets and guiding the bombers to them.\n\n====Prelude to Overlord====\nIn a prelude to the invasion of France, American air attacks began in February 1944 against railroad junctions, airfields, ports and bridges in northern France and along the [[English Channel]] coastline. Fighters from both Eighth and Ninth Air Forces made wide sweeps over the area, mounting strafing missions at airfields and rail networks. By 6 June, Allied fighter pilots had succeeded in damaging or destroying hundreds of locomotives, thousands of motorized vehicles, and many bridges. In addition, German airfields in France and Belgium were attacked.\n\nOn 1 May, over 1,300 Eighth Air Force heavy bombers made an all-out attack on the enemy's rail network, striking at targets in France and Belgium. On 7 May, another 1,000 bombers hit additional targets along the English Channel coast, hitting fortifications, bridges and marshaling areas.\n\nOn D-Day, over 2,300 sorties were flown by Eighth Air Force heavy bombers in the [[Normandy]] and [[Cherbourg]] invasion areas, all aimed at neutralizing enemy coastal defenses and front-line troops.\n\n====Defeat of the Luftwaffe====\n[[File:Bott4.jpg|thumb|North American P-51 Mustangs of the 375th Fighter Squadron, 361st FG, summer 1944]]\n[[File:Destroyed-FW-190.jpg|thumb|Destroyed Luftwaffe Fw 190, 1945]]\n\nThe [[P-51 Mustang]] first entered squadron service in Europe with the British in early 1942; the [[Allison V-1710]] engined P-51A (Mustang I) having much success with the RAF, although it found the aircraft's performance inadequate at higher altitudes. [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] engineers rapidly realized that [[North American Mustang X|equipping the Mustang with a Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine with its two speed, two stage supercharger would substantially improve performance. Also, by using a four-bladed propeller, rather than the three-bladed one used on the P-51A, the performance was greatly improved; the XP-51B achieved a level speed of 441&nbsp;mph at {{convert|29800|ft|m}}, over 100&nbsp;mph faster than the Allison-engined P-51A at that altitude. At all heights, the rate of climb was approximately doubled.\n\nThe USAAF now finally had an aircraft that could compete on equal terms with the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and the later models of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. The USAAF was finally fully sold on the Mustang, and a letter contract for 2200 P-51Bs was issued. The engine was to be the [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650-3]], based on the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin 68]].\n\nIn late 1943, the P-51B Mustang was introduced to the [[European Theater]] by the USAAF. It could fly as far on its internal fuel tanks as the P-47 could with drop tanks. However, the P-51B was introduced as a tactical fighter, so the first deliveries of the P-51B in November 1943 were assigned to three groups in the tactical [[Ninth Air Force]] at the expense of [[VIII Bomber Command]], whose need for a long range escort fighter was critical. The first escort mission for the bombers was not flown until 5 December.\n\nAs the new commander of the Eighth Air Force from January 1944 onwards, Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle]]'s major influence on the European air war occurred early that year when he made a critical change to the policy requiring escorting fighters to remain with the bombers at all times. With Doolittle's permission, American fighter pilots on bomber defense missions would primarily be flying far ahead of the bombers' [[combat box]] formations in [[air supremacy]] mode, literally \"clearing the skies\" of any [[Luftwaffe]] fighter opposition heading towards the target. This strategy fatally disabled the twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' [[heavy fighter]] wings and their replacement, single-engined ''Sturmgruppen'' of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavily armed Fw 190As]], clearing each force of [[bomber destroyer]]s in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. As part of this game-changing strategy, especially after the bombers had hit their targets, the USAAF's fighters were then free to strafe German airfields and transport while returning to base, contributing significantly to the achievement of air superiority by Allied air forces over Europe.\n\nThe effect of the Mustangs, fully operating as an air supremacy fighter force, on the Luftwaffe defenders was arguably swift and decisive. The result was that the Luftwaffe was notable by its absence over the skies of Europe after [[D-Day]] and the Allies were starting to achieve air superiority over the continent. Although the Luftwaffe could, and did, mount effective attacks on the ever-larger formations of Allied heavy bombers, the sheer numbers of B-17s and B-24s attacking enemy targets was overwhelming the German fighter force, which simply could not sustain the losses the Eighth Air Force bombers and fighters were inflicting on it.  In order to quickly assemble these formations, specially outfitted [[assembly ships]] were created from older bombers.\n\nBy mid-1944, Eighth Air Force had reached a total strength of more than 200,000 people (it is estimated that more than 350,000 Americans served in Eighth Air Force during the war in Europe). At peak strength, Eighth Air Force had forty heavy bomber groups, fifteen fighter groups, and four specialized support groups. It could, and often did, dispatch more than 2,000 four-engine bombers and more than 1,000 fighters on a single mission to multiple targets.\n\nBy 1945, all but one of the Eighth Air Force fighter groups were equipped with the P-51D.\n\n====Destroying the German oil industry====\n{{main|Oil Campaign of World War II}}\n\nEighth Air Force did not strike at oil industry targets until 13 May 1944 when 749 bombers, escorted by almost 740 fighters, pounded oil targets in the [[Leipzig]] area and at [[Brux (city)|Brux]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. At the same time, a smaller force hit an [[Fw 190]] repair depot at [[Zwickau]]. Over 300 German fighters attacked the bomber forces, losing almost half its aircraft, with claims of upwards of 47 ''Luftwaffe'' fighters by American fighter pilots. However, the [[Luftwaffe]] was successful in shooting down 46 bombers in a very unequal fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/may44.htm|title=Combat Chronology of the US Army Air Forces - May 1944|publisher=usaaf.net|accessdate=13 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606084013/http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/may44.htm|archivedate=6 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[D-Day]], attacks on the German oil industry assumed top priority which was widely dispersed around the Reich. Vast fleets of B-24s and B-17s escorted by P-51Ds and long-range P-38Ls hit refineries in Germany and [[Czechoslovakia]] in late 1944 and early 1945. Having almost total air superiority throughout the collapsing German Reich, Eighth Air Force hit targets as far east as Hungary, while [[Fifteenth Air Force]] hit oil industry facilities in [[Yugoslavia]], Romania, and northeastern Italy. On at least eighteen occasions, the Merseburg refineries in [[Leuna]], where the majority of Germany's synthetic fuel for jet aircraft was refined, was hit. By the end of 1944, only three out of ninety-one refineries in the Reich were still working normally, twenty-nine were partially functional, and the remainder were completely destroyed.\n\n====Casualties and awards====\nThese missions, however, carried a high price. Half of the U.S. Army Air Forces' casualties in World War II were suffered by Eighth Air Force (more than 47,000 casualties, with more than 26,000 dead). Seventeen [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] went to Eighth Air Force personnel during the war. By war's end, they had been awarded a number of other medals to include 220 [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Crosses]], and 442,000 [[Air Medal]]s. Many more awards were made to Eighth Air Force veterans after the war that remain uncounted. There were 261 fighter aces in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. Thirty-one of these aces had 15 or more aircraft kills apiece. Another 305 enlisted gunners were also recognized as aces.\n\nOne notable Eighth Air Force casualty was Brigadier General Arthur W. Vanaman, Chief of Intelligence, who was captured by the Germans near Aveluy, France, on 27 June 1944, becoming the highest-ranked American POW of the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Donald |title=Masters of the Air: America's Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany |date=2007}}</ref>\n\n====Victory in Europe====\nIn January 1945, the [[Luftwaffe]] attempted one last major air offensive against the Allied Air Forces. Over 950 fighters had been sent west from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for [[Unternehmen Bodenplatte|\"Operation Bodenplatte\"]]. On 1 January, the entire German fighter force in the West, comprising combat aircraft from some eleven ''[[Jagdgeschwader]]'' day fighter wings, took off and attacked 27 Allied airfields in northern France, Belgium and the southern part of the [[Netherlands]] in an attempt by the Luftwaffe to cripple [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces in the [[Low Countries]] of Europe. It was a last-ditch effort to keep up the momentum of the German forces during the stagnant stage of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] ([[Battle of the Bulge|''Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein'']]). The operation was a pyrrhic success for the ''Luftwaffe'' as the losses suffered by the German air arm were irreplaceable and over 300 Luftwaffe aircraft were shot down, mostly by Allied anti-aircraft guns. The losses of the Allied Air Forces were replaced within weeks. The operation failed to achieve [[air superiority]], even temporarily, and the German Army continued to be exposed to air attack.\n\nFirst seen by Allied airmen during the late summer of 1944, it wasn't until March 1945 that German [[jet aircraft]] started to attack Allied bomber formations in earnest. On 2 March, when Eighth Air Force bombers were dispatched to attack the synthetic oil refineries at [[Leipzig]], [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]As attacked the formation near [[Dresden]]. The next day, the largest formation of German jets ever seen, most likely from the Luftwaffe's specialist 7th Fighter Wing, ''[[Jagdgeschwader 7]]'' ''Nowotny'', made attacks on Eighth Air Force bomber formations over Dresden and the oil targets at [[Essen]], shooting down a total of three bombers.\n\nHowever, the Luftwaffe jets were simply too few and too late to have any serious effect on the Allied air armadas now sweeping over the Reich with near-impunity. A lack of fuel and available pilots for the new jets greatly reduced their effectiveness. The Me 262A was a difficult foe for the P-47s and P-51s, possessing a distinct speed advantage. Allied bomber escort fighters would fly high above the bombers \u2013 diving from this height gave them extra speed, thus reducing the speed difference. The Me 262 was also less maneuverable than the P-51 and so trained Allied pilots could turn tighter than an Me 262A. However, the only reliable way of dealing with the jets, as with the even faster Me 163B Komet rocket fighters, was to attack them on the ground and during takeoff and landing. Luftwaffe airfields that were identified as jet and rocket bases, such as [[Parchim]] and [[Bad Zwischenahn]], were frequently bombed, and Allied fighters patrolled over the fields to attack jets trying to land. The Luftwaffe countered by installing flak alleys along the approach lines in order to protect the Me 262s from the ground and providing top cover with conventional fighters during takeoff and landing. Nevertheless, in March and April 1945, Allied fighter patrol patterns over Me 262 airfields resulted in numerous losses of jets and serious attrition of the force.\n\nOn 7 April 1945, the Luftwaffe flew its most desperate and deadliest mission, with the dedicated aerial ramming unit ''[[Sonderkommando Elbe]]''. This operation involved German pilots of the unit ramming their worn-out Bf 109Gs, each barely armed with only one MG 131 heavy machine gun and 50 rounds of ammunition, into American bombers in order to get the Allies to suspend bombing raids long enough for the Germans to make a significant amount of Me 262A jet fighters. The 8th Air Force was targeted in this operation. Fifteen Allied bombers were attacked, eight were successfully destroyed.\n\n[[File:Berlin-1945.jpg|thumb|Destroyed Berlin, Germany, May 1945]]\nOn 7 April, Eighth Air Force dispatched thirty-two B-17 and B-24 groups and fourteen Mustang groups (the sheer numbers of attacking Allied aircraft were so large in 1945 that they were now counted by the group) to targets in the small area of Germany still controlled by the Nazis, hitting the remaining airfields where the Luftwaffe jets were stationed. In addition, almost 300 German aircraft of all types were destroyed in strafing attacks. On 16 April, this record was broken when over 700 German aircraft were destroyed on the ground.\n\nThe end came on 25 April 1945 when Eighth Air Force flew its last full-scale mission of the European War. B-17s hit the Skoda armaments factory at [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]] in Czechoslovakia, while B-24s bombed rail complexes surrounding [[Hitler]]'s mountain retreat at [[Berchtesgaden]].\n\n====Pacific Theater====\nFollowing the end of the war in Europe in May 1945 plans were made to transfer some of the B-17/B-24 heavy bomber groups of Eighth Air Force to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] and upgrade them to [[B-29 Superfortress]] Very Heavy (VH) bomb groups. As part of this plan, Eighth Air Force headquarters was reassigned to [[Kadena Air Base|Sakugawa (Kadena Airfield)]], [[Okinawa]], on 16 July 1945, being assigned to the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific]] without personnel or equipment.<ref name=\"usafhra1\">{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/219/137.xml|title=USAF Historical Research Agency Document 00219137}}</ref>\n\nOn Okinawa, Eighth Air Force derived its headquarters personnel from the inactivated [[XX Bomber Command]], and [[Jimmy Doolittle|Lieutenant General James H. Doolittle]] assumed command, being reassigned from England on 19 July.

During World War II, when it was named ''The Great Artiste'', 353 flew on both Atomic Bomb missions against Japan on 6 and 9 August 1945 as an instrument aircraft monitoring the nuclear explosions.  On 3 September 1948, during a polar navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay Air Base]], Labrador, and ran off the end of the runway when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance. -->]]\n[[File:1947 8th AF OC.gif|thumb|8th Air Force organizational chart, 1947]]\n\nWorld War II proved what the proponents of air power had been championing for the previous two decades\u2014the great value of strategic forces in bombing an enemy's industrial complex and of tactical forces in controlling the skies above a battlefield. As a result, Eighth Air Force was incorporated into the new [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).\n\nOn 7 June 1946, Headquarters Eighth Air Force was reassigned without personnel or equipment from Okinawa to [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill AAF]], Florida, becoming SAC's second numbered air force. At MacDill, Eighth Air Force headquarters were manned chiefly by personnel from the [[58th Air Division|58th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy]], stationed at [[Carswell AFB|Fort Worth AAF]], Texas. The organization reported administratively to the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] at [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], Colorado. That base assignment lasted until 1 November 1946, when SAC transferred the Eighth to Fort Worth (later renamed Carswell AFB).\n\n====Bomb units====\nBoth Davis-Monthan and Fort Worth Army Airfields were B-29 training bases during World War II, and the Eighth Air Force Bomb Groups were simply activated at the same field and on the same day as the original Army Air Force [[Continental Air Forces]] training bomb groups were inactivated. The assets of the former training units were simply assigned to Eighth Air Force. This was largely so that the Air Force could perpetuate the names of groups that had distinguished themselves in World War II.\n\nThese bomb wings were drastically undermanned and under equipped. At the close of 1946, they shared only a handful of operational bombers, all [[B-29 Superfortress]]es. Although there were many available which were returned from [[Twentieth Air Force]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] they were war-weary from the many long combat missions flown during the war. However, it was believed that a strong strategic air arm equipped with B-29s would deter a possible aggressor from attacking the United States for fear of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons.\n\nBy the late 1940s, the [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es and [[B-24 Liberator]]s used in the [[European Theater]] of the war were thoroughly obsolete as combat aircraft and were mostly sent to the smelters. A handful remained in service performing non-combat duties through the mid-1950s as air-sea rescue aircraft (SB-17, SB-24); photo-reconnaissance aircraft (RB-17, RB-24), and as unmanned target drones (QB-17) and their controllers (DB-17).\n\nInitially, Eighth Air Force under SAC consisted of the following:\n* [[Carswell Air Force Base|Fort Worth AAF]] (Later Carswell AFB), Texas\n: [[58th Air Division|58th Bombardment Wing (later Air Division)]]\n:: Reassigned from [[March AFB|March Field]], California 8 May 1946\n:: Reassigned to [[Andrews AFB]], Maryland 1 March 1948 (Inactivated 16 October 1948)\n: [[449th Air Expeditionary Group|449th Bombardment Group]]\n:: Reassigned from [[McCook Army Airfield|McCook AAF]], Nebraska December 1945 (McCook AAF Closed)\n:: Inactivated on 4 August 1946\n: 7th Bombardment Group\n:: Activated on 1 October 1946\n:: [[7th Bomb Wing|7th Bombardment Wing]] established on 17 November 1947. 7th Bomb Group assigned as subordinate unit.\n\nPersonnel and equipment from the inactivated 449th Bomb Group were reassigned to the 7th Bomb Group (later 7th Bomb Wing). The command staff and all personnel of the 58th Bomb wing were eliminated on 1 November 1946 and the organization was reduced to a paper unit. For two years, the wing remained in this status until the 58th Bomb Wing was inactivated on 16 October 1948.\n* [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base|Davis-Monthan AAF]] (Later Davis-Monthan Air Force Base), Arizona\n: [[40th Air Expeditionary Wing|40th Bombardment Group]]\n:: Reassigned from [[March AFB|March Field]], California, 8 May 1946\n:: Inactivated on 1 October 1946\n: [[444th Bombardment Group]]\n:: Reassigned from [[Castle AFB|Merced AAF]], California 6 May 1945\n:: Inactivated on 1 October 1946\n: [[43d Airlift Wing|43rd Bombardment Group]]\n:: Activated on 4 October 1946\n:: 43d Bombardment Wing established on 3 November 1947. 43d Bomb Group assigned as subordinate unit.\n\nPersonnel and equipment from the inactivated 40th and 444th Bomb Groups were reassigned to the 43d Bomb Group\n* [[Walker AFB|Roswell AAF]] (Later Walker Air Force Base), New Mexico\n: [[509th Composite Group|509th Bombardment Group]]\n:: Reassigned from North Field, [[Tinian]] on 8 November 1946\n:: [[509th Bombardment Wing]] established on 3 November 1947. 509th Bombardment Group assigned as subordinate unit.\n\nThe Eighth Air Force was specifically charged with the atomic mission; however, only the 509th Composite Group at [[Walker AFB|Roswell AAF]] had B-29s that had the capability to drop nuclear weapons \u2013 the 7th Bomb Group at Fort Worth AAF was modifying their aircraft to carry the atomic bomb.\n* [[Salina Municipal Airport|Smoky Hill AAF]] (Later Smoky Hill Air Force Base), Kansas Transferred from Fifteenth Air Force, 16 May 1948\n: [[301st Air Refueling Wing|301st Bombardment Wing]]\n: Reassigned to [[Barksdale AFB]], Louisiana, 1 August 1949.

In its early days, SAC had fighter wings for the escorting its aircraft equipped with the new [[North American F-82 Twin Mustang|F-82E Twin Mustang]] along with long range [[North American P-51 Mustang|F-51H Mustangs]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|F-47N Thunderbolts]], all of which were designed late in World War II for use in the planned invasion of Japan. SAC fighter wings assigned to Eighth Air Force were:\n* 27th Fighter Wing (F-82E Twin Mustang)\n: Activated at [[Kearney Regional Airport|Kearney AFB]], Nebraska on 27 July 1947\n: Reassigned to [[Bergstrom AFB]], Texas on 16 March 1949 (Base Closed)\n* 31st Fighter Wing (F-47N Thunderbolt)\n: Activated at [[Naval Air Station Albany#Turner Air Force Base (1947-66)|Turner AFB]], Georgia on 25 June 1947\n: Inactivated on 16 June 1952\n* 33d Fighter Wing (F-51H Mustang, [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|F-80C Shooting Star]])\n: Attached to 509th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, Walker AFB, New Mexico 17 November 1947\n: Reassigned to [[Otis AFB]], Massachusetts, 15 November 1948\n* 82d Fighter Wing (F-51D Mustang)\n: Activated at [[Grenier AFB]], New Hampshire on 12 April 1947\n: Inactivated 2 October 1949\n\nFighter escorts were no longer needed once SAC was equipped with [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] and then [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] jet bombers carrying nuclear bombs. As the nuclear weapons carried by the bombers were so powerful that only one plane was assigned to a target that might have previously needed a whole bomb group of aircraft. Although SAC fighter squadrons upgraded to [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]] jet fighters in the early 1950s, the new jet bombers flew so high and so fast there was little danger of them being intercepted by enemy fighters.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} By 1955, SAC no longer needed its fighters and these fighter units were transferred to [[Tactical Air Command]] and utilized in a tactical role.\n\nIn 1949, a realignment of responsibilities for SAC's two air forces occurred. [[Fifteenth Air Force]] was relocated to [[March AFB]], California. As part of this realignment, most SAC bomber forces west of the [[Mississippi River]] were reassigned to 15th AF. Those east of the Mississippi were assigned to SAC's other strategic air force, Eighth Air Force, which was reassigned to [[Westover AFB]], Massachusetts, where it commanded all SAC bases in the eastern United States.\n\nSeveral events in the late 1940s reversed the drawdown of United States strategic forces. The 1948 [[Berlin Blockade|blockade of West Berlin by the Eastern bloc]] and the outbreak of the [[Cold War]] caused the United States to deploy SAC's B-29 bomber force back to the United Kingdom and [[West Germany]]. Communist victories in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 and the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1950 meant that the United States would have to expand SAC to address these potential threats both in Europe as well as Asia.\n\nBy the time of the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, Eighth Air Force consisted of the following units:\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Carswell AFB]], Texas\n: 7th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper)\n: 11th Bombardment Wing (inactive) <!--:: Not activated until 16 February 1951 with B-36s -->\n* [[Biggs Army Airfield#Biggs Air Force Base (1947-66)|Biggs AFB]], Texas\n: 97th Bombardment Wing (B-29 Superfortress)\n* [[Davis-Monthan AFB]], Arizona\n: 43d Bombardment Wing (B-29, B-50 Superfortress)\n* [[Ellsworth AFB]], South Dakota\n: 28th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper)\n\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Walker AFB]], New Mexico\n: 6th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper)\n: 509th Bombardment Wing (B-29, B-50 Superfortress)\n* [[Hunter Army Airfield|Chatham AFB]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n: 2d Bombardment Wing (B-29, KB-50 Superfortress)\n* [[Bergstrom AFB]] Texas\n: 27th Fighter-Escort Wing (F-84 Thunderstreak)\n{{Col-end}}\n\n====Korean War====\nOn 25 June 1950, the armed forces of the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)]] invaded [[South Korea]]. On 27 June, the United Nations [[Security Council]] voted to assist the South Koreans in resisting the invasion. Although Eighth Air Force's strategic bomber force was not committed to combat in Korea, the Eighth deployed the [[27th Special Operations Wing|27th Fighter Escort Wing]] for combat action in Korea and earned numerous honors and awards for their combat record during the Korean War.\n\nOn 21 January 1951, Lt. Col. William Bertram, commander of the 523rd Fighter-Escort Squadron, shot down the first [[Mig-15|MiG-15]] for the wing and became the first F-84 pilot with a confirmed MiG kill. Two days later, on 23 January, the 27th FEW participated in the raid on [[Sinuiju Airport|Sinuju Airfield]] in [[North Korea]] and shot down four more MiG-15s. By the time the group rotated back to the United States, they had flown more than 23,000 combat hours in more than 12,000 sorties.\n\nFor its Korean War service, the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Distinguished Unit Citation]], covering the period of 26 January through 21 April 1951, for their actions in Korea.\n\nThe 27th was relieved of its duties supporting U.N. forces in Korea and returned to Bergstrom AFB on 31 July 1951, but was redeployed to [[Misawa Air Base|Misawa AB]], Japan during 6 October 1952 \u2013 13 February 1953 to provide air defense.\n\n====Cold War====\n[[File:Usaf-b-47-usafmuseum.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth Air Force Boeing B-47E-50-LM (S/N ''52-3363'') in flight]]\n[[File:8af-b52-kc135-usafmuseum.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth Air Force Boeing B-52D-70-BO (S/N ''56-0582'') being refueled by Boeing KC-135A-BN (S/N ''55-3127'')]]\n\nWith the end of fighting in Korea, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who had taken office in January 1953, called for a \"new look\" at national defense. The result: a greater reliance on [[nuclear weapon]]s and air power to deter war. His administration chose to invest in the Air Force, especially Strategic Air Command. The [[nuclear arms race]] shifted into high gear. The Air Force retired nearly all of its piston-engined B-29/B-50s and they were replaced by new Boeing [[B-47 Stratojet]] aircraft. By 1955 the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] would be entering the inventory in substantial numbers, as prop [[B-36]]s were phased out of heavy bombardment units rapidly.\n\nAlso after the deployment of forces to Far East Air Force to engage in combat over Korea, the history of Eighth Air Force becomes indistinguishable from that of [[Strategic Air Command]]. The Eighth's weapons inventory also changed to include [[KC-135]] air refuelers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (the Atlas, Titan I and Titan II, and all Minuteman models.)\n\nAt the same time, aerial refueling techniques were improved to the extent that Eighth Air Force bombers could still reach targets in Europe and Asia even if overseas bases were destroyed by an enemy attack. To reduce the risk to its bomber fleet in the United States, Eighth Air Force aircraft stood nuclear alert, providing a deterrent against an attack on the United States by the Soviet Union. It dispersed its planes to a large number of bases across the United States so as not to have too many concentrated at a single location.\n\n====Vietnam War====\nIn 1965, Eighth Air Force entered combat again, this time in Southeast Asia. At first, the Eighth deployed its B-52 bomber and KC-135 tanker units from the U.S. to operating bases in [[Guam]], [[Okinawa]] and [[Thailand]]. Then in April 1970, SAC moved the Eighth without personnel or equipment to [[Andersen AFB]] [[Guam]], absorbing resources of the 3d Air Division. At Anderson, the Eighth took over the direction of all bombing and refueling operations in Southeast Asia. The intensive bombing of [[Hanoi]] and [[Haiphong]] during 11 days in December 1972, known as [[Operation Linebacker II]], was but one highlight of those war years. Importantly, the Eighth's bombing effectiveness influenced the North Vietnamese to end hostilities. With the end of combat in Southeast Asia, the Eighth Air Force moved without personnel or equipment to [[Barksdale AFB]] Louisiana on 1 January 1975, absorbing the resources of Second Air Force.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Eighth participated in several key operations such as running the tanker task force for [[Operation Urgent Fury]] in 1983 and directing all air refueling operations for [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] in 1986 and [[Operation Just Cause]] in 1989.\n\n====Operations over Iraq====\nThe Eighth's units played a key role in the 42-day [[Gulf War]] in 1991. An Eighth Air Force unit, the 2d Bomb Wing, spearheaded the air campaign by dispatching B-52s from Barksdale to launch conventional air-launched cruise missiles against Iraqi targets. Eighth Air Force bomb wings, stationed in the Persian Gulf region, also attacked Iraq's Republican Guard forces and numerous key strategic targets, while other units provided air refueling and tactical reconnaissance throughout the conflict. As a headquarters, the Eighth had another important role in victory over Iraqi forces\u2014operating the logistics supply and air refueling bridge between the U.S. and gulf region.\n\n===History from June 1992===\n[[File:Air Combat Command.png|left|100px]]\n\nFifteen months after Operation Desert Storm, the Air Force reorganized. Eighth Air Force was relieved from assignment to Strategic Air Command and assigned to the new [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC) on 1 June 1992.\n\nUnder ACC, Eighth Air Force provides command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C2ISR); long-range attack; and information operations forces to Air Force components and warfighting commands. Eighth Air Force trains, tests, exercises and demonstrates combat-ready forces for rapid employment worldwide.\n\nEighth Air Force also provides conventional forces to U.S. Joint Forces Command and provides nuclear capable bombers, specified Global Strike assets, and C2ISR capabilities to U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM). Eighth Air Force also supports STRATCOM's Joint Force Headquarters \u2013 Information Operations and serves as the command element for Air Force wide computer network operations.\n\nUnder ACC, the Eighth received control over active duty, [[Air Force Reserve]], and [[Air National Guard]] units in the central U.S. and two overseas locations. Then in January 1994, ACC reorganized Eighth Air Force as a general purpose Numbered Air Force (NAF) with a warfighting mission to support the U.S. Joint Forces and U.S. Strategic Commands. Support to the latter command included the operation of Task Force 204 (bombers).\n\nSince 1994, the Eighth has participated in a string of contingency operations, such as the 1996 Operation \"Desert Strike\" against [[Iraq]], the 1998 Operation \"Desert Fox\" (similarly named but in no way associated with Field Marshal Erwin Rommel) against Iraq, which featured the [[B-1 Lancer|B-1B]] in its combat debut, and 1999 Operation \"Allied Force\" against the Federal Republic of [[Yugoslavia]], which involved the [[B-2 Spirit|B-2A Spirit]] in its first uncontested mission of aggression, which was officially designated \"combat\". The \"Allied Force\" campaign also marked the Eighth's return to Europe and the participation of U.S. bombers in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's ([[NATO]]) first combat operation. Altogether, the Eighth's bombers flew 325 sorties to drop over 7 million pounds of ordnance on a nation slightly smaller than the state of Colorado.\n\nIn 2000, the Air Force decided to integrate information operations into Eighth Air Force. The integration process started on 1 February 2001, when the Air Force realigned the Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) under ACC and assigned the 67th Information Operations Wing and the 70th Intelligence Wing to the Eighth. The reorganization transformed the Eighth into the only information operations and bomber NAF in the Air Force. For the Mighty Eighth, that change heralded an interesting future, one that bring further restructuring, different aircraft system purchases, and a new challenging mission to the NAF.\n\nWhile posturing itself for that mission change, the Eighth also supported [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Operation \"Enduring Freedom\"]] in which the Air Force operates against targets in [[Afghanistan]], and [[Operation Noble Eagle|\"NOBLE EAGLE\"]] for the defense of North American airspace. Throughout the first six months of \"ENDURING FREEDOM\", the Mighty Eighth's bombers were instrumental in the eradication of many targets and opposing combatants in Afghanistan.\n\n====Air Force Global Strike Command====\n[[File:Air Force Global Strike Command.png|right|100px]]\n\nUnder [[Air Force Global Strike Command]] since 1 Feb 2010, Eighth Air Force controls strategic bomber (e.g., [[B-2 Spirit]] and [[B-52 Stratofortress]], and [[B-1 Lancer]]) forces throughout the United States and overseas locations.

It is headquartered at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], [[Louisiana]]. The command serves as '''Air Forces Strategic \u2013 Global Strike''', one of the air components of [[United States Strategic Command]] (USSTRATCOM). The Eighth Air Force includes the heart of America's heavy bomber force: the [[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber, the [[B-1 Lancer]] supersonic bomber, and the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] heavy bomber aircraft.\n\nEstablished on 22 February 1944 by the redesignation of '''VIII Bomber Command''' at [[RAF Daws Hill]] in [[High Wycombe, England|High Wycombe]], England, the '''Eighth Army Air Force''' (8 AAF) was a [[United States Army Air Forces]] combat air force in the [[European Theater of World War II]] (1939/41\u20131945), engaging in operations primarily in the Northern Europe [[area of responsibility]]; carrying out [[strategic bombing]] of enemy targets in France, the [[Low Countries]], and Germany;<ref>{{cite video | year =1945 | title =Video: Allies Pierce Siegfried Line | url =https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39156 | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]] | accessdate =21 February 2012}}</ref> and engaging in air-to-air fighter combat against enemy aircraft until the German capitulation in May 1945. It was the largest of the deployed combat Army Air Forces in numbers of personnel, aircraft, and equipment.\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131991), 8 AF was one of three Numbered Air Forces of the United States Air Force's [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), with a three-star general headquartered at [[Westover AFB]], [[Massachusetts]] commanding USAF strategic bombers and missiles on a global scale. Elements of 8 AF engaged in combat operations during the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953); [[Vietnam War]] (1961\u20131975), as well as [[Operation Desert Storm]] (1990\u20131991) over Iraq and occupied Kuwait in the [[Gulf War|First Persian Gulf War]].\n\n==Overview==\nEighth Air Force is one of two active duty numbered air forces in Air Force Global Strike Command. Eighth Air Force, with headquarters at Barksdale AFB, in the [[Bossier City]] \u2013 [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], metro area, supports U.S. Strategic Command, and is designated as U.S. Strategic Command's Task Force 204, providing on-alert, combat-ready forces to the president. The mission of \"The Mighty Eighth\" is to safeguard America's interests through strategic deterrence and global combat power. Eighth Air Force controls long-range nuclear-capable bomber assets throughout the United States and overseas locations. Its flexible, conventional and nuclear deterrence mission provides the capability to deploy forces and engage enemy threats from home station or forward positioned, anywhere, any time. The 8th Air Force motto is \"Peace Through Strength.\"\n\nThe Eighth Air Force team consists of more than 16,000 Regular Air Force (e.g., active duty), [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve]] professionals operating and maintaining a variety of aircraft capable of deploying air power to any area of the world. This air power includes the heart of America's heavy bomber force, deploying the [[B-1 Lancer]], [[B-2 Spirit]] and the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. The Mighty Eighth's B-52 force consists of 76 bombers assigned to two active duty wings, the [[2d Bomb Wing]] at [[Barksdale AFB]], Louisiana and the [[5th Bomb Wing]] at [[Minot AFB]], North Dakota, and one reserve wing, the [[307th Bomb Wing]] at [[Barksdale AFB]], Louisiana. The B-2 force consists of 20 bombers assigned to the active duty [[509th Bomb Wing]] along with the [[Missouri Air National Guard]]'s associate [[131st Bomb Wing]] at [[Whiteman AFB]], Missouri. The B-1 force consists of 62 bombers assigned to the active duty [[7th Bomb Wing]] at [[Dyess AFB]], Texas and the [[28th Bomb Wing]] at [[Ellsworth AFB]], South Dakota.  The 131st Bomb Wing is operationally-gained by AFGSC and 8 AF from the [[Air National Guard]], while the 307th Bomb Wing is operationally-gained from [[Air Force Reserve Command]] and [[10th Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.8af.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=17064|title=Factsheets : Eighth Air Force|website=|publisher=8af.af.mil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193045/http://www.8af.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=17064|archive-date=3 March 2016|access-date=|accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104500/b-1b-lancer/|title=B-1B Lancer}}</ref>\n\nMajor General James Dawkins Jr. was named Commander of 8th Air Force on 20 August 2018, after having served as the Deputy Director for Nuclear, Homeland Defense, and Current Operations on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.\n\n==History==\n:''For additional history and lineage, see [[United States Air Forces in Europe]]''\n\nEighth Air Force was established as VIII Bomber Command on 19 January 1942 and activated at [[Langley Field]], Virginia on 1 February.  It was reassigned to Savannah Air Base, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on 10 February 1942. An advanced detachment of VIII Bomber Command was established at [[RAF Bomber Command]] Headquarters at [[RAF Daws Hill]] England on 23 February in preparation for its units to arrive in the United Kingdom from the United States. The first combat group of VIII Bomber Command to arrive in the United Kingdom was the ground echelon of the [[97th Bombardment Group]], which arrived at [[RAF Polebrook]] on 9 June 1942.\n\n===Start of offensive operations against Nazi-occupied territory===\n\nRegular combat operations by the VIII Bomber Command began on 17 August 1942, when the 97th Bombardment Group flew 12 B-17Es on the first VIII Bomber Command heavy bomber mission of the war from RAF Polebrook, attacking the [[Rouen]]-Sotteville [[marshalling yard]]s in France.\n\n[[File:B-17 Flying Fortress.jpg|thumb|right|B-17 Flying Fortresses Over Europe during World War II]]\nDuring World War II, the offensive air forces of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) came to be classified as strategic or tactical. A strategic air force was that with a mission to attack an enemy's war effort beyond his front-line forces, predominantly production and supply facilities, whereas a tactical air force supported ground campaigns, usually with objectives selected through co-operation with the armies.\n\nIn Europe, Eighth Air Force was the first USAAF strategic air force, with a mission to support an invasion of continental Europe from the British Isles. Eighth Air Force carried out strategic daytime strategic bombing operations in Western Europe from [[airfield]]s in eastern England.\n\n===World War II (1944\u20131945)===\n[[File:Eighth_Air_Force_-_Emblem_(World_War_II).png|left|125px]]\n[[File:Living Legends.jpg|thumb|[[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es from the [[398th Air Expeditionary Group|398th Bombardment Group]] fly a bombing run to [[Neum\u00fcnster]], Germany, on 13 April 1945. On 8 May, Germany surrendered, and [[Victory in Europe Day]] was declared.]]\n{{ external media\n| align  = right\n| width  = \n| video1 = {{YouTube|V9klkEF7Y7g&t|Target For Today \u2013 1943 VIII Bomber Command film}}\n}}\nOn 4 January 1944, the B-24s and B-17s based in England flew their last mission as a subordinate part of VIII Bomber Command. On 22 February 1944, a massive reorganization of American airpower took place in Europe. The original Eighth Air Force was redesignated as the [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF).  VIII Bomber Command, redesignated as Eighth Air Force, and [[Ninth Air Force]] were assigned to (USSTAF).\n\nVIII Bomber Command, after redesignation as Eighth Air Force, was assigned VIII Fighter and VIII Air Support Commands under its command. This is from where the present-day Eighth Air Force's history, lineage and honors derive.\n\nGeneral [[Carl Spaatz]] returned to England to command the USSTAF. Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle]] relinquished command of the Fifteenth Air Force to Major General [[Nathan F. Twining]] and took over command of the Eighth Air Force from [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Ira C. Eaker]] at [[RAF Daws Hill]]. Doolittle was well known to American airmen as the famous \"Tokyo Raider\" and former air racer. His directive was simple: 'Win the air war and isolate the battlefield'.\n\nSpaatz and Doolittle's plan was to use the US Strategic Air Forces in a series of co-ordinated raids, code-named Operation 'Argument' and supported by RAF night bombing, on the German aircraft industry at the earliest possible date.\n\n====Big Week====\nCold and clear weather was predicted for the last week of February 1944 and Operation Argument became known as \"[[Big Week]]\". On the night of 19\u201320 February, the RAF [[Bombing of Leipzig in World War II|bombed Leipzig]]. Eighth Air Force put up over 1,000 B-17s and B-24s and over 800 fighters and the RAF provided sixteen squadrons of [[P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. In all, twelve aircraft factories were attacked, with the B-17s heading to Leipzig (Allgemeine Transportanlagen-Gesellschaft \u2013 [[Junkers Ju 88]] production and Erla Maschinenwerk \u2013 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]]), [[Bernburg]]-Strenzfeld ([[Junkers]] [[Ju 88]] plant) and [[Oschersleben]] ([[AGO Flugzeugwerke|AGO]] plant making Focke-Wulf [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190A]] fighters), while the B-24s hitting the [[Gothaer Waggonfabrik]] (production of [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]), the Fw 190 [[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]] plant at [[Tutow]] and the [[Heinkel]] firm's ''\"Heinkel-Nord\"'' headquarters at [[Rostock]] (production of [[Heinkel He 111|He 111]]). As a contrast, the Luftwaffe was undertaking the [[Operation Steinbock#20/21 February|sixth major raid of the \"Baby Blitz\"]] the following night (20/21 February), with only some 165 German aircraft sortieing against British targets.\n\nThe raids on the German aircraft industry comprising much of \"Big Week\" caused so much damage that the Germans were forced to disperse aircraft manufacturing eastward, to safer parts of the Reich.\n\nThe next day, over 900 bombers and 700 fighters of Eighth Air Force hit more aircraft factories in the [[Braunschweig]] area. Over 60 [[Luftwaffe]] fighters were shot down with a loss of 19 US bombers and 5 US fighters. On 24 February, with the weather clearing over central Germany, Eighth Air Force sent over 800 bombers, hitting [[Schweinfurt]] and attacks on the Baltic coast, with a total of 11 B-17s being lost. Some 230 B-24s hit the Messerschmitt Bf 110 assembly plant at [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] with a loss of 24 aircraft.\n\nOn 22 February 1944, due to many mistakes, Nijmegen was bombarded by 12 aircraft of the 446th Bomb Group and 2 aircraft of the 453rd. They did not realize that they were above Dutch ground. 850 civilians, including children on their way to school, were among the casualties.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nOn 25 February, both Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces hit numerous targets at [[F\u00fcrth]] airfield, [[Augsburg]] and [[Regensburg]], attacking Messerschmitt Bf 110 and [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]] plants. The 8th lost 31 bombers, the 15th lost 33.\n\n====Berlin====\n[[File:Molesw-hellsangels.jpg|thumb|Aircraft and ground crew of Boeing B-17F-25-BO Fortress \"Hell's Angels\" (AAF Ser. No. ''41-24577'') of the 358th Bomb Squadron, 303d Bomb Group, RAF Molesworth. This was first B-17 to complete 25 combat missions in the 8th Air Force, on 13 May 1943. After completing 48 missions, the aircraft returned to the U.S. on 20 January 1944, for a publicity tour]]\n\nLess than a week after \"Big Week\", Eighth Air Force made its first attack on the Reich's capital, Berlin. The RAF had been making night raids on Berlin [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|since 1940]], (with [[Battle of Berlin (air)|heavy raids in 1943]]) and nuisance Mosquito raids in daylight, but this was the first major daylight bombing raid on the German capital. On 6 March 1944, over 700 heavy bombers along with 800 escort fighters of the Eighth Air Force hit numerous targets within Berlin, dropping the first American bombs on the capital of the [[Third Reich]]. On 8 March, another raid of 600 bombers and 200 fighters hit the Berlin area again, destroying the VKF ball-bearing plant at [[Erkner]]. The following day, on 9 March, [[H2X radar]]-equipped B-17s mounted a third attack on the Reich capital through clouds. Altogether, the Eighth Air Force dropped over 4,800 tons of high explosive on Berlin during the first week of March. The photograph shows housing destroyed by the RAF during night raids.\n\nOn 22 March, over 800 bombers, led by H2X radar equipped bombers hit Berlin yet again, bombing targets though a thick rainy overcast causing more destruction to various industries. Because of the thick clouds and rain over the area the Luftwaffe did not attack the American bomber fleet, as the Germans believed that because of the weather the American bombers would be incapable of attacking their targets. Even so, the \"pathfinder\" bombers of the [[RAF Alconbury]]-based 482d Bomb Group proved very capable of finding the targets and guiding the bombers to them.\n\n====Prelude to Overlord====\nIn a prelude to the invasion of France, American air attacks began in February 1944 against railroad junctions, airfields, ports and bridges in northern France and along the [[English Channel]] coastline. Fighters from both Eighth and Ninth Air Forces made wide sweeps over the area, mounting strafing missions at airfields and rail networks. By 6 June, Allied fighter pilots had succeeded in damaging or destroying hundreds of locomotives, thousands of motorized vehicles, and many bridges. In addition, German airfields in France and Belgium were attacked.\n\nOn 1 May, over 1,300 Eighth Air Force heavy bombers made an all-out attack on the enemy's rail network, striking at targets in France and Belgium. On 7 May, another 1,000 bombers hit additional targets along the English Channel coast, hitting fortifications, bridges and marshaling areas.\n\nOn D-Day, over 2,300 sorties were flown by Eighth Air Force heavy bombers in the [[Normandy]] and [[Cherbourg]] invasion areas, all aimed at neutralizing enemy coastal defenses and front-line troops.\n\n====Defeat of the Luftwaffe====\n[[File:Bott4.jpg|thumb|North American P-51 Mustangs of the 375th Fighter Squadron, 361st FG, summer 1944]]\n[[File:Destroyed-FW-190.jpg|thumb|Destroyed Luftwaffe Fw 190, 1945]]\n\nThe [[P-51 Mustang]] first entered squadron service in Europe with the British in early 1942; the [[Allison V-1710]] engined P-51A (Mustang I) having much success with the RAF, although it found the aircraft's performance inadequate at higher altitudes. [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] engineers rapidly realized that [[North American Mustang X|equipping the Mustang with a Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine with its two speed, two stage supercharger would substantially improve performance. Also, by using a four-bladed propeller, rather than the three-bladed one used on the P-51A, the performance was greatly improved; the XP-51B achieved a level speed of 441&nbsp;mph at {{convert|29800|ft|m}}, over 100&nbsp;mph faster than the Allison-engined P-51A at that altitude. At all heights, the rate of climb was approximately doubled.\n\nThe USAAF now finally had an aircraft that could compete on equal terms with the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and the later models of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. The USAAF was finally fully sold on the Mustang, and a letter contract for 2200 P-51Bs was issued. The engine was to be the [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650-3]], based on the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin 68]].\n\nIn late 1943, the P-51B Mustang was introduced to the [[European Theater]] by the USAAF. It could fly as far on its internal fuel tanks as the P-47 could with drop tanks. However, the P-51B was introduced as a tactical fighter, so the first deliveries of the P-51B in November 1943 were assigned to three groups in the tactical [[Ninth Air Force]] at the expense of [[VIII Bomber Command]], whose need for a long range escort fighter was critical. The first escort mission for the bombers was not flown until 5 December.\n\nAs the new commander of the Eighth Air Force from January 1944 onwards, Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle]]'s major influence on the European air war occurred early that year when he made a critical change to the policy requiring escorting fighters to remain with the bombers at all times. With Doolittle's permission, American fighter pilots on bomber defense missions would primarily be flying far ahead of the bombers' [[combat box]] formations in [[air supremacy]] mode, literally \"clearing the skies\" of any [[Luftwaffe]] fighter opposition heading towards the target. This strategy fatally disabled the twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' [[heavy fighter]] wings and their replacement, single-engined ''Sturmgruppen'' of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavily armed Fw 190As]], clearing each force of [[bomber destroyer]]s in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. As part of this game-changing strategy, especially after the bombers had hit their targets, the USAAF's fighters were then free to strafe German airfields and transport while returning to base, contributing significantly to the achievement of air superiority by Allied air forces over Europe.\n\nThe effect of the Mustangs, fully operating as an air supremacy fighter force, on the Luftwaffe defenders was arguably swift and decisive. The result was that the Luftwaffe was notable by its absence over the skies of Europe after [[D-Day]] and the Allies were starting to achieve air superiority over the continent. Although the Luftwaffe could, and did, mount effective attacks on the ever-larger formations of Allied heavy bombers, the sheer numbers of B-17s and B-24s attacking enemy targets was overwhelming the German fighter force, which simply could not sustain the losses the Eighth Air Force bombers and fighters were inflicting on it.  In order to quickly assemble these formations, specially outfitted [[assembly ships]] were created from older bombers.\n\nBy mid-1944, Eighth Air Force had reached a total strength of more than 200,000 people (it is estimated that more than 350,000 Americans served in Eighth Air Force during the war in Europe). At peak strength, Eighth Air Force had forty heavy bomber groups, fifteen fighter groups, and four specialized support groups. It could, and often did, dispatch more than 2,000 four-engine bombers and more than 1,000 fighters on a single mission to multiple targets.\n\nBy 1945, all but one of the Eighth Air Force fighter groups were equipped with the P-51D.\n\n====Destroying the German oil industry====\n{{main|Oil Campaign of World War II}}\n\nEighth Air Force did not strike at oil industry targets until 13 May 1944 when 749 bombers, escorted by almost 740 fighters, pounded oil targets in the [[Leipzig]] area and at [[Brux (city)|Brux]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. At the same time, a smaller force hit an [[Fw 190]] repair depot at [[Zwickau]]. Over 300 German fighters attacked the bomber forces, losing almost half its aircraft, with claims of upwards of 47 ''Luftwaffe'' fighters by American fighter pilots. However, the [[Luftwaffe]] was successful in shooting down 46 bombers in a very unequal fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/may44.htm|title=Combat Chronology of the US Army Air Forces - May 1944|publisher=usaaf.net|accessdate=13 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606084013/http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/may44.htm|archivedate=6 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[D-Day]], attacks on the German oil industry assumed top priority which was widely dispersed around the Reich. Vast fleets of B-24s and B-17s escorted by P-51Ds and long-range P-38Ls hit refineries in Germany and [[Czechoslovakia]] in late 1944 and early 1945. Having almost total air superiority throughout the collapsing German Reich, Eighth Air Force hit targets as far east as Hungary, while [[Fifteenth Air Force]] hit oil industry facilities in [[Yugoslavia]], Romania, and northeastern Italy. On at least eighteen occasions, the Merseburg refineries in [[Leuna]], where the majority of Germany's synthetic fuel for jet aircraft was refined, was hit. By the end of 1944, only three out of ninety-one refineries in the Reich were still working normally, twenty-nine were partially functional, and the remainder were completely destroyed.\n\n====Casualties and awards====\nThese missions, however, carried a high price. Half of the U.S. Army Air Forces' casualties in World War II were suffered by Eighth Air Force (more than 47,000 casualties, with more than 26,000 dead). Seventeen [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] went to Eighth Air Force personnel during the war. By war's end, they had been awarded a number of other medals to include 220 [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Crosses]], and 442,000 [[Air Medal]]s. Many more awards were made to Eighth Air Force veterans after the war that remain uncounted. There were 261 fighter aces in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. Thirty-one of these aces had 15 or more aircraft kills apiece. Another 305 enlisted gunners were also recognized as aces.\n\nOne notable Eighth Air Force casualty was Brigadier General Arthur W. Vanaman, Chief of Intelligence, who was captured by the Germans near Aveluy, France, on 27 June 1944, becoming the highest-ranked American POW of the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Donald |title=Masters of the Air: America's Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany |date=2007}}</ref>\n\n====Victory in Europe====\nIn January 1945, the [[Luftwaffe]] attempted one last major air offensive against the Allied Air Forces. Over 950 fighters had been sent west from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for [[Unternehmen Bodenplatte|\"Operation Bodenplatte\"]]. On 1 January, the entire German fighter force in the West, comprising combat aircraft from some eleven ''[[Jagdgeschwader]]'' day fighter wings, took off and attacked 27 Allied airfields in northern France, Belgium and the southern part of the [[Netherlands]] in an attempt by the Luftwaffe to cripple [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces in the [[Low Countries]] of Europe. It was a last-ditch effort to keep up the momentum of the German forces during the stagnant stage of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] ([[Battle of the Bulge|''Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein'']]). The operation was a pyrrhic success for the ''Luftwaffe'' as the losses suffered by the German air arm were irreplaceable and over 300 Luftwaffe aircraft were shot down, mostly by Allied anti-aircraft guns. The losses of the Allied Air Forces were replaced within weeks. The operation failed to achieve [[air superiority]], even temporarily, and the German Army continued to be exposed to air attack.\n\nFirst seen by Allied airmen during the late summer of 1944, it wasn't until March 1945 that German [[jet aircraft]] started to attack Allied bomber formations in earnest. On 2 March, when Eighth Air Force bombers were dispatched to attack the synthetic oil refineries at [[Leipzig]], [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]As attacked the formation near [[Dresden]]. The next day, the largest formation of German jets ever seen, most likely from the Luftwaffe's specialist 7th Fighter Wing, ''[[Jagdgeschwader 7]]'' ''Nowotny'', made attacks on Eighth Air Force bomber formations over Dresden and the oil targets at [[Essen]], shooting down a total of three bombers.\n\nHowever, the Luftwaffe jets were simply too few and too late to have any serious effect on the Allied air armadas now sweeping over the Reich with near-impunity. A lack of fuel and available pilots for the new jets greatly reduced their effectiveness. The Me 262A was a difficult foe for the P-47s and P-51s, possessing a distinct speed advantage. Allied bomber escort fighters would fly high above the bombers \u2013 diving from this height gave them extra speed, thus reducing the speed difference. The Me 262 was also less maneuverable than the P-51 and so trained Allied pilots could turn tighter than an Me 262A. However, the only reliable way of dealing with the jets, as with the even faster Me 163B Komet rocket fighters, was to attack them on the ground and during takeoff and landing. Luftwaffe airfields that were identified as jet and rocket bases, such as [[Parchim]] and [[Bad Zwischenahn]], were frequently bombed, and Allied fighters patrolled over the fields to attack jets trying to land. The Luftwaffe countered by installing flak alleys along the approach lines in order to protect the Me 262s from the ground and providing top cover with conventional fighters during takeoff and landing. Nevertheless, in March and April 1945, Allied fighter patrol patterns over Me 262 airfields resulted in numerous losses of jets and serious attrition of the force.\n\nOn 7 April 1945, the Luftwaffe flew its most desperate and deadliest mission, with the dedicated aerial ramming unit ''[[Sonderkommando Elbe]]''. This operation involved German pilots of the unit ramming their worn-out Bf 109Gs, each barely armed with only one MG 131 heavy machine gun and 50 rounds of ammunition, into American bombers in order to get the Allies to suspend bombing raids long enough for the Germans to make a significant amount of Me 262A jet fighters. The 8th Air Force was targeted in this operation. Fifteen Allied bombers were attacked, eight were successfully destroyed.\n\n[[File:Berlin-1945.jpg|thumb|Destroyed Berlin, Germany, May 1945]]\nOn 7 April, Eighth Air Force dispatched thirty-two B-17 and B-24 groups and fourteen Mustang groups (the sheer numbers of attacking Allied aircraft were so large in 1945 that they were now counted by the group) to targets in the small area of Germany still controlled by the Nazis, hitting the remaining airfields where the Luftwaffe jets were stationed. In addition, almost 300 German aircraft of all types were destroyed in strafing attacks. On 16 April, this record was broken when over 700 German aircraft were destroyed on the ground.\n\nThe end came on 25 April 1945 when Eighth Air Force flew its last full-scale mission of the European War. B-17s hit the Skoda armaments factory at [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]] in Czechoslovakia, while B-24s bombed rail complexes surrounding [[Hitler]]'s mountain retreat at [[Berchtesgaden]].\n\n====Pacific Theater====\nFollowing the end of the war in Europe in May 1945 plans were made to transfer some of the B-17/B-24 heavy bomber groups of Eighth Air Force to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] and upgrade them to [[B-29 Superfortress]] Very Heavy (VH) bomb groups. As part of this plan, Eighth Air Force headquarters was reassigned to [[Kadena Air Base|Sakugawa (Kadena Airfield)]], [[Okinawa]], on 16 July 1945, being assigned to the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific]] without personnel or equipment.<ref name=\"usafhra1\">{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/219/137.xml|title=USAF Historical Research Agency Document 00219137}}</ref>\n\nOn Okinawa, Eighth Air Force derived its headquarters personnel from the inactivated [[XX Bomber Command]], and [[Jimmy Doolittle|Lieutenant General James H. Doolittle]] assumed command, being reassigned from England on 19 July. The command controlled three airfields on Okinawa, [[Bolo Airfield|Bolo]], [[Marine Corps Air Station Futenma|Futema]], and [[Kadena Air Base|Kadena Airfield]]. The Eighth received its first B-29 Superfortress on 8 August 1945.<ref name=\"usafhra1\"/>\n\nEighth Air Force's mission in the Pacific was initially to organize and train new bomber groups for combat against Japan. In the planned [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]], the mission of Eighth Air Force would be to conduct [[B-29 Superfortress]] raids from Okinawa in coordination with [[Twentieth Air Force]] operating from airfields in the [[Mariana Islands]].<ref name=\"usafhra1\"/>\n\nUnits assigned to Eighth Air Force in the Pacific were:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* Headquarters, [[301st Fighter Wing (World War II)|301st Fighter Wing]]\n: [[Ie Shima Airfield]], [[Okinawa]], 31 July \u2013 29 November 1945\n: [[318th Fighter Group]] ([[P-47|P-47N Thunderbolt]])\n:: [[Ie Shima Airfield]], [[Okinawa]], 31 July \u2013 29 November 1945\n: [[413th Fighter Group]] ([[P-47|P-47N Thunderbolt]])\n:: [[Ie Shima Airfield]], [[Okinawa]], 31 July \u2013 29 November 1945\n: [[507th Air Refueling Wing|507th Fighter Group]] ([[P-47|P-47N Thunderbolt]])\n:: [[Ie Shima Airfield]], [[Okinawa]], 31 July \u2013 29 January 1946\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* Headquarters, [[316th Air Division|316th Bombardment Wing]]\n: [[Kadena Air Base|Kadena Airfield]] [[Okinawa]], 5 September 1945 \u2013 7 June 1946\n: [[22d Air Refueling Wing|22d Bombardment Group]], ([[B-29 Superfortress]])\n:: [[Kadena Air Base|Kadena Airfield]] [[Okinawa]], 15 August \u2013 23 November 1945\n: [[333d Bombardment Group]], ([[B-29 Superfortress]])\n:: [[Kadena Air Base|Kadena Airfield]], [[Okinawa]], 5 August 1945 \u2013 28 May 1946\n: [[346th Bombardment Group]], ([[B-29 Superfortress]])\n:: [[Kadena Air Base|Kadena Airfield]], [[Okinawa]], 7 August 1945 \u2013 30 June 1946\n: [[382d Bombardment Group]], ([[B-29 Superfortress]])\n:: [[Northwest Field (Guam)|Northwest Field]], [[Guam]], 8 September \u2013 16 December 1945\n:: Note: Only 420th Bombardment Squadron of group arrived with B-29 Aircraft, 464th and 872d Bomb Squadrons only ground echelons arrived.

Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance. -->]]\n[[File:1947 8th AF OC.gif|thumb|8th Air Force organizational chart, 1947]]\n\nWorld War II proved what the proponents of air power had been championing for the previous two decades\u2014the great value of strategic forces in bombing an enemy's industrial complex and of tactical forces in controlling the skies above a battlefield. As a result, Eighth Air Force was incorporated into the new [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).\n\nOn 7 June 1946, Headquarters Eighth Air Force was reassigned without personnel or equipment from Okinawa to [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill AAF]], Florida, becoming SAC's second numbered air force. At MacDill, Eighth Air Force headquarters were manned chiefly by personnel from the [[58th Air Division|58th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy]], stationed at [[Carswell AFB|Fort Worth AAF]], Texas. The organization reported administratively to the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] at [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], Colorado. That base assignment lasted until 1 November 1946, when SAC transferred the Eighth to Fort Worth (later renamed Carswell AFB).\n\n====Bomb units====\nBoth Davis-Monthan and Fort Worth Army Airfields were B-29 training bases during World War II, and the Eighth Air Force Bomb Groups were simply activated at the same field and on the same day as the original Army Air Force [[Continental Air Forces]] training bomb groups were inactivated. The assets of the former training units were simply assigned to Eighth Air Force. This was largely so that the Air Force could perpetuate the names of groups that had distinguished themselves in World War II.\n\nThese bomb wings were drastically undermanned and under equipped. At the close of 1946, they shared only a handful of operational bombers, all [[B-29 Superfortress]]es. Although there were many available which were returned from [[Twentieth Air Force]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] they were war-weary from the many long combat missions flown during the war. However, it was believed that a strong strategic air arm equipped with B-29s would deter a possible aggressor from attacking the United States for fear of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons.\n\nBy the late 1940s, the [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es and [[B-24 Liberator]]s used in the [[European Theater]] of the war were thoroughly obsolete as combat aircraft and were mostly sent to the smelters. A handful remained in service performing non-combat duties though the mid-1950s as air-sea rescue aircraft (SB-17, SB-24); photo-reconnaissance aircraft (RB-17, RB-24), and as unmanned target drones (QB-17) and their controllers (DB-17).\n\nInitially, Eighth Air Force under SAC consisted of the following:\n* [[Carswell Air Force Base|Fort Worth AAF]] (Later Carswell AFB), Texas\n: [[58th Air Division|58th Bombardment Wing (later Air Division)]]\n:: Reassigned from [[March AFB|March Field]], California 8 May 1946\n:: Reassigned to [[Andrews AFB]], Maryland 1 March 1948 (Inactivated 16 October 1948)\n: [[449th Air Expeditionary Group|449th Bombardment Group]]\n:: Reassigned from [[McCook Army Airfield|McCook AAF]], Nebraska December 1945 (McCook AAF Closed)\n:: Inactivated on 4 August 1946\n: 7th Bombardment Group\n:: Activated on 1 October 1946\n:: [[7th Bomb Wing|7th Bombardment Wing]] established on 17 November 1947. 7th Bomb Group assigned as subordinate unit.\n\nPersonnel and equipment from the inactivated 449th Bomb Group were reassigned to the 7th Bomb Group (later 7th Bomb Wing). The command staff and all personnel of the 58th Bomb wing were eliminated on 1 November 1946 and the organization was reduced to a paper unit. For two years, the wing remained in this status until the 58th Bomb Wing was inactivated on 16 October 1948.\n* [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base|Davis-Monthan AAF]] (Later Davis-Monthan Air Force Base), Arizona\n: [[40th Air Expeditionary Wing|40th Bombardment Group]]\n:: Reassigned from [[March AFB|March Field]], California, 8 May 1946\n:: Inactivated on 1 October 1946\n: [[444th Bombardment Group]]\n:: Reassigned from [[Castle AFB|Merced AAF]], California 6 May 1945\n:: Inactivated on 1 October 1946\n: [[43d Airlift Wing|43rd Bombardment Group]]\n:: Activated on 4 October 1946\n:: 43d Bombardment Wing established on 3 November 1947. 43d Bomb Group assigned as subordinate unit.\n\nPersonnel and equipment from the inactivated 40th and 444th Bomb Groups were reassigned to the 43d Bomb Group\n* [[Walker AFB|Roswell AAF]] (Later Walker Air Force Base), New Mexico\n: [[509th Composite Group|509th Bombardment Group]]\n:: Reassigned from North Field, [[Tinian]] on 8 November 1946\n:: [[509th Bombardment Wing]] established on 3 November 1947. 509th Bombardment Group assigned as subordinate unit.\n\nThe Eighth Air Force was specifically charged with the atomic mission; however, only the 509th Composite Group at [[Walker AFB|Roswell AAF]] had B-29s that had the capability to drop nuclear weapons \u2013 the 7th Bomb Group at Fort Worth AAF was modifying their aircraft to carry the atomic bomb.\n* [[Salina Municipal Airport|Smoky Hill AAF]] (Later Smoky Hill Air Force Base), Kansas Transferred from Fifteenth Air Force, 16 May 1948\n: [[301st Air Refueling Wing|301st Bombardment Wing]]\n: Reassigned to [[Barksdale AFB]], Louisiana, 1 August 1949.

In its early days, SAC had fighter wings for the escorting its aircraft equipped with the new [[North American F-82 Twin Mustang|F-82E Twin Mustang]] along with long range [[North American P-51 Mustang|F-51H Mustangs]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|F-47N Thunderbolts]], all of which were designed late in World War II for use in the planned invasion of Japan. SAC fighter wings assigned to Eighth Air Force were:\n* 27th Fighter Wing (F-82E Twin Mustang)\n: Activated at [[Kearney Regional Airport|Kearney AFB]], Nebraska on 27 July 1947\n: Reassigned to [[Bergstrom AFB]], Texas on 16 March 1949 (Base Closed)\n* 31st Fighter Wing (F-47N Thunderbolt)\n: Activated at [[Naval Air Station Albany#Turner Air Force Base (1947-66)|Turner AFB]], Georgia on 25 June 1947\n: Inactivated on 16 June 1952\n* 33d Fighter Wing (F-51H Mustang, [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|F-80C Shooting Star]])\n: Attached to 509th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, Walker AFB, New Mexico 17 November 1947\n: Reassigned to [[Otis AFB]], Massachusetts, 15 November 1948\n* 82d Fighter Wing (F-51D Mustang)\n: Activated at [[Grenier AFB]], New Hampshire on 12 April 1947\n: Inactivated 2 October 1949\n\nFighter escorts were no longer needed once SAC was equipped with [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] and then [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] jet bombers carrying nuclear bombs. As the nuclear weapons carried by the bombers were so powerful that only one plane was assigned to a target that might have previously needed a whole bomb group of aircraft. Although SAC fighter squadrons upgraded to [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]] jet fighters in the early 1950s, the new jet bombers flew so high and so fast there was little danger of them being intercepted by enemy fighters.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} By 1955, SAC no longer needed its fighters and these fighter units were transferred to [[Tactical Air Command]] and utilized in a tactical role.\n\nIn 1949, a realignment of responsibilities for SAC's two air forces occurred. [[Fifteenth Air Force]] was relocated to [[March AFB]], California. As part of this realignment, most SAC bomber forces west of the [[Mississippi River]] were reassigned to 15th AF. Those east of the Mississippi were assigned to SAC's other strategic air force, Eighth Air Force, which was reassigned to [[Westover AFB]], Massachusetts, where it commanded all SAC bases in the eastern United States.\n\nSeveral events in the late 1940s reversed the drawdown of United States strategic forces. The 1948 [[Berlin Blockade|blockade of West Berlin by the Eastern bloc]] and the outbreak of the [[Cold War]] caused the United States to deploy SAC's B-29 bomber force back to the United Kingdom and [[West Germany]]. Communist victories in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 and the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1950 meant that the United States would have to expand SAC to address these potential threats both in Europe as well as Asia.\n\nBy the time of the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, Eighth Air Force consisted of the following units:\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Carswell AFB]], Texas\n: 7th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper)\n: 11th Bombardment Wing (inactive) <!--:: Not activated until 16 February 1951 with B-36s -->\n* [[Biggs Army Airfield#Biggs Air Force Base (1947-66)|Biggs AFB]], Texas\n: 97th Bombardment Wing (B-29 Superfortress)\n* [[Davis-Monthan AFB]], Arizona\n: 43d Bombardment Wing (B-29, B-50 Superfortress)\n* [[Ellsworth AFB]], South Dakota\n: 28th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper)\n\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Walker AFB]], New Mexico\n: 6th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper)\n: 509th Bombardment Wing (B-29, B-50 Superfortress)\n* [[Hunter Army Airfield|Chatham AFB]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n: 2d Bombardment Wing (B-29, KB-50 Superfortress)\n* [[Bergstrom AFB]] Texas\n: 27th Fighter-Escort Wing (F-84 Thunderstreak)\n{{Col-end}}\n\n====Korean War====\nOn 25 June 1950, the armed forces of the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)]] invaded [[South Korea]]. On 27 June, the United Nations [[Security Council]] voted to assist the South Koreans in resisting the invasion. Although Eighth Air Force's strategic bomber force was not committed to combat in Korea, the Eighth deployed the [[27th Special Operations Wing|27th Fighter Escort Wing]] for combat action in Korea and earned numerous honors and awards for their combat record during the Korean War.\n\nOn 21 January 1951, Lt. Col. William Bertram, commander of the 523rd Fighter-Escort Squadron, shot down the first [[Mig-15|MiG-15]] for the wing and became the first F-84 pilot with a confirmed MiG kill. Two days later, on 23 January, the 27th FEW participated in the raid on [[Sinuiju Airport|Sinuju Airfield]] in [[North Korea]] and shot down four more MiG-15s. By the time the group rotated back to the United States, they had flown more than 23,000 combat hours in more than 12,000 sorties.\n\nFor its Korean War service, the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Distinguished Unit Citation]], covering the period of 26 January through 21 April 1951, for their actions in Korea.\n\nThe 27th was relieved of its duties supporting U.N. forces in Korea and returned to Bergstrom AFB on 31 July 1951, but was redeployed to [[Misawa Air Base|Misawa AB]], Japan during 6 October 1952 \u2013 13 February 1953 to provide air defense.\n\n====Cold War====\n[[File:Usaf-b-47-usafmuseum.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth Air Force Boeing B-47E-50-LM (S/N ''52-3363'') in flight]]\n[[File:8af-b52-kc135-usafmuseum.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth Air Force Boeing B-52D-70-BO (S/N ''56-0582'') being refueled by Boeing KC-135A-BN (S/N ''55-3127'')]]\n\nWith the end of fighting in Korea, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who had taken office in January 1953, called for a \"new look\" at national defense. The result: a greater reliance on [[nuclear weapon]]s and air power to deter war. His administration chose to invest in the Air Force, especially Strategic Air Command. The [[nuclear arms race]] shifted into high gear. The Air Force retired nearly all of its piston-engined B-29/B-50s and they were replaced by new Boeing [[B-47 Stratojet]] aircraft. By 1955 the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] would be entering the inventory in substantial numbers, as prop [[B-36]]s were phased out of heavy bombardment units rapidly.\n\nAlso after the deployment of forces to Far East Air Force to engage in combat over Korea, the history of Eighth Air Force becomes indistinguishable from that of [[Strategic Air Command]]. The Eighth's weapons inventory also changed to include [[KC-135]] air refuelers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (the Atlas, Titan I and Titan II, and all Minuteman models.)\n\nAt the same time, aerial refueling techniques were improved to the extent that Eighth Air Force bombers could still reach targets in Europe and Asia even if overseas bases were destroyed by an enemy attack. To reduce the risk to its bomber fleet in the United States, Eighth Air Force aircraft stood nuclear alert, providing a deterrent against an attack on the United States by the Soviet Union. It dispersed its planes to a large number of bases across the United States so as not to have too many concentrated at a single location.\n\n====Vietnam War====\nIn 1965, Eighth Air Force entered combat again, this time in Southeast Asia. At first, the Eighth deployed its B-52 bomber and KC-135 tanker units from the U.S. to operating bases in [[Guam]], [[Okinawa]] and [[Thailand]]. Then in April 1970, SAC moved the Eighth without personnel or equipment to [[Andersen AFB]] [[Guam]], absorbing resources of the 3d Air Division. At Anderson, the Eighth took over the direction of all bombing and refueling operations in Southeast Asia. The intensive bombing of [[Hanoi]] and [[Haiphong]] during 11 days in December 1972, known as [[Operation Linebacker II]], was but one highlight of those war years. Importantly, the Eighth's bombing effectiveness influenced the North Vietnamese to end hostilities. With the end of combat in Southeast Asia, the Eighth Air Force moved without personnel or equipment to [[Barksdale AFB]] Louisiana on 1 January 1975, absorbing the resources of Second Air Force.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Eighth participated in several key operations such as running the tanker task force for [[Operation Urgent Fury]] in 1983 and directing all air refueling operations for [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] in 1986 and [[Operation Just Cause]] in 1989.\n\n====Operations over Iraq====\nThe Eighth's units played a key role in the 42-day [[Gulf War]] in 1991. An Eighth Air Force unit, the 2d Bomb Wing, spearheaded the air campaign by dispatching B-52s from Barksdale to launch conventional air-launched cruise missiles against Iraqi targets. Eighth Air Force bomb wings, stationed in the Persian Gulf region, also attacked Iraq's Republican Guard forces and numerous key strategic targets, while other units provided air refueling and tactical reconnaissance throughout the conflict. As a headquarters, the Eighth had another important role in victory over Iraqi forces\u2014operating the logistics supply and air refueling bridge between the U.S. and gulf region.\n\n===History from June 1992===\n[[File:Air Combat Command.png|left|100px]]\n\nFifteen months after Operation Desert Storm, the Air Force reorganized. Eighth Air Force was relieved from assignment to Strategic Air Command and assigned to the new [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC) on 1 June 1992.\n\nUnder ACC, Eighth Air Force provides command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C2ISR); long-range attack; and information operations forces to Air Force components and warfighting commands. Eighth Air Force trains, tests, exercises and demonstrates combat-ready forces for rapid employment worldwide.\n\nEighth Air Force also provides conventional forces to U.S. Joint Forces Command and provides nuclear capable bombers, specified Global Strike assets, and C2ISR capabilities to U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM). Eighth Air Force also supports STRATCOM's Joint Force Headquarters \u2013 Information Operations and serves as the command element for Air Force wide computer network operations.\n\nUnder ACC, the Eighth received control over active duty, [[Air Force Reserve]], and [[Air National Guard]] units in the central U.S. and two overseas locations. Then in January 1994, ACC reorganized Eighth Air Force as a general purpose Numbered Air Force (NAF) with a warfighting mission to support the U.S. Joint Forces and U.S. Strategic Commands. Support to the latter command included the operation of Task Force 204 (bombers).\n\nSince 1994, the Eighth has participated in a string of contingency operations, such as the 1996 Operation \"Desert Strike\" against [[Iraq]], the 1998 Operation \"Desert Fox\" (similarly named but in no way associated with Field Marshal Erwin Rommel) against Iraq, which featured the [[B-1 Lancer|B-1B]] in its combat debut, and 1999 Operation \"Allied Force\" against the Federal Republic of [[Yugoslavia]], which involved the [[B-2 Spirit|B-2A Spirit]] in its first uncontested mission of aggression, which was officially designated \"combat\". The \"Allied Force\" campaign also marked the Eighth's return to Europe and the participation of U.S. bombers in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's ([[NATO]]) first combat operation. Altogether, the Eighth's bombers flew 325 sorties to drop over 7 million pounds of ordnance on a nation slightly smaller than the state of Colorado.\n\nIn 2000, the Air Force decided to integrate information operations into Eighth Air Force. The integration process started on 1 February 2001, when the Air Force realigned the Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) under ACC and assigned the 67th Information Operations Wing and the 70th Intelligence Wing to the Eighth. The reorganization transformed the Eighth into the only information operations and bomber NAF in the Air Force. For the Mighty Eighth, that change heralded an interesting future, one that bring further restructuring, different aircraft system purchases, and a new challenging mission to the NAF.\n\nWhile posturing itself for that mission change, the Eighth also supported [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Operation \"Enduring Freedom\"]] in which the Air Force operates against targets in [[Afghanistan]], and [[Operation Noble Eagle|\"NOBLE EAGLE\"]] for the defense of North American airspace.

Also the [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by him.\n\nIn the beginning of the twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was [[Albert Einstein]]'s (1905)<ref>Einstein 1905</ref> and [[Marian Smoluchowski]]'s (1906)<ref>Smoluchowski 1906</ref>\npapers on [[Brownian motion]], which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.\n\n==Assumptions==\nThe theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions:\n\n* The gas consists of very small particles known as molecules. This smallness of their size is such that the total [[volume]] of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the smallest open ball containing all the molecules. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their [[atomic radius|size]].\n* These particles have the same [[mass]].\n* The number of molecules is so large that statistical treatment can be applied.\n\n* The rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container. All these collisions are perfectly elastic. This means the molecules are considered to be perfectly spherical in shape and elastic in nature.\n* Except during collisions, the [[interaction]]s among molecules are negligible. (That is, they exert no [[force]]s on one another.) \n:This implies:\n::1. [[Special relativity|Relativistic]] effects are negligible.\n::2. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum-mechanical]] effects are negligible. This means that the [[mean inter-particle distance|inter-particle distance]] is much larger than the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] and the molecules are treated as [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[physical body|objects]].\n::3. Because of the above two, their dynamics can be treated classically. This means that the equations of motion of the molecules are time-reversible.\n\n* The average kinetic energy of the gas particles depends only on the [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] of the [[system]]. The kinetic theory has its own definition of temperature, not identical with the thermodynamic definition.\n* The elapsed time of a collision between a molecule and the container's wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions.\n* Because they have mass, gravity will accelerate molecules.  (If this were not the case then there would be no density gradient in a planet's troposphere and it would collapse to the surface.)\n\nMore modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the [[Boltzmann equation]]. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, [[molecular chaos]] and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as [[virial expansion]]s.\n\nAn important book on kinetic theory is that by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman]] and [[Thomas Cowling|Cowling]].<ref name=\"C & C\">[[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman, S.]], [[Cowling, T.G.]] (1939/1970).</ref> An important approach to the subject is called [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]].<ref>Kauzmann, W. (1966). ''Kinetic Theory of Gasses'', W.A. Benjamin, New York, pp. 232\u2013235.</ref> There have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.<ref>Grad 1949</ref>\nIn the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the [[Knudsen number]].\n\n==Equilibrium properties==\n=== {{anchor|Pressure and Kinetic Energy}}Pressure and kinetic energy===<!-- This section is linked from [[Pressure]] -->\nIn kinetic model of gases, the [[pressure]] is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface. Consider a gas of ''N'' molecules, each of mass ''m'', enclosed in a cube of volume ''V'' = ''L''<sup>3</sup>. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the ''x'' axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an [[elastic collision]]), the change in [[momentum]] is given by:\n\n:<math>\\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = p_{i,x} - (-p_{i,x}) = 2 p_{i,x} = 2 mv_x,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the momentum, ''i'' and ''f'' indicate initial and final momentum (before and after collision), ''x'' indicates that only the ''x'' direction is being considered, and ''v'' is the speed of the [[particle]] (which is the same before and after the collision).\n\nThe particle impacts one specific side wall once every\n\n:<math>\\Delta t = \\frac{2L}{v_x},</math>\n\nwhere ''L'' is the distance between opposite walls.\n\nThe [[force]] due to this particle is\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{m v_x^2}{L}.</math>\n\nThe total force on the wall is\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v_x^2}}{L},</math>\n\nwhere the bar denotes an average over the ''N'' particles.\n\nSince the motion of the particles is random and there is no bias applied in any direction, the average squared speed in each direction is identical:\n\n:<math>\\overline{v_x^2} = \\overline{v_y^2} = \\overline{v_z^2}.</math>\n\nBy [[Pythagorean theorem]] in three dimensions the total squared speed ''v'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\overline{v^2} = \\overline{v_x^2} + \\overline{v_y^2} + \\overline{v_z^2},</math>\n\n:<math>\\overline{v^2} = 3\\overline{v_x^2}.</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n:<math>\\overline{v_x^2} = \\frac{\\overline{v^2}}{3},</math>\n\nand the force can be written as:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v^2}}{3L}.</math>\n\nThis force is exerted on an area ''L''<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the pressure of the gas is\n\n:<math>P = \\frac{F}{L^2} = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v^2}}{3V},</math>\n\nwhere ''V'' = ''L''<sup>3</sup> is the volume of the box.\n\nIn terms of the kinetic energy of the gas ''K'':\n\n:<math>PV = \\frac{2}{3} \\times{K}.</math>\n\nThis is a first non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a [[macroscopic]] property, to the  (translational) [[kinetic energy]] of the molecules <math>N\\frac{1}{2} m\\overline{v^2}</math>, which is a [[microscopic]] property.\n\n===Temperature and kinetic energy===\n\nRewriting the above result for the pressure as <math>PV = {Nm\\overline{v^2}\\over 3} </math>, \nwe may combine it with the [[ideal gas law]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\displaystyle PV = N k_B T ,</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere <math>\\displaystyle k_B</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and <math>\\displaystyle T</math> the\n[[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute]] [[temperature]] defined by the ideal gas law, to obtain\n\n:<math>k_B T  =   {m\\overline{v^2}\\over 3} </math>,\n\nwhich leads to simplified expression of the average kinetic energy per molecule,<ref>The average kinetic energy of a fluid is proportional to the [[Root-mean-square speed|root mean-square velocity]], which always exceeds the mean velocity - [http://www.mikeblaber.org/oldwine/chm1045/notes/Gases/Kinetic/Gases08.htm Kinetic Molecular Theory]</ref>\n:<math>   \\displaystyle     \\frac {1} {2} m\\overline{v^2} =  \\frac {3} {2}  k_B T</math>.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the system is N times that of a molecule, namely <math> K= \\frac {1} {2} N m \\overline{v^2} </math>.\nThen the temperature <math>\\displaystyle T</math> takes the form\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>   \\displaystyle    T   =   {m\\overline{v^2}\\over 3 k_B}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nwhich becomes\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>   \\displaystyle    T   =   \\frac   {2}   {3}   \\frac   {K}   {N k_B}.</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\nEq.({{EquationNote|3}})\nis one important result of the kinetic\ntheory:\n''The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law's absolute temperature''.\nFrom Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and\nEq.({{EquationNote|3}}),\nwe have\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n   \\displaystyle \n   PV \n   =\n   \\frac\n   {2}\n   {3}\n   K.\n</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\nThus, the product of pressure and\nvolume per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] is proportional to the average\n(translational) molecular kinetic energy.\n\nEq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and Eq.({{EquationNote|4}})\nare called the \"classical results\",\nwhich could also be derived from [[statistical mechanics]];\nfor more details, see:<ref>\n[http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 Configuration integral (statistical mechanics)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193950/http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 |date=2012-04-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nSince there are\n<math>\\displaystyle 3N</math>\n[[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in a monatomic-gas system with\n<math>\\displaystyle N</math>\nparticles,\nthe kinetic energy per degree of freedom per molecule is\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n   \\displaystyle \n   \\frac\n   {K}\n   {3 N}\n   =\n   \\frac\n   {k_B T}\n   {2}\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\nIn the kinetic energy per degree of freedom,\nthe constant of proportionality of temperature\nis 1/2 times [[Boltzmann constant]] or R/2 per mole.

Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a [[Couette flow]] where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force F. The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component <math>u</math> which increase uniformly with distance <math>y</math> above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution]] of molecular motions.\n\nLet <math> \\sigma </math> be the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among gas particles|cross section]] of one molecule colliding with another. The number density <math> n </math> is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume <math> n = N/V </math>. The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is <math> n \\sigma </math>, and it is related to the [[Mean free path#Kinetic theory|mean free path]] <math>l</math> by \n\n<math> \\quad l = \\frac {1} {\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma} </math>\n\nNotice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume <math> n \\sigma </math> is reciprocal of length. The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision.\n\nLet <math> u_{0} </math> be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area <math>dA</math> on one side of the gas layer, with speed <math>v</math> at angle <math>\\theta</math> from the normal, in time interval <math>dt</math> is \n\n<math> \\quad nv\\cos{\\theta}dAdt{\\times}\\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi k_BT}\\right)^{3/2}\\,  e^{- \\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} (v^2\\sin{\\theta}dv{d\\theta}d\\phi)</math>\n\nThese molecules made their last collision at a distance <math>l\\cos \\theta</math> above and below the gas layer, and each will contribute a forward momentum of\n\n<math> \\quad p_{x}^{\\pm} = m \\left( u_{0} \\pm l \\cos \\theta {d u \\over dy} \\right), </math>\n\nwhere plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below.

We note that\n\n<math> \\quad k_{B} \\cdot N_{A} = R \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M = m \\cdot N_{A} </math>\n\nand insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation for [[Viscosity models for mixtures#Dilute gas limit and scaled variables|shear viscosity for dilute gases]]:\n\n<math> \\quad \\eta_{0} = \\frac {2} {3 \\sqrt{\\pi} } \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{m k_{B} T}} { \\sigma } \n= \\frac {2} {3 \\sqrt{\\pi} } \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{MRT}} { \\sigma \\cdot N_{A} } </math>\n\nand <math> M </math> is the [[molar mass]]. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by\n\n<math> \\quad \\sigma = \\pi \\left( 2 r \\right)^2 = \\pi d^2 </math>\n\nThe radius <math>r</math> is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter <math>d</math> is called collision cross section diameter or [[kinetic diameter]] of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among particles|cross section]] and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] or [[Morse potential]] which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. [[Mean free path#Mean free path in kinetic theory|The radius for zero  Lennard-Jones potential]] is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.\n\n===Thermal conductivity and heat flux===\n{{See also|Thermal conductivity}}Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for [[thermal conductivity]]<ref name=\"Sears1975\" /> of a dilute gas: \n\nConsider two parallel plates separated by a gas layer.

The model describes a gas as a large number of identical submicroscopic [[particle]]s ([[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s), all of which are in constant, rapid, [[randomness|random]] [[motion (physics)|motion]]. Their size is assumed to be much smaller than the average distance between the particles. The particles undergo random [[elastic collision]]s between themselves and with the enclosing walls of the container. The basic version of the model describes the [[ideal gas]], and considers no other interactions between the particles and, thus, the nature of kinetic energy transfers during collisions is strictly thermal.\n\nThe kinetic theory of gases explains the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] properties of gases, such as volume, pressure, and temperature, as well as [[Transport phenomena|transport properties]] such as [[viscosity]], [[thermal conductivity]] and [[mass diffusivity]]. The model also accounts for related phenomena, such as [[Brownian motion]].\n\n==History==\nIn approximately 50 [[before common era|BCE]], the Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]] proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=J.

The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because [[conservation of energy]] had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.<ref name=\"PonomarevKurchatov1993\">{{cite book|title=The Quantum Dice|author1=L.I Ponomarev|author2=I.V Kurchatov|date=1 January 1993|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0251-7}}</ref>{{rp|36\u201337}}\n\nOther pioneers of the kinetic theory (which were neglected by their contemporaries) were [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1747),<ref>Lomonosov 1758</ref> [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (ca. 1780, published 1818),<ref>Le Sage 1780/1818</ref> [[John Herapath]] (1816)<ref>Herapath 1816, 1821</ref> and [[John James Waterston]] (1843),<ref>Waterston 1843</ref> which connected their research with the development of [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]].

Also the [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by him.\n\nIn the beginning of the twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was [[Albert Einstein]]'s (1905)<ref>Einstein 1905</ref> and [[Marian Smoluchowski]]'s (1906)<ref>Smoluchowski 1906</ref>\npapers on [[Brownian motion]], which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.\n\n==Assumptions==\nThe theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions:\n\n* The gas consists of very small particles known as molecules. This smallness of their size is such that the total [[volume]] of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the smallest open ball containing all the molecules. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their [[atomic radius|size]].\n* These particles have the same [[mass]].\n* The number of molecules is so large that statistical treatment can be applied.\n\n* The rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container. All these collisions are perfectly elastic. This means the molecules are considered to be perfectly spherical in shape and elastic in nature.\n* Except during collisions, the [[interaction]]s among molecules are negligible. (That is, they exert no [[force]]s on one another.) \n:This implies:\n::1. [[Special relativity|Relativistic]] effects are negligible.\n::2. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum-mechanical]] effects are negligible. This means that the [[mean inter-particle distance|inter-particle distance]] is much larger than the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] and the molecules are treated as [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[physical body|objects]].\n::3. Because of the above two, their dynamics can be treated classically. This means that the equations of motion of the molecules are time-reversible.\n\n* The average kinetic energy of the gas particles depends only on the [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] of the [[system]]. The kinetic theory has its own definition of temperature, not identical with the thermodynamic definition.\n* The elapsed time of a collision between a molecule and the container's wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions.\n* Because they have mass, gravity will accelerate molecules.  (If this were not the case then there would be no density gradient in a planet's troposphere and it would collapse to the surface.)\n\nMore modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the [[Boltzmann equation]]. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, [[molecular chaos]] and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as [[virial expansion]]s.\n\nAn important book on kinetic theory is that by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman]] and [[Thomas Cowling|Cowling]].<ref name=\"C & C\">[[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman, S.]], [[Cowling, T.G.]] (1939/1970).</ref> An important approach to the subject is called [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]].<ref>Kauzmann, W. (1966). ''Kinetic Theory of Gasses'', W.A. Benjamin, New York, pp. 232\u2013235.</ref> There have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.<ref>Grad 1949</ref>\nIn the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the [[Knudsen number]].\n\n==Equilibrium properties==\n=== {{anchor|Pressure and Kinetic Energy}}Pressure and kinetic energy===<!-- This section is linked from [[Pressure]] -->\nIn kinetic model of gases, the [[pressure]] is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface. Consider a gas of ''N'' molecules, each of mass ''m'', enclosed in a cube of volume ''V'' = ''L''<sup>3</sup>. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the ''x'' axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an [[elastic collision]]), the change in [[momentum]] is given by:\n\n:<math>\\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = p_{i,x} - (-p_{i,x}) = 2 p_{i,x} = 2 mv_x,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the momentum, ''i'' and ''f'' indicate initial and final momentum (before and after collision), ''x'' indicates that only the ''x'' direction is being considered, and ''v'' is the speed of the [[particle]] (which is the same before and after the collision).\n\nThe particle impacts one specific side wall once every\n\n:<math>\\Delta t = \\frac{2L}{v_x},</math>\n\nwhere ''L'' is the distance between opposite walls.\n\nThe [[force]] due to this particle is\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{m v_x^2}{L}.</math>\n\nThe total force on the wall is\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v_x^2}}{L},</math>\n\nwhere the bar denotes an average over the ''N'' particles.\n\nSince the motion of the particles is random and there is no bias applied in any direction, the average squared speed in each direction is identical:\n\n:<math>\\overline{v_x^2} = \\overline{v_y^2} = \\overline{v_z^2}.</math>\n\nBy [[Pythagorean theorem]] in three dimensions the total squared speed ''v'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\overline{v^2} = \\overline{v_x^2} + \\overline{v_y^2} + \\overline{v_z^2},</math>\n\n:<math>\\overline{v^2} = 3\\overline{v_x^2}.</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n:<math>\\overline{v_x^2} = \\frac{\\overline{v^2}}{3},</math>\n\nand the force can be written as:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v^2}}{3L}.</math>\n\nThis force is exerted on an area ''L''<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the pressure of the gas is\n\n:<math>P = \\frac{F}{L^2} = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v^2}}{3V},</math>\n\nwhere ''V'' = ''L''<sup>3</sup> is the volume of the box.\n\nIn terms of the kinetic energy of the gas ''K'':\n\n:<math>PV = \\frac{2}{3} \\times{K}.</math>\n\nThis is a first non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a [[macroscopic]] property, to the  (translational) [[kinetic energy]] of the molecules <math>N\\frac{1}{2} m\\overline{v^2}</math>, which is a [[microscopic]] property.\n\n===Temperature and kinetic energy===\n\nRewriting the above result for the pressure as <math>PV = {Nm\\overline{v^2}\\over 3} </math>, \nwe may combine it with the [[ideal gas law]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\displaystyle PV = N k_B T ,</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere <math>\\displaystyle k_B</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and <math>\\displaystyle T</math> the\n[[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute]] [[temperature]] defined by the ideal gas law, to obtain\n\n:<math>k_B T  =   {m\\overline{v^2}\\over 3} </math>,\n\nwhich leads to simplified expression of the average kinetic energy per molecule,<ref>The average kinetic energy of a fluid is proportional to the [[Root-mean-square speed|root mean-square velocity]], which always exceeds the mean velocity - [http://www.mikeblaber.org/oldwine/chm1045/notes/Gases/Kinetic/Gases08.htm Kinetic Molecular Theory]</ref>\n:<math>   \\displaystyle     \\frac {1} {2} m\\overline{v^2} =  \\frac {3} {2}  k_B T</math>.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the system is N times that of a molecule, namely <math> K= \\frac {1} {2} N m \\overline{v^2} </math>.\nThen the temperature <math>\\displaystyle T</math> takes the form\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>   \\displaystyle    T   =   {m\\overline{v^2}\\over 3 k_B}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nwhich becomes\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>   \\displaystyle    T   =   \\frac   {2}   {3}   \\frac   {K}   {N k_B}.</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\nEq.({{EquationNote|3}})\nis one important result of the kinetic\ntheory:\n''The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law's absolute temperature''.\nFrom Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and\nEq.({{EquationNote|3}}),\nwe have\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n   \\displaystyle \n   PV \n   =\n   \\frac\n   {2}\n   {3}\n   K.\n</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\nThus, the product of pressure and\nvolume per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] is proportional to the average\n(translational) molecular kinetic energy.\n\nEq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and Eq.({{EquationNote|4}})\nare called the \"classical results\",\nwhich could also be derived from [[statistical mechanics]];\nfor more details, see:<ref>\n[http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 Configuration integral (statistical mechanics)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193950/http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 |date=2012-04-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nSince there are\n<math>\\displaystyle 3N</math>\n[[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in a monatomic-gas system with\n<math>\\displaystyle N</math>\nparticles,\nthe kinetic energy per degree of freedom per molecule is\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n   \\displaystyle \n   \\frac\n   {K}\n   {3 N}\n   =\n   \\frac\n   {k_B T}\n   {2}\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\nIn the kinetic energy per degree of freedom,\nthe constant of proportionality of temperature\nis 1/2 times [[Boltzmann constant]] or R/2 per mole.

The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is <math> n \\sigma </math>, and it is related to the [[Mean free path#Kinetic theory|mean free path]] <math>l</math> by \n\n<math> \\quad l = \\frac {1} {\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma} </math>\n\nNotice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume <math> n \\sigma </math> is reciprocal of length. The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision.\n\nLet <math> u_{0} </math> be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area <math>dA</math> on one side of the gas layer, with speed <math>v</math> at angle <math>\\theta</math> from the normal, in time interval <math>dt</math> is \n\n<math> \\quad nv\\cos{\\theta}dAdt{\\times}\\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi k_BT}\\right)^{3/2}\\,  e^{- \\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} (v^2\\sin{\\theta}dv{d\\theta}d\\phi)</math>\n\nThese molecules made their last collision at a distance <math>l\\cos \\theta</math> above and below the gas layer, and each will contribute a forward momentum of\n\n<math> \\quad p_{x}^{\\pm} = m \\left( u_{0} \\pm l \\cos \\theta {d u \\over dy} \\right), </math>\n\nwhere plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the forward velocity gradient <math>du/dy</math> can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path. \n\nIntegrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint \n\n<math>\\quad v>0,0<\\theta<\\pi/2,0<\\phi<2\\pi</math> \n\nyields the forward momentum transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as [[shear stress]]):\n\n<math> \\quad \\tau^{\\pm} = \\frac {1}{4} \\bar v n \\cdot m \\left( u_{0} \\pm \\frac {2}{3} l {d u \\over dy} \\right) </math>\n\nThe net rate of momentum per unit area that is transported across the imaginary surface is thus\n\n<math> \\quad \\tau = \\tau^{+}  - \\tau^{-} = \\frac {1}{3} \\bar v n m \\cdot l {d u \\over dy} </math>\n\nCombining the above kinetic equation with [[Viscosity#Definition|Newton's law of viscosity]]\n\n<math> \\quad \\tau = \\eta {d u \\over dy} </math>\n\ngives the equation for shear viscosity, which is usually denoted <math> \\eta_{0} </math> when it is a dilute gas:\n\n<math> \\quad \\eta_{0} = \\frac {1} {3} \\bar v n m l </math>\n\nCombining this equation with the equation for mean free path gives\n\n<math> \\quad \\eta_{0} = \\frac {1} {3 \\sqrt{2} } \\frac {m \\cdot \\bar v} {\\sigma}</math>\n\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the average (equilibrium) molecular speed as\n\n<math> \\quad \\bar v = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} v_{p} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac {k_{B}T}{m_{}}} </math>\n\nwhere <math>v_{p}</math> is the most probable speed. We note that\n\n<math> \\quad k_{B} \\cdot N_{A} = R \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M = m \\cdot N_{A} </math>\n\nand insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation for [[Viscosity models for mixtures#Dilute gas limit and scaled variables|shear viscosity for dilute gases]]:\n\n<math> \\quad \\eta_{0} = \\frac {2} {3 \\sqrt{\\pi} } \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{m k_{B} T}} { \\sigma } \n= \\frac {2} {3 \\sqrt{\\pi} } \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{MRT}} { \\sigma \\cdot N_{A} } </math>\n\nand <math> M </math> is the [[molar mass]]. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by\n\n<math> \\quad \\sigma = \\pi \\left( 2 r \\right)^2 = \\pi d^2 </math>\n\nThe radius <math>r</math> is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter <math>d</math> is called collision cross section diameter or [[kinetic diameter]] of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among particles|cross section]] and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] or [[Morse potential]] which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. [[Mean free path#Mean free path in kinetic theory|The radius for zero  Lennard-Jones potential]] is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.\n\n===Thermal conductivity and heat flux===\n{{See also|Thermal conductivity}}Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for [[thermal conductivity]]<ref name=\"Sears1975\" /> of a dilute gas: \n\nConsider two parallel plates separated by a gas layer. Both plates have uniform temperatures, and are so massive compared to the gas layer that they can be treated as [[Thermal reservoir|thermal reservoirs]]. The upper plate has a higher temperature than the lower plate. The molecules in the gas layer have a molecular kinetic energy <math>\\varepsilon</math> which increases uniformly with distance <math>y</math> above the lower plate.

The net heat flux across the imaginary surface is thus\n\n<math> \\quad q = q_y^{+}  - q_y^{-} = -\\frac {1}{3} \\bar v n m c_v l {d T \\over dy} </math>\n\nCombining the above kinetic equation with [[Fourier's law]]\n\n<math> \\quad q = -\\kappa {d T \\over dy} </math>\n\ngives the equation for thermal conductivity, which is usually denoted <math> \\kappa_{0} </math> when it is a dilute gas:\n\n<math> \\quad \\kappa_{0} = \\frac {1} {3} \\bar v n m c_v l </math>\n\n=== Diffusion Coefficient and diffusion flux ===\n{{See also|Fick's laws of diffusion}}Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for [[mass diffusivity]]<ref name=\"Sears1975\" /> of a dilute gas: \n\nConsider a [[Steady state|steady]] diffusion between two regions of the same gas with perfectly flat and parallel boundaries separated by a layer of the same gas. Both regions have uniform [[Number density|number densities]], but the upper region has a higher number density than the lower region.

However, the number density <math>n</math> in the layer increases uniformly with distance <math>y</math> above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium molecular flow is superimposed on a [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution]] of molecular motions. \n\nLet <math> n_{0} </math> be the number density of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the layer.

In 1967 he was preaching to the \"[[Afrocentric views on race|Ansaaru Allah]]\" ([[viz.]] African Americans) in [[Brooklyn]], New York, during the period of the [[Black Power]] movement. He founded numerous orders under various names during the 1970s and 1980s. These were at first based on [[Pseudo-|pseudo]]-[[Islam]]ic themes and Judaism (Nubian Islamic Hebrews). Later he developed a theme derived from \"[[ancient Egypt in Afrocentrism|Ancient Egypt]],\" mixing ideas taken from [[black nationalism]], [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] and [[UFO religions]], and popular [[conspiracy theory]].

Before York's trial, the community had been joined directly and in the area by hundreds of other followers from out of state, while alienating both black and white local residents. The community was intensively investigated after numerous reports that York had molested numerous children of his followers.\n\nYork was arrested in May 2002.

It was built over a period of years and completed in 1993.\n\nTensions with county authorities increased in 1998, when the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney.<ref name=\"moser\"/>\n\nWithin Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the NAACP chapter.

He urges his female followers to pattern themselves on the Islamic paradigms of the wife and the mother, apparently desiring the creation of stable family units. But in reality the husbands and wives are [[sex segregation|segregated]] in dormitories, separated also from their children. York permits spouses to cohabit only once every three months. They are permitted to meet in the \"Green Room\" by prior appointment only.<ref>Gabriel, Theodore. \"Dwight York \u2013 a religious and cultural ''bricoleur'',\" in Partridge, C.

The FBI, which had started investigating the group in 1993, assigned a major task force to it. In 2002 York was arrested and charged with more than 100 counts of sexually molesting dozens of children, some as young as four years old. According to Bill Osinski, who wrote a 2007 book about York and the case:\n\n<blockquote>When he [York] was finally indicted, state prosecutors literally had to cut back the number of counts listed \u2014 from well beyond a thousand to slightly more than 200 \u2014 because they feared a jury simply wouldn't believe the magnitude of York's [[evil]].\u2026 [It] is believed to be the nation's largest child molestation prosecution ever directed at a single person, in terms of number of victims and number of alleged criminal acts.<ref>[http://www.ungodlybook.com/factsheet.htm Osinski, Bill.

Crawford, \"Former Nuwaubian writes book, tells how York duped followers,\" ''The Macon Telegraph,'' 14 March 2005], posted at New Age Fraud website; accessed May 26, 2016</ref>\n\nPerhaps to avoid scrutiny from the international [[Muslim]] community, the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Gods and Earths, legal troubles, and the negative history of his group during their New York period, he changed his own name several times, as well as the group's name, and masked different parts of their doctrine.<ref name=\"watchman.org\"/> In Georgia, they changed their name to the \"United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.\"<ref name=\"enc\"/>\n\nAt York's direction, the community purchased land and built ''[[Tama-Re]]'' (originally named Kadesh), an Egyptian-themed complex built on {{convert|476|acre|km2}} of land near [[Eatonton, Georgia]]. It was built over a period of years and completed in 1993.\n\nTensions with county authorities increased in 1998, when the county sought an injunction against construction and uses that violated zoning. At the same time, the Nuwaubian community increased its leafletting of Eatonton and surrounding areas, charging white officials with racial discrimination and striving to increase opposition to them. Threats mounted and an eviscerated dog carcass was left at the home of the county attorney.<ref name=\"moser\"/>\n\nWithin Putnam County, the Nuwaubians lost black support, in part by trying to take over the NAACP chapter. But outside, they appealed to activists, claiming to be persecuted in the county. During this period, the group maintained Holy Tabernacle stores \"in more than a dozen cities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Trinidad.\"<ref name=\"moser\"/>  And York purchased a $557,000 mansion in [[Athens, Georgia]], about 60 miles away, the base of the University of Georgia.<ref name=\"moser\"/>\n\nIn July 1999, ''[[Time magazine]]'' reported on the \"40-ft. pyramids, obelisks, gods, goddesses and a giant sphinx,\" built by York's followers in rural Georgia in an article titled \"Space Invaders\".<ref>[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/nuwaubians/nuwaubians176.html Joe Kovac Jr., \"New Book Asks Provocative Questions About Dwight York\"], ''The Macon Telegraph,'' May 20, 2007, accessed May 25, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2005 federal government officials acquired the property of Tama-Re through [[asset forfeiture]] after York was convicted and sentenced to prison for 135 years. He owed money for violating financial laws. After the property was sold, new owners demolished the buildings and monuments.\n\n=== Arrest and conviction of child molestation (2002\u2013present)===\nBeginning in Brooklyn, York had established strict sexual practices within the community, reserving for himself sexual access to many women and girls, including wives and children of followers.\n\nTheodore Gabriel wrote about these practices:\n\n<blockquote>[W]hile extolling the virtues and importance of family life and the conjugal relationship, he [York] denies such relationships to his followers except at strictly controlled intervals. He urges his female followers to pattern themselves on the Islamic paradigms of the wife and the mother, apparently desiring the creation of stable family units. But in reality the husbands and wives are [[sex segregation|segregated]] in dormitories, separated also from their children. York permits spouses to cohabit only once every three months. They are permitted to meet in the \"Green Room\" by prior appointment only.<ref>Gabriel, Theodore. \"Dwight York \u2013 a religious and cultural ''bricoleur'',\" in Partridge, C. ''UFO Religions,'' Routledge, 2003, p. 152</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnonymous letters were sent to Putnam County officials alleging child molestation at the Nuwaubian community. The FBI, which had started investigating the group in 1993, assigned a major task force to it. In 2002 York was arrested and charged with more than 100 counts of sexually molesting dozens of children, some as young as four years old. According to Bill Osinski, who wrote a 2007 book about York and the case:\n\n<blockquote>When he [York] was finally indicted, state prosecutors literally had to cut back the number of counts listed \u2014 from well beyond a thousand to slightly more than 200 \u2014 because they feared a jury simply wouldn't believe the magnitude of York's [[evil]].\u2026 [It] is believed to be the nation's largest child molestation prosecution ever directed at a single person, in terms of number of victims and number of alleged criminal acts.<ref>[http://www.ungodlybook.com/factsheet.htm Osinski, Bill.

Attachments filed with the 2241 ''habeas corpus'' motion, 27 April  2006</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2003, York entered into a [[plea bargain]] that was later dismissed by the judge. He was convicted by a jury on January 23, 2004. The judge rejected his plea to be returned for trial to his own \"tribe,\" after York claimed status as an [[indigenous people|indigenous person]]:\n\n<blockquote>Your Honor, with all due respects to your government, your nation, and your court, we the indigenous people of this land have our own rights, accepted sovereign, our own governments. We are a sovereign people, [[Nuwaubianism#Yamassee|Yamassee]], [[Creek Indians|Native American Creeks]], [[Seminole]], Washitaw Mound Builders. And all I'm asking is that the Court recognize that I am an indigenous person. Your court does not have jurisdiction over me. I should be transferred to the Moors Cherokee Council Court in which I will get a trial by juries of my peers. I cannot get a fair trial, Your Honor, if I'm being tried by the settlers or the confederates. I have to be tried by Native Americans as a Native American.

He wrote, \"We have been coming to this planet before it had your life form on it. ... My incarnation as an Ilah Mutajassid or Avatara was originally in the year 1945 A.D. In order to get here I travelled by one of the smaller passenger crafts called SHAM out of a Motherplane called MERKABAH or NIBIRU.\" This version of York came to Earth on March 16, 1970. (Comet Bennett, which was visible on that date, is said to have really been York\u2019s spacecraft.) York taught that the Motherplane/NIBIRU would launch the Crystal City or New Jerusalem (see: Book of Revelation 21:2) to our solar system from its position in Orion.
