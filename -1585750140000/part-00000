E. Cummings|E.E. Cummings]]. ''Him'' has been called a precursor to [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. The play was first published in November 1927 and premiered in New York during the spring of 1928. ''Him'' is sometimes called a precursor to [[Theatre of the Absurd]] but has also been described as being [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] and in the [[German Expressionism|German expressionist]] tradition. It is heavily influenced by Freudian psychology as well as popular culture of the 1920s.\n\n== Background ==\nCummings wrote him in Paris and New York.

The Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], cuts through the northern half of the city while the Napindan River, another tributary of the Pasig, forms the common border of Taguig with Pasig.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as \"''mga taga-giik'',\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"rice thresher\") and the settlement as \"''pook ng mga taga-giik''.\" Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found \"taga-giik\" difficult to pronounce. \"Tagui-ig\" was later shortened to its current form \"Taguig\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nTaguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate \"[[pueblo]]\" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.\n\nDuring that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and \"sawali\" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, \"Kapitan\" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.\n\nDuring the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig \"revolutionarios\" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.\n\nThe defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Bi\u00f1an]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905 with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.\n\nIt was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a 25.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the [[United States]] on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.\n\nThe town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.\n\nIn 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004 ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.\n\nIn 2011, doing 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a \u201cProbinSyudad\u201d because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Taguig\n| 1903 = 6829\n| 1918 = 8423\n| 1939 = 12087\n| 1948 = 15340\n| 1960 = 21856\n| 1970 = 55257\n| 1975 = 73702\n| 1980 = 134137\n| 1990 = 266637\n| 1995 = 381350\n| 2000 = 467375\n| 2007 = 613343\n| 2010 = 644473\n| 2015 = 804915\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n==Local government==\n{{See also|Cities of the Philippines}}\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Taguig is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms.

This Philippine military base, most of which has been converted to a modern commercial and residential development area, lies in an ambiguous area. A portion of the base, including the ''[[Heroes' Cemetery|Libingan ng mga Bayani]]'' (Heroes' Cemetery) and the [[Manila American Cemetery and Memorial]] lies within Taguig, while the northern portion where the development center is now located used to be considered part of Makati, but is currently and permanently considered part of Taguig. A 2003 ruling by a judge in the Pasig Regional Trial Court has upheld the jurisdiction of Taguig over the whole of Fort Bonifacio, including Barangay Pinagsama and Bonifacio Global City.\n\n===Ruling===\nThe Supreme Court on June 27, 2008 per [[Leonardo Quisumbing]], dismissed the suit of the [[Makati]], seeking to nullify Special Patents 3595 and 3596 signed by [[Fidel Ramos]] conveying to the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] public land in [[Fort Bonifacio]], Taguig. Because of a pending civil case filed by the Taguig City government asking the court to define its territorial boundaries, Makati therefore cannot stop Taguig from collecting taxes on land located in Fort Bonifacio.<ref>[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police2_june30_2008 Court junks Makati's suit to nullify Ramos patents], manilastandardtoday.com; accessed August 10, 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2008/june2008/163175.htm Binay v Taguig, G.R.

The Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], cuts through the northern half of the city while the Napindan River, another tributary of the Pasig, forms the common border of Taguig with Pasig.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as \"''mga taga-giik'',\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"rice thresher\") and the settlement as \"''pook ng mga taga-giik''.\" Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found \"taga-giik\" difficult to pronounce. \"Tagui-ig\" was later shortened to its current form \"Taguig\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nTaguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate \"[[pueblo]]\" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.\n\nDuring that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and \"sawali\" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, \"Kapitan\" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.\n\nDuring the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig \"revolutionarios\" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.\n\nThe defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Bi\u00f1an]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905 with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.\n\nIt was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a 25.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the [[United States]] on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.\n\nThe town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.\n\nIn 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004 ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.\n\nIn 2011, doing 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a \u201cProbinSyudad\u201d because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Taguig\n| 1903 = 6829\n| 1918 = 8423\n| 1939 = 12087\n| 1948 = 15340\n| 1960 = 21856\n| 1970 = 55257\n| 1975 = 73702\n| 1980 = 134137\n| 1990 = 266637\n| 1995 = 381350\n| 2000 = 467375\n| 2007 = 613343\n| 2010 = 644473\n| 2015 = 804915\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n==Local government==\n{{See also|Cities of the Philippines}}\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Taguig is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms.

Though his work was published as early as 1919 and largely during the 1920s and 1930s, Faulkner's renown reached its peak upon the publication of Malcolm Cowley's ''The Portable Faulkner'' and his 1949 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], making him the only Mississippi-born Nobel winner. Two of his works, ''[[A Fable]]'' (1954) and his last novel ''[[The Reivers]]'' (1962), each won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]].<ref name=pulitzer/> In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked his 1929 novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' sixth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]]; also on the list were ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930) and ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932).

Following the sale of the railroad business, Murry proposed a plan to get a new start for his family by moving to Texas and becoming a rancher. Maud disagreed with this proposition, however, and they moved instead to [[Oxford, Mississippi]], where Murry's father owned several businesses, making it easy for Murry to find work.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Minter, David L. ''William Faulkner, His Life and Work''. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980; {{ISBN|0-8018-2347-1}}</ref> Thus, four days prior to William's fifth birthday, the Falkner family settled in Oxford, where he lived on and off for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Ole Miss\"/><ref name=\"Nobel Prize\">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html|title=William Faulkner biodate|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis family, particularly his mother Maud, his maternal grandmother Lelia Butler, and Caroline \"Callie\" Barr (the African American nanny who raised him from infancy) crucially influenced the development of Faulkner's artistic imagination. Both his mother and grandmother were avid readers as well as painters and photographers, educating him in visual language. While Murry enjoyed the outdoors and encouraged his sons to hunt, track, and fish, Maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church. She taught her sons to read before sending them to public school and exposed them to classics such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFaulkner's lifelong education by Callie Barr is central to his novels' preoccupations with the politics of sexuality and race.<ref name=\"Sensibar\">Sensibar, Judith L. ''Faulkner and Love: The Women Who Shaped His Art, A Biography'', Yale University Press, 2010; {{ISBN|0-300-16568-4}}</ref>\n\nAs a schoolchild, Faulkner had success early on. He excelled in the first grade, skipped the second, and did well through the third and fourth grades. However, beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling, Faulkner became a much quieter and more withdrawn child. He began to play hooky occasionally and became somewhat indifferent to his schoolwork, instead taking interest in studying the history of Mississippi on his own time beginning in the seventh grade. The decline of his performance in school continued, and Faulkner wound up repeating the eleventh and twelfth grade, never graduating from high school.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFaulkner spent his boyhood listening to stories told to him by his elders including those of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], slavery, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and the Falkner family. Faulkner's grandfather would also tell him of the exploits of William's great-grandfather and namesake, [[William Clark Falkner]], who was a successful businessman, writer, and Civil War hero. Telling stories about \"Old Colonel\", as his family called him, had already become something of a family pastime when Faulkner was a boy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to one of Faulkner's biographers, by the time William was born, his great-grandfather had \"been enshrined long since as a household deity.\"<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953a\">Coughlan, pg. 38</ref>\n\nWhen he was 17, Faulkner met [[Phil Stone]], who became an important early influence on his writing. Stone was four years his senior and came from one of Oxford's older families; he was passionate about literature and had already earned bachelor's degrees from [[Yale University|Yale]] and the [[University of Mississippi]]. Faulkner also attended the latter, joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, and pursued his dream to become a writer. Stone read and was impressed by some of Faulkner's early poetry, becoming one of the first to recognize and encourage Faulkner's talent. Stone mentored the young Faulkner, introducing him to the works of writers such as [[James Joyce]], who influenced Faulkner's own writing. In his early 20s, Faulkner gave poems and short stories he had written to Stone in hopes of their being published. Stone would in turn send these to publishers, but they were uniformly rejected.<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953\"/>\n[[File:William Faulkner in Toronto, Canada (1918).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cadet Faulkner in [[Toronto]], 1918]]\nThe younger Faulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived. Mississippi marked his sense of humor, his sense of the tragic position of \"black and white\" Americans, his characterization of Southern characters, and his timeless themes, including fiercely intelligent people dwelling behind the fa\u00e7ades of [[good ol' boy]]s and simpletons. Unable to join the [[United States Army]] due to his height (he was 5' 5\u00bd\"), Faulkner enlisted in a reservist unit of the [[British Army]] in Toronto.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scrivener|first=Leslie|title=U of T Back Campus Debate Invokes William Faulkner, Morley Callaghan|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=June 9, 2013|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/06/09/u_of_t_back_campus_debate_invokes_william_faulkner_morley_callaghan.html}}</ref>  Despite his claims, records indicate that Faulkner was never actually a member of the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and never saw active service during the First World War.<ref>{{cite book|title=William Faulkner: Self-Presentation and Performance|last=Watson|first=James G.|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-79151-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Faulkner's surname went from \"Falkner\" to '''Faulkner'''. According to one story, a careless typesetter simply made an error. When the misprint appeared on the title page of his first book, Faulkner was asked whether he wanted the change. He supposedly replied, \"Either way suits me.\"<ref>Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters'' Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: pp. 63\u201364. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}</ref>\n\nIn adolescence, Faulkner began writing poetry almost exclusively. He did not write his first novel until 1925. His literary influences are deep and wide. He once stated that he modeled his early writing on the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] in late 18th- and early 19th-century England.<ref name=\"Ole Miss\"/> He attended the [[University of Mississippi]] (\"Ole Miss\") in Oxford, enrolling in 1919, going three semesters before dropping out in November 1920.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olemiss.edu/mwp/dir/faulkner_william|title=University of Mississippi: William Faulkner|publisher=Olemiss.edu|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWilliam was able to attend classes at the university because his father had a job there as a business manager. He skipped classes often and received a \"D\" grade in English. However, some of his poems were published in campus publications.<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953\">Coughlan, Robert.

This novel drew heavily on the traditions and history of the South, in which Faulkner had been engrossed in his youth. He was extremely proud of the novel upon its completion and he believed it to be a significant step up from his previous two novels. However, when submitted for publication, it was rejected by the publishers Boni & Liveright. Faulkner was devastated by this rejection, but he eventually allowed his literary agent, Ben Wasson, to significantly edit the text, and the novel was published in 1929 as ''[[Sartoris]].''<ref name=\"Porter, Carolyn 2007\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner 2004\"/> (The original version was issued as ''[[Flags in the Dust]]'' in 1973.)\n\nIn the autumn of 1928, just after his 31st birthday, he began working on ''The Sound and the Fury''. He started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name Compson, but soon began to feel that the characters he had created might be better suited for a full-length novel. Perhaps as a result of disappointment in the initial rejection of ''Flags in the Dust'', Faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style. In describing the writing process for this work, Faulkner would later say, ''\"One day I seemed to shut the door between me and all publisher's addresses and book lists. I said to myself, 'Now I can write.'\"''<ref>Porter, Carolyn.

Estelle brought with her two children from her previous marriage to [[Cornell Franklin]] and Faulkner hoped to support his new family as a writer. Faulkner and Estelle later had a daughter, Jill, in 1933. He began writing ''As I Lay Dying'' in 1929 while working night shifts at the [[University of Mississippi Power House]].

This body of work formed the basis of his reputation and earned him the Nobel Prize at age 52. Faulkner's prodigious output includes his most celebrated novels such as ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929), ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930), ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932), and ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936). Faulkner was also a prolific writer of [[short story|short stories]].\n\nHis first short story collection, ''[[These 13]]'' (1931), includes many of his most acclaimed (and most frequently [[anthology|anthologized]]) stories, including \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\", \"[[Red Leaves]]\", \"[[That Evening Sun]]\", and \"[[Dry September]]\". Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]]<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949: Biography] ''Nobelprize.org''.</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, of which his hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is the county seat. Yoknapatawpha was Faulkner's \"postage stamp\", and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature. Three of his novels, ''[[The Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Town (Faulkner novel)|The Town]]'' and ''[[The Mansion (novel)|The Mansion]]'', known collectively as the Snopes Trilogy, document the town of Jefferson and its environs, as an extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace.<ref>Charlotte Renner, Talking and Writing in Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy, ACADEMIC JOURNAL ARTICLE, The Southern Literary Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1, Fall 1982.</ref>\n\nHis short story \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\" was his first story published in a major magazine, the ''Forum'', but received little attention from the public. After revisions and reissues, it gained popularity and is now considered one of his best.\n\nFaulkner was known for his experimental style with meticulous attention to [[diction]] and [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]]. In contrast to the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] understatement of his contemporary [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner made frequent use of \"[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]\" in his writing, and wrote often highly emotional, subtle, cerebral, complex, and sometimes [[Southern Gothic|Gothic]] or [[Grotesque#In literature|grotesque]] stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves, poor white, agrarian, or working-class Southerners, and Southern aristocrats.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in 1956, Faulkner remarked: <blockquote>Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique. There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error. The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice. He has supreme vanity. No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him.</blockquote> Another esteemed Southern writer, [[Flannery O'Connor]], stated that \"the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do. Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down\".<ref>Levinger, Larry. \"The Prophet Faulkner.\" ''Atlantic Monthly'' 285 (2000): 76.</ref>\n\nFaulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings, ''The Marble Faun'' (1924),<ref>This book shares a title with ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860), one of the novels of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].</ref> and ''A Green Bough'' (1933), and a collection of mystery stories, ''Knight's Gambit'' (1949).\n\n== Legacy ==\nFaulkner's work has been examined by many critics from a wide variety of critical perspectives.\n\nThe [[New Criticism|New Critics]] became very interested in Faulkner's work, with [[Cleanth Brooks]] writing ''The Yoknapatawpha Country'' and Michael Millgate writing ''The Achievement of William Faulkner''. Since then, critics have looked at Faulkner's work using other approaches, such as feminist and psychoanalytic methods.<ref name=\"Faulkner 2004\" /><ref>Wagner-Martin, Linda.

Though his work was published as early as 1919 and largely during the 1920s and 1930s, Faulkner's renown reached its peak upon the publication of Malcolm Cowley's ''The Portable Faulkner'' and his 1949 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], making him the only Mississippi-born Nobel winner. Two of his works, ''[[A Fable]]'' (1954) and his last novel ''[[The Reivers]]'' (1962), each won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]].<ref name=pulitzer/> In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked his 1929 novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' sixth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]]; also on the list were ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930) and ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932).

Following the sale of the railroad business, Murry proposed a plan to get a new start for his family by moving to Texas and becoming a rancher. Maud disagreed with this proposition, however, and they moved instead to [[Oxford, Mississippi]], where Murry's father owned several businesses, making it easy for Murry to find work.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Minter, David L.

Both his mother and grandmother were avid readers as well as painters and photographers, educating him in visual language. While Murry enjoyed the outdoors and encouraged his sons to hunt, track, and fish, Maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church. She taught her sons to read before sending them to public school and exposed them to classics such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFaulkner's lifelong education by Callie Barr is central to his novels' preoccupations with the politics of sexuality and race.<ref name=\"Sensibar\">Sensibar, Judith L.

He excelled in the first grade, skipped the second, and did well through the third and fourth grades. However, beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling, Faulkner became a much quieter and more withdrawn child. He began to play hooky occasionally and became somewhat indifferent to his schoolwork, instead taking interest in studying the history of Mississippi on his own time beginning in the seventh grade. The decline of his performance in school continued, and Faulkner wound up repeating the eleventh and twelfth grade, never graduating from high school.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFaulkner spent his boyhood listening to stories told to him by his elders including those of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], slavery, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and the Falkner family. Faulkner's grandfather would also tell him of the exploits of William's great-grandfather and namesake, [[William Clark Falkner]], who was a successful businessman, writer, and Civil War hero. Telling stories about \"Old Colonel\", as his family called him, had already become something of a family pastime when Faulkner was a boy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to one of Faulkner's biographers, by the time William was born, his great-grandfather had \"been enshrined long since as a household deity.\"<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953a\">Coughlan, pg. 38</ref>\n\nWhen he was 17, Faulkner met [[Phil Stone]], who became an important early influence on his writing. Stone was four years his senior and came from one of Oxford's older families; he was passionate about literature and had already earned bachelor's degrees from [[Yale University|Yale]] and the [[University of Mississippi]]. Faulkner also attended the latter, joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, and pursued his dream to become a writer. Stone read and was impressed by some of Faulkner's early poetry, becoming one of the first to recognize and encourage Faulkner's talent. Stone mentored the young Faulkner, introducing him to the works of writers such as [[James Joyce]], who influenced Faulkner's own writing. In his early 20s, Faulkner gave poems and short stories he had written to Stone in hopes of their being published. Stone would in turn send these to publishers, but they were uniformly rejected.<ref name=\"Coughlan, Robert 1953\"/>\n[[File:William Faulkner in Toronto, Canada (1918).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cadet Faulkner in [[Toronto]], 1918]]\nThe younger Faulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived. Mississippi marked his sense of humor, his sense of the tragic position of \"black and white\" Americans, his characterization of Southern characters, and his timeless themes, including fiercely intelligent people dwelling behind the fa\u00e7ades of [[good ol' boy]]s and simpletons. Unable to join the [[United States Army]] due to his height (he was 5' 5\u00bd\"), Faulkner enlisted in a reservist unit of the [[British Army]] in Toronto.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scrivener|first=Leslie|title=U of T Back Campus Debate Invokes William Faulkner, Morley Callaghan|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=June 9, 2013|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/06/09/u_of_t_back_campus_debate_invokes_william_faulkner_morley_callaghan.html}}</ref>  Despite his claims, records indicate that Faulkner was never actually a member of the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and never saw active service during the First World War.<ref>{{cite book|title=William Faulkner: Self-Presentation and Performance|last=Watson|first=James G.|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-79151-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Faulkner's surname went from \"Falkner\" to '''Faulkner'''. According to one story, a careless typesetter simply made an error. When the misprint appeared on the title page of his first book, Faulkner was asked whether he wanted the change. He supposedly replied, \"Either way suits me.\"<ref>Nelson, Randy F.

He did not write his first novel until 1925. His literary influences are deep and wide. He once stated that he modeled his early writing on the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] in late 18th- and early 19th-century England.<ref name=\"Ole Miss\"/> He attended the [[University of Mississippi]] (\"Ole Miss\") in Oxford, enrolling in 1919, going three semesters before dropping out in November 1920.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olemiss.edu/mwp/dir/faulkner_william|title=University of Mississippi: William Faulkner|publisher=Olemiss.edu|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWilliam was able to attend classes at the university because his father had a job there as a business manager.

This novel drew heavily on the traditions and history of the South, in which Faulkner had been engrossed in his youth. He was extremely proud of the novel upon its completion and he believed it to be a significant step up from his previous two novels. However, when submitted for publication, it was rejected by the publishers Boni & Liveright. Faulkner was devastated by this rejection, but he eventually allowed his literary agent, Ben Wasson, to significantly edit the text, and the novel was published in 1929 as ''[[Sartoris]].''<ref name=\"Porter, Carolyn 2007\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner 2004\"/> (The original version was issued as ''[[Flags in the Dust]]'' in 1973.)\n\nIn the autumn of 1928, just after his 31st birthday, he began working on ''The Sound and the Fury''. He started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name Compson, but soon began to feel that the characters he had created might be better suited for a full-length novel. Perhaps as a result of disappointment in the initial rejection of ''Flags in the Dust'', Faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style. In describing the writing process for this work, Faulkner would later say, ''\"One day I seemed to shut the door between me and all publisher's addresses and book lists. I said to myself, 'Now I can write.'\"''<ref>Porter, Carolyn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=awt9X0cAC40C&printsec=frontcover ''William Faulkner''], New York: Oxford University Press, 2007; {{ISBN|0-19-531049-7}}, pg. 37</ref> After its completion, Faulkner insisted that Ben Wasson not do any editing or add any punctuation for clarity.<ref name=\"Porter, Carolyn 2007\"/>\n\nIn 1929, Faulkner married Estelle Oldham, Andrew Kuhn serving as best man at the wedding. Estelle brought with her two children from her previous marriage to [[Cornell Franklin]] and Faulkner hoped to support his new family as a writer. Faulkner and Estelle later had a daughter, Jill, in 1933. He began writing ''As I Lay Dying'' in 1929 while working night shifts at the [[University of Mississippi Power House]].

He asked Wasson to sell the serialization rights for his newly completed novel, ''Light in August'', to a magazine for $5,000, but none accepted the offer.

This body of work formed the basis of his reputation and earned him the Nobel Prize at age 52. Faulkner's prodigious output includes his most celebrated novels such as ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929), ''[[As I Lay Dying]]'' (1930), ''[[Light in August]]'' (1932), and ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936). Faulkner was also a prolific writer of [[short story|short stories]].\n\nHis first short story collection, ''[[These 13]]'' (1931), includes many of his most acclaimed (and most frequently [[anthology|anthologized]]) stories, including \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\", \"[[Red Leaves]]\", \"[[That Evening Sun]]\", and \"[[Dry September]]\". Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in [[Yoknapatawpha County]]<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-bio.html The Nobel Prize in Literature 1949: Biography] ''Nobelprize.org''.</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, of which his hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is the county seat. Yoknapatawpha was Faulkner's \"postage stamp\", and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature. Three of his novels, ''[[The Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Town (Faulkner novel)|The Town]]'' and ''[[The Mansion (novel)|The Mansion]]'', known collectively as the Snopes Trilogy, document the town of Jefferson and its environs, as an extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace.<ref>Charlotte Renner, Talking and Writing in Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy, ACADEMIC JOURNAL ARTICLE, The Southern Literary Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1, Fall 1982.</ref>\n\nHis short story \"[[A Rose for Emily]]\" was his first story published in a major magazine, the ''Forum'', but received little attention from the public. After revisions and reissues, it gained popularity and is now considered one of his best.\n\nFaulkner was known for his experimental style with meticulous attention to [[diction]] and [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]]. In contrast to the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] understatement of his contemporary [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner made frequent use of \"[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]\" in his writing, and wrote often highly emotional, subtle, cerebral, complex, and sometimes [[Southern Gothic|Gothic]] or [[Grotesque#In literature|grotesque]] stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves, poor white, agrarian, or working-class Southerners, and Southern aristocrats.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in 1956, Faulkner remarked: <blockquote>Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique. There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error. The good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice. He has supreme vanity. No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him.</blockquote> Another esteemed Southern writer, [[Flannery O'Connor]], stated that \"the presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do. Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down\".<ref>Levinger, Larry. \"The Prophet Faulkner.\" ''Atlantic Monthly'' 285 (2000): 76.</ref>\n\nFaulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings, ''The Marble Faun'' (1924),<ref>This book shares a title with ''[[The Marble Faun]]'' (1860), one of the novels of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].</ref> and ''A Green Bough'' (1933), and a collection of mystery stories, ''Knight's Gambit'' (1949).\n\n== Legacy ==\nFaulkner's work has been examined by many critics from a wide variety of critical perspectives.\n\nThe [[New Criticism|New Critics]] became very interested in Faulkner's work, with [[Cleanth Brooks]] writing ''The Yoknapatawpha Country'' and Michael Millgate writing ''The Achievement of William Faulkner''. Since then, critics have looked at Faulkner's work using other approaches, such as feminist and psychoanalytic methods.<ref name=\"Faulkner 2004\" /><ref>Wagner-Martin, Linda.

Although Leeds soon recovered they had lost too much ground in the race for 3rd and 4th place consecutive defeats to Manchester United 3-4 and Tottenham 1-2 all but ended Leeds hopes of finishing in the top 4, United would finish 5th but after spending 100 million on player signings and with one of the best squads in the Premiership was a disappointment. In June David O'Leary manager since October 1998 who had previously secured 4th 3rd 4th place finishes a Uafer cup semi final and Champions League semi final was sacked by chairman Peter Risdale.    \n\nPlans were unveiled on 5 September for a new 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, West Yorkshire|Skelton]] to replace [[Elland Road]], with Ridsdale hoping to have it ready by the summer of 2004. In fact, Ridsdale was aware that millions of pounds had been staked on Champions League qualification - by not qualifying in successive years, the club was heading for financial meltdown.\n\n==Final

Although Leeds soon recovered they had lost too much ground in the race for 3rd and 4th place consecutive defeats to Manchester United 3-4 and Tottenham 1-2 all but ended Leeds hopes of finishing in the top 4, United would finish 5th but after spending 100 million in recent years on player signings and with one of the best squads in the Premiership was a disappointment. In June David O'Leary manager since October 1998 who had previously secured 4th 3rd 4th place finishes a Uafer cup semi final and Champions League semi final was sacked by chairman Peter Risdale.    \n\nPlans were unveiled on 5 September for a new 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, West Yorkshire|Skelton]] to replace [[Elland Road]], with Ridsdale hoping to have it ready by the summer of 2004. In fact, Ridsdale was aware that millions of pounds had been staked on Champions League qualification - by not qualifying in successive years, the club was heading for financial meltdown.\n\n==Final
