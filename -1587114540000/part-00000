After being transferred to the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] in Korea, he participated in three campaigns before being mortally wounded.\n\nOn May 28, 1952, Corporal Champagne, a fire team leader, advanced with his platoon in the initial assault on a strongly fortified and heavily defended enemy hill position. He successfully led his team through enemy grenade, small-arms, and machine gun fire to the crest of the hill. Although wounded in the encounter, he refused evacuation.\n\nThe enemy counterattack intensified and a grenade landed in the midst of Champagne's team. Without hesitation, he seized the grenade and threw it at the enemy. It exploded as it left his hand and hurled him out of the trench. While thus exposed to enemy mortar fire, he was mortally wounded.  He was 19 years and 6 months old at the time of his death.\n\nIn addition to the Medal of Honor, Champagne was awarded [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]]ly the [[Purple Heart Medal]]. He was/is also entitled to the [[Combat Action Ribbon]], [[National Defense Service Medal]], [[Korean Service Medal]] with three {{frac|3|16}}\" [[service star|bronze stars]], [[United Nations Service Medal]], and the [[Korean War Service Medal]].\n\nCorporal Champagne's Medal of Honor was presented to his 15-year-old brother, Reginald H.
