Mostly [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Seventh-day Sabbatarians]], they broke away from their former churches to form communities that followed Seventh-day Sabbath-based practices that differed from the rest of Christianity, often also adopting a more literal interpretation of law, either Christian or Mosaic.\n\n==History==\n\n===Sabbath timing===\n{{See also|Shabbat}}\n\nThe Hebrew Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, is often spoken of loosely as \"Saturday\" but in the [[Hebrew calendar]] a day begins at sunset and not at midnight. The Sabbath therefore coincides with what is now commonly identified as Friday sunset to Saturday night when three stars are visible in the night sky. Similarly, the Hebrew first day of the week (\"Sunday\") extends from sunset on (in common parlance) Saturday evening to sunset on what is generally called Sunday evening. The Sabbath continued to be observed on the seventh day in the early Christian church.{{NoteTag|The civil calendar of the ancient Roman Empire, the [[Julian calendar]] (founded in 45 BC), marked days loosely in general practice, since the timing of midnight was difficult to determine widely at that time. Thus, the early church easily adopted for its own use the Hebrew calendar's sunset-to-sunset formula for marking the days, even after it began to calculate Easter according to the Julian calendar. Its daily cycle of church services began with Vespers, which was often celebrated just after sunset, in the early evening. This pattern made its way into both Roman and Eastern liturgical practice, and continues in use in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to this day.}} To this day, the liturgical day continues to be observed in line with the Hebrew reckoning in the church calendars in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].<ref>Canon of Holy Saturday (Orthodox), Kontakion: \"Exceeding blessed is this Sabbath, on which Christ has slumbered, to rise on the third day.\"</ref> In the [[Latin Church]], \"the liturgical day runs from midnight to midnight.

The teachers of a Friday crucifixion and Sunday resurrection assume that the next day after the crucifixion was the weekly Sabbath, but it was a yearly Sabbath, the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (which is clearly indicated in John 19:31, a \"high day\") that occurred on Thursday of that week. The U.S. Naval Observatory confirmed that Passover in 31 A.D. occurred on a Wednesday, not a Friday.  The reason they requested permission from Pilate to remove the body before sunset was because the Romans did not keep track of their yearly Sabbaths, only respecting the weekly Sabbath, so they would already know that if a Jew was crucified on Friday they would have to have the body down before sunset, which is why they probably would not crucify a Jew on Friday, knowing that he would have to be taken down shortly thereafter, so they would wait until Sunday for the crucifixion. In addition, one verse states that the women bought the spices before the Sabbath, and another verse states that they prepared the spices after the Sabbath, so the only way that both can be true is that they bought the spices on Friday, between the two Sabbaths, and they could not anoint the body on that day because the guards were there for three full days with a Roman seal on the tomb.  When the women went to the tomb early on Sunday morning, one said, \"Who is able to help us roll the stone away\", so they had to know that the guards would already be gone, and the guards were ordered to stay there for three full days, on penalty of death.  In addition, stores would be open on Friday, the \"preparation day\", for them to be able to buy the spices, but would be closed in observance of the Passover, so if the Passover occurred on that Friday they would not be able to buy the spices on that day, nor would they be able to buy them on Saturday, the weekly Sabbath.  Daniel 9:27 states, \"In the middle of the week he will cause sacrifice to cease\".  He was killed in the middle of a 49-year period, in the middle of the final 7 years of the Daniel \"70 weeks\" prophecy (which totaled 490 years), and in the middle of the actual 7-day week on Wednesday. When God makes a prophecy it comes true in every way possible.\n\n===Corporate worship===\nWhile the Lord's Day observance of the Eucharist was established separately from the Jewish Sabbath, the centrality of the Eucharist itself made it the commonest early observance whenever Christians gathered for worship. In many places and times as late as the 4th century, they did continue to gather weekly on the Sabbath, often in addition to the Lord's Day, celebrating the Eucharist on both days.<ref name=socrates>{{citation |last1=Socrates Scholasticus |authorlink1=Socrates Scholasticus |title=Ecclesiastical History, Book V, Chapter 22 |work=[[Philip Schaff]] et al., [[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]] |series=Second Series (NPNF2, Vol 2) |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.viii.xxiii.html |ref=none }}</ref><ref name=sozomen>{{citation |last1=Sozomen |authorlink1=Sozomen |title=Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter 19 |work=[[Philip Schaff]] et al., [[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]] |series=Second Series (NPNF2, Vol 2)|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.iii.xii.xix.html |ref=none }}</ref><ref name=Laodicea16>{{citation |editor1-last=Schaff |editor1-first=Philip |editorlink1=Philip Schaff |editor2-last=Wace |editor2-first=Henry |title=Synod of Laodicea, Canon 16 |work=[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]] |series=Second Series (NPNF2, Vol 14) |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.vii.iii.xvii.html |ref=none |quote=[Editorial notes of Van Espen]: Among the Greeks the Sabbath was kept exactly as the Lord's day except so far as the cessation of work was concerned}}</ref> No disapproval of Sabbath observance of the Christian festival was expressed at the early church councils that dealt with [[Judaizing]].

[[Justin Martyr]], who attended worship on the first day,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Justin Martyr|title=First Apology|volume=67|authorlink=Justin Martyr}}</ref> wrote about the cessation of Hebrew Sabbath observance and stated that the Sabbath was enjoined as a temporary sign to Israel to teach it of human sinfulness ({{bibleref2|Gal.|3:24-25|NKJV}}),<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dialogue with Trypho|author=[[Justin Martyr]]|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xxi.html|volume=21}}</ref> no longer needed after Christ came without sin.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dialogue with Trypho|author=[[Justin Martyr]]|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xxiii.html|volume=23}}</ref> He rejected the need to keep literal seventh-day Sabbath, arguing instead that \"the new law requires you to keep the sabbath constantly.\"<ref>{{citation|author=Justin Martyr|title=Dialogue with Trypho 12:3|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xii.html}}</ref> With Christian corporate worship so clearly aligned with the Eucharist and allowed on the seventh day, Hebrew Sabbath practices primarily involved the observance of a day of rest.\n\n===Day of rest===\nA common theme in criticism of Hebrew Sabbath rest was idleness, found not to be in the Christian spirit of rest.

On March 7, 321, however, [[Constantine the Great|Roman Emperor Constantine I]] issued a civil decree making Sunday a day of rest from labor, stating:<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph Cullen|last=Ayer|title=A Source Book for Ancient Church History|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1913|volume=2.1.1.59g|pages=284\u20135}}</ref> {{quote|All judges and city people and the craftsmen shall rest upon the venerable day of the sun.

At Laodicea also, the Church encouraged Christians to make use of the day for Christian rest where possible,<ref name=Laodicea29/> without ascribing to it any of the regulation of Mosaic Law, and indeed, anathematizing Hebrew observance on the Sabbath. The civil law and its effects made possible a pattern in Church life that has been imitated throughout the centuries in many places and cultures, wherever possible.\n\n===From ancient times to Middle Ages===\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] followed the early patristic writers in spiritualizing the meaning of the Sabbath commandment, referring it to eschatological rest rather than observance of a literal day. Such writing, however, did serve to deepen the idea of Christian rest on Sunday, and its practice increased in prominence throughout the early [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=Bauckham3/>\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] is an expression of natural law which binds all men, and therefore the Sabbath commandment is a moral requirement along with the other nine. Thus in the West, Sunday rest became more closely associated with a Christian application of the Sabbath, a development towards the idea of a \"Christian Sabbath\" rather than a Hebrew one.<ref name=Bauckham3>{{cite book|chapter=Sabbath and Sunday in the Medieval Church in the West|first=R.J.|last=Bauckham|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|pages=299\u2013310|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers/Zondervan|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}</ref> While Sunday worship and Sunday rest combined powerfully to relate to Sabbath commandment precepts, the application of the commandment to Christian life was nevertheless a response within the law of liberty, not restricted to a single day but continuous, and not a displacement of the Sabbath in time.\n\n====Continuations of Hebrew practices====\n{{primary sources|section|date=September 2018}}\nSeventh-day Sabbath was observed at least sporadically by a minority of groups during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the early church in Ireland, there is evidence that a sabbath-rest on Saturday may have been kept along with mass on Sunday as the 'Lord's day'. It appears that many of the canon laws in Ireland from that period were derived from parts of the laws of Moses. In Adomnan of Iona's biography of [[St Columba]] it describes Columba's death by having Columba say on a Saturday 'Today is truly my sabbath, for it is my last day in this wearisome life, when I shall keep the Sabbath after my troublesome labours. At midnight this Sunday, as Scripture saith, \"I shall go the way of my fathers\"' and he then dies that night. The identification of this sabbath day as a Saturday in the narrative is clear in the context, because Columba is recorded as seeing an angel at the mass on the previous Sunday and the narrative claims he dies in the same week, on the sabbath day at the end of the week, during the 'Lord's night' (referring to Saturday night-Sunday morning).<ref>Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995</ref>\n\nAn Eastern body of Christian Sabbath-keepers mentioned from the 8th century to the 12th is called Athenians (\"touch-not\") because they abstained from uncleanness and intoxicating drinks, called Athinginians in Neander: \"This sect, which had its principal seat in the city of Armorion, in upper Phrygia, where many Jews resided, sprung out of a mixture of Judaism and Christianity. They united baptism with the observance of all the rites of Judaism, circumcision excepted. We may perhaps recognize a branch of the older Judaizing sects.<ref>Neander, fourth period, 6, 428.</ref>\n\nCardinal Hergenrother says that they stood in intimate relation with Emperor Michael II (AD 821-829), and testifies that they observed Sabbath.<ref>Kirchengeschichte, I, 527</ref> As late as the 11th century Cardinal Humbert still referred to the Nazarenes as a Sabbath-keeping Christian body existing at that time. But in the 10th and 11th centuries, there was a great extension of sects from the East to the West. Neander states that the corruption of the clergy furnished a most important vantage-ground on which to attack the dominant church. The abstemious life of these Christians, the simplicity and earnestness of their preaching and teaching, had their effect. \"Thus we find them emerging at once in the 11th century, in countries the most diverse, and the most remote from each other, in Italy, France, and even in the Harz districts in Germany.\" Likewise, also, \"traces of Sabbath-keepers are found in the times of Gregory I, Gregory VII, and in the 12th century in Lombardy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dedication.www3.50megs.com/historyofsabbath/hos_twentyone_b.html#027|title=SABBATH DURING THE DARK AGES|website=dedication.www3.50megs.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===\nThe [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches celebrate the Sabbath, a practice proselytised in the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] church in Ethiopia in the 1300s by [[Ewostatewos]] ({{lang-gez|\u12ee\u1235\u1323\u1274\u12ce\u1235}}, {{lang-grc|\u0395\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}}<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Marcus|first=Harold G.|title=A History of Ethiopia|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofethiopi00marc|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofethiopi00marc/page/24 24]|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08121-5}}</ref>).

The [[Puritans]] of England and Scotland brought a new rigorism into the observance of the Christian Lord's Day in reaction to the customary Sunday observance of the time, which they regarded as lax. They appealed to Sabbath ordinances with the idea that only the Bible can bind men's consciences on whether or how they will take a break from work, or to impose an obligation to meet at a particular time. Their influential reasoning spread to other denominations also, and it is primarily through their influence that \"Sabbath\" has become the colloquial equivalent of \"Lord's Day\" or \"Sunday\". Sunday Sabbatarianism is enshrined in its most mature expression, the ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' (1646), in the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theological tradition. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Chapter 21 (''Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day'') read:<blockquote>7. As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him: which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week, which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's day, and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.<br /><br />8. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe a holy rest, all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations, but also are taken up, the whole time, in the public and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_21|title=The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster|last=Assembly|first=Westminster}}</ref></blockquote>The confession holds that not only is work forbidden on Sunday, but also \"works, words, and thoughts\" about \"worldly employments and recreations.\" Instead, the whole day should be taken up with \"public and private exercises of [one's] worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_21|title=The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster|last=Assembly|first=Westminster}}</ref>\n\nStrict Sunday Sabbatarianism is sometimes called \"Puritan Sabbath\", which may be contrasted with \"Continental Sabbath\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=George|author-link=George Marsden|title=Understanding Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism|year=1991|publisher=[[William B.

This non-Sabbatarian interpretation usually states that Jesus's obedience and the [[New Covenant]] fulfilled the laws of Sabbath, the [[Ten Commandments]], and the [[Law of Moses]], which are thus considered not to be binding moral laws, and sometimes considered abolished or [[abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogated]]. While Sunday is often observed as the day of Christian assembly and worship, in accordance with church tradition, Sabbath commandments are dissociated from this practice.\n\nNon-Sabbatarian Christians also cite {{Bibleverse|2|Cor.|3:2-3}}, in which believers are compared to \"a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written ... not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts\"; this interpretation states that Christians accordingly no longer follow the Ten Commandments with dead orthodoxy (\"tablets of stone\"), but follow a new law written upon \"tablets of human hearts\". {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Cor.|3:7-11}} adds that \"if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory ..., will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? .... And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!\" This is interpreted as teaching that [[New Covenant]] Christians are not bound by the Mosaic Law, and that Sabbath-keeping is not required. Further, because \"love is the fulfillment of the law\" ({{Bibleverse||Rom.|13:10}}), the new-covenant \"law\" is considered to be based entirely upon love and to rescind Sabbath requirements.\n\n===Spiritual rest===\nNon-Sabbatarians who affirm that Sabbath-keeping remains for God's people (as in {{Bibleverse||Heb.|3:7-4:11}}) frequently regard this as present weeklong spiritual rest or future heavenly rest rather than as physical weekly rest. For instance, [[Irenaeus]] saw Sabbath rest from secular affairs for one day each week as a sign of the way that Christians were called to permanently devote themselves to God<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Against Heresies|volume=3.16.1|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vi.xvii.html}}</ref> and an eschatological symbol.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Against Heresies|volume=4.33.2|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.xxxiv.html}}</ref> One such interpretation of Hebrews states that seventh-day Sabbath is no longer relevant as a regular, literal day of rest, but instead is a [[typology (theology)|symbolic metaphor]] for the eternal salvation \"rest\" that Christians enjoy in Christ, which was in turn prefigured by the promised land of Canaan. {{quote|\"The NT indicates that the sabbath followed its own channel and found its goal in Christ's redemptive work [John 5:17, cf. 7:23, Colossians 2:16, Matthew 11:28\u201312:14, Hebrews 3:7\u20134:11]. It is true to the NT to say that the Mosaic sabbath as a legal and weekly matter was a temporary symbol of a more fundamental and comprehensive salvation, epitomized by and grounded in God's own creation sabbath, and brought to fulfillment (in already\u2013not yet fashion) in Christ's redemptive work. Believers are indeed to 'keep sabbath,' no longer by observance of a day of the week but now by the upholding of that to which it pointed: the gospel of the [Kingdom of God].\"<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Martin, R.

While first-day Sabbatarian practice declined during the 18th century, leaving few modern followers, its concern for stricter Sunday observances did have influence in the west, shaping the origin of the Christian Sabbath. The term no longer applies to a specific set of practices, but tends to be used to describe the general establishment of Sunday worship and rest observances within Christianity. It does not necessarily imply the displacement of the Sabbath itself, which is often recognized as remaining on Saturday. As such, the Christian Sabbath generally represents a reinterpretation of the meaning of the Sabbath in the light of Christian law, emphases of practice, and values.\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\nIn 1998 [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote an [[apostolic letter]] ''Dies Domini'',<ref>https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_05071998_dies-domini_en.html</ref> \"on keeping the Lord's day holy\". He encourages Catholics to remember the importance of keeping Sunday holy, urging that it not lose its meaning by being blended with a frivolous \"[[Workweek and weekend|weekend]]\" mentality.\n\nGoing beyond the traditional Catholic position and seeing to uphold the [[Lord's Day Act]] in [[French Quebec]], the Catholic Sunday League was formed in 1923 to promote first-day sabbatarian restrictions in the province, especially against movie theaters.<ref name=\"Roy2005\">{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|title=Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|url=https://archive.org/details/traditionalfesti0000royc/page/457|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9781576070895|page=[https://archive.org/details/traditionalfesti0000royc/page/457 457]|quote=However, an amendment was made that left is enforcement to the discretion of the provinces, so that it remained a dead letter in mostly French Quebec.

Is not the observance of this law among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday.

The Church and the Bible|page=72|date=1917}}. First published in 1876.</ref>|}}\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nOrthodox Sunday worship is not a direct Sabbath observance. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] observes the first day (liturgical Sunday, beginning Saturday evening) as a weekly feast, the remembrance of Christ's resurrection, and a mini-[[Easter|Pascha]]. As such, it tends to hold the first place within a week's observances, sharing that place only with other major feasts which occur from time to time. The Divine Liturgy is always celebrated, joining the participants on earth with those who offer the worship in God's kingdom, and hence joining the first day to the [[The eighth day (Christian)|eighth day]], wherein the communion of the whole Church with Christ is fully realized. As such, it is never surpassed as a time for the Orthodox to assemble in worship.\n\nThe Church affirms its authority to appoint the time of this feast (and all observances) as deriving from the authority given to the apostles and passed to the bishops through the [[laying-on of hands]], for the sake of the governance of the Church on earth, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit ({{bibleref2|John|20:22|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|John|14:26|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|Rom.|6:14-18|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|Rom.|7:6|NKJV}}). It does not treat Sunday worship as a transference of Sabbath worship, but identifies the Sabbath, still on Saturday, as a Biblical \"type\", a precursor, realized fully only after Christ's fulfillment of the Mosaic Law ({{bibleref2|Mat.|5:17-18|NKJV}}). Thus, the Sabbath and the Mosaic Law both remain as a teacher, reminding Christians to worship in holiness, but now according to grace, in Christian observations and Sunday worship.\n\nThe grace received in baptism binds the Church to Christ, Who has given his people the freedom to seek him directly in relationship, not to pursue whatever suits one's fancy. The goal of that freedom is always union with Christ in [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]], and the maintenance of that union all the time, throughout this life and into the next, which is sometimes described as the \"sanctification of time\". Grace therefore never permits of whatever is sinful or unhelpful to salvation, such as laziness or hedonistic revelry. Rather, it becomes a stricter guide for behavior than any legal code, even the Mosaic, and disciplines the believer in some degree of ascetic endeavor ({{bibleref2|Rom.|6:14-18|NKJV}}).<ref>{{citation |title=Orthodox Study Bible |publisher=St. Athanasius Academy of Orthodox Theology |year=2008 |page=1533 |ref=none}}</ref>\n\nOrthodoxy recognizes no mandated time for rest, a day or any other span, but the Church leads the individual to holiness in different ways, and recognizes the need for [[Economy (religion)|economy]] and for rest. Activities such as sleep, relaxation, and recreation become a matter of balance and proper handling, and acceptance of God's mercy. [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil the Great]] expresses thanks for this in a prayer often said by Orthodox Christians in the morning, after rising: \"You do we bless, O Most High God and Lord of mercy, ... Who has given unto us sleep for rest from our infirmity, and for repose of our much-toiling flesh.\"<ref>{{citation |title=A Prayer Book for Orthodox Christians |publisher=Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Boston, MA |year=1987 |p=7 |ref=none }}</ref> In recognition of God's gifts, therefore, the Church welcomes and supports civil laws that provide a day away from labor, which then become opportunities for Christians to pray, rest, and engage in acts of mercy. In grace do Christians respond, remembering both the example of the Sabbath rest, and Christ's lordship ({{bibleref2|Mk.|2:21-28}}).\n\n====Eastern Christianity and Saturday vs. Sunday observances====\nEastern Orthodox and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] distinguish between the \"Sabbath\" (Saturday) and the \"Lord's Day\" (Sunday), and both continue to play a special role for the faithful. Many parishes and monasteries will serve the [[Divine Liturgy]] on both Saturday morning and Sunday morning. The church never allows strict fasting on any Saturday (except [[Holy Saturday]]) or Sunday, and the fasting rules on those Saturdays and Sundays which fall during one of the fasting seasons (such as [[Great Lent]], [[Apostles' Fast]], etc.) are always relaxed to some degree. During Great Lent, when the celebration of the Liturgy is forbidden on weekdays, there is always Liturgy on Saturday as well as Sunday. The church also has a special cycle of Bible readings ([[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]]) for Saturdays and Sundays which is different from the cycle of readings allotted to weekdays. However, the Lord's Day, being a celebration of the Resurrection, is clearly given more emphasis. For instance, in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] Sunday is always observed with an [[all-night vigil]] on Saturday night, and in all of the Eastern Churches it is amplified with special hymns which are chanted only on Sunday. If a [[feast day]] falls on a Sunday it is always combined with the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|hymns for Sunday]] (unless it is a [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Lord's Great Feast]]). Saturday is celebrated as a sort of [[afterfeast]] for the previous Sunday, on which several of the hymns from the previous Sunday are repeated.\n\nIn part, Eastern Christians continue to celebrate Saturday as Sabbath because of its role in the history of salvation: it was on a Saturday that Jesus \"rested\" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|cave tomb]] after the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. For this reason also, Saturday is a day for general [[prayer for the dead|commemoration of the departed]], and special [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|requiem hymns]] are often chanted on this day. Orthodox Christians make time to help the poor and needy as well on this day.\n\n===Lutheranism===\n[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] founder [[Martin Luther]] stated \"I wonder exceedingly how it came to be imputed to me that I should reject the law of Ten Commandments...Whosoever abrogates the law must of necessity abrogate sin also.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Martin Luther, Spiritual Antichrist|pages=71\u20132}}</ref> The Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]], speaking of changes made by Roman Catholic pontiffs, states: \"They refer to the Sabbath-day as having been changed into the Lord's Day, contrary to the Decalog, as it seems. Neither is there any example whereof they make more than concerning the changing of the Sabbath-day.

Latter Day Saints believe this means performing no labor that would keep them from giving their full attention to spiritual matters (Ex. 20:10).

John Traske (1586\u20131636) and Thomas Brabourne first advocated seventh-day Sabbatarianism in England.

[[Jesus]]'s parable of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]] describes the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] as fasting \"twice a week\" (Greek ''dis tou sabbatou'', literally, \"twice of the Sabbath\").\n\nSeven annual Biblical festivals, called by the name ''[[miqra]]'' (\"called assembly\") in Hebrew and \"[[High Sabbaths|High Sabbath]]\" in English, serve as supplemental testimonies to Sabbath. These are recorded in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] and do not necessarily occur on the Sabbath. They are observed by Jews and a minority of Christians. Three of them occur in spring: the first and seventh days of [[Passover (Christian holiday)|Passover]], and [[Pentecost]]. Four occur in fall, in the seventh month, and are also called ''Shabbaton'': the [[Christian observances of Jewish holidays#Feast of Trumpets|Feast of Trumpets]]; [[Christian observances of Yom Kippur|Yom Kippur]], \"Sabbath of Sabbaths\"; and the first and eighth days of [[Christian observances of Jewish holidays#Feast of Tabernacles|Tabernacles]].\n\nThe year of ''[[Shmita]]'' (Hebrew \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4, literally, \"release\"), also called Sabbatical Year, is the seventh year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by the [[Torah]] for the [[Land of Israel]]. During ''Shmita'', the land is to be left to lie fallow. A second aspect of ''Shmita'' concerns debts and loans: when the year ends, personal debts are considered nullified and forgiven.\n\nJewish ''[[Shabbat]]'' is a weekly day of rest cognate to Christian Sabbath, observed from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night; it is also observed by a minority of Christians. Customarily, ''Shabbat'' is ushered in by lighting [[candle]]s shortly before sunset, at [[halakha|halakhicallly]] calculated times that change from week to week and from place to place.\n\nThe [[new moon]], occurring every 29 or 30 days, is an important separately sanctioned occasion in Judaism and some other faiths. It is not widely regarded as Sabbath, but some [[Hebrew Roots]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal churches]], such as the native New Israelites of Peru and the [[Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church]], do keep the day of the new moon as Sabbath or rest day, from evening to evening. New-moon services can last all day.\n\nIn [[South Africa]], Christian [[Boer]]s have celebrated December 16, the [[Day of the Vow]] (now called the [[Day of Reconciliation]], as annual Sabbath (holy day of thanksgiving) since 1838, commemorating a famous Boer victory over the [[Zulu Kingdom]].\n\nMany early Christian writers from the 2nd century, such as [[Epistle of Barnabas|pseudo-Barnabas]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] followed [[rabbinic Judaism]] (the ''Mishna'') in interpreting Sabbath not as a literal day of rest, but as a [[Millennialism|thousand-year reign]] of Jesus Christ, which would follow six millennia of world history.<ref name=Bauckham/>\n\nSecular use of \"Sabbath\" for \"rest day\", while it usually refers to Sunday, is often stated in [[North America]] to refer to different purposes for the rest day than those of [[Christendom]]. In ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'' (1961), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that contemporary [[Maryland]] [[blue law]]s (typically, Sunday rest laws) were intended to promote the secular values of \"health, safety, recreation, and general well-being\" through a common day of rest, and that this day coinciding with majority Christian Sabbath neither reduces its effectiveness for secular purposes nor prevents adherents of other religions from observing their own holy days.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gregorian calendar]]\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; First-day\n*{{cite book|last=Dawn|first=Marva J.|authorlink=Marva Dawn|title=Keeping the Sabbath Wholly: Ceasing, Resting, Embracing, Feasting|location=[[Grand Rapids]]|year=1989}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dawn|first=Marva J.|authorlink=Marva Dawn|title=The Sense of the Call: A Sabbath Way of Life for Those Who Serve God, the Church, and the World|year=2006}}\n*{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|edition=2d|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1997|author=United States Catholic Conference, Inc.|chapter=You Shall Love the Lord Your God with All Your Heart, and with All Your Soul, and with All Your Mind, Article 3, The Third Commandment|at=2168\u20132195}}\n\n; Seventh-day\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=From Sabbath to Sunday|publisher=Pontifical Gregorian University Press; Biblical Perspectives|year=1977|url=http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/books/sabbath_to_sunday/}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=Divine Rest for Human Restlessness|publisher=Biblical Perspectives|date=June 1980|url=http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/books/rest_restlessness/|isbn=978-99946-1-024-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=The Sabbath Under Crossfire: A Biblical Analysis Of Recent Sabbath/Sunday Developments|publisher=Biblical Perspectives|url=http://sdanet.org/atissue/sabbath/bacchiocchi.htm|year=1998}}\n*{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Desmond|authorlink=Desmond Ford|title=The Forgotten Day|year=1981}}\n*{{cite book|last=Strand|first=Kenneth A., ed.|title=The Sabbath in Scripture and History|date=July 1982|isbn=978-0-8280-0037-6|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association}}\n*{{cite book|last=Tonstad|first=Sigve K.|title=The Lost Meaning of the Seventh Day|date=November 2009|isbn=978-1-883925-65-9|location=[[Berrien Springs, Michigan]]|publisher=Andrews University Press|url=http://universitypress.andrews.edu/catalog.php?key=199}}\n\n; Non-Sabbatarian\n*{{cite book|title=Sabbatarianism Re-examined|authorlink=Robert Brinsmead|last=Brinsmead|first=Robert|publisher=Verdict Publishing 4:4|date=June 1981|url=http://www.exadventist.com/Home/Articles/sabbatarian/tabid/452/Default.aspx}}\n*{{cite book|last=Ratzlaff|first=Dale|authorlink=|first2=Don|last2=Muth|first3=Richard|last3=Tinker|first4=Richard|last4=Fredericks|title=Sabbath in Christ|year=2003|origyear=1990}}\n\n; Varying\n*{{cite book|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A.|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers/Zondervan|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cotton, John Paul.

Mostly [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Seventh-day Sabbatarians]], they broke away from their former churches to form communities that followed Seventh-day Sabbath-based practices that differed from the rest of Christianity, often also adopting a more literal interpretation of law, either Christian or Mosaic.\n\n==History==\n\n===Sabbath timing===\n{{See also|Shabbat}}\n\nThe Hebrew Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, is often spoken of loosely as \"Saturday\" but in the [[Hebrew calendar]] a day begins at sunset and not at midnight. The Sabbath therefore coincides with what is now commonly identified as Friday sunset to Saturday night when three stars are visible in the night sky. Similarly, the Hebrew first day of the week (\"Sunday\") extends from sunset on (in common parlance) Saturday evening to sunset on what is generally called Sunday evening. The Sabbath continued to be observed on the seventh day in the early Christian church.{{NoteTag|The civil calendar of the ancient Roman Empire, the [[Julian calendar]] (founded in 45 BC), marked days loosely in general practice, since the timing of midnight was difficult to determine widely at that time. Thus, the early church easily adopted for its own use the Hebrew calendar's sunset-to-sunset formula for marking the days, even after it began to calculate Easter according to the Julian calendar. Its daily cycle of church services began with Vespers, which was often celebrated just after sunset, in the early evening. This pattern made its way into both Roman and Eastern liturgical practice, and continues in use in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to this day.}} To this day, the liturgical day continues to be observed in line with the Hebrew reckoning in the church calendars in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].<ref>Canon of Holy Saturday (Orthodox), Kontakion: \"Exceeding blessed is this Sabbath, on which Christ has slumbered, to rise on the third day.\"</ref> In the [[Latin Church]], \"the liturgical day runs from midnight to midnight.

On March 7, 321, however, [[Constantine the Great|Roman Emperor Constantine I]] issued a civil decree making Sunday a day of rest from labor, stating:<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph Cullen|last=Ayer|title=A Source Book for Ancient Church History|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1913|volume=2.1.1.59g|pages=284\u20135}}</ref> {{quote|All judges and city people and the craftsmen shall rest upon the venerable day of the sun.

At Laodicea also, the Church encouraged Christians to make use of the day for Christian rest where possible,<ref name=Laodicea29/> without ascribing to it any of the regulation of Mosaic Law, and indeed, anathematizing Hebrew observance on the Sabbath. The civil law and its effects made possible a pattern in Church life that has been imitated throughout the centuries in many places and cultures, wherever possible.\n\n===From ancient times to Middle Ages===\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] followed the early patristic writers in spiritualizing the meaning of the Sabbath commandment, referring it to eschatological rest rather than observance of a literal day. Such writing, however, did serve to deepen the idea of Christian rest on Sunday, and its practice increased in prominence throughout the early [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=Bauckham3/>\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] is an expression of natural law which binds all men, and therefore the Sabbath commandment is a moral requirement along with the other nine. Thus in the West, Sunday rest became more closely associated with a Christian application of the Sabbath, a development towards the idea of a \"Christian Sabbath\" rather than a Hebrew one.<ref name=Bauckham3>{{cite book|chapter=Sabbath and Sunday in the Medieval Church in the West|first=R.J.|last=Bauckham|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|pages=299\u2013310|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers/Zondervan|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}</ref> While Sunday worship and Sunday rest combined powerfully to relate to Sabbath commandment precepts, the application of the commandment to Christian life was nevertheless a response within the law of liberty, not restricted to a single day but continuous, and not a displacement of the Sabbath in time.\n\n====Continuations of Hebrew practices====\n{{primary sources|section|date=September 2018}}\nSeventh-day Sabbath was observed at least sporadically by a minority of groups during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the early church in Ireland, there is evidence that a sabbath-rest on Saturday may have been kept along with mass on Sunday as the 'Lord's day'. It appears that many of the canon laws in Ireland from that period were derived from parts of the laws of Moses. In Adomnan of Iona's biography of [[St Columba]] it describes Columba's death by having Columba say on a Saturday 'Today is truly my sabbath, for it is my last day in this wearisome life, when I shall keep the Sabbath after my troublesome labours. At midnight this Sunday, as Scripture saith, \"I shall go the way of my fathers\"' and he then dies that night. The identification of this sabbath day as a Saturday in the narrative is clear in the context, because Columba is recorded as seeing an angel at the mass on the previous Sunday and the narrative claims he dies in the same week, on the sabbath day at the end of the week, during the 'Lord's night' (referring to Saturday night-Sunday morning).<ref>Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995</ref>\n\nAn Eastern body of Christian Sabbath-keepers mentioned from the 8th century to the 12th is called Athenians (\"touch-not\") because they abstained from uncleanness and intoxicating drinks, called Athinginians in Neander: \"This sect, which had its principal seat in the city of Armorion, in upper Phrygia, where many Jews resided, sprung out of a mixture of Judaism and Christianity. They united baptism with the observance of all the rites of Judaism, circumcision excepted. We may perhaps recognize a branch of the older Judaizing sects.<ref>Neander, fourth period, 6, 428.</ref>\n\nCardinal Hergenrother says that they stood in intimate relation with Emperor Michael II (AD 821-829), and testifies that they observed Sabbath.<ref>Kirchengeschichte, I, 527</ref> As late as the 11th century Cardinal Humbert still referred to the Nazarenes as a Sabbath-keeping Christian body existing at that time. But in the 10th and 11th centuries, there was a great extension of sects from the East to the West. Neander states that the corruption of the clergy furnished a most important vantage-ground on which to attack the dominant church. The abstemious life of these Christians, the simplicity and earnestness of their preaching and teaching, had their effect. \"Thus we find them emerging at once in the 11th century, in countries the most diverse, and the most remote from each other, in Italy, France, and even in the Harz districts in Germany.\" Likewise, also, \"traces of Sabbath-keepers are found in the times of Gregory I, Gregory VII, and in the 12th century in Lombardy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dedication.www3.50megs.com/historyofsabbath/hos_twentyone_b.html#027|title=SABBATH DURING THE DARK AGES|website=dedication.www3.50megs.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===\nThe [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches celebrate the Sabbath, a practice proselytised in the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] church in Ethiopia in the 1300s by [[Ewostatewos]] ({{lang-gez|\u12ee\u1235\u1323\u1274\u12ce\u1235}}, {{lang-grc|\u0395\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}}<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Marcus|first=Harold G.|title=A History of Ethiopia|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofethiopi00marc|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofethiopi00marc/page/24 24]|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08121-5}}</ref>).

The [[Puritans]] of England and Scotland brought a new rigorism into the observance of the Christian Lord's Day in reaction to the customary Sunday observance of the time, which they regarded as lax. They appealed to Sabbath ordinances with the idea that only the Bible can bind men's consciences on whether or how they will take a break from work, or to impose an obligation to meet at a particular time. Their influential reasoning spread to other denominations also, and it is primarily through their influence that \"Sabbath\" has become the colloquial equivalent of \"Lord's Day\" or \"Sunday\". Sunday Sabbatarianism is enshrined in its most mature expression, the ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' (1646), in the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theological tradition. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Chapter 21 (''Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day'') read:<blockquote>7. As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for the worship of God; so, in his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him: which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week, which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's day, and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.<br /><br />8. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe a holy rest, all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations, but also are taken up, the whole time, in the public and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_21|title=The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster|last=Assembly|first=Westminster}}</ref></blockquote>The confession holds that not only is work forbidden on Sunday, but also \"works, words, and thoughts\" about \"worldly employments and recreations.\" Instead, the whole day should be taken up with \"public and private exercises of [one's] worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Confession_of_Faith_of_the_Assembly_of_Divines_at_Westminster#Chapter_21|title=The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster|last=Assembly|first=Westminster}}</ref>\n\nStrict Sunday Sabbatarianism is sometimes called \"Puritan Sabbath\", which may be contrasted with \"Continental Sabbath\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=George|author-link=George Marsden|title=Understanding Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism|year=1991|publisher=[[William B.

This non-Sabbatarian interpretation usually states that Jesus's obedience and the [[New Covenant]] fulfilled the laws of Sabbath, the [[Ten Commandments]], and the [[Law of Moses]], which are thus considered not to be binding moral laws, and sometimes considered abolished or [[abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogated]]. While Sunday is often observed as the day of Christian assembly and worship, in accordance with church tradition, Sabbath commandments are dissociated from this practice.\n\nNon-Sabbatarian Christians also cite {{Bibleverse|2|Cor.|3:2-3}}, in which believers are compared to \"a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written ... not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts\"; this interpretation states that Christians accordingly no longer follow the Ten Commandments with dead orthodoxy (\"tablets of stone\"), but follow a new law written upon \"tablets of human hearts\". {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Cor.|3:7-11}} adds that \"if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory ..., will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? .... And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!\" This is interpreted as teaching that [[New Covenant]] Christians are not bound by the Mosaic Law, and that Sabbath-keeping is not required. Further, because \"love is the fulfillment of the law\" ({{Bibleverse||Rom.|13:10}}), the new-covenant \"law\" is considered to be based entirely upon love and to rescind Sabbath requirements.\n\n===Spiritual rest===\nNon-Sabbatarians who affirm that Sabbath-keeping remains for God's people (as in {{Bibleverse||Heb.|3:7-4:11}}) frequently regard this as present weeklong spiritual rest or future heavenly rest rather than as physical weekly rest. For instance, [[Irenaeus]] saw Sabbath rest from secular affairs for one day each week as a sign of the way that Christians were called to permanently devote themselves to God<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Against Heresies|volume=3.16.1|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vi.xvii.html}}</ref> and an eschatological symbol.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Against Heresies|volume=4.33.2|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.xxxiv.html}}</ref> One such interpretation of Hebrews states that seventh-day Sabbath is no longer relevant as a regular, literal day of rest, but instead is a [[typology (theology)|symbolic metaphor]] for the eternal salvation \"rest\" that Christians enjoy in Christ, which was in turn prefigured by the promised land of Canaan. {{quote|\"The NT indicates that the sabbath followed its own channel and found its goal in Christ's redemptive work [John 5:17, cf. 7:23, Colossians 2:16, Matthew 11:28\u201312:14, Hebrews 3:7\u20134:11]. It is true to the NT to say that the Mosaic sabbath as a legal and weekly matter was a temporary symbol of a more fundamental and comprehensive salvation, epitomized by and grounded in God's own creation sabbath, and brought to fulfillment (in already\u2013not yet fashion) in Christ's redemptive work. Believers are indeed to 'keep sabbath,' no longer by observance of a day of the week but now by the upholding of that to which it pointed: the gospel of the [Kingdom of God].\"<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Martin, R.

While first-day Sabbatarian practice declined during the 18th century, leaving few modern followers, its concern for stricter Sunday observances did have influence in the west, shaping the origin of the Christian Sabbath. The term no longer applies to a specific set of practices, but tends to be used to describe the general establishment of Sunday worship and rest observances within Christianity. It does not necessarily imply the displacement of the Sabbath itself, which is often recognized as remaining on Saturday. As such, the Christian Sabbath generally represents a reinterpretation of the meaning of the Sabbath in the light of Christian law, emphases of practice, and values.\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\nIn 1998 [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote an [[apostolic letter]] ''Dies Domini'',<ref>https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_05071998_dies-domini_en.html</ref> \"on keeping the Lord's day holy\". He encourages Catholics to remember the importance of keeping Sunday holy, urging that it not lose its meaning by being blended with a frivolous \"[[Workweek and weekend|weekend]]\" mentality.\n\nGoing beyond the traditional Catholic position and seeing to uphold the [[Lord's Day Act]] in [[French Quebec]], the Catholic Sunday League was formed in 1923 to promote first-day sabbatarian restrictions in the province, especially against movie theaters.<ref name=\"Roy2005\">{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|title=Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|url=https://archive.org/details/traditionalfesti0000royc/page/457|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9781576070895|page=[https://archive.org/details/traditionalfesti0000royc/page/457 457]|quote=However, an amendment was made that left is enforcement to the discretion of the provinces, so that it remained a dead letter in mostly French Quebec.

The [[Lord's Day]] is considered both the first day and the 'eighth day' of the [[week]], symbolizing both first creation and new creation (2174).<ref name=ccc>U.S. Catholic Conference 1997, pp. 580\u20136.</ref> Roman Catholics view the first day as a day for assembly for worship (2178, {{bibleref2|Heb.|10:25}}),<ref name=ccc/> but consider a day of rigorous rest not obligatory on Christians ({{bibleref2|Rom.|14:5}}, {{bibleref2|Col.|2:16}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=Sabbath|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia |year=1913 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287b.htm}}</ref> Catholic recommendations to rest on Sunday do not hinder participation in \"ordinary and innocent occupations\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Sabbatarians|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|year=1913|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13287a.htm}}</ref> In the spirit of the Sabbath, Catholics ought to observe a day of rest from servile work, which also becomes \"a day of protest against the servitude of work and the worship of money\" (Catholic Catechism 2172).

The Church and the Bible|page=72|date=1917}}. First published in 1876.</ref>|}}\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nOrthodox Sunday worship is not a direct Sabbath observance. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] observes the first day (liturgical Sunday, beginning Saturday evening) as a weekly feast, the remembrance of Christ's resurrection, and a mini-[[Easter|Pascha]]. As such, it tends to hold the first place within a week's observances, sharing that place only with other major feasts which occur from time to time. The Divine Liturgy is always celebrated, joining the participants on earth with those who offer the worship in God's kingdom, and hence joining the first day to the [[The eighth day (Christian)|eighth day]], wherein the communion of the whole Church with Christ is fully realized. As such, it is never surpassed as a time for the Orthodox to assemble in worship.\n\nThe Church affirms its authority to appoint the time of this feast (and all observances) as deriving from the authority given to the apostles and passed to the bishops through the [[laying-on of hands]], for the sake of the governance of the Church on earth, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit ({{bibleref2|John|20:22|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|John|14:26|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|Rom.|6:14-18|NKJV}}, {{bibleref2|Rom.|7:6|NKJV}}). It does not treat Sunday worship as a transference of Sabbath worship, but identifies the Sabbath, still on Saturday, as a Biblical \"type\", a precursor, realized fully only after Christ's fulfillment of the Mosaic Law ({{bibleref2|Mat.|5:17-18|NKJV}}). Thus, the Sabbath and the Mosaic Law both remain as a teacher, reminding Christians to worship in holiness, but now according to grace, in Christian observations and Sunday worship.\n\nThe grace received in baptism binds the Church to Christ, Who has given his people the freedom to seek him directly in relationship, not to pursue whatever suits one's fancy. The goal of that freedom is always union with Christ in [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]], and the maintenance of that union all the time, throughout this life and into the next, which is sometimes described as the \"sanctification of time\". Grace therefore never permits of whatever is sinful or unhelpful to salvation, such as laziness or hedonistic revelry. Rather, it becomes a stricter guide for behavior than any legal code, even the Mosaic, and disciplines the believer in some degree of ascetic endeavor ({{bibleref2|Rom.|6:14-18|NKJV}}).<ref>{{citation |title=Orthodox Study Bible |publisher=St. Athanasius Academy of Orthodox Theology |year=2008 |page=1533 |ref=none}}</ref>\n\nOrthodoxy recognizes no mandated time for rest, a day or any other span, but the Church leads the individual to holiness in different ways, and recognizes the need for [[Economy (religion)|economy]] and for rest. Activities such as sleep, relaxation, and recreation become a matter of balance and proper handling, and acceptance of God's mercy. [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil the Great]] expresses thanks for this in a prayer often said by Orthodox Christians in the morning, after rising: \"You do we bless, O Most High God and Lord of mercy, ... Who has given unto us sleep for rest from our infirmity, and for repose of our much-toiling flesh.\"<ref>{{citation |title=A Prayer Book for Orthodox Christians |publisher=Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Boston, MA |year=1987 |p=7 |ref=none }}</ref> In recognition of God's gifts, therefore, the Church welcomes and supports civil laws that provide a day away from labor, which then become opportunities for Christians to pray, rest, and engage in acts of mercy. In grace do Christians respond, remembering both the example of the Sabbath rest, and Christ's lordship ({{bibleref2|Mk.|2:21-28}}).\n\n====Eastern Christianity and Saturday vs. Sunday observances====\nEastern Orthodox and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] distinguish between the \"Sabbath\" (Saturday) and the \"Lord's Day\" (Sunday), and both continue to play a special role for the faithful. Many parishes and monasteries will serve the [[Divine Liturgy]] on both Saturday morning and Sunday morning. The church never allows strict fasting on any Saturday (except [[Holy Saturday]]) or Sunday, and the fasting rules on those Saturdays and Sundays which fall during one of the fasting seasons (such as [[Great Lent]], [[Apostles' Fast]], etc.) are always relaxed to some degree. During Great Lent, when the celebration of the Liturgy is forbidden on weekdays, there is always Liturgy on Saturday as well as Sunday. The church also has a special cycle of Bible readings ([[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]]) for Saturdays and Sundays which is different from the cycle of readings allotted to weekdays. However, the Lord's Day, being a celebration of the Resurrection, is clearly given more emphasis. For instance, in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] Sunday is always observed with an [[all-night vigil]] on Saturday night, and in all of the Eastern Churches it is amplified with special hymns which are chanted only on Sunday. If a [[feast day]] falls on a Sunday it is always combined with the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|hymns for Sunday]] (unless it is a [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Lord's Great Feast]]). Saturday is celebrated as a sort of [[afterfeast]] for the previous Sunday, on which several of the hymns from the previous Sunday are repeated.\n\nIn part, Eastern Christians continue to celebrate Saturday as Sabbath because of its role in the history of salvation: it was on a Saturday that Jesus \"rested\" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|cave tomb]] after the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. For this reason also, Saturday is a day for general [[prayer for the dead|commemoration of the departed]], and special [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|requiem hymns]] are often chanted on this day. Orthodox Christians make time to help the poor and needy as well on this day.\n\n===Lutheranism===\n[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] founder [[Martin Luther]] stated \"I wonder exceedingly how it came to be imputed to me that I should reject the law of Ten Commandments...Whosoever abrogates the law must of necessity abrogate sin also.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Martin Luther, Spiritual Antichrist|pages=71\u20132}}</ref> The Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]], speaking of changes made by Roman Catholic pontiffs, states: \"They refer to the Sabbath-day as having been changed into the Lord's Day, contrary to the Decalog, as it seems.

Latter Day Saints believe this means performing no labor that would keep them from giving their full attention to spiritual matters (Ex. 20:10). LDS prophets have described this as meaning they should not shop, hunt, fish, attend sports events, or participate in similar activities on that day. Elder [[Spencer W.

Seventh-day Sabbatarianism has been criticized as an effort to combine [[Old Testament]] laws, practiced in Judaism, with [[Christianity]], or to revive the [[Judaizers]] of the [[Epistle]]s or the [[Ebionites]].\n\n[[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Seventh-day Sabbatarians]] practice a strict seventh-day Sabbath observance, similar to ''[[Shabbat]]'' in Judaism. John Traske (1586\u20131636) and Thomas Brabourne first advocated seventh-day Sabbatarianism in England. Their ideas gave rise to the [[Seventh Day Baptists]], formed in early 17th-century in England. Samuel and Tacy Hubbard began the first American congregation on [[Rhode Island]] in 1671.\n\n[[Grace Communion International]] ([[Armstrongism]]) taught seventh-day Sabbath observance. The [[United Church of God]] teaches seventh-day Sabbath observance.\n\n===Seventh-day Adventist Church===\n[[File:Calhoun SDA Church.JPG|thumb|A Seventh-day Adventist Church.]]\n{{See also|Seventh-day Adventist worship|Armstrongism|Seventh-day Adventist eschatology}}\n\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] arose in the mid-19th century in America after [[Rachel Oakes Preston|Rachel Oakes]], a Seventh Day Baptist, gave a [[tract (literature)|tract]] about the Sabbath to an Adventist [[Millerism|Millerite]], who passed it on to [[Ellen G. White]].\n\nFundamental Belief # 20 of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] states: {{quote|The beneficent Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of Creation. The fourth commandment of God's unchangeable law requires the observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one another. It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our eternal future in God's kingdom. The Sabbath is God's perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and His people. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, sunset to sunset, is a celebration of God's creative and redemptive acts.

[[Jesus]]'s parable of the [[Pharisee and the Publican]] describes the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] as fasting \"twice a week\" (Greek ''dis tou sabbatou'', literally, \"twice of the Sabbath\").\n\nSeven annual Biblical festivals, called by the name ''[[miqra]]'' (\"called assembly\") in Hebrew and \"[[High Sabbaths|High Sabbath]]\" in English, serve as supplemental testimonies to Sabbath. These are recorded in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] and do not necessarily occur on the Sabbath. They are observed by Jews and a minority of Christians. Three of them occur in spring: the first and seventh days of [[Passover (Christian holiday)|Passover]], and [[Pentecost]]. Four occur in fall, in the seventh month, and are also called ''Shabbaton'': the [[Christian observances of Jewish holidays#Feast of Trumpets|Feast of Trumpets]]; [[Christian observances of Yom Kippur|Yom Kippur]], \"Sabbath of Sabbaths\"; and the first and eighth days of [[Christian observances of Jewish holidays#Feast of Tabernacles|Tabernacles]].\n\nThe year of ''[[Shmita]]'' (Hebrew \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4, literally, \"release\"), also called Sabbatical Year, is the seventh year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by the [[Torah]] for the [[Land of Israel]]. During ''Shmita'', the land is to be left to lie fallow. A second aspect of ''Shmita'' concerns debts and loans: when the year ends, personal debts are considered nullified and forgiven.\n\nJewish ''[[Shabbat]]'' is a weekly day of rest cognate to Christian Sabbath, observed from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night; it is also observed by a minority of Christians. Customarily, ''Shabbat'' is ushered in by lighting [[candle]]s shortly before sunset, at [[halakha|halakhicallly]] calculated times that change from week to week and from place to place.\n\nThe [[new moon]], occurring every 29 or 30 days, is an important separately sanctioned occasion in Judaism and some other faiths. It is not widely regarded as Sabbath, but some [[Hebrew Roots]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal churches]], such as the native New Israelites of Peru and the [[Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church]], do keep the day of the new moon as Sabbath or rest day, from evening to evening. New-moon services can last all day.\n\nIn [[South Africa]], Christian [[Boer]]s have celebrated December 16, the [[Day of the Vow]] (now called the [[Day of Reconciliation]], as annual Sabbath (holy day of thanksgiving) since 1838, commemorating a famous Boer victory over the [[Zulu Kingdom]].\n\nMany early Christian writers from the 2nd century, such as [[Epistle of Barnabas|pseudo-Barnabas]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] followed [[rabbinic Judaism]] (the ''Mishna'') in interpreting Sabbath not as a literal day of rest, but as a [[Millennialism|thousand-year reign]] of Jesus Christ, which would follow six millennia of world history.<ref name=Bauckham/>\n\nSecular use of \"Sabbath\" for \"rest day\", while it usually refers to Sunday, is often stated in [[North America]] to refer to different purposes for the rest day than those of [[Christendom]]. In ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'' (1961), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that contemporary [[Maryland]] [[blue law]]s (typically, Sunday rest laws) were intended to promote the secular values of \"health, safety, recreation, and general well-being\" through a common day of rest, and that this day coinciding with majority Christian Sabbath neither reduces its effectiveness for secular purposes nor prevents adherents of other religions from observing their own holy days.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gregorian calendar]]\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; First-day\n*{{cite book|last=Dawn|first=Marva J.|authorlink=Marva Dawn|title=Keeping the Sabbath Wholly: Ceasing, Resting, Embracing, Feasting|location=[[Grand Rapids]]|year=1989}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dawn|first=Marva J.|authorlink=Marva Dawn|title=The Sense of the Call: A Sabbath Way of Life for Those Who Serve God, the Church, and the World|year=2006}}\n*{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|edition=2d|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1997|author=United States Catholic Conference, Inc.|chapter=You Shall Love the Lord Your God with All Your Heart, and with All Your Soul, and with All Your Mind, Article 3, The Third Commandment|at=2168\u20132195}}\n\n; Seventh-day\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=From Sabbath to Sunday|publisher=Pontifical Gregorian University Press; Biblical Perspectives|year=1977|url=http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/books/sabbath_to_sunday/}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=Divine Rest for Human Restlessness|publisher=Biblical Perspectives|date=June 1980|url=http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/books/rest_restlessness/|isbn=978-99946-1-024-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bacchiocchi|first=Samuele|authorlink=Samuele Bacchiocchi|title=The Sabbath Under Crossfire: A Biblical Analysis Of Recent Sabbath/Sunday Developments|publisher=Biblical Perspectives|url=http://sdanet.org/atissue/sabbath/bacchiocchi.htm|year=1998}}\n*{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Desmond|authorlink=Desmond Ford|title=The Forgotten Day|year=1981}}\n*{{cite book|last=Strand|first=Kenneth A., ed.|title=The Sabbath in Scripture and History|date=July 1982|isbn=978-0-8280-0037-6|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association}}\n*{{cite book|last=Tonstad|first=Sigve K.|title=The Lost Meaning of the Seventh Day|date=November 2009|isbn=978-1-883925-65-9|location=[[Berrien Springs, Michigan]]|publisher=Andrews University Press|url=http://universitypress.andrews.edu/catalog.php?key=199}}\n\n; Non-Sabbatarian\n*{{cite book|title=Sabbatarianism Re-examined|authorlink=Robert Brinsmead|last=Brinsmead|first=Robert|publisher=Verdict Publishing 4:4|date=June 1981|url=http://www.exadventist.com/Home/Articles/sabbatarian/tabid/452/Default.aspx}}\n*{{cite book|last=Ratzlaff|first=Dale|authorlink=|first2=Don|last2=Muth|first3=Richard|last3=Tinker|first4=Richard|last4=Fredericks|title=Sabbath in Christ|year=2003|origyear=1990}}\n\n; Varying\n*{{cite book|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A.|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers/Zondervan|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cotton, John Paul.

It portrays the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a wild [[beekeeper]] in the remote mountainous village of Bekirlija, [[North Macedonia]], and follows her lifestyle before and after neighbors move in next door. Although initially planned as a short film documenting the region surrounding the river [[Bregalnica]], the documentary's area of focus changed course when directors met Hatid\u017ee. ''Honeyland'' received its world premiere at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January and it has grossed $1,140,879.\n\nFilming of ''Honeyland'' lasted three years, with directors collecting a total of four hundred hours of footage. Several [[environmentalism|environmental topics]] are explored, such as [[climate change]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[exploitation of natural resources]]. Primarily focusing on the visual aspects, the directors wanted to portray humanity's balance with the [[ecosystem]] through Hatid\u017ee and [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]] through her neighbors. The documentary also portrays the protagonist's relationship with her bedridden mother and neighbors. ''Honeyland'' contains elements of several documentary styles, including [[fly on the wall]], [[direct cinema]], and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]. \n\n''Honeyland'' received universal critical acclaim from film critics who praised attention to detail and applauded the message of conservation of nature. The documentary received numerous awards and nominations at film festivals, including three awards at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] and two nominations at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] in the categories for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]]. ''Honeyland'' marked the first documentary in history to receive a nomination in both categories in the history of the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\n''Honeyland'' documents the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a Macedonian wild [[beekeeping|beekeeper]] of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Turkish]] descent who lives in the village of Bekirlija in the [[Lozovo Municipality|municipality of Lozovo]]. She is one of the last remaining wild beekeepers in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Europe]]. Due to its location in a secluded mountain, the village has no access to electricity or running water. Hatid\u017ee lives with her 85-year-old partly blind bedridden mother, Nazife, who is completely dependent on her daughter. She earns a living by selling honey in the country's capital [[Skopje]] which is four hours away from the village. \n\nChanges in the village are brought upon by the arrival of the nomadic rancher Hussein Sam, who arrives with a trailer along with his wife Ljutvie, their seven children and their imported domestic animals.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-2020-north-macedonia-selects-honeyland-best-international-feature-category-1234863|title=Oscars: North Macedonia Selects 'Honeyland' for Best International Feature Category|last=Holdsworth|first=Nick|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/106712-living-and-working-with-each-other-for-those-three-years-in-almost-unbearable-life-conditions-directors-ljubo-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-honeyland/|title=\"Living and Working with Each Other for Those Three Years in Almost Unbearable Life Conditions\": Directors Ljubo Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska {{!}} Honeyland|website=Filmmaker|date=28 January 2019|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Initially, Hatid\u017ee maintains good relationships with the family and bonds with the children who frequently invade her privacy. In need of financial means, and inspired by Hatid\u017ee's way of earning money, Sam takes an interest in wild beekeeping himself. Hatid\u017ee instructs him on collecting honey and provides him with several bees so Sam can start his own colony. Despite being initially successful at beekeeping, Sam receives a demand by a customer to provide him with more honey than his bees can produce. Sam disregards Hatid\u017ee's advice of always leaving half of the honey to the bee and proceeds to sell the entire honey his beehives produce. This leads to Sam's colonies attacking Hatid\u017ee's during the resource-scarce winter period, thus bringing an end to her trade. Hatid\u017ee scolds Sam for not following her advice as she finds her bee colony collapsing. Soon after, her mother passes away. As the nomadic family decides to move on to the next village, Hatid\u017ee remains alone in Bekirlija.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/62254-honeyland-documentary-science-golden-rule|title=Oscar-nominated doc 'Honeyland' teaches a golden rule, rooted in science|work=Inverse.com|first=Sarah|last=Slota|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n[[File:Bregalnica River.JPG|thumb|left|The film was originally planned as a documentary short about preserving the region surrounding river [[Bregalnica]] (''pictured'').]]\n''Honeyland'' marks [[Tamara Kotevska]]'s and [[Ljubomir Stefanov]]'s second collaboration on a documentary movie after ''Lake of Apples'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eagan |first1=Daniel |title='It's a Choice: To Be a Filmmaker or a Human': Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska on Honeyland |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/107983-its-a-choice-to-be-a-filmmaker-or-a-human-ljubomir-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-on-honeyland/#.XhyTzFNKgWo |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The movie was originally intended as [[documentary short]] financially supported by the government.

It portrays the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a wild [[beekeeper]] in the remote mountainous village of Bekirlija, [[North Macedonia]], and follows her lifestyle before and after neighbors move in next door. Although initially planned as a short film documenting the region surrounding the river [[Bregalnica]], the documentary's area of focus changed course when directors met Hatid\u017ee. ''Honeyland'' received its world premiere at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January and it has grossed $1,140,879.\n\nFilming of ''Honeyland'' lasted for three years, with directors collecting a total of four hundred hours of footage. Several [[environmentalism|environmental topics]] are explored, such as [[climate change]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[exploitation of natural resources]]. Primarily focusing on the visual aspects, the directors wanted to portray humanity's balance with the [[ecosystem]] through Hatid\u017ee and [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]] through her neighbours. The documentary also portrays the protagonist's relationship with her bedridden mother and her neighbors. ''Honeyland'' contains elements of several documentary styles, including [[fly on the wall]], [[direct cinema]], and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]. \n\n''Honeyland'' received universal critical acclaim from film critics who praised attention to detail and applauded the promotion of conservation of nature. The documentary received numerous awards and nominations at film festivals, including three awards at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] and two nominations at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] in the categories for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]]. ''Honeyland'' marked the first documentary in history to receive a nomination in both categories in the history of the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\n''Honeyland'' documents the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a Macedonian wild [[beekeeping|beekeeper]] of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Turkish]] descent who lives in the village of Bekirlija in the [[Lozovo Municipality|municipality of Lozovo]]. She is one of the last remaining wild beekeepers in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Europe]]. Due to its location in a secluded mountain, the village has no access to electricity or running water. Hatid\u017ee lives with her 85-year-old partly blind bedridden mother, Nazife, who is completely dependent on her daughter. She earns a living by selling honey in the country's capital [[Skopje]] which is four hours away from the village. \n\nChanges in the village are brought upon by the arrival of the nomadic rancher Hussein Sam, who arrives with a trailer along with his wife Ljutvie, their seven children and their imported domestic animals.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-2020-north-macedonia-selects-honeyland-best-international-feature-category-1234863|title=Oscars: North Macedonia Selects 'Honeyland' for Best International Feature Category|last=Holdsworth|first=Nick|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/106712-living-and-working-with-each-other-for-those-three-years-in-almost-unbearable-life-conditions-directors-ljubo-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-honeyland/|title=\"Living and Working with Each Other for Those Three Years in Almost Unbearable Life Conditions\": Directors Ljubo Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska {{!}} Honeyland|website=Filmmaker|date=28 January 2019|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Initially, Hatid\u017ee maintains good relationships with the family and bonds with the children who frequently invade her privacy. In need of financial means, and inspired by Hatid\u017ee's way of earning money, Sam takes an interest in wild beekeeping himself. Hatid\u017ee instructs him on collecting honey and provides him with several bees so Sam can start his own colony. Despite being initially successful at beekeeping, Sam receives a demand by a customer to provide him with more honey than his bees can produce. Sam disregards Hatid\u017ee's advice of always leaving half of the honey to the bee and proceeds to sell the entire honey his beehives produce. This leads to Sam's colonies attacking Hatid\u017ee's during the resource-scarce winter period, thus bringing an end to her trade. Hatid\u017ee scolds Sam for not following her advice as she finds her bee colony collapsing. Soon after, her mother passes away. As the nomadic family decides to move on to the next village, Hatid\u017ee remains alone in Bekirlija.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/62254-honeyland-documentary-science-golden-rule|title=Oscar-nominated doc 'Honeyland' teaches a golden rule, rooted in science|work=Inverse.com|first=Sarah|last=Slota|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n[[File:Bregalnica River.JPG|thumb|left|The film was originally planned as a documentary short about preserving the region surrounding river [[Bregalnica]] (''pictured'').]]\n''Honeyland'' marks [[Tamara Kotevska]]'s and [[Ljubomir Stefanov]]'s second collaboration on a documentary movie after ''Lake of Apples'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eagan |first1=Daniel |title='It's a Choice: To Be a Filmmaker or a Human': Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska on Honeyland |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/107983-its-a-choice-to-be-a-filmmaker-or-a-human-ljubomir-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-on-honeyland/#.XhyTzFNKgWo |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The movie was originally intended as [[documentary short]] financially supported by the government.

Starting the 2014 season Premier Division is organized again by PT Liga Indonesia after the dissolution of LPIS.\n\nPrior to the formation of Indonesia Super League in 2008, Premier Division was the Indonesian top-flight football league.

2''' ([[English language|English]]: ''League Two'') is the second-tier of the [[Indonesian football league system|football competition system in Indonesia]], organized by [[PSSI]]. Before 2017, this competition was named the Liga Indonesia Premier Division (from 1994 to 2007, it was the top-tier division in the [[Indonesian football league system]]).<ref name=\"pd-l2\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.bola.net/indonesia/pssi-ubah-isl-jadi-liga-1-6a5497.html|title=PSSI Ubah ISL Jadi Liga 1|publisher=Bola.net |date=20 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe competition is usually divided into several groups because of geographic and number of participants factors.\n\nAs a result of continuing conflict between PT Liga Indonesia (LI) and PT Liga Prima Indonesia Sportindo (LPIS), there were two different Liga Indonesia Premier Division being organized for 2011\u201312 and 2013 season, one for the [[Liga 1 (Indonesia)|Indonesia Super League]] and the other for [[Indonesian Premier League]]. Starting the 2014 season Premier Division is organized again by PT Liga Indonesia after the dissolution of LPIS.\n\nPrior to the formation of Indonesia Super League in 2008, Premier Division was the Indonesian top-flight football league. Along with Indonesia Super League, Premier Division is a fully professional competition.\n\nIn January 2017, PSSI renamed the competition to Liga 2.<ref name=\"pd-l2\" />\n\n==Current members==\n<section begin=map />{{location map+ |Indonesia |float=none |width=1000 |caption=Locations of the 2019 Liga 2 teams (Red: West Region, Blue: East Region) |places=\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-2.1047222|long=106.1030841|label=[[BaBel United F.C.|{{nowrap|BaBel United}}]] |label_size=80 |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-6.910763 |long=107.6733961|label=[[Persib Bandung B|{{nowrap|Persib B}}]] |label_size=80 |position=top |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-5.9960614|long=106.0379432|label=[[Cilegon United F.C.|{{nowrap|Cilegon United}}]] |label_size=80 |position=left |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-6.1182102|long=106.1741832|label=[[Perserang Serang|Perserang]] |label_size=80 |position=bottom |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-6.9012853|long=109.7144096|label=[[Persibat Batang|Persibat]] |label_size=80 |position=top |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=5.5649576 |long=95.3384371 |label=[[Persiraja Banda Aceh|Persiraja]] |label_size=80 |position=top |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-6.2585714|long=106.6020648|label=[[Persita Tangerang|Persita]] |label_size=80 |position=top |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-7.6955298|long=109.0318233|label=[[PSCS Cilacap|PSCS]] |label_size=80 |position=bottom |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-7.3340651|long=108.3542915|label=[[PSGC Ciamis|PSGC]] |label_size=80 |position=left |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=3.5648384 |long=98.6934613 |label=[[PSMS Medan|PSMS]] |label_size=80 |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=0.5726609 |long=101.4279082|label=[[PSPS Riau|PSPS]] |label_size=80 |position=bottom |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-3.0214126|long=104.7869512|label=[[Sriwijaya F.C.|Sriwijaya]] |label_size=80 |position=bottom |mark=Red pog.svg}}\n\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-7.016739 |long=113.874082 |label=[[Madura F.C.|Madura]] |label_size=80 |position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-3.436455 |long=114.8745851|label=[[Martapura F.C.|Martapura]] |label_size=80 |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-0.411305 |long=116.9805811|label=[[Mitra Kukar F.C.|{{nowrap|Mitra Kukar}}]] |label_size=80 |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-6.9250191|long=112.0899227|label=[[Persatu Tuban|Persatu]] |label_size=80 |position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-7.6483494|long=112.9072519|label=[[Persewar Waropen|Persewar]] |label_size=80 |position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-1.233363 |long=116.941071 |label=[[Persiba Balikpapan|Persiba]] |label_size=80 |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-7.8171121|long=112.0265904|label=[[Persik Kediri|Persik]] |label_size=80 |position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-7.6309674|long=111.5274923|label=[[Persis Solo|Persis]] |label_size=80 |position=left |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-1.1798394|long=136.0848154|label=[[PSBS Biak Numfor|PSBS]] |label_size=80 |position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=-7.7959371|long=110.3821   |label=[[PSIM Yogyakarta|PSIM]] |label_size=80 |position=bottom |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n{{location map~ |Indonesia |lat=1.4587713 |long=124.8335737|label=[[Sulut United F.C.|{{nowrap|Sulut United}}]] |label_size=80 |position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n}}<section end=map />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
