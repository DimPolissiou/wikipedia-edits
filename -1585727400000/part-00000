The second king of the [[Sargonid dynasty]], Sennacherib is among the most famous of all [[List of Assyrian kings|Assyrian kings]] due to the role he plays in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]], which describes his [[Sennacherib's campaign in the Levant|war in the Levant]].'''{{Sfn|Mark|2014|p=}}''' Other events of his reign which have made him remembered throughout the millennia following his death include his 689 BC destruction of the city [[Babylon]] and his construction of the last great [[Assyria]]n capital, [[Nineveh]].\n\nAlthough Sennacherib was one of the most powerful and wide-ranging of all the Assyrian kings,{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=89}} he faced considerable difficulty in controlling [[Babylonia]], which formed the southern portion of his empire. Many of Sennacherib's Babylonian troubles stemmed from the [[Chaldea]]n tribal chief [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]], who had been [[List of kings of Babylon|Babylon's king]] until he was defeated by Sennacherib's father. Shortly after Sennacherib inherited the throne, Marduk-apla-iddina retook Babylon and allied with the [[Elamites]]. Though Sennacherib retook the south in 700 BC, Marduk-apla-iddina continued to trouble him, probably instigating Assyrian vassals in the [[Levant]] to rebel and successfully convincing Sennacherib's vassal king in Babylonia, [[Bel-ibni]], to also throw off Sennacherib's rule. After the Babylonians and Elamites captured Sennacherib's eldest son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]], another noble Sennacherib proclaimed as his vassal king in Babylon, Sennacherib campaigned in both regions, successfully subduing Elam. Because Babylon, well within his own territory, had been the target of most of his military campaigns and had caused the death of his son, Sennacherib [[Siege of Babylon|destroyed the city]] in 689 BC.\n\nThe Levantine war of 701 BC was made necessary because several Assyrian vassals in the region decided to rebel, either because they were encouraged by Marduk-apla-iddina or because the ill omens associated with the battlefield death of Sennacherib's father. Though the northern Levant was subdued relatively quickly, the states in the southern Levant, especially the [[Kingdom of Judah]] under King [[Hezekiah]], did not submit as easily. The Assyrians thus invaded Palestine, a campaign which is recorded not only in Sennacherib's own accounts but also in the [[Second Book of Kings]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Though the biblical narrative has Sennacherib's [[Assyrian siege of Jerusalem|attack on Jerusalem]] defeated through divine intervention by an [[angel]] destroying the Assyrian army, an outright Assyrian defeat is unlikely as Hezekiah submitted to Sennacherib at the end of the campaign.\n\nSennacherib transferred the capital of the Assyria to Nineveh, where he had spent most of his time as crown prince. In order to transform Nineveh into a capital worthy of his empire, the city was the site of one of the most ambitious building projects in ancient history. He expanded the size of the city, constructed great city walls, numerous temples and a great royal garden. His most famous work in the city is the Southwest Palace, a large palace which Sennacherib himself called the \"Palace without Rival\".\n\nAfter his eldest son and crown prince Ashur-nadin-shumi was killed by the Elamites, Sennacherib's new heir had originally been the second eldest surviving son, [[Arda-Mulissu]]. For unknown reasons, Arda-Mulissu was replaced as heir in 684 BC by a younger son, [[Esarhaddon]], a decision Sennacherib maintained despite repeated appeals by Arda-Mulissu to be accepted as heir again. In 681 BC, Arda-Mulissu and another of Sennacherib's sons assaulted and murdered the king, hoping to seize power for themselves. In Babylonia and the Levant, Sennacherib's death was welcomed as divine punishment whilst the reaction in the Assyrian heartland was probably resentment and horror. Arda-Mulissu's coronation was postponed and in the meantime, Esarhaddon raised an army and successfully seized Nineveh, becoming king as intended by Sennacherib's succession plans.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Ancestry and early life ===\n[[File:Deportation_of_Jews_by_Assyrians.svg|left|thumb|Expansion of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], and the [[Resettlement policy of the Neo-Assyrian Empire|deportations]] of [[Jews]] from the [[Levant]], under the reigns of Sennacherib's three immediate predecessors as king; [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser V]] and [[Sargon II]].]]\nSennacherib was the son and successor of the Neo-Assyrian king [[Sargon II]], who had reigned as [[king of Assyria]] from 722 to 705 BC and as [[king of Babylon]] from 710 to 705 BC. The identity of Sennacherib's mother is not entirely certain. Though the most popular view historically has been that Sennacherib was the son of Sargon's wife [[Ataliya]], this is probably impossible. To be the mother of Sennacherib, Ataliya would have had to be born at the latest around the year 760 BC and lived to about 692 BC, but Ataliya's grave at [[Kalhu]] has been recovered and her body indicated that she was at most 35 years old when she died. It is considered more plausible that Sennacherib's mother was another of Sargon's wives, [[Ra'\u012bm\u00e2]], who in a stele from [[Assur]] (once the capital of Assyria) is specifically referred to as the \"mother of Sennacherib\".{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=13}} Sargon II claimed that he was the son of the earlier king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], but this is uncertain as Sargon usurped the throne from Tiglath-Pileser's (other) son [[Shalmaneser V]].{{Sfn|Elayi|2017|p=27}}\n\nSennacherib was probably born {{Circa|}} 745 BC. If Sargon II was the son of Tiglath-Pileser III and not a non-dynastic usurper, he would probably have lived in the royal palace at Kalhu for several years before becoming king. Sennacherib would then probably have been born at Kalhu, where he would then have grown up and spent most of his youth. Sargon lived in Kalhu until long after becoming king, leaving the city in 710 BC to reside at [[Babylon]] and later at his new capital, [[Dur-Sharrukin]]. By that point Sennacherib, who served as Sargon's crown prince and intended heir to the throne had already left the city, living in a residence at [[Nineveh]].{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=18}} Nineveh had been the designated seat of the Assyrian crown prince since the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=30}} As crown prince, Sennacherib also owned an estate at [[Tarbisu]]. Alongside his siblings, Sennacherib would have been educated by the royal educator Hunn\u00ee, probably receiving a scribal education, learning some arithmetic and learning how to read and write in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=18}}\n\nHe had several brothers and at least one sister. In addition to the older brothers dead before his birth, Sennacherib also had younger brothers, some of which are mentioned as being alive as late as 670 BC, then in the service of Sennacherib's son and successor [[Esarhaddon]]. Sennacherib's only known sister, [[Ahat-abisha]], was married off to Ambaris, the king of [[Tabal]], but probably returned to Assyria after Sargon's first successful campaign against Tabal.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=15}}\n\nSennacherib's name, ''S\u00een-a\u1e25\u1e25\u0113-er\u012bba'' in Akkadian, means \"[[Sin (mythology)|S\u00een]] (the moon-god) has replaced the brothers\". The name probably derives from Sennacherib not being Sargon's first son, but all of his older brothers being dead by the time he was born. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], his name was rendered as ''Sn\u1e25ryb'' and in [[Aramaic]] it was ''\u0160n\u1e25\u2019ryb''.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=12}} As per a 670 BC document, it was illegal to give the name Sennacherib (then the former king) to a commoner in Assyria, as it was considered a taboo and sacrilege.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=13}}\n\n=== Sennacherib as crown prince ===\n[[File:Sargon_II_(left)_faces_a_high-ranking_official,_possibly_Sennacherib_his_son_and_crown_prince._710-705_BCE._From_Khorsabad,_Iraq._The_British_Museum,_London.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sennacherib's father [[Sargon II]] (left) facing a high-ranking official, possibly his crown prince Sennacherib. From a relief housed in the [[British Museum]].]]\nAs crown prince, Sennacherib exercised royal power together with his father, or alone as a substitute while Sargon was away campaigning. During Sargon's longer absences from the Assyrian heartland, Sennacherib's residence would have served as the center of government in the Neo-Assyrian Empire, with the crown prince taking on significant administrative and political responsibilities.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=30}} The vast responsibilities allowed to Sennacherib suggests a certain degree of  trust between the king and the crown prince. In reliefs depicting both Sargon and Sennacherib, they are depicted in discussion, appearing almost as equals. As regent, Sennacherib's main duty was to maintain relations with Assyrian governors and generals and oversee the vast military intelligence network of the empire. Sennacherib also oversaw domestic affairs and often informed Sargon of the progress being made on building projects throughout the empire.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=31}} Sennacherib was also assigned to the distribution and reception of audience gifts and tribute, after distributing such financial resources, Sennacherib sent letters to his father to inform him of the decisions made.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=38}}\n\nSennacherib's letter to his father indicate that he respected him and that they were on friendly terms. He never disobeyed his father and though his letters indicate that he wanted to please Sargon, they also show that he knew him quite well. For unknown reasons Sargon never brought Sennacherib along on his military campaigns, something Sennacherib may have resented his father for as he missed out on the glory attached to military victories.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=40}} In any event, Sennacherib never took action against Sargon or attempted to usurp the throne despite being more than old enough to become king on his own.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=40}}\n\n=== Assyria and Babylonia ===\n[[File:Mesopotamia 1200 BC.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Mesopotamia]] {{Circa|}} 1200 BC, 500 years before Sennacherib's time, showing important cities and the former core territories of [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]].]]\nBy the time Sennacherib became king, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had been the dominant power in the Near East for more than thirty years, chiefly due to its well-trained and large army which was superior to that of any other contemporary kingdom. Though [[Babylonia]] in the south had once been a large kingdom as well, it was typically weaker than its northern neighbor due to being internally divided and lacking the well organized army of the Assyrians. The population of Babylonia was divided into various groups with different priorities and ideas. Though most of the cities, such as Babylon itself and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Borsippa]] and [[Nippur]], were ruled by the old native Babylonians, most of the southernmost land was dominated by [[Chaldea]]n tribes led by chieftains who often squabbled with each other.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=89}} There were also the [[Arameans]], living on fringes of the settled land and being notorious for their robberies and plunders. Because these three major group rarely worked together, Babylonia often represented an appealing target for Assyrian campaigns.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=90}} The two kingdoms competed for centuries and in the 8th century BC the Assyrians eventually gained the upper hand.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=209}} Babylon's internal and external weakness led to its conquest by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 729 BC.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=90}}\n\nDuring the expansion of Assyria into a major empire, the Assyrians had conquered various neighboring kingdoms, generally either annexing them and turning them into Assyrian provinces or allowing them to continue on as vassal states. However, because the Assyrians venerated Babylon's long history and its culture, it was preserved as a full kingdom, either being ruled through an appointed vassal king or by the Assyrian king directly (then being the king of both Assyria and Babylonia).{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=90}} The relationship between Assyria and Babylonia was not entirely unlike the relationship between [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in later centuries; Assyria and Babylonia shared the same language and a large amount of Assyria's own culture, texts and traditions had been imported from the south.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=208}} Assyria's relationship to Babylon was in a way an emotional one, there is an implicit gendering of the two countries in Neo-Assyrian inscriptions and in their worldview (with Assyria as the metaphorical \"husband\" of its \"wife\", Babylon). In the words of [[Assyriologist]] Eckart Frahm, \"the Assyrians were in love with Babylon, but also wished to dominate her\". Though Babylon was respected as the well-spring of civilization, it was expected to remain passive in political matters, something which Assyria's \"Babylonian bride\" repeatedly refused to do.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=212}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Death of Sargon II and succession ===\n[[File:Alter_Orient_0700BC.svg|alt=|thumb|Map of the [[Near East]] in 700 BC, with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] shown in blue.]]\nIn 705 BC, Sargon II, probably in his sixties, led the Assyrian army on campaign against King Gurd\u00ee of [[Tabal]] in central [[Anatolia]]. The campaign was a disaster; Gurd\u00ee defeated the Assyrian army, killed the king and carried off his body.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=201}}{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=20}} Though the defeat was bad, the death of the king was worse and the Assyrians believed that the gods must have punished Sargon for some major past wrongdoing. In Mesopotamian mythology, the afterlife suffered by those who died in battle and weren't buried was terrible, doomed to suffer like beggars for eternity.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=202}} Sennacherib was about 35 years old when he ascended to the Assyrian throne in August of 705 BC{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=3}} and was well experienced with how to rule the empire due to his long tenure as crown prince.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=204}} His reaction to the fate of his father was to distance himself from Sargon{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=15}} and appears to have been denial, refusing to acknowledge and deal with what happened to him. Sargon's great new capital, Dur-Sharrukin, was abandoned immediately and the capital was instead moved to Nineveh. Before he began any other major projects, one of Sennacherib's first actions as king was to rebuild a temple dedicated to the god [[Nergal]], associated with death, disaster and war, at the city [[Tarbisu]].{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=202}}\n\nEven with this public denial in mind, Sennacherib was superstitious and spent much time asking his diviners what kind of sin Sargon could have committed to suffer the fate that he did, possibly considering the idea that Sargon might have offended Babylon's deities by taking control of the city.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} A text, though probably written after Sennacherib's own death, has the king proclaim that he was investigating the nature of a \"sin\" committed by his father.{{Sfn|Frahm|2002|p=1113}} A minor 704 BC{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=130}} campaign (unmentioned in Sennacherib's later historical accounts), led by Sennacherib's [[magnate]]s rather than the king himself, was sent against Gurd\u00ee in Tabal to avenge Sargon. Sennacherib spent a lot of time and effort to rid the empire of Sargon's imagery. Images which Sargon had created at the temple in Assur were made invisible through raising the level of the courtyard, Sargon's wife Ataliya was buried hastily when she died without regard to the traditional burial practices (and in the same coffin as another woman, the queen of the previous king Tiglath-Pileser III), and Sargon is never mentioned in his inscriptions.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=203}}\n\n=== First Babylonian campaign ===\n[[File:Vorderasiatisches_Museum_Berlin_027.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Depiction of Sennacherib's arch-enemy [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]] (left), [[king of Babylon]] 722\u2013710 BC and 704/703\u2013702 BC and the instigator of many of Sennacherib's later conflicts, [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffing]] (making a legal agreement with) a vassal. Exhibited at the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]].]]\nSargon II's death in the battle and the disappearance of his body inspired rebellions across the Assyrian Empire.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=20}} Sargon had ruled Babylonia since 710 BC, when he defeated the Chaldean tribal chief [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]], who had taken control of the south in the aftermath of the death of Sargon's predecessor [[Shalmaneser V]] in 722 BC.{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=129}} As with his immediate predecessors, Sennacherib took the ruling titles of both Assyria and Babylonia when he became king, but his reign in Babylonia did not go well.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} Unlike Sargon, who had proclaimed himself as ''shakkanakku'' ([[viceroy]]) of Babylon, in reverence for the city's deity [[Marduk]] (which was considered Babylon's formal \"king\"), Sennacherib explicitly proclaimed himself as Babylon's king. Furthermore, Sennacherib did not \"take the hand\" of the [[Statue of Marduk]], the physical representation of the deity, and thus did not honor the god by undergoing the traditional Babylonian coronation ritual.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=9}}\n\nAngered by the disprespect, revolts a month apart in 704{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=129}} or 703{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}}{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} BC overthrew Sennacherib's rule in the south. First, a Babylonian by the name [[Marduk-zakir-shumi II]] took the throne but he was after just two{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} or four{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=129}}{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} weeks replaced as king by Marduk-apla-iddina II, the same Chaldean warlord who had seized control of the city once before and had warred against Sennacherib's father. Marduk-apla-iddina's main strength was his ability to unite the normally infighting Chaldean tribes and the Babylonians against the Assyrians.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} [[Shutur-Nahhunte II]], the king of [[Elam]] (a civilization in modern-day south-western Iran), sent aid to Marduk-apla-iddina, sending an army of 80,000 Elamite bowmen, supported by cavalry under the command of his commander-in-chief. Elam's massive support inspired the rest of the Chaldean tribes and the Arameans to join the ranks of the Babylonian king.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}}\n[[File:Sennacherib.jpg|thumb|Sennacherib on campaign against [[Babylon]] as depicted in one of his reliefs.]]\nDue to portions of the Assyrian army being absent in Tabal in 704 BC and Sennacherib possibly considering a two-front war too risky, he left Marduk-apla-iddina unchallenged for several months. After the Tabal expedition had been completed, Sennacherib gathered the Assyrian army at Assur in 703 BC, often used as a mustering spot for campaigns against the south.{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=130}} Near the city of Kish,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} the forces of this coalition successfully defeated an early Assyrian attack led by Sennacherib's commander-in-chief and other generals, bolstering their confidence and Babylon continued to ignore the Babylonian claims of the Assyrian king.{{Sfn|Bauer|2007|p=384}} Once Sennacherib, encamped by the city of [[Kutha]], received word of the defeat of his generals he led the next attack in person and at a new battle near Kish, he defeated the troops of the anti-Assyrian coalition. At this point, the anti-Assyrian army was led by Elam as Marduk-apla-iddina, fearing for his life, had fled to the southern Sea Land (the marshlands in southernmost Mesopotamia). Among the captives taken after the victory was a stepson of Marduk-apla-iddina and brother of an Arabian queen, [[Yatie]], who had joined the coalition.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}}\n\nSennacherib then marched directly towards Babylon. As the Assyrians appeared on the horizon, Babylon opened its gates to Sennacherib without the need of a protracted siege.{{Sfn|Bauer|2007|p=384}} The Assyrians then spent five days unsuccessfully hunting for Marduk-apla-iddina in the Sea Land, destroying the fields of Chaldeans, Arameans and Babylonians who had supported the revolting regime and taking more than two hundred thousand prisoners.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} The city of Babylon itself was also reprimanded, suffering a minor sack,{{Sfn|Bauer|2007|p=384}} though the citizens were not harmed.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=106}} Because his previous policy of reigning as king of both Assyria and Babylonia had evidently failed, Sennacherib attempted another method, appointing a native Babylonian who had grown up at the Assyrian court, [[Bel-ibni]], as his vassal king of the south. Bel-ibni was described by Sennacherib as \"a native of Babylon who grew up in my palace like a young puppy\".{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}}\n\n=== War in the Levant ===\n{{Main|Sennacherib's campaign in the Levant}}\n[[File:Assyrian siege-engine attacking the city wall of Lachish, part of the ascending assaulting wave.

Notably, it is the most well documented event in the [[history of Israel]] during the [[First Temple Period|First Temple period]].{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=11}} In 705 BC, [[Hezekiah]], the king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], had stopped paying his annual tribute to the Assyrians and began pursuing a markedly aggressive foreign policy, probably inspired by the recent wave of anti-Assyrian rebellions across the empire. Hezekiah conspired with [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Sidqia]], an anti-Assyrian king of the city [[Ashkelon]], attacked [[Philistines|Philistine]] cities loyal to Assyria and captured the Assyrian vassal Padi, king of [[Ekron]], and imprisoned him in his capital [[Jerusalem]].{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=20}} In the northern Levant, former Assyrian vassal cities rallied around [[Luli]], the king of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]].{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} The anti-Assyrian sentiment among some of the empire's western vassals was encouraged by Sennacherib's arch-enemy Marduk-apla-iddina II, who corresponded with and sent gifts to western rulers such as Hezekiah,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} probably hoping to assemble a vast anti-Assyrian alliance.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}}\n[[File:Assyrian soldier, using a dagger, about to behead a prisoner from the city of Lachish.

Like many rulers of these cities had done before and would do after, Luli decided to flee rather than face the wrath of the Assyrians, escaping by boat until he was safely outside of Sennacherib's reach. In his stead, Sennacherib proclaimed a noble by the name [[Ethbaal of Sidon|Ethbaal]] as the new king of Sidon and his vassal and oversaw the submission of many of the surrounding cities to his rule. Faced with a massive Assyrian army nearby, many of the Levantine rulers, including [[Budu-ilu]] of [[Ammon]], [[Kamusu-nadbi]] of [[Moab]], [[Mitini of Ashdod|Mitini]] of [[Ashdod]] and [[Malik-rammu]] of [[Edom]], quickly submitted to Sennacherib to avoid retribution.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=11}}\n\nThe resistance in the southern Levant was not as easily compelled to submit, forcing Sennacherib to invade the region. The Assyrians began with taking Ashkelon, defeating Sidqia, and then proceeded to successfully besiege and take numerous cities. As the Assyrians were preparing to retake Ekron, Hezekiah's ally Egypt intervened in the conflict but the Egyptian expedition was defeated in battle near the city [[Ge'alya|Eltekeh]]. The cities of Ekron and [[Timnah]] were taken and Judah stood alone, with Sennacherib setting his sight on Jerusalem.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=11}} While a portion of Sennacherib's troops prepared to blockade Jerusalem, Sennacherib himself marched on the important Judean city [[Lachish]]. Both the [[Assyrian siege of Jerusalem|blockade of Jerusalem]] and the [[siege of Lachish]] probably served to prevent further Egyptian aid from reaching Hezekiah and to intimidate the kings of other smaller states in the region. The siege of Lachish, which ended in the city's destruction, was so long that the defenders eventually began using arrows made of bone rather than metal since supplies were running out. In order to take the city, the Assyrians constructed a great siege mound (essentially a ramp made of stone and earth) to reach the top of Lachish's walls. After the city was destroyed, survivors were deported into the Assyrian Empire. Some of them were forced to aid in Sennacherib's building projects and others were employed in the king's personal guard.{{Sfn|Barnett|1958|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\n=== Sennacherib at the gates of Jerusalem ===\n{{Main|Assyrian siege of Jerusalem}}\n[[File:DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB'S HOST..jpg|left|thumb|19th century [[wood engraving]] by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] depicting the [[Bible|Biblical]] narrative of an [[angel]] destroying Sennacherib's army outside [[Jerusalem]].]]\nSennacherib's account of what happened at Jerusalem begins with \"As for Hezekiah ... like a caged bird I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city.

As such, Jerusalem was blockaded in some capacity, though the lack of massive military activities and appropriate equipment means that it was probably not a full siege.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=38}} According to the narrative of the event laid out in the [[Books of Kings]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], a senior Assyrian official with the title [[Rabshakeh]] stood in front of the city's walls and demanded its surrender.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=25}} Allegedly, the Rabshakeh used the phrase \"eat feces and drink urine\" to threaten the Judeans with the difficult conditions that they were soon to experience.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=40}} Although the Assyrian account of the operation may lead one to believe that Sennacherib was present in person, this is never explicitly stated and reliefs depicting the campaign show Sennacherib as seated on a throne in Lachish instead of overseeing the preparations for an assault on Jerusalem. According to the biblical account, Sennacherib's threatening representatives to Hezekiah found Sennacherib engaged in a struggle with the city [[Libnah]] upon their return to the king, who remained at Lachish.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=12}}\n\nThe account of the blockade erected around Jerusalem is different from the sieges described in Sennacherib's annals and the massive reliefs in Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh which depict the Levantine campaign show the successful siege of Lachish rather than what transpired at Jerusalem. Though the blockade of Jerusalem was not a proper siege, it is clear from all available sources that a massive Assyrian army was encamped in the city's vicinity, probably on its northern side.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=39\u201340}}\n[[File:The fall of Lachish, King Sennacherib reviews Judaean prisoners..JPG|thumb|Relief depicting Sennacherib (enthroned at the far right) at [[Lachish]], interacting with his officials and reviewing the prisoners from [[Judea]]. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nThough it is clear  that the blockade of Jerusalem ended without significant fighting, how it was resolved and what stopped Sennacherib's massive army from overwhelming the city is uncertain. The Biblical account of the end of Sennacherib's attack on Jerusalem holds that though Hezekiah's soldiers manned the walls of the city, ready to defend it against the Assyrians, an entity referred to as the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|destroying angel]], sent by [[Yahweh]], annihilated Sennacherib's army, killing 185,000 Assyrian soldiers in front of Jerusalem's gates.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=19}} The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] describe the operation being an Assyrian failure due to a \"multitude of [[Apodemus|field-mice]]\" descending upon the Assyrian camp, devouring crucial material such as quivers and bowstrings, making the Assyrians unarmed and causing them to flee.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=12}} It is possible that the story of the mice infestation is an allusion to some kind of disease striking the Assyrian camp, possibly the [[septicemic plague]].{{Sfn|Caesar|2017|p=224}} The battle being an outright Assyrian defeat is considered unlikely, especially on account of contemporary Babylonian chronicles, otherwise eager to mention Assyrian failures, being silent on the matter.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=13}}\n\nDespite the seemingly inconclusive end to the blockade of Jerusalem, the Levantine campaign was an Assyrian victory. After the Assyrians had successfully seized many of Judah's most important fortified cities and destroyed several towns and villages, Hezekiah realized that his anti-Assyrian activities had been disastrous military and political miscalculations and as such submitted to the Assyrians once more. He was forced to pay a heavier tribute than previously, probably alongside a heavy penalty and the tribute which he had failed to send to Nineveh from 705 to 701 BC.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=20}} He was also forced to release the imprisoned king of Ekron, Padi,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=13}} and Judah lost a substantial amount of territory in the aftermath of the campaign, with Sennacherib granting portions of its land to the neighboring kingdoms of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], Ashdod and Ekron.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=48}}\n\n=== Resolving the Babylonian problem ===\n[[File:Assyria slingers hurling stones towards the enemy at the city of -alammu. Detail of a wall relief dating back to the reign of Sennacherib, 700-692 BCE. From Nineveh, Iraq, currently housed in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Relief from Sennacherib's reign depicting Assyrian slingers hurling stones at an enemy city. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nSennacherib's victory in the Levant had not been as conclusive and decisive as most Assyrian victories, which may have encouraged the vassal king of Babylon, Bel-ibni, to listen to the Elamites and Marduk-apla-iddina.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=13}} Because Marduk-apla-iddina continued to be active in Babylonoia, Sennacherib campaigned against the south again in 700 BC and removed Bel-ibni from the throne, either due to complicity or incompetence.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} Sennacherib's hunt for Marduk-apla-iddina was so furious that the Chaldean escaped on boats with his people and treasury across the Persian Gulf, taking refuge in the Elamite city Nagitu. Victorious, Sennacherib attempted yet another method to govern Babylonia and appointed his son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] to reign as Babylonian vassal king.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=14}}\n\nAshur-nadin-shumi was also titled as ''m\u0101ru r\u0113\u0161t\u00fb'', a title that could be interpreted either as the \"pre-eminent son\" or the \"firstborn son\". His appointment as king of Babylon and the new title suggests that Ashur-nadin-shumi was being groomed to also follow Sennacherib as the King of Assyria upon his death. Ashur-nadin-shumi being titled as the ''m\u0101ru r\u0113\u0161t\u00fb'' likely means that he was Sennacherib's crown prince; if it means \"pre-eminent\" such a title would be befitting only for the crown prince and if it means \"firstborn\", it also suggests that Ashur-nadin-shumi was the heir as the Assyrians in most cases followed the principle of primogeniture (the oldest son inherits).{{Sfn|Porter|1993|p=14}} More evidence in favor of Ashur-nadin-shumi being the crown prince is Sennacherib's construction of a palace for him at the city of [[Assur]],{{Sfn|Porter|1993|p=15}} something Sennacherib would also do for the later crown prince Esarhaddon. As an Assyrian King of Babylon, Ashur-nadin-shumi's position was politically important and highly delicate and would have granted valuable experience to him as the intended heir to the entire Neo-Assyrian Empire.{{Sfn|Porter|1993|p=16}}\n\nIn the years that followed, Babylonia stayed relatively quiet and Sennacherib campaigned elsewhere. His fifth campaign in 699 BC was composed of a series of raids against the villages around the foot of [[Mount Judi]], located to the northeast of Nineveh. Other small campaigns were also led by Sennacherib's general without the king present, including a 698 BC expedition against Kirua, a revolting Assyrian governor in [[Cilicia]], and a 695 BC campaign against the city [[Tegarama]] for which the cause is unknown. Throughout these years, the survival of Marduk-apla-iddina likely represented a thorn in Sennacherib's side and so, he decided to invade Elam in 694 BC in pursuit of his Chaldean enemies.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=14}}\n\n=== The Elamite campaign and revenge ===\n[[File:AssyrianWarship.jpg|thumb|Assyrian warship depicted in one of Sennacherib's reliefs. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nIn preparation for an invasion of Elam, aimed at capturing the escaped Chaldeans rather than defeating the Elamites themselves, Sennacherib had for some time overseen the construction of a great fleet by Phoenician shipbuilders in the northern parts of the Euphrates and in Nineveh, by the Tigris. The ships, manned by sailors from Tyre, Sidon and [[Cyprus]], then transported large portions of the Assyrian army to the city [[Opis]]. At Opis, the ships were pulled ashore and transported overland on rollers or sledges to the [[Arahtu River|Arahtu canal]], perhaps because the lower portions of the two rivers were under Elamite influence. When the Arahtu joined with the Euphrates south of Babylon, the troops embarked and marched to the mouth of the river. Sennacherib was not present on the boats, marching the entire distance from Nineveh to the mouth of the Euphrates.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=14}} From the city [[Bab-Salemeti]], Sennacherib then joined the rest of the army and sailed across the Persian Gulf. Though the journey took five days and was apparently difficult, with repeated sacrifices being made to [[Ea (god)|Ea]], the god of the deep, the Assyrians successfully landed at the Elamite coast.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=15}}\n[[File:Assyrian soldiers and their prisoners from the town of -alammu, 8th century BC, from Nineveh, Iraq. The British Museum.jpg|thumb|Assyrian soldiers with prisoners and war trophies depicted in one of Sennacherib's reliefs. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]Though they faced heavy resistance, Sennacherib's forces prevailed and successfully took several cities, an event the king describes in his own records as a \"great victory\". The many captured Chaldeans and Elamites were apportioned among his soldiers. Though Sennacherib had successfully had his revenge against Marduk-apla-iddina, his arch-enemy had not lived the see it, seemingly dying of natural causes shortly before. The campaign was not a total success, as Shutur-Nahhunte II's successor as king of Elam, [[Hallushu-Inshushinak]], exacted his revenge for the invasion by striking at Babylonia.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=15}} Wishing to restore their independence, some of the Babylonians then seized their king Ashur-nadin-shumi at the city [[Sippar]] and handed him over to the Elamites whereafter Ashur-nadin-shumi was taken to Elam and never heard from again, probably being executed.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=92}}{{Sfn|Bertman|2005|p=79}} In his stead, the Elamites proclaimed a native Babylonian, [[Nergal-ushezib]], as the king of Babylon.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=92}}\n\nSennacherib's position, cut off from his own empire by both Elam and Babylonia, was disadvantageous and the Elamite-Babylonian alliance was initially successful. In June or July of 694 BC, Nergal-ushezib captured the city Nippur but three months later the Assyrians took Uruk and shortly thereafter the war decisively turned in the favor of the Assyrians. In 693 BC, Negal-ushezib and the Elamites attacked the Assyrian army near Nippur but were defeated and Nergal-ushezib was taken as a prisoner to Nineveh. Shortly thereafter, a rebellion broke out in Elam and three weeks after the defeat at Nippur, Hallushu-Inshushinak was replaced as Elamite king by [[Kutir-Nahhunte III]]. Even then, the Babylonians did not surrender and instead proclaimed the Chaldean [[Mushezib-Marduk]] as their new king. Before moving to deal with this problem, Sennacherib was determined to defeat Elam. Though the Assyrians captured and destroyed 46 cities, the Elamites refused to fight them, retreating with their new king into the mountains. The oncoming winter, combined with snow and rain, stopped Sennacherib from pursuing them and he returned to Nineveh.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=15}}\n\n=== Destruction of Babylon ===\n{{Main|Siege of Babylon}}\n[[File:Assiri, regno di sennacherib, prisma a sei facce con iscrizione sulle 8 campagne militari del sovrano, 704-681 ac ca. 02.jpg|thumb|Prism of Sennacherib, containing records of his military campaigns, culminating with [[Siege of Babylon|Babylon's destruction]]. Exhibited at the [[Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago]].]]\nAfter reigning for just ten months, Kutir-Nahhunte III was replaced as king of Elam by [[Humban-Numena III]] and Sennacherib decided that the time had come to decisively defeat his southern enemies. With the threat of Assyrian invasion looming, the Babylonians quickly ensured the continued support of Elam by bribing the new Elamite king with valuables they stripped from their great temple dedicated to their god Marduk.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=15}} The Assyrian records consider Humban-Numena's decision to support Babylon as dumb, describing him as a \"man without any sense or judgement\".{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=16}} In 691 BC, Mushezib-Marduk's anti-Assyrian coalition struck against Sennacherib. Humban-Numena and his commander, Humban-undasha, led the forces of the coalition against Sennacherib in the [[Battle of Halule]], the outcome of which is uncertain. Babylonian texts describe the battle as a great victory, but so do Assyrian documents. Since Assyrian texts do not mention events in the south again until the later siege of Babylon, it is more likely that the southerners won, though likely suffering large casualties. Sennacherib returned to Nineveh with both of his enemies still on their respective thrones.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=93}}{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=17}}\n\nIn 690 BC, Humban-Numena suffered a stroke and his jaw became locked in a way which prevented him from speaking. Taking advantage of the situation, Sennacherib embarked on his final campaign against Babylon.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=17}} The initial success of the Babylonians had been short-lived and in that same year, a siege of Babylon was already well underway.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=93}} Babylon must have been in a poor condition once it fell to Sennacherib in 689 BC, having been besieged for over fifteen months. The king who had anxiously considered the implications of Sargon's seizure of Babylon and the role that the city's offended gods may have played in his father's downfall was gone, replaced by a king wishing to avenge the death of his son and tiring of a city well within the borders of his empire which had repeatedly rebelled against his rule. He had no affection for gods who had inspired their populace to attack him and Sennacherib decided to destroy the city.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=94}} Sennacherib's own account of the destruction reads as follows:\n\n{{quote|quote=Into my land I carried off alive Mu\u0161\u0113zib-Marduk, king of Babylonia, together with his family and officials. I counted out the wealth of that city \u2013 silver, gold, precious stones, property and goods \u2013 into the hands of my people; and they took it as their own. The hands of my people laid hold of the gods dwelling there and smashed them; they took their property and goods.<br>I destroyed the city and its houses, from foundation to parapet; I devastated and burned them. I razed the brick and earthenwork of the outer and inner wall of the city, of the temples, and of the ziggurat; and I dumped these into the Ara\u1e2btu canal. I dug canals through the midst of that city, I overwhelmed it with water, I made its very foundations disappear, and I destroyed it more completely than a devastating flood. So that it might be impossible in future days to recognize the site of that city and its temples, I utterly dissolved it with water and made it like inundated land.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=94}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nIt is worth pointing out that even as Sennacherib destroyed the city, he was still somewhat fearful of Babylon's ancient gods. Earlier in his account of the campaign he specifically mention that the sanctuaries of the Babylonian deities had provided financial support to his enemies and the passage in which the seizure of the property of the gods and the destruction of some of their statues is described is one of the few in which Sennacherib uses \"my people\" rather than \"I\".{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=94}} This leaves the blame of the fate of the temples not on Sennacherib himself, but on the decisions made by the temple personnel and the actions of the Assyrian people rather than the king in particular.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=95}}\n\nDuring the destruction of the city, Sennacherib destroyed the temples and the images of the gods, except for that of Marduk, which he took to Assyria.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=118}} This caused consternation in Assyria itself, where Babylon and its gods were held in high esteem.{{sfn|Leick|2009|p=156}} Sennacherib attempted to justify his actions to his own countrymen through a campaign of religious propaganda.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|pp=118\u2013119}} Among the elements of this campaign he commissioned a myth in which Marduk was put on trial before [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], the god of Assyria. This text is fragmentary but it seems Marduk is found guilty of some grave offense;{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=119}} he described his defeat of the Babylonian rebels in language of the [[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161|Babylonian creation myth]], identifying Babylon with the evil demon-goddess [[Tiamat]] and himself with Marduk;{{sfn|McCormick|2002|pp=156,158}} Ashur replaced Marduk in the New Year's festival; and in the temple of the festival he placed a symbolic pile of rubble from Babylon.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=116}} In Babylonia, Sennacherib's policy spawned a deep-seated hatred amongst much of the populace.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=109}}\n\nSennacherib's goal was the complete eradication of the Babylonia as a political entity.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=210}} Though some northern Babylonian territories were turned into Assyrian provinces, the Assyrians made no effort to rebuild Babylon itself and southern chronicles from the time refer to the era as the \"kingless\" period when there was no king in the land.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=95}}\n\n=== Construction of Nineveh ===\n[[File:Archaeologist Henry Layard's image of Nineveh.jpg|left|thumb|19th century reconstruction of [[Nineveh]] by British archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]].]]\nAfter the final war with Babylon, Sennacherib seemingly spent the rest of his reign in peace, dedicating his time to improving his new capital at Nineveh rather than embarking on large military campaigns.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=17}} Nineveh had been an important city in northern Mesopotamia for millennia. The oldest traces of human settlement at its location are from the 7th millennium BC and from the 4th millennium BC and onwards it formed an important administrative center in the north.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=13}} When Sennacherib made the city his new capital it experienced one of the most ambitious building projects in ancient history, being completely transformed from the somewhat neglected state the city had been in before his reign.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=14}}\n[[File:Palace of Sennacherib Restored.jpeg|left|thumb|1876 reconstruction of Sennacherib's \"Palace without Rival\" in [[Nineveh]] by [[John Philip Newman]].]]\nThe earliest inscriptions discussing the building project at Nineveh date to 702 BC and are about the construction of the Southwest Palace, a large residence constructed in the city's southwestern parts.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=15}} Sennacherib called this palace the ''ekallu \u0161a \u0161\u0101nina la i\u0161u'', the \"Palace without Rival\".{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=5}} During the construction process, a previous smaller palace was torn down, a stream of water which had been eroding parts of the palace mound was redirected and a terrace which the new palace was to stand on was erected and raised to the height of 160 layers of brick. Though many of these early inscriptions talk about the palace as if it was already completed, this was the standard way of writing about building projects in ancient Assyria. The Nineveh described in Sennacherib's earliest accounts of its construction was a city with at that point only existed in his imagination.'''{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=15}}'''\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 350\n| image1 = Nineveh map city walls & gates.JPG\n| image2 = Quyunjiq constructions.JPG\n| footer = City plan of [[Nineveh]] (left) and a close-up of the Kuyunjik mound (right), where Sennacherib's palace was constructed. The northern palace depicted in the map was first built during the reign of Sennacherib's grandson [[Ashurbanipal]].\n}}\n\nBy 700 BC the walls of the Southwest Palace's throne room were being constructed, followed shortly thereafter by the many reliefs that were to be displayed within it. After the reliefs were done, the final step in the construction of the palace was the erection of great colossal statues depicting bulls and lions, characteristic of Late Assyrian architecture. Though such statues in stone have been excavated at Nineveh, similar colossal statues mentioned in the inscriptions as being made of precious metals remain missing. The roof of the palace was constructed with cypress and cedar recovered from the mountains in the west and the palace was illuminated through multiple windows and decorated with silver and bronze pegs on the inside and glazed bricks on the outside. The full structure, going by the mound it was built on, measured 450 metres (1476&nbsp;ft) long and 220 metres (722&nbsp;ft) wide. An inscription on a stone lion in the quarter associated with Sennacherib's queen, Tashmetu-sharrat, contains hopes that the king and queen would both live long and healthy lives within the new palace.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=16}} The text of the inscription reads:\n\n{{Quote|quote=And for the queen Tashmetu-sharrat, my beloved wife, whose features [[Belet-ili]] has made more beautiful than all other women, I had a palace of love, joy and pleasure built. \u2026 By the order of Ashur, father of the gods, and heavenly queen [[Ishtar]] may we both live long in health and happiness in this palace and enjoy wellbeing to the full!{{Sfn|Kertai|2013|p=116}}}}\n\nThough probably conceived as a structure similar to the palace Sargon II built at Dur-Sharrukin, Sennacherib's palace and especially the artwork featured therein shows some differences. Though Sargon's reliefs usually show the king as close to other members of the Assyrian aristocracy, Sennacherib's art usually depicts the king towering above everyone else in his vicinity due to being mounted in a chariot. His reliefs show larger scenes, some almost from a birds-eye point of view. There are also examples of a more naturalistic approach in the art; where colossal statues of bulls from Sargon's palace depicts them with five legs (so that four legs could be seen from either side and two from the front), Sennacherib's bulls all have four legs.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=16}} Sennacherib constructed beautiful gardens at his new palace, importing various plants and herbs from throughout his empire and beyond. [[Cotton]] plants may have been imported from as far away as India. It has been suggested that the famous [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], where actually these gardens in Nineveh, but the presence of impressive royal gardens in Babylon itself makes this idea somewhat unlikely.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=17}}\n\nIn addition to the palace, Sennacherib oversaw other building projects at Nineveh. He built a large second palace at the city's southern mound, which served as an arsenal to store military equipment and also as permanent quarters for portions of the Assyrian standing army. Numerous temples were built and restored, many of them on the Kuyunjik mound (where the Southwest Palace was located), including a temple dedicated to the god S\u00een (invoked in the king's own name). Furthermore, Sennacherib massively expanded the city to the south and erected new huge and massive city walls, surrounded by a moat, up to 25 metres (82&nbsp;ft) high and 15 metres (49&nbsp;ft) thick.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=17}}\n\n=== Conspiracy, murder and succession ===\n[[File:The_Flight_of_Adrammelech_Murch.jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Flight of Adrammelech'', illustration from ''Dalziel's Bible Gallery'' (1881), depicting [[Arda-Mulissu]] and Nabu-shar-usur escaping after murdering Sennacherib.]]\nWhen his eldest son and original crown prince Ashur-nadin-shumi disappeared and presumably died, Sennacherib selected his eldest surviving son, [[Arda-Mulissu]], as the new crown prince. Arda-Mulissu held the position of heir apparent for several years until he suddenly was replaced as heir by his younger brother Esarhaddon in 684 BC. The reason for Arda-Mulissu's sudden dismissal from the prominent position is unknown, but it is clear from contemporary inscriptions that he was very disappointed.{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=166}} Esarhaddon's influential mother [[Naqi'a]] may have played a role in convincing Sennacherib to pick Esarhaddon as heir.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=16}} Despite his dismissal, Arda-Mulissu remained popular figure and some vassals secretly supported him as the heir to throne.{{Sfn|Parpola|1980|p=}}\n\nArda-Mulissu was forced to swear loyalty to Esarhaddon by his father, but repeatedly tried to appeal Sennacherib to again accept him as heir instead.{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=166}} Sennacherib noted the increasing popularity of Arda-Mulissu and came to fear for his designated successor, so sent Esarhaddon away to the western provinces. This exile of Esarhaddon put Arda-Mulissu in a difficult position as he had reached the height of his popularity but was powerless to do anything to Esarhaddon. In order to use the opportunity, Arda-Mulissu decided that he needed to act quickly and take the throne by force.{{Sfn|Parpola|1980|p=}} Arda-Mulissu concluded a \"treaty of rebellion\" with another of his younger brothers, Nabu-shar-usur, and on 20 October 681 BC, they attacked and killed their father in one of Nineveh's temples,{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=166}} possibly the temple dedicated to S\u00een.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=17}}\n\nThe murder of Sennacherib, ruler of the mightiest empire on the planet at his time, was shocking to his contemporaries and was received with strong emotion and mixed feelings throughout Mesopotamia and the rest of the Ancient Near East. In the Levant and in Babylonia the news were celebrated and proclaimed as divine punishment due to Sennacherib's brutal campaigns against them while in Assyria, the reaction was probably resentment and horror. The event was recorded in numerous sources and is even mentioned in the Bible ({{bibleverse|2 Kings|19:37|KJV}}; [[Isaiah 37:38]]), wherein Arda-Mulissu is called ''Adrammelech''.{{Sfn|Parpola|1980|p=}}\n\nDespite their conspiracy succeeding, Arda-Mulissu couldn't successfully seize the throne. The murder of the king caused some resentment against Arda-Mulissu by his own supporters which delayed his potential coronation and in the meantime, Esarhaddon had raised an army. The army raised by Arda-Mulissu and Nabu-shar-usur met Esarhaddon's forces at [[Hanigalbat]], a city in the western parts of the empire. There, most of their soldiers deserted and joined Esarhaddon, who then marched on Nineveh without opposition, becoming the new king of Assyria. Shortly after taking the throne, Esarhaddon made sure to execute all conspirators and political enemies he could get his hands on, including the families of his brothers. All servants involved with the security of the royal palace at Nineveh were executed. Arda-Mulissu and Nabu-shar-usur survived this purge as they had escaped as exiles to the northern kingdom of [[Urartu]].{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=166}}\n\n== Family and children ==\n[[File:Assyrian_Crown-Prince_MET_hb32_143_13.jpg|thumb|Stele with a depiction of an Assyrian crown prince in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Dated to  Sennacherib's reign, it could depict [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]], [[Arda-Mulissu]] or [[Esarhaddon]].]]\nAs traditional for Assyrian kings, Sennacherib had a harem of many women. Two of his wives are known by name; '''Tashmetu-sharrat''' (Akkadian: ''Ta\u0161metu-\u0161arrat''){{Sfn|Frahm|2002|p=1114}} and '''Naqi'a'''. Whether both of the women held the position of queen or not is uncertain, but contemporary sources suggest that though the kings had multiple women, only one at a time was recognized as the queen and primary consort. For most of Sennacherib's reign, the queen was Tashmetu-sharrat, whose name literally means \"[[Tashmetum]] is queen\".{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=15}} Inscriptions suggest that Sennacherib and Tashmetu-sharrat had a loving relationship, with the king referring to her as \"my beloved wife\" and publicly praising her beauty.{{Sfn|Frahm|2002|p=1114}}\n\nWhether Nagi'a ever held the title of queen is not clear, she was referred to as the \"queen mother\" during Esarhaddon's reign but she was Esarhaddon's mother and the title was thus bestowed on her either by Esarhaddon or late in Sennacherib's reign.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=15}} Though Tashmetu-sharrat was the primary consort for longer, Naqi'a is more well known today due to her role during Esarhaddon's reign. When she became one of Sennacherib's wives, she took the Akkadian name ''Zak\u00fbtu'' (Naqi'a being an Aramaic name).

However, these inscriptions were not actually written by the king himself, but rather his royal scribes, and often served as propaganda meant to portray the king as better than all other rulers, both contemporary and ancient.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=19}} Furthermore, Assyrian royal inscriptions often only explore military and construction matters and were highly formulaic, differing little from king to king.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=171}} However, by examining the inscriptions and comparing them to those of other kings and of non-royal inscriptions, it is possible to assume some aspects of Sennacherib's character. As in the inscriptions of other Assyrian kings, Sennacherib's inscriptions show pride and high self-esteem, for instance in the passage \"Ashur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises\". In several places, the great intelligence of Sennacherib is emphasized, for instance the passage \"the god Ninshiku gave me wide understanding equal to (that of) the sage Adapu (and) endowed me with broad knowledge\". In several inscriptions he is explicitly referred to as \"foremost of all rulers\" (''a\u0161ared kal malk\u012b'') and a \"perfect man\" (''e\u1e6dlu gitm\u0101lu'').{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=19}}{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=193}} Sennacherib's decision to keep his birth name when he became king, rather than assuming a throne name (something at least 19 of his 21 immediate predecessors had done), suggests a certain degree of self-confidence. The assumption of several new epithets never before used by Assyrian kings, such as \"guardian of the right\" and \"lover of justice\", suggests a desire to leave a personal mark on a new era beginning with his reign.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=204}}\n\nWhen Sennacherib became king he was already an adult and had served as Sargon II's crown prince for over 15 years. He would thus have been well acquainted to the administration of the empire. Unlike many preceding and later Assyrian kings (including his father), Sennacherib did not portray himself as a conqueror or express much desire in conquering the world. Instead, his inscriptions often portrayed the most important parts of his reign as his large-scale building projects. Most of Sennacherib's campaigns were not aimed at conquest but at suppressing revolts against his rule, restoring lost territories and securing treasure to finance his building projects.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=20}} As can be seen in several of Sennacherib's campaigns being led by his generals rather than the king in person, Sennacherib was not as interested in campaigning as his predecessors had been.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=21}} The brutal retribution and punishment served to Assyria's enemies as described in Sennacherib's accounts do not necessarily reflect the truth as these accounts also served as propaganda and psychological warfare through intimidation.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=22}}\n[[File:Inschrift \u00fcber dem Kopf des K\u00f6nigs Sennacherib.jpg|thumb|Writing in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and its translation into English from above the head of Sennacherib in the reliefs depicting the [[siege of Lachish]]. From [[Austen Henry Layard]]'s 1853 book ''Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon''.]]\nDespite the apparent lack of interest in world domination, Sennacherib did assume the traditional Mesopotamian titles that designated rule of the entire world; \"[[King of the Universe|king of the universe]]\" and \"[[King of the Four Corners of the World|king of the four corners of the world]]\". Other titles, such as \"strong king\" and \"mighty king\", emphasized his power and greatness, alongside epithets such as \"virile warrior\" (''zikaru qardu'') and \"fierce wild bull\" (''r\u012bmu ekdu'').{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=20}} All Sennacherib's campaigns were described as victories in his own accounts, even the unsuccessful ones. This was not necessarily due to personal pride; a failed campaign would have been regarded by his subjects as an indication that the gods no longer favored Sennacherib's rule.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=20}} Sennacherib was fully convinced that the gods supported him and saw all his wars as just for this reason.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=21}} The enemies of Assyria were seen as people who did not respect the gods and they were thus treated and punished as criminals.{{Sfn|Elayi|2017|p=18}}\n\nIt is possible that Sennacherib suffered from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] due to the catastrophic fate of his father. From the available sources it does appear that Sennacherib was easily enraged by bad news and that he developed serious psychological problems over time. Sennacherib's son and successor Esarhaddon mentions in his inscriptions that Sennacherib was afflicted with the \"''al\u00fb'' demon\" and that none of Sennacherib's diviners initially dared to tell the kings that signs pointing to the demon had been observed.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=203}} What the ''al\u00fb'' demon was is not entirely understood, but the typical symptoms described in contemporary documents include the afflicted not knowing who they are, their pupils constricting, their limbs being tense, being incapable of speech and their ears roaring.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=204}}\n\nAssyriologists Julian E. Reade and Eckart Frahm have pondered the idea that Sennacherib could be classified as a [[feminist]]. Female members of the court were more prominent and enjoyed greater privileges under Sennacherib's reign than under the reigns of previous Assyrian kings. The reasons for Sennacherib's policy towards his female relatives is unknown. It might be due to a desire to shift power away from powerful generals and magnates to his own family, due to encounters with powerful Arabian queens who made their own decisions and led armies or as a way to compensate for the way he treated his father's memory. Evidence to the increased standing of the royal women include the increased amount of texts referencing Assyrian queens from Sennacherib's reign compared to queens of earlier times and evidence that the queens of Sennacherib had their own standing military units, just like the king. Mirroring the increased standing of the women of the royal family, female deities were also depicted more frequently during the time of Sennacherib. For instance, the god Ashur is frequently depicted together with a female companion, probably the goddess [[Mullissu]].{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|pp=213\u2013217}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Sennacherib in popular memory ===\n[[File:Georg Pencz - Tyrants of the Old Testament- Sennacherib - 1923.413 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Woodcut]] depicting Sennacherib by 16th century German engraver, painter and printmaker [[Georg Pencz]], from a series of woodcuts titled ''Tyrants of the Old Testament''.|alt=]]Throughout the milllennia that followed Sennacherib's death, the popular image of the king has been mainly negative. There are two primary reasons for this, the first being Sennacherib's negative portrayal in the Bible, as the evil conqueror who attempted to take Jerusalem, and the second being his destruction of Babylon, one of the most prominent cities in the ancient world. This negative view of Sennacherib endured until modern times. In the famous 1815 poem ''[[The Destruction of Sennacherib]]'' by [[Lord Byron]], Sennacherib is presented as akin to a ruthless predator,{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=1}} attacking Judah as a \"wolf on the fold\":\n\n{{quote|quote=The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,<br>And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;<br>And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,<br>When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.|author=[[Lord Byron]] (1815)|title=''[[The Destruction of Sennacherib]]''|source=first stanza.{{sfn|Elayi|2018|p=1}}}}\n\n[[File:The Death of Sennacherib - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Miniature from a book of [[Old Testament]] prophets made in [[Norman Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] around 1300, portraying three separate scenes from Sennacherib's war against the Israelites.

On the left, two of Sennacherib's sons murder him as he is praying before a pagan idol.|alt=]]\nSennacherib's 701 BC attack against Jerusalem was a \"world event\", drawing together the fates of numerous otherwise disparate groups. The event and its aftermath affected and had consequences for not only the Assyrians and the Israelites, but also the Babylonians, Egyptians, [[Nubians]], Syro-Hittites and [[Anatolian peoples]]. The siege is discussed not only in contemporary sources, but also in later folklore and traditions, such in Aramaic folklore, in later [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] histories on the Near East and in the tales of medieval [[Syriac Christians]] and [[Arabs]].{{Sfn|Kalimi|Richardson|p=1|2014}} Sennacherib's levantine campaign is a significant event in the Bible, being brought up and discussed in numerous places, notably [[2 Kings]] 18:13\u201319:37, 20:6 and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 32:1\u201323.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=12}} A vast majority of the Biblical account of King Hezekiah's reign in 2 Kings is dedicated to Sennacherib's campaign, cementing it as the most important event of Hezekiah's time.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=15}} In Chronicles, the failure of Sennacherib and the success of Hezekiah is emphasized, the Assyrian campaign (here described as an aggression rather than as a response to Hezekiah's rebellious activities) is seen as doomed to fail from the start. According to the narrative, no enemy, not even the powerful king of Assyria, would have been able to triumph over Hezekiah as the Judean king had God on his side.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=21}} The conflict is presented as something akin to a [[holy war]]; God's war against the pagan Sennacherib.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=37}}\n\nThough Assyria had more than a hundred kings throughout its long history, Sennacherib (alongside his son Esarhaddon and grandsons [[Ashurbanipal]] and [[Shamash-shum-ukin]]) is one of the few kings who were remembered and figured in Aramaic and Syriac folklore long after the kingdom had fallen. In the ancient Aramaic [[story of Ahikar]], Sennacherib is portrayed as a benevolent patron of the titular character Ahikar, with his son Esarhaddon being portrayed more negatively. In medieval Syriac tales, Sennacherib is characterized as an archetypical pagan king who is assassinated as part of a family feud and whose children convert to Christianity.{{Sfn|Kalimi|Richardson|p=5|2014}} In the legend of the 4th-century [[Behnam, Sarah, and the Forty Martyrs|Saints Behnam and Sarah]], Sennacherib, under the name [[Sinharib]], is cast as the royal father of Behnam and Sarah. After Behnam converts to Christianity, Sinharib orders his execution but is later struck by a dangerous disease which is cured through being baptized by [[Saint Matthew]] in Assur. Thankful, Sinharib then converts to Christianity and founds an important monastery near [[Mosul]], called [[Mar Behnam Monastery|Deir Mar Mattai]].{{Sfn|Radner|2015|p=7}}\n\nIn later Jewish tradition, Sennacherib also occupied various roles. In [[Midrash]], similar examinations of the Old Testament and later stories, the events of 701 BC are often explored in detail; often featuring massive armies deployed by Sennacherib and pointing out how Sennacherib repeatedly consulted astrologers on his campaign, delaying his actions. In the stories, Sennacherib's armies are destroyed when Hezekiah recites [[Hallel]] psalms on the eve of [[Passover]]. The event is often portrayed as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] scenario, with Hezekiah portrayed as a [[Messiah in Judaism|messianic]] figure and Sennacherib and his armies being personifications of [[Gog and Magog]].{{Sfn|Kalimi|Richardson|p=6|2014}}\n\n=== Archaeological discoveries ===\n[[File:Six-sided clay prism, side 3, written on behalf of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, and containing narratives of his military campaigns, 704-681 BC - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07602.JPG|thumb|One of Sennacherib's prisms, containing narratives of his military campaigns. Exhibited at the [[Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago]].]]\nThe discovery of Sennacherib's own inscriptions in the 19th century, in which brutal and cruel acts such as ordering the throats of his Elamite enemies to be slit, and their hands and lips to be cut off, amplified his already ferocious reputation. Today, an abundance of such inscriptions are known, most of them housed in the collections of the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin|Vorderasiatisches Museum]] in Berlin and the [[British Museum]] in London, though many are also scattered throughout the world in other institutions and in private collections. Some large objects with Sennacherib's inscriptions remain at Nineveh, where some have even been reburied.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=2}} Sennacherib's own accounts of his building projects and military campaigns, typically referred to as his \"annals\", of his reign were often copied several times and spread throughout the Neo-Assyrian Empire during his reign. For the first six years of his tenure as king they were written on clay cylinders, but he later began using clay prisms, probably because they provided a greater surface area.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=3}}\n\nLetters associated with Sennacherib are less in number than those known from his father and from the time of his son Esarhaddon and most of them are from Sennacherib's tenure as crown prince. Other types of non-royal inscriptions from Sennacherib's reign, such as administrative documents, economic documents and chronicles, are more numerous.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=4}} In addition to written sources, numerous pieces of artwork has also survived from Sennacherib's time, notably the king's reliefs from his palace at Nineveh. These reliefs typically depict his conquests, sometimes with short pieces of texts explaining the scene shown. First discovered and excavated from 1847 to 1851 by British archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]], the discovery of reliefs depicting Sennacherib's siege of Lachish in the Southwest Palace was the first archaeological confirmation of an event described in the Bible.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=5}}\n\nFurther excavations of the Southwest Palace were then led by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and [[Henry Creswicke Rawlinson]] from 1852 to 1854, [[William Kennett Loftus]] from 1854 to 1855 and [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] from 1873 to 1874.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=5}} Among the many inscriptions found at the site, Smith discovered a fragmentary account of a [[Flood myth|flood]], which generated much excitement both among the general public and among scholars.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=6}} Since Smith, the site has been experienced several periods of intense excavations and study; Hormuzd Rassam returned from 1878 to 1882, [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] oversaw excavations from 1889 to 1891, [[Leonard William King]] from 1903 to 1904 and [[Reginald Campbell Thompson]] in 1905 and from 1931 to 1932. The most recent expeditions were conducted by the [[Iraqi Department of Antiquities]] under [[T. Madhloom]] from 1965 to 1968. Many of Sennacherib's reliefs are today exhibited at the Vorderasiatisches Museum, the British Museum, the [[Iraq Museum]] in Baghdad, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=6}}\n\n== Titles ==\n{{See also|Akkadian royal titulary}}The following titulature is used by Sennacherib in early accounts of his 703 BC Babylonian campaign:\n\n{{quote|quote=Sennacherib, great king, mighty king, king of Assyria, king without rival, righteous shepherd, favorite of the great gods, prayerful shepherd, who fears the great gods, protector of righteousness, lover of justice, who lends support, who comes to the aid of the cripple and aims to do good deeds, perfect hero, mighty man, first among all kings, neckstock that bends the insubmissive, who strikes the enemy like a thunderbolt, Ashur, the great mountain, has bestowed upon me an unrivalled kingship and has made my weapons mightier than the weapons of all other rulers sitting on daises.{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=141}}|author=|title=|source=}}This variant of the titulature is used in an inscription from the Southwest Palace at Nineveh written after Sennacherib's 700 BC Babylonian campaign:{{quote|quote=Sennacherib, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world); favorite of the great gods; the wise and crafty one; strong hero, first among all princes; the flame that consumes the insubmissive, who strikes the wicked with the thunderbolt.

''S\u00een-ahh\u012b-er\u012bba''{{Sfn|Harman\u015fah|2013|p=120}} or ''S\u00een-a\u1e25\u1e25\u0113-er\u012bba'',{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=11}} meaning \"[[Sin (mythology)|S\u00een]] has replaced the brothers\"{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=12}}) was the king of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] from the death of his father [[Sargon II]] in 705 BC to his own death in 681 BC. The second king of the [[Sargonid dynasty]], Sennacherib is among the most famous of all [[List of Assyrian kings|Assyrian kings]] due to the role he plays in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]], which describes his [[Sennacherib's campaign in the Levant|war in the Levant]].'''{{Sfn|Mark|2014|p=}}''' Other events of his reign which have made him remembered throughout the millennia following his death include his 689 BC destruction of the city [[Babylon]] and his construction of the last great [[Assyria]]n capital, [[Nineveh]].\n\nAlthough Sennacherib was one of the most powerful and wide-ranging of all the Assyrian kings,{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=89}} he faced considerable difficulty in controlling [[Babylonia]], which formed the southern portion of his empire. Many of Sennacherib's Babylonian troubles stemmed from the [[Chaldea]]n tribal chief [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]], who had been [[List of kings of Babylon|Babylon's king]] until he was defeated by Sennacherib's father. Shortly after Sennacherib inherited the throne, Marduk-apla-iddina retook Babylon and allied with the [[Elamites]]. Though Sennacherib retook the south in 700 BC, Marduk-apla-iddina continued to trouble him, probably instigating Assyrian vassals in the [[Levant]] to rebel and successfully convincing Sennacherib's vassal king in Babylonia, [[Bel-ibni]], to also throw off Sennacherib's rule. After the Babylonians and Elamites captured Sennacherib's eldest son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]], another noble Sennacherib proclaimed as his vassal king in Babylon, Sennacherib campaigned in both regions, successfully subduing Elam. Because Babylon, well within his own territory, had been the target of most of his military campaigns and had caused the death of his son, Sennacherib [[Siege of Babylon|destroyed the city]] in 689 BC.\n\nThe Levantine war of 701 BC was made necessary because several Assyrian vassals in the region decided to rebel, either because they were encouraged by Marduk-apla-iddina or because the ill omens associated with the battlefield death of Sennacherib's father. Though the northern Levant was subdued relatively quickly, the states in the southern Levant, especially the [[Kingdom of Judah]] under King [[Hezekiah]], did not submit as easily. The Assyrians thus invaded Palestine, a campaign which is recorded not only in Sennacherib's own accounts but also in the [[Second Book of Kings]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Though the biblical narrative has Sennacherib's [[Assyrian siege of Jerusalem|attack on Jerusalem]] defeated through divine intervention by an [[angel]] destroying the Assyrian army, an outright Assyrian defeat is unlikely as Hezekiah submitted to Sennacherib at the end of the campaign.\n\nSennacherib transferred the capital of the Assyria to Nineveh, where he had spent most of his time as crown prince. In order to transform Nineveh into a capital worthy of his empire, the city was the site of one of the most ambitious building projects in ancient history. He expanded the size of the city, constructed great city walls, numerous temples and a great royal garden. His most famous work in the city is the Southwest Palace, a large palace which Sennacherib himself called the \"Palace without Rival\".\n\nAfter his eldest son and crown prince Ashur-nadin-shumi was killed by the Elamites, Sennacherib's new heir had originally been the second eldest surviving son, [[Arda-Mulissu]]. For unknown reasons, Arda-Mulissu was replaced as heir in 684 BC by a younger son, [[Esarhaddon]], a decision Sennacherib maintained despite repeated appeals by Arda-Mulissu to be accepted as heir again. In 681 BC, Arda-Mulissu and another of Sennacherib's sons assaulted and murdered the king, hoping to seize power for themselves. In Babylonia and the Levant, Sennacherib's death was welcomed as divine punishment whilst the reaction in the Assyrian heartland was probably resentment and horror. Arda-Mulissu's coronation was postponed and in the meantime, Esarhaddon raised an army and successfully seized Nineveh, becoming king as intended by Sennacherib's succession plans.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Ancestry and early life ===\n[[File:Deportation_of_Jews_by_Assyrians.svg|left|thumb|Expansion of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], and the [[Resettlement policy of the Neo-Assyrian Empire|deportations]] of [[Jews]] from the [[Levant]], under the reigns of Sennacherib's three immediate predecessors as king; [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser V]] and [[Sargon II]].]]\nSennacherib was the son and successor of the Neo-Assyrian king [[Sargon II]], who had reigned as [[king of Assyria]] from 722 to 705 BC and as [[king of Babylon]] from 710 to 705 BC. The identity of Sennacherib's mother is not entirely certain. Though the most popular view historically has been that Sennacherib was the son of Sargon's wife [[Ataliya]], this is probably impossible. To be the mother of Sennacherib, Ataliya would have had to be born at the latest around the year 760 BC and lived to about 692 BC, but Ataliya's grave at [[Kalhu]] has been recovered and her body indicated that she was at most 35 years old when she died. It is considered more plausible that Sennacherib's mother was another of Sargon's wives, [[Ra'\u012bm\u00e2]], who in a stele from [[Assur]] (once the capital of Assyria) is specifically referred to as the \"mother of Sennacherib\".{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=13}} Sargon II claimed that he was the son of the earlier king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], but this is uncertain as Sargon usurped the throne from Tiglath-Pileser's (other) son [[Shalmaneser V]].{{Sfn|Elayi|2017|p=27}}\n\nSennacherib was probably born {{Circa|}} 745 BC. If Sargon II was the son of Tiglath-Pileser III and not a non-dynastic usurper, he would probably have lived in the royal palace at Kalhu for several years before becoming king. Sennacherib would then probably have been born at Kalhu, where he would then have grown up and spent most of his youth. Sargon lived in Kalhu until long after becoming king, leaving the city in 710 BC to reside at [[Babylon]] and later at his new capital, [[Dur-Sharrukin]]. By that point Sennacherib, who served as Sargon's crown prince and intended heir to the throne had already left the city, living in a residence at [[Nineveh]].{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=18}} Nineveh had been the designated seat of the Assyrian crown prince since the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=30}} As crown prince, Sennacherib also owned an estate at [[Tarbisu]]. Alongside his siblings, Sennacherib would have been educated by the royal educator Hunn\u00ee, probably receiving a scribal education, learning some arithmetic and learning how to read and write in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=18}}\n\nHe had several brothers and at least one sister. In addition to the older brothers dead before his birth, Sennacherib also had younger brothers, some of which are mentioned as being alive as late as 670 BC, then in the service of Sennacherib's son and successor [[Esarhaddon]]. Sennacherib's only known sister, [[Ahat-abisha]], was married off to Ambaris, the king of [[Tabal]], but probably returned to Assyria after Sargon's first successful campaign against Tabal.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=15}}\n\nSennacherib's name, ''S\u00een-a\u1e25\u1e25\u0113-er\u012bba'' in Akkadian, means \"[[Sin (mythology)|S\u00een]] (the moon-god) has replaced the brothers\". The name probably derives from Sennacherib not being Sargon's first son, but all of his older brothers being dead by the time he was born. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], his name was rendered as ''Sn\u1e25ryb'' and in [[Aramaic]] it was ''\u0160n\u1e25\u2019ryb''.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=12}} As per a 670 BC document, it was illegal to give the name Sennacherib (then the former king) to a commoner in Assyria, as it was considered a taboo and sacrilege.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=13}}\n\n=== Sennacherib as crown prince ===\n[[File:Sargon_II_(left)_faces_a_high-ranking_official,_possibly_Sennacherib_his_son_and_crown_prince._710-705_BCE._From_Khorsabad,_Iraq._The_British_Museum,_London.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sennacherib's father [[Sargon II]] (left) facing a high-ranking official, possibly his crown prince Sennacherib. From a relief housed in the [[British Museum]].]]\nAs crown prince, Sennacherib exercised royal power together with his father, or alone as a substitute while Sargon was away campaigning. During Sargon's longer absences from the Assyrian heartland, Sennacherib's residence would have served as the center of government in the Neo-Assyrian Empire, with the crown prince taking on significant administrative and political responsibilities.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=30}} The vast responsibilities allowed to Sennacherib suggests a certain degree of  trust between the king and the crown prince. In reliefs depicting both Sargon and Sennacherib, they are depicted in discussion, appearing almost as equals. As regent, Sennacherib's main duty was to maintain relations with Assyrian governors and generals and oversee the vast military intelligence network of the empire. Sennacherib also oversaw domestic affairs and often informed Sargon of the progress being made on building projects throughout the empire.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=31}} Sennacherib was also assigned to the distribution and reception of audience gifts and tribute, after distributing such financial resources, Sennacherib sent letters to his father to inform him of the decisions made.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=38}}\n\nSennacherib's letter to his father indicate that he respected him and that they were on friendly terms. He never disobeyed his father and though his letters indicate that he wanted to please Sargon, they also show that he knew him quite well. For unknown reasons Sargon never brought Sennacherib along on his military campaigns, something Sennacherib may have resented his father for as he missed out on the glory attached to military victories.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=40}} In any event, Sennacherib never took action against Sargon or attempted to usurp the throne despite being more than old enough to become king on his own.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=40}}\n\n=== Assyria and Babylonia ===\n[[File:Mesopotamia 1200 BC.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Mesopotamia]] {{Circa|}} 1200 BC, 500 years before Sennacherib's time, showing important cities and the former core territories of [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]].]]\nBy the time Sennacherib became king, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had been the dominant power in the Near East for more than thirty years, chiefly due to its well-trained and large army which was superior to that of any other contemporary kingdom. Though [[Babylonia]] in the south had once been a large kingdom as well, it was typically weaker than its northern neighbor due to being internally divided and lacking the well organized army of the Assyrians. The population of Babylonia was divided into various groups with different priorities and ideas. Though most of the cities, such as Babylon itself and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Borsippa]] and [[Nippur]], were ruled by the old native Babylonians, most of the southernmost land was dominated by [[Chaldea]]n tribes led by chieftains who often squabbled with each other.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=89}} There were also the [[Arameans]], living on fringes of the settled land and being notorious for their robberies and plunders. Because these three major group rarely worked together, Babylonia often represented an appealing target for Assyrian campaigns.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=90}} The two kingdoms competed for centuries and in the 8th century BC the Assyrians eventually gained the upper hand.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=209}} Babylon's internal and external weakness led to its conquest by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 729 BC.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=90}}\n\nDuring the expansion of Assyria into a major empire, the Assyrians had conquered various neighboring kingdoms, generally either annexing them and turning them into Assyrian provinces or allowing them to continue on as vassal states. However, because the Assyrians venerated Babylon's long history and its culture, it was preserved as a full kingdom, either being ruled through an appointed vassal king or by the Assyrian king directly (then being the king of both Assyria and Babylonia).{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=90}} The relationship between Assyria and Babylonia was not entirely unlike the relationship between [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in later centuries; Assyria and Babylonia shared the same language and a large amount of Assyria's own culture, texts and traditions had been imported from the south.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=208}} Assyria's relationship to Babylon was in a way an emotional one, there is an implicit gendering of the two countries in Neo-Assyrian inscriptions and in their worldview (with Assyria as the metaphorical \"husband\" of its \"wife\", Babylon). In the words of [[Assyriologist]] Eckart Frahm, \"the Assyrians were in love with Babylon, but also wished to dominate her\". Though Babylon was respected as the well-spring of civilization, it was expected to remain passive in political matters, something which Assyria's \"Babylonian bride\" repeatedly refused to do.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=212}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Death of Sargon II and succession ===\n[[File:Alter_Orient_0700BC.svg|alt=|thumb|Map of the [[Near East]] in 700 BC, with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] shown in blue.]]\nIn 705 BC, Sargon II, probably in his sixties, led the Assyrian army on campaign against King Gurd\u00ee of [[Tabal]] in central [[Anatolia]]. The campaign was a disaster; Gurd\u00ee defeated the Assyrian army, killed the king and carried off his body.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=201}}{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=20}} Though the defeat was bad, the death of the king was worse and the Assyrians believed that the gods must have punished Sargon for some major past wrongdoing. In Mesopotamian mythology, the afterlife suffered by those who died in battle and weren't buried was terrible, doomed to suffer like beggars for eternity.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=202}} Sennacherib was about 35 years old when he ascended to the Assyrian throne in August of 705 BC{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=3}} and was well experienced with how to rule the empire due to his long tenure as crown prince.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=204}} His reaction to the fate of his father was to distance himself from Sargon{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=15}} and appears to have been denial, refusing to acknowledge and deal with what happened to him. Sargon's great new capital, Dur-Sharrukin, was abandoned immediately and the capital was instead moved to Nineveh. Before he began any other major projects, one of Sennacherib's first actions as king was to rebuild a temple dedicated to the god [[Nergal]], associated with death, disaster and war, at the city [[Tarbisu]].{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=202}}\n\nEven with this public denial in mind, Sennacherib was superstitious and spent much time asking his diviners what kind of sin Sargon could have committed to suffer the fate that he did, possibly considering the idea that Sargon might have offended Babylon's deities by taking control of the city.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} A text, though probably written after Sennacherib's own death, has the king proclaim that he was investigating the nature of a \"sin\" committed by his father.{{Sfn|Frahm|2002|p=1113}} A minor 704 BC{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=130}} campaign (unmentioned in Sennacherib's later historical accounts), led by Sennacherib's [[magnate]]s rather than the king himself, was sent against Gurd\u00ee in Tabal to avenge Sargon. Sennacherib spent a lot of time and effort to rid the empire of Sargon's imagery. Images which Sargon had created at the temple in Assur were made invisible through raising the level of the courtyard, Sargon's wife Ataliya was buried hastily when she died without regard to the traditional burial practices (and in the same coffin as another woman, the queen of the previous king Tiglath-Pileser III), and Sargon is never mentioned in his inscriptions.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=203}}\n\n=== First Babylonian campaign ===\n[[File:Vorderasiatisches_Museum_Berlin_027.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Depiction of Sennacherib's arch-enemy [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]] (left), [[king of Babylon]] 722\u2013710 BC and 704/703\u2013702 BC and the instigator of many of Sennacherib's later conflicts, [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffing]] (making a legal agreement with) a vassal.

Furthermore, Sennacherib did not \"take the hand\" of the [[Statue of Marduk]], the physical representation of the deity, and thus did not honor the god by undergoing the traditional Babylonian coronation ritual.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=9}}\n\nAngered by the disprespect, revolts a month apart in 704{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=129}} or 703{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}}{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} BC overthrew Sennacherib's rule in the south. First, a Babylonian by the name [[Marduk-zakir-shumi II]] took the throne but he was after just two{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} or four{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=129}}{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} weeks replaced as king by Marduk-apla-iddina II, the same Chaldean warlord who had seized control of the city once before and had warred against Sennacherib's father. Marduk-apla-iddina's main strength was his ability to unite the normally infighting Chaldean tribes and the Babylonians against the Assyrians.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} [[Shutur-Nahhunte II]], the king of [[Elam]] (a civilization in modern-day south-western Iran), sent aid to Marduk-apla-iddina, sending an army of 80,000 Elamite bowmen, supported by cavalry under the command of his commander-in-chief. Elam's massive support inspired the rest of the Chaldean tribes and the Arameans to join the ranks of the Babylonian king.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}}\n[[File:Sennacherib.jpg|thumb|Sennacherib on campaign against [[Babylon]] as depicted in one of his reliefs.]]\nDue to portions of the Assyrian army being absent in Tabal in 704 BC and Sennacherib possibly considering a two-front war too risky, he left Marduk-apla-iddina unchallenged for several months. After the Tabal expedition had been completed, Sennacherib gathered the Assyrian army at Assur in 703 BC, often used as a mustering spot for campaigns against the south.{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=130}} Near the city of Kish,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} the forces of this coalition successfully defeated an early Assyrian attack led by Sennacherib's commander-in-chief and other generals, bolstering their confidence and Babylon continued to ignore the Babylonian claims of the Assyrian king.{{Sfn|Bauer|2007|p=384}} Once Sennacherib, encamped by the city of [[Kutha]], received word of the defeat of his generals he led the next attack in person and at a new battle near Kish, he defeated the troops of the anti-Assyrian coalition. At this point, the anti-Assyrian army was led by Elam as Marduk-apla-iddina, fearing for his life, had fled to the southern Sea Land (the marshlands in southernmost Mesopotamia). Among the captives taken after the victory was a stepson of Marduk-apla-iddina and brother of an Arabian queen, [[Yatie]], who had joined the coalition.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}}\n\nSennacherib then marched directly towards Babylon. As the Assyrians appeared on the horizon, Babylon opened its gates to Sennacherib without the need of a protracted siege.{{Sfn|Bauer|2007|p=384}} The Assyrians then spent five days unsuccessfully hunting for Marduk-apla-iddina in the Sea Land, destroying the fields of Chaldeans, Arameans and Babylonians who had supported the revolting regime and taking more than two hundred thousand prisoners.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} The city of Babylon itself was also reprimanded, suffering a minor sack,{{Sfn|Bauer|2007|p=384}} though the citizens were not harmed.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=106}} Because his previous policy of reigning as king of both Assyria and Babylonia had evidently failed, Sennacherib attempted another method, appointing a native Babylonian who had grown up at the Assyrian court, [[Bel-ibni]], as his vassal king of the south. Bel-ibni was described by Sennacherib as \"a native of Babylon who grew up in my palace like a young puppy\".{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}}\n\n=== War in the Levant ===\n{{Main|Sennacherib's campaign in the Levant}}\n[[File:Assyrian siege-engine attacking the city wall of Lachish, part of the ascending assaulting wave.

There, Sennacherib subdued the [[Yasubigallians]], a people from east of the Tigris river,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=11}} and the [[Kassites]], a people which centuries prior had ruled Babylonia.{{Sfn|Matty|2016|p=26}} Sennacherib's third campaign, directed against the kingdoms and city-states in the Levant, is compared to many other events in the history of the ancient Near East very well documented. Notably, it is the most well documented event in the [[history of Israel]] during the [[First Temple Period|First Temple period]].{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=11}} In 705 BC, [[Hezekiah]], the king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], had stopped paying his annual tribute to the Assyrians and began pursuing a markedly aggressive foreign policy, probably inspired by the recent wave of anti-Assyrian rebellions across the empire. Hezekiah conspired with [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Sidqia]], an anti-Assyrian king of the city [[Ashkelon]], attacked [[Philistines|Philistine]] cities loyal to Assyria and captured the Assyrian vassal Padi, king of [[Ekron]], and imprisoned him in his capital [[Jerusalem]].{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=20}} In the northern Levant, former Assyrian vassal cities rallied around [[Luli]], the king of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]].{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} The anti-Assyrian sentiment among some of the empire's western vassals was encouraged by Sennacherib's arch-enemy Marduk-apla-iddina II, who corresponded with and sent gifts to western rulers such as Hezekiah,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=10}} probably hoping to assemble a vast anti-Assyrian alliance.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}}\n[[File:Assyrian soldier, using a dagger, about to behead a prisoner from the city of Lachish.

Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nIn 701 BC, Sennacherib first moved to attack the [[Syro-Hittite states|Syro-Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n cities in the north. Like many rulers of these cities had done before and would do after, Luli decided to flee rather than face the wrath of the Assyrians, escaping by boat until he was safely outside of Sennacherib's reach. In his stead, Sennacherib proclaimed a noble by the name [[Ethbaal of Sidon|Ethbaal]] as the new king of Sidon and his vassal and oversaw the submission of many of the surrounding cities to his rule. Faced with a massive Assyrian army nearby, many of the Levantine rulers, including [[Budu-ilu]] of [[Ammon]], [[Kamusu-nadbi]] of [[Moab]], [[Mitini of Ashdod|Mitini]] of [[Ashdod]] and [[Malik-rammu]] of [[Edom]], quickly submitted to Sennacherib to avoid retribution.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=11}}\n\nThe resistance in the southern Levant was not as easily compelled to submit, forcing Sennacherib to invade the region. The Assyrians began with taking Ashkelon, defeating Sidqia, and then proceeded to successfully besiege and take numerous cities. As the Assyrians were preparing to retake Ekron, Hezekiah's ally Egypt intervened in the conflict but the Egyptian expedition was defeated in battle near the city [[Ge'alya|Eltekeh]]. The cities of Ekron and [[Timnah]] were taken and Judah stood alone, with Sennacherib setting his sight on Jerusalem.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=11}} While a portion of Sennacherib's troops prepared to blockade Jerusalem, Sennacherib himself marched on the important Judean city [[Lachish]]. Both the [[Assyrian siege of Jerusalem|blockade of Jerusalem]] and the [[siege of Lachish]] probably served to prevent further Egyptian aid from reaching Hezekiah and to intimidate the kings of other smaller states in the region. The siege of Lachish, which ended in the city's destruction, was so long that the defenders eventually began using arrows made of bone rather than metal since supplies were running out. In order to take the city, the Assyrians constructed a great siege mound (essentially a ramp made of stone and earth) to reach the top of Lachish's walls. After the city was destroyed, survivors were deported into the Assyrian Empire. Some of them were forced to aid in Sennacherib's building projects and others were employed in the king's personal guard.{{Sfn|Barnett|1958|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\n=== Sennacherib at the gates of Jerusalem ===\n{{Main|Assyrian siege of Jerusalem}}\n[[File:DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB'S HOST..jpg|left|thumb|19th century [[wood engraving]] by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] depicting the [[Bible|Biblical]] narrative of an [[angel]] destroying Sennacherib's army outside [[Jerusalem]].]]\nSennacherib's account of what happened at Jerusalem begins with \"As for Hezekiah ... like a caged bird I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city. I barricaded him with outposts, and exit from the gate of his city I made taboo for him\". As such, Jerusalem was blockaded in some capacity, though the lack of massive military activities and appropriate equipment means that it was probably not a full siege.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=38}} According to the narrative of the event laid out in the [[Books of Kings]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], a senior Assyrian official with the title [[Rabshakeh]] stood in front of the city's walls and demanded its surrender.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=25}} Allegedly, the Rabshakeh used the phrase \"eat feces and drink urine\" to threaten the Judeans with the difficult conditions that they were soon to experience.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=40}} Although the Assyrian account of the operation may lead one to believe that Sennacherib was present in person, this is never explicitly stated and reliefs depicting the campaign show Sennacherib as seated on a throne in Lachish instead of overseeing the preparations for an assault on Jerusalem. According to the biblical account, Sennacherib's threatening representatives to Hezekiah found Sennacherib engaged in a struggle with the city [[Libnah]] upon their return to the king, who remained at Lachish.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=12}}\n\nThe account of the blockade erected around Jerusalem is different from the sieges described in Sennacherib's annals and the massive reliefs in Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh which depict the Levantine campaign show the successful siege of Lachish rather than what transpired at Jerusalem. Though the blockade of Jerusalem was not a proper siege, it is clear from all available sources that a massive Assyrian army was encamped in the city's vicinity, probably on its northern side.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=39\u201340}}\n[[File:The fall of Lachish, King Sennacherib reviews Judaean prisoners..JPG|thumb|Relief depicting Sennacherib (enthroned at the far right) at [[Lachish]], interacting with his officials and reviewing the prisoners from [[Judea]]. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nThough it is clear  that the blockade of Jerusalem ended without significant fighting, how it was resolved and what stopped Sennacherib's massive army from overwhelming the city is uncertain. The Biblical account of the end of Sennacherib's attack on Jerusalem holds that though Hezekiah's soldiers manned the walls of the city, ready to defend it against the Assyrians, an entity referred to as the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|destroying angel]], sent by [[Yahweh]], annihilated Sennacherib's army, killing 185,000 Assyrian soldiers in front of Jerusalem's gates.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=19}} The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] describe the operation being an Assyrian failure due to a \"multitude of [[Apodemus|field-mice]]\" descending upon the Assyrian camp, devouring crucial material such as quivers and bowstrings, making the Assyrians unarmed and causing them to flee.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=12}} It is possible that the story of the mice infestation is an allusion to some kind of disease striking the Assyrian camp, possibly the [[septicemic plague]].{{Sfn|Caesar|2017|p=224}} The battle being an outright Assyrian defeat is considered unlikely, especially on account of contemporary Babylonian chronicles, otherwise eager to mention Assyrian failures, being silent on the matter.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=13}}\n\nDespite the seemingly inconclusive end to the blockade of Jerusalem, the Levantine campaign was an Assyrian victory. After the Assyrians had successfully seized many of Judah's most important fortified cities and destroyed several towns and villages, Hezekiah realized that his anti-Assyrian activities had been disastrous military and political miscalculations and as such submitted to the Assyrians once more. He was forced to pay a heavier tribute than previously, probably alongside a heavy penalty and the tribute which he had failed to send to Nineveh from 705 to 701 BC.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=20}} He was also forced to release the imprisoned king of Ekron, Padi,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=13}} and Judah lost a substantial amount of territory in the aftermath of the campaign, with Sennacherib granting portions of its land to the neighboring kingdoms of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], Ashdod and Ekron.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=48}}\n\n=== Resolving the Babylonian problem ===\n[[File:Assyria slingers hurling stones towards the enemy at the city of -alammu.

From Nineveh, Iraq, currently housed in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Relief from Sennacherib's reign depicting Assyrian slingers hurling stones at an enemy city. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nSennacherib's victory in the Levant had not been as conclusive and decisive as most Assyrian victories, which may have encouraged the vassal king of Babylon, Bel-ibni, to listen to the Elamites and Marduk-apla-iddina.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=13}} Because Marduk-apla-iddina continued to be active in Babylonoia, Sennacherib campaigned against the south again in 700 BC and removed Bel-ibni from the throne, either due to complicity or incompetence.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=91}} Sennacherib's hunt for Marduk-apla-iddina was so furious that the Chaldean escaped on boats with his people and treasury across the Persian Gulf, taking refuge in the Elamite city Nagitu. Victorious, Sennacherib attempted yet another method to govern Babylonia and appointed his son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] to reign as Babylonian vassal king.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=14}}\n\nAshur-nadin-shumi was also titled as ''m\u0101ru r\u0113\u0161t\u00fb'', a title that could be interpreted either as the \"pre-eminent son\" or the \"firstborn son\". His appointment as king of Babylon and the new title suggests that Ashur-nadin-shumi was being groomed to also follow Sennacherib as the King of Assyria upon his death. Ashur-nadin-shumi being titled as the ''m\u0101ru r\u0113\u0161t\u00fb'' likely means that he was Sennacherib's crown prince; if it means \"pre-eminent\" such a title would be befitting only for the crown prince and if it means \"firstborn\", it also suggests that Ashur-nadin-shumi was the heir as the Assyrians in most cases followed the principle of primogeniture (the oldest son inherits).{{Sfn|Porter|1993|p=14}} More evidence in favor of Ashur-nadin-shumi being the crown prince is Sennacherib's construction of a palace for him at the city of [[Assur]],{{Sfn|Porter|1993|p=15}} something Sennacherib would also do for the later crown prince Esarhaddon. As an Assyrian King of Babylon, Ashur-nadin-shumi's position was politically important and highly delicate and would have granted valuable experience to him as the intended heir to the entire Neo-Assyrian Empire.{{Sfn|Porter|1993|p=16}}\n\nIn the years that followed, Babylonia stayed relatively quiet and Sennacherib campaigned elsewhere. His fifth campaign in 699 BC was composed of a series of raids against the villages around the foot of [[Mount Judi]], located to the northeast of Nineveh. Other small campaigns were also led by Sennacherib's general without the king present, including a 698 BC expedition against Kirua, a revolting Assyrian governor in [[Cilicia]], and a 695 BC campaign against the city [[Tegarama]] for which the cause is unknown. Throughout these years, the survival of Marduk-apla-iddina likely represented a thorn in Sennacherib's side and so, he decided to invade Elam in 694 BC in pursuit of his Chaldean enemies.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=14}}\n\n=== The Elamite campaign and revenge ===\n[[File:AssyrianWarship.jpg|thumb|Assyrian warship depicted in one of Sennacherib's reliefs. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nIn preparation for an invasion of Elam, aimed at capturing the escaped Chaldeans rather than defeating the Elamites themselves, Sennacherib had for some time overseen the construction of a great fleet by Phoenician shipbuilders in the northern parts of the Euphrates and in Nineveh, by the Tigris. The ships, manned by sailors from Tyre, Sidon and [[Cyprus]], then transported large portions of the Assyrian army to the city [[Opis]]. At Opis, the ships were pulled ashore and transported overland on rollers or sledges to the [[Arahtu River|Arahtu canal]], perhaps because the lower portions of the two rivers were under Elamite influence. When the Arahtu joined with the Euphrates south of Babylon, the troops embarked and marched to the mouth of the river. Sennacherib was not present on the boats, marching the entire distance from Nineveh to the mouth of the Euphrates.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=14}} From the city [[Bab-Salemeti]], Sennacherib then joined the rest of the army and sailed across the Persian Gulf. Though the journey took five days and was apparently difficult, with repeated sacrifices being made to [[Ea (god)|Ea]], the god of the deep, the Assyrians successfully landed at the Elamite coast.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=15}}\n[[File:Assyrian soldiers and their prisoners from the town of -alammu, 8th century BC, from Nineveh, Iraq.

The many captured Chaldeans and Elamites were partioned among his soldiers. Though Sennacherib had successfully had his revenge against Marduk-apla-iddina, his arch-enemy had not lived the see it, seemingly dying of natural causes shortly before. The campaign was not a total success, as Shutur-Nahhunte II's successor as king of Elam, [[Hallushu-Inshushinak]], exacted his revenge for the invasion by striking at Babylonia.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=15}} Wishing to restore their independence, some of the Babylonians then seized their king Ashur-nadin-shumi at the city [[Sippar]] and handed him over to the Elamites whereafter Ashur-nadin-shumi was taken to Elam and never heard from again, probably being executed.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=92}}{{Sfn|Bertman|2005|p=79}} In his stead, the Elamites proclaimed a native Babylonian, [[Nergal-ushezib]], as the king of Babylon.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=92}}\n\nSennacherib's position, cut off from his own empire by both Elam and Babylonia, was disadvantageous and the Elamite-Babylonian alliance was initially successful. In June or July of 694 BC, Nergal-ushezib captured the city Nippur but three months later the Assyrians took Uruk and shortly thereafter the war decisively turned in the favor of the Assyrians. In 693 BC, Negal-ushezib and the Elamites attacked the Assyrian army near Nippur but were defeated and Nergal-ushezib was taken as a prisoner to Nineveh. Shortly thereafter, a rebellion broke out in Elam and three weeks after the defeat at Nippur, Hallushu-Inshushinak was replaced as Elamite king by [[Kutir-Nahhunte III]]. Even then, the Babylonians did not surrender and instead proclaimed the Chaldean [[Mushezib-Marduk]] as their new king. Before moving to deal with this problem, Sennacherib was determined to defeat Elam. Though the Assyrians captured and destroyed 46 cities, the Elamites refused to fight them, retreating with their new king into the mountains. The oncoming winter, combined with snow and rain, stopped Sennacherib from pursuing them and he returned to Nineveh.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=15}}\n\n=== Destruction of Babylon ===\n{{Main|Siege of Babylon}}\n[[File:Assiri, regno di sennacherib, prisma a sei facce con iscrizione sulle 8 campagne militari del sovrano, 704-681 ac ca. 02.jpg|thumb|Prism of Sennacherib, containing records of his military campaigns, culminating with [[Siege of Babylon|Babylon's destruction]].

With the threat of Assyrian invasion looming, the Babylonians quickly ensured the continued support of Elam by bribing the new Elamite king with valuables they stripped from their great temple dedicated to their god Marduk.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=15}} The Assyrian records consider Humban-Numena's decision to support Babylon as dumb, describing him as a \"man without any sense or judgement\".{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=16}} In 691 BC, Mushezib-Marduk's anti-Assyrian coalition struck against Sennacherib. Humban-Numena and his commander, Humban-undasha, led the forces of the coalition against Sennacherib in the [[Battle of Halule]], the outcome of which is uncertain. Babylonian texts describe the battle as a great victory, but so do Assyrian documents. Since Assyrian texts do not mention events in the south again until the later siege of Babylon, it is more likely that the southerners won, though likely suffering large casualties. Sennacherib returned to Nineveh with both of his enemies still on their respective thrones.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=93}}{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=17}}\n\nIn 690 BC, Humban-Numena suffered a stroke and his jaw became locked in a way which prevented him from speaking. Taking advantage of the situation, Sennacherib embarked on his final campaign against Babylon.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=17}} The initial success of the Babylonians had been short-lived and in that same year, a siege of Babylon was already well underway.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=93}} Babylon must have been in a poor condition once it fell to Sennacherib in 689 BC, having been besieged for over fifteen months. The king who had anxiously considered the implications of Sargon's seizure of Babylon and the role that the city's offended gods may have played in his father's downfall was gone, replaced by a king wishing to avenge the death of his son and tiring of a city well within the borders of his empire which had repeatedly rebelled against his rule. He had no affection for gods who had inspired their populace to attack him and Sennacherib decided to destroy the city.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=94}} Sennacherib's own account of the destruction reads as follows:\n\n{{quote|quote=Into my land I carried off alive Mu\u0161\u0113zib-Marduk, king of Babylonia, together with his family and officials. I counted out the wealth of that city \u2013 silver, gold, precious stones, property and goods \u2013 into the hands of my people; and they took it as their own. The hands of my people laid hold of the gods dwelling there and smashed them; they took their property and goods.<br>I destroyed the city and its houses, from foundation to parapet; I devastated and burned them. I razed the brick and earthenwork of the outer and inner wall of the city, of the temples, and of the ziggurat; and I dumped these into the Ara\u1e2btu canal. I dug canals through the midst of that city, I overwhelmed it with water, I made its very foundations disappear, and I destroyed it more completely than a devastating flood. So that it might be impossible in future days to recognize the site of that city and its temples, I utterly dissolved it with water and made it like inundated land.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=94}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nIt is worth pointing out that even as Sennacherib destroyed the city, he was still somewhat fearful of Babylon's ancient gods. Earlier in his account of the campaign he specifically mention that the sanctuaries of the Babylonian deities had provided financial support to his enemies and the passage in which the seizure of the property of the gods and the destruction of some of their statues is described is one of the few in which Sennacherib uses \"my people\" rather than \"I\".{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=94}} This leaves the blame of the fate of the temples not on Sennacherib himself, but on the decisions made by the temple personnel and the actions of the Assyrian people rather than the king in particular.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=95}}\n\nDuring the destruction of the city, Sennacherib destroyed the temples and the images of the gods, except for that of Marduk, which he took to Assyria.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=118}} This caused consternation in Assyria itself, where Babylon and its gods were held in high esteem.{{sfn|Leick|2009|p=156}} Sennacherib attempted to justify his actions to his own countrymen through a campaign of religious propaganda.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|pp=118\u2013119}} Among the elements of this campaign he commissioned a myth in which Marduk was put on trial before [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], the god of Assyria. This text is fragmentary but it seems Marduk is found guilty of some grave offense;{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=119}} he described his defeat of the Babylonian rebels in language of the [[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161|Babylonian creation myth]], identifying Babylon with the evil demon-goddess [[Tiamat]] and himself with Marduk;{{sfn|McCormick|2002|pp=156,158}} Ashur replaced Marduk in the New Year's festival; and in the temple of the festival he placed a symbolic pile of rubble from Babylon.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=116}} In Babylonia, Sennacherib's policy spawned a deep-seated hatred amongst much of the populace.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=109}}\n\nSennacherib's goal was the complete eradication of the Babylonia as a political entity.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=210}} Though some northern Babylonian territories were turned into Assyrian provinces, the Assyrians made no effort to rebuild Babylon itself and southern chronicles from the time refer to the era as the \"kingless\" period when there was no king in the land.{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=95}}\n\n=== Construction of Nineveh ===\n[[File:Archaeologist Henry Layard's image of Nineveh.jpg|left|thumb|19th century reconstruction of [[Nineveh]] by British archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]].]]\nAfter the final war with Babylon, Sennacherib seemingly spent the rest of his reign in peace, dedicating his time to improving his new capital at Nineveh rather than embarking on large military campaigns.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1924|p=17}} Nineveh had been an important city in northern Mesopotamia for millennia. The oldest traces of human settlement at its location are from the 7th millennium BC and from the 4th millennium BC and onwards it formed an important administrative center in the north.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=13}} When Sennacherib made the city his new capital it experienced one of the most ambitious building projects in ancient history, being completely transformed from the somewhat neglected state the city had been in before his reign.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=14}}\n[[File:Palace of Sennacherib Restored.jpeg|left|thumb|1876 reconstruction of Sennacherib's \"Palace without Rival\" in [[Nineveh]] by [[John Philip Newman]].]]\nThe earliest inscriptions discussing the building project at Nineveh date to 702 BC and are about the construction of the Southwest Palace, a large residence constructed in the city's southwestern parts.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=15}} Sennacherib called this palace the ''ekallu \u0161a \u0161\u0101nina la i\u0161u'', the \"Palace without Rival\".{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=5}} During the construction process, a previous smaller palace was torn down, a stream of water which had been eroding parts of the palace mound was redirected and a terrace which the new palace was to stand on was erected and raised to the height of 160 layers of brick. Though many of these early inscriptions talk about the palace as if it was already completed, this was the standard way of writing about building projects in ancient Assyria. The Nineveh described in Sennacherib's earliest accounts of its construction was a city with at that point only existed in his imagination.'''{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=15}}'''\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 350\n| image1 = Nineveh map city walls & gates.JPG\n| image2 = Quyunjiq constructions.JPG\n| footer = City plan of [[Nineveh]] (left) and a close-up of the Kuyunjik mound (right), where Sennacherib's palace was constructed. The northern palace depicted in the map was first built during the reign of Sennacherib's grandson [[Ashurbanipal]].\n}}\n\nBy 700 BC the walls of the Southwest Palace's throne room were being constructed, followed shortly thereafter by the many reliefs that were to be displayed within it. After the reliefs were done, the final step in the construction of the palace was the erection of great colossal statues depicting bulls and lions, characteristic of Late Assyrian architecture. Though such statues in stone have been excavated at Nineveh, similar colossal statues mentioned in the inscriptions as being made of precious metals remain missing. The roof of the palace was constructed with cypress and cedar recovered from the mountains in the west and the palace was illuminated through multiple windows and decorated with silver and bronze pegs on the inside and glazed bricks on the outside. The full structure, going by the mound it was built on, measured 450 metres (1476&nbsp;ft) long and 220 metres (722&nbsp;ft) wide. An inscription on a stone lion in the quarter associated with Sennacherib's queen, Tashmetu-sharrat, contains hopes that the king and queen would both live long and healthy lives within the new palace.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=16}} The text of the inscription reads:\n\n{{Quote|quote=And for the queen Tashmetu-sharrat, my beloved wife, whose features [[Belet-ili]] has made more beautiful than all other women, I had a palace of love, joy and pleasure built. \u2026 By the order of Ashur, father of the gods, and heavenly queen [[Ishtar]] may we both live long in health and happiness in this palace and enjoy wellbeing to the full!{{Sfn|Kertai|2013|p=116}}}}\n\nThough probably conceived as a structure similar to the palace Sargon II built at Dur-Sharrukin, Sennacherib's palace and especially the artwork featured therein shows some differences. Though Sargon's reliefs usually show the king as close to other members of the Assyrian aristocracy, Sennacherib's art usually depicts the king towering above everyone else in his vicinity due to being mounted in a chariot. His reliefs show larger scenes, some almost from a birds-eye point of view. There are also examples of a more naturalistic approach in the art; where colossal statues of bulls from Sargon's palace depicts them with five legs (so that four legs could be seen from either side and two from the front), Sennacherib's bulls all have four legs.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=16}} Sennacherib constructed beautiful gardens at his new palace, importing various plants and herbs from throughout his empire and beyond. [[Cotton]] plants may have been imported from as far away as India. It has been suggested that the famous [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], where actually these gardens in Nineveh, but the presence of impressive royal gardens in Babylon itself makes this idea somewhat unlikely.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=17}}\n\nIn addition to the palace, Sennacherib oversaw other building projects at Nineveh. He built a large second palace at the city's southern mound, which served as an arsenal to store military equipment and also as permanent quarters for portions of the Assyrian standing army. Numerous temples were built and restored, many of them on the Kuyunjik mound (where the Southwest Palace was located), including a temple dedicated to the god S\u00een (invoked in the king's own name). Furthermore, Sennacherib massively expanded the city to the south and erected new huge and massive city walls, surrounded by a moat, up to 25 metres (82&nbsp;ft) high and 15 metres (49&nbsp;ft) thick.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=17}}\n\n=== Conspiracy, murder and succession ===\n[[File:The_Flight_of_Adrammelech_Murch.jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Flight of Adrammelech'', illustration from ''Dalziel's Bible Gallery'' (1881), depicting [[Arda-Mulissu]] and Nabu-shar-usur escaping after murdering Sennacherib.]]\nWhen his eldest son and original crown prince Ashur-nadin-shumi disappeared and presumably died, Sennacherib selected his eldest surviving son, [[Arda-Mulissu]], as the new crown prince. Arda-Mulissu held the position of heir apparent for several years until he suddenly was replaced as heir by his younger brother Esarhaddon in 684 BC. The reason for Arda-Mulissu's sudden dismissal from the prominent position is unknown, but it is clear from contemporary inscriptions that he was very disappointed.{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=166}} Esarhaddon's influential mother [[Naqi'a]] may have played a role in convincing Sennacherib to pick Esarhaddon as heir.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=16}} Despite his dismissal, Arda-Mulissu remained popular figure and some vassals secretly supported him as the heir to throne.{{Sfn|Parpola|1980|p=}}\n\nArda-Mulissu was forced to swear loyalty to Esarhaddon by his father, but repeatedly tried to appeal Sennacherib to again accept him as heir instead.{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=166}} Sennacherib noted the increasing popularity of Arda-Mulissu and came to fear for his designated successor, so sent Esarhaddon away to the western provinces. This exile of Esarhaddon put Arda-Mulissu in a difficult position as he had reached the height of his popularity but was powerless to do anything to Esarhaddon. In order to use the opportunity, Arda-Mulissu decided that he needed to act quickly and take the throne by force.{{Sfn|Parpola|1980|p=}} Arda-Mulissu concluded a \"treaty of rebellion\" with another of his younger brothers, Nabu-shar-usur, and on 20 October 681 BC, they attacked and killed their father in one of Nineveh's temples,{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=166}} possibly the temple dedicated to S\u00een.{{Sfn|Frahm|2008|p=17}}\n\nThe murder of Sennacherib, ruler of the mightiest empire on the planet at his time, was shocking to his contemporaries and was received with strong emotion and mixed feelings throughout Mesopotamia and the rest of the Ancient Near East. In the Levant and in Babylonia the news were celebrated and proclaimed as divine punishment due to Sennacherib's brutal campaigns against them while in Assyria, the reaction was probably resentment and horror. The event was recorded in numerous sources and is even mentioned in the Bible ({{bibleverse|2 Kings|19:37|KJV}}; [[Isaiah 37:38]]), wherein Arda-Mulissu is called ''Adrammelech''.{{Sfn|Parpola|1980|p=}}\n\nDespite their conspiracy succeeding, Arda-Mulissu couldn't successfully seize the throne. The murder of the king caused some resentment against Arda-Mulissu by his own supporters which delayed his potential coronation and in the meantime, Esarhaddon had raised an army. The army raised by Arda-Mulissu and Nabu-shar-usur met Esarhaddon's forces at [[Hanigalbat]], a city in the western parts of the empire. There, most of their soldiers deserted and joined Esarhaddon, who then marched on Nineveh without opposition, becoming the new king of Assyria. Shortly after taking the throne, Esarhaddon made sure to execute all conspirators and political enemies he could get his hands on, including the families of his brothers. All servants involved with the security of the royal palace at Nineveh were executed. Arda-Mulissu and Nabu-shar-usur survived this purge as they had escaped as exiles to the northern kingdom of [[Urartu]].{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=166}}\n\n== Family and children ==\n[[File:Assyrian_Crown-Prince_MET_hb32_143_13.jpg|thumb|Stele with a depiction of an Assyrian crown prince in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Dated to  Sennacherib's reign, it could depict [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]], [[Arda-Mulissu]] or [[Esarhaddon]].]]\nAs traditional for Assyrian kings, Sennacherib had a harem of many women. Two of his wives are known by name; '''Tashmetu-sharrat''' (Akkadian: ''Ta\u0161metu-\u0161arrat''){{Sfn|Frahm|2002|p=1114}} and '''Naqi'a'''. Whether both of the women held the position of queen or not is uncertain, but contemporary sources suggest that though the kings had multiple women, only one at a time was recognized as the queen and primary consort. For most of Sennacherib's reign, the queen was Tashmetu-sharrat, whose name literally means \"[[Tashmetum]] is queen\".{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=15}} Inscriptions suggest that Sennacherib and Tashmetu-sharrat had a loving relationship, with the king referring to her as \"my beloved wife\" and publicly praising her beauty.{{Sfn|Frahm|2002|p=1114}}\n\nWhether Nagi'a ever held the title of queen is not clear, she was referred to as the \"queen mother\" during Esarhaddon's reign but she was Esarhaddon's mother and the title was thus bestowed on her either by Esarhaddon or late in Sennacherib's reign.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=15}} Though Tashmetu-sharrat was the primary consort for longer, Naqi'a is more well known today due to her role during Esarhaddon's reign. When she became one of Sennacherib's wives, she took the Akkadian name ''Zak\u00fbtu'' (Naqi'a being an Aramaic name). Naqi'a having two names could point to her originating outside of Assyria proper, possibly in Babylonia or in the Levant, but there is no substantial evidence for any theory regarding her origin.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=16}}\n[[File:Relief_Esarhaddon_Louvre_AO20185.jpg|thumb|Relief in the [[Louvre]] depicting Sennacherib's son and successor [[Esarhaddon]] (right) and Esarhaddon's mother (and Sennacherib's wife) [[Naqi'a]] (left).]]\nSennacherib had at least seven sons and at least one daughter.

However, these inscriptions were not actually written by the king himself, but rather his royal scribes, and often served as propaganda meant to portray the king as better than all other rulers, both contemporary and ancient.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=19}} Furthermore, Assyrian royal inscriptions often only explore military and construction matters and were highly formulaic, differing little from king to king.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=171}} However, by examining the inscriptions and comparing them to those of other kings and of non-royal inscriptions, it is possible to assume some aspects of Sennacherib's character. As in the inscriptions of other Assyrian kings, Sennacherib's inscriptions show pride and high self-esteem, for instance in the passage \"Ashur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises\". In several places, the great intelligence of Sennacherib is emphasized, for instance the passage \"the god Ninshiku gave me wide understanding equal to (that of) the sage Adapu (and) endowed me with broad knowledge\". In several inscriptions he is explicitly referred to as \"foremost of all rulers\" (''a\u0161ared kal malk\u012b'') and a \"perfect man\" (''e\u1e6dlu gitm\u0101lu'').{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=19}}{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=193}} Sennacherib's decision to keep his birth name when he became king, rather than assuming a throne name (something at least 19 of his 21 immediate predecessors had done), suggests a certain degree of self-confidence. The assumption of several new epithets never before used by Assyrian kings, such as \"guardian of the right\" and \"lover of justice\", suggests a desire to leave a personal mark on a new era beginning with his reign.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=204}}\n\nWhen Sennacherib became king he was already an adult and had served as Sargon II's crown prince for over 15 years. He would thus have been well acquainted to the administration of the empire. Unlike many preceding and later Assyrian kings (including his father), Sennacherib did not portray himself as a conqueror or express much desire in conquering the world. Instead, his inscriptions often portrayed the most important parts of his reign as his large-scale building projects. Most of Sennacherib's campaigns were not aimed at conquest but at suppressing revolts against his rule, restoring lost territories and securing treasure to finance his building projects.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=20}} As can be seen in several of Sennacherib's campaigns being led by his generals rather than the king in person, Sennacherib was not as interested in campaigning as his predecessors had been.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=21}} The brutal retribution and punishment served to Assyria's enemies as described in Sennacherib's accounts do not necessarily reflect the truth as these accounts also served as propaganda and psychological warfare through intimidation.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=22}}\n[[File:Inschrift \u00fcber dem Kopf des K\u00f6nigs Sennacherib.jpg|thumb|Writing in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and its translation into English from above the head of Sennacherib in the reliefs depicting the [[siege of Lachish]]. From [[Austen Henry Layard]]'s 1853 book ''Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon''.]]\nDespite the apparent lack of interest in world domination, Sennacherib did assume the traditional Mesopotamian titles that designated rule of the entire world; \"[[King of the Universe|king of the universe]]\" and \"[[King of the Four Corners of the World|king of the four corners of the world]]\". Other titles, such as \"strong king\" and \"mighty king\", emphasized his power and greatness, alongside epithets such as \"virile warrior\" (''zikaru qardu'') and \"fierce wild bull\" (''r\u012bmu ekdu'').{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=20}} All Sennacherib's campaigns were described as victories in his own accounts, even the unsuccessful ones. This was not necessarily due to personal pride; a failed campaign would have been regarded by his subjects as an indication that the gods no longer favored Sennacherib's rule.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=20}} Sennacherib was fully convinced that the gods supported him and saw all his wars as just for this reason.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=21}} The enemies of Assyria were seen as people who did not respect the gods and they were thus treated and punished as criminals.{{Sfn|Elayi|2017|p=18}}\n\nIt is possible that Sennacherib suffered from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] due to the catastrophic fate of his father. From the available sources it does appear that Sennacherib was easily enraged by bad news and that he developed serious psychological problems over time. Sennacherib's son and successor Esarhaddon mentions in his inscriptions that Sennacherib was afflicted with the \"''al\u00fb'' demon\" and that none of Sennacherib's diviners initially dared to tell the kings that signs pointing to the demon had been observed.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=203}} What the ''al\u00fb'' demon was is not entirely understood, but the typical symptoms described in contemporary documents include the afflicted not knowing who they are, their pupils constricting, their limbs being tense, being incapable of speech and their ears roaring.{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|p=204}}\n\nAssyriologists Julian E. Reade and Eckart Frahm have pondered the idea that Sennacherib could be classified as a [[feminist]]. Female members of the court were more prominent and enjoyed greater privileges under Sennacherib's reign than under the reigns of previous Assyrian kings. The reasons for Sennacherib's policy towards his female relatives is unknown. It might be due to a desire to shift power away from powerful generals and magnates to his own family, due to encounters with powerful Arabian queens who made their own decisions and led armies or as a way to compensate for the way he treated his father's memory. Evidence to the increased standing of the royal women include the increased amount of texts referencing Assyrian queens from Sennacherib's reign compared to queens of earlier times and evidence that the queens of Sennacherib had their own standing military units, just like the king. Mirroring the increased standing of the women of the royal family, female deities were also depicted more frequently during the time of Sennacherib. For instance, the god Ashur is frequently depicted together with a female companion, probably the goddess [[Mullissu]].{{Sfn|Frahm|2014|pp=213\u2013217}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Sennacherib in popular memory ===\n[[File:Georg Pencz - Tyrants of the Old Testament- Sennacherib - 1923.413 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Woodcut]] depicting Sennacherib by 16th century German engraver, painter and printmaker [[Georg Pencz]], from a series of woodcuts titled ''Tyrants of the Old Testament''.|alt=]]Throughout the milllennia that followed Sennacherib's death, the popular image of the king has been mainly negative. There are two primary reasons for this, the first being Sennacherib's negative portrayal in the Bible, as the evil conqueror who attempted to take Jerusalem, and the second being his destruction of Babylon, one of the most prominent cities in the ancient world. This negative view of Sennacherib endured until modern times. In the famous 1815 poem ''[[The Destruction of Sennacherib]]'' by [[Lord Byron]], Sennacherib is presented as akin to a ruthless predator,{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=1}} attacking Judah as a \"wolf on the fold\":\n\n{{quote|quote=The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,<br>And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;<br>And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,<br>When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.|author=[[Lord Byron]] (1815)|title=''[[The Destruction of Sennacherib]]''|source=first stanza.{{sfn|Elayi|2018|p=1}}}}\n\n[[File:The Death of Sennacherib - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Miniature from a book of [[Old Testament]] prophets made in [[Norman Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] around 1300, portraying three separate scenes from Sennacherib's war against the Israelites.

On the left, two of Sennacherib's sons murder him as he is praying before a pagan idol.|alt=]]\nSennacherib's 701 BC attack against Jerusalem was a \"world event\", drawing together the fates of numerous otherwise disparate groups. The event and its aftermath affected and had consequences for not only the Assyrians and the Israelites, but also the Babylonians, Egyptians, [[Nubians]], Syro-Hittites and [[Anatolian peoples]]. The siege is discussed not only in contemporary sources, but also in later folklore and traditions, such in Aramaic folklore, in later [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] histories on the Near East and in the tales of medieval [[Syriac Christians]] and [[Arabs]].{{Sfn|Kalimi|Richardson|p=1|2014}} Sennacherib's levantine campaign is a significant event in the Bible, being brought up and discussed in numerous places, notably [[2 Kings]] 18:13\u201319:37, 20:6 and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 32:1\u201323.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=12}} A vast majority of the Biblical account of King Hezekiah's reign in 2 Kings is dedicated to Sennacherib's campaign, cementing it as the most important event of Hezekiah's time.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=15}} In Chronicles, the failure of Sennacherib and the success of Hezekiah is emphasized, the Assyrian campaign (here described as an aggression rather than as a response to Hezekiah's rebellious activities) is seen as doomed to fail from the start. According to the narrative, no enemy, not even the powerful king of Assyria, would have been able to triumph over Hezekiah as the Judean king had God on his side.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=21}} The conflict is presented as something akin to a [[holy war]]; God's war against the pagan Sennacherib.{{Sfn|Kalimi|2014|p=37}}\n\nThough Assyria had more than a hundred kings throughout its long history, Sennacherib (alongside his son Esarhaddon and grandsons [[Ashurbanipal]] and [[Shamash-shum-ukin]]) is one of the few kings who were remembered and figured in Aramaic and Syriac folklore long after the kingdom had fallen. In the ancient Aramaic [[story of Ahikar]], Sennacherib is portrayed as a benevolent patron of the titular character Ahikar, with his son Esarhaddon being portrayed more negatively. In medieval Syriac tales, Sennacherib is characterized as an archetypical pagan king who is assassinated as part of a family feud and whose children convert to Christianity.{{Sfn|Kalimi|Richardson|p=5|2014}} In the legend of the 4th-century [[Behnam, Sarah, and the Forty Martyrs|Saints Behnam and Sarah]], Sennacherib, under the name [[Sinharib]], is cast as the royal father of Behnam and Sarah. After Behnam converts to Christianity, Sinharib orders his execution but is later struck by a dangerous disease which is cured through being baptized by [[Saint Matthew]] in Assur. Thankful, Sinharib then converts to Christianity and founds an important monastery near [[Mosul]], called [[Mar Behnam Monastery|Deir Mar Mattai]].{{Sfn|Radner|2015|p=7}}\n\nIn later Jewish tradition, Sennacherib also occupied various roles. In [[Midrash]], similar examinations of the Old Testament and later stories, the events of 701 BC are often explored in detail; often featuring massive armies deployed by Sennacherib and pointing out how Sennacherib repeatedly consulted astrologers on his campaign, delaying his actions. In the stories, Sennacherib's armies are destroyed when Hezekiah recites [[Hallel]] psalms on the eve of [[Passover]]. The event is often portrayed as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] scenario, with Hezekiah portrayed as a [[Messiah in Judaism|messianic]] figure and Sennacherib and his armies being personifications of [[Gog and Magog]].{{Sfn|Kalimi|Richardson|p=6|2014}}\n\n=== Archaeological discoveries ===\n[[File:Six-sided clay prism, side 3, written on behalf of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, and containing narratives of his military campaigns, 704-681 BC - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC07602.JPG|thumb|One of Sennacherib's prisms, containing narratives of his military campaigns. Exhibited at the [[Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago]].]]\nThe discovery of Sennacherib's own inscriptions in the 19th century, in which brutal and cruel acts such as ordering the throats of his Elamite enemies to be slit, and their hands and lips to be cut off, amplified his already ferocious reputation. Today, an abundance of such inscriptions are known, most of them housed in the collections of the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin|Vorderasiatisches Museum]] in Berlin and the [[British Museum]] in London, though many are also scattered throughout the world in other institutions and in private collections. Some large objects with Sennacherib's inscriptions remain at Nineveh, where some have even been reburied.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=2}} Sennacherib's own accounts of his building projects and military campaigns, typically referred to as his \"annals\", of his reign were often copied several times and spread throughout the Neo-Assyrian Empire during his reign. For the first six years of his tenure as king they were written on clay cylinders, but he later began using clay prisms, probably because they provided a greater surface area.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=3}}\n\nLetters associated with Sennacherib are less in number than those known from his father and from the time of his son Esarhaddon and most of them are from Sennacherib's tenure as crown prince. Other types of non-royal inscriptions from Sennacherib's reign, such as administrative documents, economic documents and chronicles, are more numerous.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=4}} In addition to written sources, numerous pieces of artwork has also survived from Sennacherib's time, notably the king's reliefs from his palace at Nineveh. These reliefs typically depict his conquests, sometimes with short pieces of texts explaining the scene shown. First discovered and excavated from 1847 to 1851 by British archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]], the discovery of reliefs depicting Sennacherib's siege of Lachish in the Southwest Palace was the first archaeological confirmation of an event described in the Bible.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=5}}\n\nFurther excavations of the Southwest Palace were then led by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and [[Henry Creswicke Rawlinson]] from 1852 to 1854, [[William Kennett Loftus]] from 1854 to 1855 and [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] from 1873 to 1874.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=5}} Among the many inscriptions found at the site, Smith discovered a fragmentary account of a [[Flood myth|flood]], which generated much excitement both among the general public and among scholars.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=6}} Since Smith, the site has been experienced several periods of intense excavations and study; Hormuzd Rassam returned from 1878 to 1882, [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] oversaw excavations from 1889 to 1891, [[Leonard William King]] from 1903 to 1904 and [[Reginald Campbell Thompson]] in 1905 and from 1931 to 1932. The most recent expeditions were conducted by the [[Iraqi Department of Antiquities]] under [[T. Madhloom]] from 1965 to 1968. Many of Sennacherib's reliefs are today exhibited at the Vorderasiatisches Museum, the British Museum, the [[Iraq Museum]] in Baghdad, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Elayi|2018|p=6}}\n\n== Titles ==\n{{See also|Akkadian royal titulary}}The following titulature is used by Sennacherib in early accounts of his 703 BC Babylonian campaign:\n\n{{quote|quote=Sennacherib, great king, mighty king, king of Assyria, king without rival, righteous shepherd, favorite of the great gods, prayerful shepherd, who fears the great gods, protector of righteousness, lover of justice, who lends support, who comes to the aid of the cripple and aims to do good deeds, perfect hero, mighty man, first among all kings, neckstock that bends the insubmissive, who strikes the enemy like a thunderbolt, Ashur, the great mountain, has bestowed upon me an unrivalled kingship and has made my weapons mightier than the weapons of all other rulers sitting on daises.{{Sfn|Frahm|2003|p=141}}|author=|title=|source=}}This variant of the titulature is used in an inscription from the Southwest Palace at Nineveh written after Sennacherib's 700 BC Babylonian campaign:{{quote|quote=Sennacherib, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world); favorite of the great gods; the wise and crafty one; strong hero, first among all princes; the flame that consumes the insubmissive, who strikes the wicked with the thunderbolt.

The data is sourced from the [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) and expanded with data from the [[JPL SBDB]] (mean-diameter), Johnston's archive (sub-classification) and others ''(see detailed field descriptions below)''. For an overview of all existing partial lists, ''see {{section link||Main index}}''.\n\nThe information given for a minor planet includes a [[Minor planet designation|permanent]] and [[Provisional designation in astronomy#Minor planets|provisional]] designation ''({{section link||Designation}})'', a citation that links to the [[meanings of minor planet names]] (only if named), the discovery date, location, and credited [[LOMPD|discoverer]]s ''({{section link||Discovery}} and {{section link||Discoverers}})'', a category with a more refined classification than the principal grouping represented by the background color ''({{section link||Category}})'', a mean-diameter, sourced from JPL's [[JPL SBDB|SBDB]] or otherwise calculated estimates in italics ''({{section link||Diameter}})'', and a reference (Ref) to the corresponding pages at MPC and JPL SBDB.\n\nThe MPC may credit one or several astronomers, a [[Astronomical survey|survey]] or similar program, or even the [[IAU codes|observatory site]] with the discovery. In the first column of the table, an existing stand-alone article is linked in boldface, while (self-)redirects are never linked. Discoverers, discovery site and category are only linked if they differ from the preceding catalog entry.\n\n=== Example ===\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 1em;\" style=\"font-size: 0.9em; max-width: 950px;\">\n{{List of minor planets/header2|top-link=no}}\n|-bgcolor=#d6d6d6\n| 189001 || 4889 P-L || \u2014 || 24 September 1960 || [[Palomar Observatory|Palomar]] || [[Palomar\u2013Leiden survey|PLS]] || \u2014 || align=right | 3.4&nbsp;km || {{M+J|189001}}\n|-id=002 bgcolor=#fefefe\n| 189002 || 6760 P-L || \u2014 || 24 September 1960 || Palomar || PLS || [[FIN tbl#405|NYS]] || align=right data-sort-value=\"0.96\" | ''960&nbsp;m'' || {{M+J|189002}}\n|-id=003 bgcolor=#d6d6d6\n| 189003 || 3009 T-3 || \u2014 || 16 October 1977 || Palomar || PLS || \u2014 || align=right | ''5.1&nbsp;km'' || {{M+J|189003}}\n|-id=004 bgcolor=#C2FFFF\n| 189004 Capys || 3184 T-3 || {{MoMP|189004|Capys}} || 16 October 1977 || Palomar || PLS || [[Trojan camp|L5]] || align=right | ''12&nbsp;km'' || {{M+J|189004}}\n|-id=005 bgcolor=#E9E9E9\n| 189005 || 5176 T-3 || \u2014 || 16 October 1977 || Palomar || PLS || \u2014 || align=right | ''3.5&nbsp;km'' || {{M+J|189005}}\n|}</div>\n\nThe example above shows five catalog entries from [[List of minor planets: 189001\u2013190000|one of the partial lists]]. All five asteroids were discovered at [[Palomar Observatory]] by the [[Palomar\u2013Leiden survey]] (PLS). The MPC directly credits the survey's principle investigators, that is, the astronomers [[Cornelis van Houten]], [[Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld]] and [[Tom Gehrels]]. (This is the only instance where the list of minor planets diverges from the ''Discovery Circumstances'' in the official MPC list.<ref name=\"MPC-Discovery-Circumstances-Example\" />) [[189004&nbsp;Capys]], discovered on 16 October 1977, is the only named minor planet. Its background color indicates that it is a [[Jupiter trojan]] (from the [[Trojan camp]] at Jupiter's {{L5}}), estimated to be approximately 12 kilometers in diameter. All other objects are smaller asteroids from the inner (white), central (light-grey) and outer regions (dark grey) of the [[asteroid belt]]. The provisional designation for all objects is an uncommon [[survey designation]].\n\n=== Designation ===\n\nAfter discovery, minor planets generally receive a [[provisional designation]], e.g. {{mp|1989 AC}}, then a leading sequential number in parenthesis, e.g. {{mp|(4179) 1989 AC}}, turning it into a permanent designation (numbered minor planet). Optionally, a name can be given, replacing the provisional part of the designation, e.g. {{mp|[[4179 Toutatis]]}}. (On Wikipedia, named minor planets also drop their parenthesis.)\n\nIn modern times, a minor planet receives a sequential number only after it has been observed several times over at least 4 oppositions.{{refn|1=An opposition is the time when a body is at its furthest apparent point from the Sun, and in this case is defined as the time when an asteroid is far enough from the Sun to be observed from the Earth. In most cases, this is about 4 to 6 months a year. Some notable minor planets are exceptions to this rule, such as {{mp|[[367943 Duende]]}}.}} Minor planets whose orbits are not (yet) precisely known are known by their provisional designation. This rule was not necessarily followed in earlier times, and some bodies received a number but subsequently became [[lost minor planet]]s. The 2000 recovery of {{mp|[[719 Albert]]}}, which had been lost for nearly 89 years, eliminated the last numbered lost asteroid.<ref name=\"719 Albert\" /> Only after a number is assigned is the minor planet eligible to receive a name. Usually the discoverer has up to 10 years to pick a name; many minor planets now remain unnamed. Especially towards the end of the twentieth century, large-scale automated asteroid discovery programs such as [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] have increased the pace of discoveries so much that the vast majority of minor planets will most likely never receive names.\n\nFor these reasons, the sequence of numbers only approximately matches the timeline of discovery. In extreme cases, such as lost minor planets, there may be a considerable mismatch: for instance the high-numbered {{mp|[[69230 Hermes]]}} was originally discovered in 1937, but it was a lost until 2003. Only after it was rediscovered could its orbit be established and a number assigned.\n\n<!-- pie chart Top 10 Discoverers -->\n{{Image frame\n |width = 252\n |align = right\n |pos = bottom\n |content =<div style=\"background-color: #F9F9F9; font-size: 0.85em; text-align: left; padding: 8px 0; margin: 0;\">\n {{#invoke:Chart\n  |pie chart\n  |radius = 125\n  |slices = \n    ( 148677 : [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] : #3D81FF : [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]])\n    ( 139773 : [[Spacewatch]] : #FF2600 : [[Spacewatch]] )\n    ( 57317 : [[Mount Lemmon Survey|Mt.

Many of them have discovered only a few minor planets or even just co-discovered a single one. Moreover, a discoverer does not need to be a human being. There are about 300 programs, surveys and observatories [[List of minor planet discoverers#Discovering dedicated institutions|credited as discoverers]]. Among these, a small group of U.S. programs and surveys actually account for most of all discoveries made so far ''(see pie chart)''. As the total of numbered minor planets is growing by the tens of thousands every year, all statistical figures are constantly changing. In contrast to the Top 10 discoverers displayed in this articles, the MPC summarizes the total of discoveries somewhat differently, that is by a distinct group of discoverers. For example, bodies discovered in the [[Palomar\u2013Leiden Survey]] are directly credited to the program's principal investigators.\n\n=== Discovery site ===\n{{See also|List of observatory codes|List of minor planet discoverers#Discovering dedicated institutions}}\n\nObservatories, telescopes and [[Astronomical survey|surveys]] that report [[Astrometry|astrometric observations]] of [[small Solar System bodies]] to the MPC receive a numeric or alphanumeric code such as [[IAU code#675|675]] for the Palomar Observatory, or [[IAU code#I41|I41]] for the [[Palomar Transient Factory]], a dedicated survey that was conducted at [[Palomar Observatory]] during 2009\u20132012. On numbering, such an observatory may directly be credited by the MPC as discoverer.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Orbital groups}} Category ===\n{{Further|List of minor-planet groups|Asteroid family#All families}}\n\nIn this catalog, minor planets are classified into one of 8 principal orbital groups and highlighted with a distinct color. These are:\n\n{{Minor planet color code legend}}\n\nThe vast majority of minor planets are evenly distributed between the inner-, central and outer parts of the [[asteroid belt]], which are separated by the two [[Kirkwood gap]]s at 2.5 and 2.82&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]]. Nearly 97.5% of all minor planets are main-belt asteroids (MBA), while [[Jupiter trojans]], [[Mars-crossing asteroid|Mars-crossing]] and [[near-Earth asteroids]] each account for 1% or less of the overall population. Only a small number of [[distant minor planet]]s, that is the [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]] and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, have been numbered so far.

criteria to outer MBAs ([[perihelion|q]] &gt; 1.666&nbsp;AU).<br />The values for an object's perihelion and [[aphelion]] need to be derived from the semi-major axis and the [[orbital

unclassified based on the defined orbital criteria. At least five of these bodies have a semi-major axis too large to be an outer main-belt asteroid, and an orbit too eccentric to be classified as a Jupiter trojan (JPL classifies these bodies simply as \"asteroids\", while the MPC, which never distinguishes between inner, outer and middle MBAs, classifies them as \"main-belt asteroids\"). Other unclassified minor planets include Mars-crossers (as per MPC) with a semi-major axis of that of an outer-MBA (as per JPL).}}\n\n{{efn|name=NEO-subgroups|Split-up of NEOs into Amor, Aten, Apollo and Atira asteroid is based on the orbital criteria given in adjunct table.

The catalog consists of hundreds of pages, each containing 1000 minor planets.

The vast majority (97%) of minor planets are asteroids from the [[asteroid belt]] (the catalog uses a color code to indicate a body's [[#Orbital groups|dynamical classification]]). There are more than a thousand different [[List of minor planet discoverers|minor-planet discoverers]] observing from a growing [[List of observatory codes|list of registered observatories]]. In terms of numbers, the most prolific discoverers are [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]], [[Spacewatch]], [[Mount Lemmon Survey|MLS]], [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking|NEAT]] and [[Catalina Sky Survey|CSS]].

The data is sourced from the [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) and expanded with data from the [[JPL SBDB]] (mean-diameter), Johnston's archive (sub-classification) and others ''(see detailed field descriptions below)''. For an overview of all existing partial lists, ''see {{section link||Main index}}''.\n\nThe information given for a minor planet includes a [[Minor planet designation|permanent]] and [[Provisional designation in astronomy#Minor planets|provisional]] designation ''({{section link||Designation}})'', a citation that links to the [[meanings of minor planet names]] (only if named), the discovery date, location, and credited [[LOMPD|discoverer]]s ''({{section link||Discovery}} and {{section link||Discoverers}})'', a category with a more refined classification than the principal grouping represented by the background color ''({{section link||Category}})'', a mean-diameter, sourced from JPL's [[JPL SBDB|SBDB]] or otherwise calculated estimates in italics ''({{section link||Diameter}})'', and a reference (Ref) to the corresponding pages at MPC and JPL SBDB. \n\nThe MPC may credit one or several astronomers, a [[Astronomical survey|survey]] or similar program, or even the [[IAU codes|observatory site]] with the discovery. In the first column of the table, an existing stand-alone article is linked in boldface, while (self-)redirects are never linked. Discoverers, discovery site and category are only linked if they differ from the preceding catalog entry.\n\n=== Example ===\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 1em;\" style=\"font-size: 0.9em; max-width: 950px;\">\n{{List of minor planets/header2|top-link=no}}\n|-bgcolor=#d6d6d6\n| 189001 || 4889 P-L || \u2014 || September 24, 1960 || [[Palomar Observatory|Palomar]] || [[Palomar\u2013Leiden survey|PLS]] || \u2014 || align=right | 3.4 km || {{M+J|189001}}\n|-id=002 bgcolor=#fefefe\n| 189002 || 6760 P-L || \u2014 || September 24, 1960 || Palomar || PLS || [[FIN tbl#405|NYS]] || align=right data-sort-value=\"0.96\" | ''960 m'' || {{M+J|189002}}\n|-id=003 bgcolor=#d6d6d6\n| 189003 || 3009 T-3 || \u2014 || October 16, 1977 || Palomar || PLS || \u2014 || align=right | ''5.1 km'' || {{M+J|189003}}\n|-id=004 bgcolor=#C2FFFF\n| 189004 Capys || 3184 T-3 || {{MoMP|189004|Capys}} || October 16, 1977 || Palomar || PLS || [[Trojan camp|L5]] || align=right | ''12 km'' || {{M+J|189004}}\n|-id=005 bgcolor=#E9E9E9\n| 189005 || 5176 T-3 || \u2014 || October 16, 1977 || Palomar || PLS || \u2014 || align=right | ''3.5 km'' || {{M+J|189005}}\n|}</div>\n\nThe example above shows five catalog entries from [[List of minor planets: 189001\u2013190000|one of the partial lists]]. All five asteroids were discovered at [[Palomar Observatory]] by the [[Palomar\u2013Leiden survey]] (PLS). The MPC directly credits the survey's principle investigators, that is, the astronomers [[Cornelis van Houten]], [[Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld]] and [[Tom Gehrels]]. (This is the only instance where the list of minor planets diverges from the ''Discovery Circumstances'' in the official MPC list.<ref name=\"MPC-Discovery-Circumstances-Example\" />) [[189004&nbsp;Capys]], discovered on 16 October 1977, is the only named minor planet. Its background color indicates that it is a [[Jupiter trojan]] (from the [[Trojan camp]] at Jupiter's {{L5}}), estimated to be approximately 12 kilometers in diameter. All other objects are smaller asteroids from the inner (white), central (light-grey) and outer regions (dark grey) of the [[asteroid belt]]. The provisional designation for all objects is an uncommon [[survey designation]].\n\n=== Designation ===\n\nAfter discovery, minor planets generally receive a [[provisional designation]], e.g. {{mp|1989 AC}}, then a leading sequential number in parenthesis, e.g. {{mp|(4179) 1989 AC}}, turning it into a permanent designation (numbered minor planet). Optionally, a name can be given, replacing the provisional part of the designation, e.g. {{mp|[[4179 Toutatis]]}}. (On Wikipedia, named minor planets also drop their parenthesis.)\n\nIn modern times, a minor planet receives a sequential number only after it has been observed several times over at least 4 oppositions.{{refn|1=An opposition is the time when a body is at its furthest apparent point from the Sun, and in this case is defined as the time when an asteroid is far enough from the Sun to be observed from the Earth. In most cases, this is about 4 to 6 months a year. Some notable minor planets are exceptions to this rule, such as {{mp|[[367943 Duende]]}}.}} Minor planets whose orbits are not (yet) precisely known are known by their provisional designation. This rule was not necessarily followed in earlier times, and some bodies received a number but subsequently became [[lost minor planet]]s. The 2000 recovery of {{mp|[[719 Albert]]}}, which had been lost for nearly 89 years, eliminated the last numbered lost asteroid.<ref name=\"719 Albert\" /> Only after a number is assigned is the minor planet eligible to receive a name. Usually the discoverer has up to 10 years to pick a name; many minor planets now remain unnamed. Especially towards the end of the twentieth century, large-scale automated asteroid discovery programs such as [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] have increased the pace of discoveries so much that the vast majority of minor planets will most likely never receive names.\n\nFor these reasons, the sequence of numbers only approximately matches the timeline of discovery. In extreme cases, such as lost minor planets, there may be a considerable mismatch: for instance the high-numbered {{mp|[[69230 Hermes]]}} was originally discovered in 1937, but it was a lost until 2003. Only after it was rediscovered could its orbit be established and a number assigned.\n\n<!-- pie chart Top 10 Discoverers -->\n{{Image frame\n |width = 252\n |align = right\n |pos = bottom\n |content =<div style=\"background-color: #F9F9F9; font-size: 0.85em; text-align: left; padding: 8px 0; margin: 0;\">\n {{#invoke:Chart\n  |pie chart\n  |radius = 125\n  |slices = \n    ( 148677 : [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] : #3D81FF : [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]])\n    ( 139773 : [[Spacewatch]] : #FF2600 : [[Spacewatch]] )\n    ( 57317 : [[Mount Lemmon Survey|Mt.

Many of them have discovered only a few minor planets or even just co-discovered a single one. Moreover, a discoverer does not need to be a human being. There are about 300 programs, surveys and observatories [[List of minor planet discoverers#Discovering dedicated institutions|credited as discoverers]]. Among these, a small group of U.S. programs and surveys actually account for most of all discoveries made so far ''(see pie chart)''. As the total of numbered minor planets is growing by the tens of thousands every year, all statistical figures are constantly changing. In contrast to the Top 10 discoverers displayed in this articles, the MPC summarizes the total of discoveries somewhat differently, that is by a distinct group of discoverers. For example, bodies discovered in the [[Palomar\u2013Leiden Survey]] are directly credited to the program's principal investigators.\n\n=== Discovery site ===\n{{See also|List of observatory codes|List of minor planet discoverers#Discovering dedicated institutions}}\n\nObservatories, telescopes and [[Astronomical survey|surveys]] that report [[Astrometry|astrometric observations]] of [[small Solar System bodies]] to the MPC receive a numeric or alphanumeric code such as [[IAU code#675|675]] for the Palomar Observatory, or [[IAU code#I41|I41]] for the [[Palomar Transient Factory]], a dedicated survey that was conducted at [[Palomar Observatory]] during 2009\u20132012. On numbering, such an observatory may directly be credited by the MPC as discoverer.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Orbital groups}} Category ===\n{{Further|List of minor-planet groups|Asteroid family#All families}}\n\nIn this catalog, minor planets are classified into one of 8 principal orbital groups and highlighted with a distinct color. These are:\n\n{{Minor planet color code legend}}\n\nThe vast majority of minor planets are evenly distributed between the inner-, central and outer parts of the [[asteroid belt]], which are separated by the two [[Kirkwood gap]]s at 2.5 and 2.82&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]]. Nearly 97.5% of all minor planets are main-belt asteroids (MBA), while [[Jupiter trojans]], [[Mars-crossing asteroid|Mars-crossing]] and [[near-Earth asteroids]] each account for 1% or less of the overall population. Only a small number of [[distant minor planet]]s, that is the [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]] and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, have been numbered so far.

The newspaper also alleged that he did not obtain three eye witness reports which is a usual requirement for the medal. The citation stated that the medal was for gallantry in the operation to capture Jaffna. Daluwatte later stated that he had not been in combat at Jaffna but saw action at Neerveli, though none of the commanders spoken to by the newspaper could verify this.<ref name=\"thesundayleader\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/01/16/cardboard-hero-new-chairman-of-gem-and-jewellery-authority/|title=Cardboard Hero New Chairman of Gem And Jewellery Authority &#124; ''The Sunday Leader''|date=16 January 2011|publisher=Thesundayleader.lk|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*List of [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)]]\n*[[List of Sri Lankan generals]]\n*[[List of Sri Lankan non-career diplomats|Sri Lankan non-career diplomats]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120830175533/http://www.army.lk/pastcommanders.php Sri Lanka Army Official Webpage]\n*[http://www.kdu.ac.lk/index.php?id=46 KDE website]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-mil}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[G.
