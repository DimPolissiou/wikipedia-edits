For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\n<!--Popper was profoundly impressed by the differences between the allegedly \u2018scientific\u2019 theories of Freud and Adler and the revolution effected by Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity in physics in the first two decades of this century. The main difference between them, as Popper saw it, was that while Einstein\u2019s theory was highly \u2018risky\u2019, in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were, in the light of the then dominant Newtonian physics, highly improbable (e.g., that light is deflected towards solid bodies\u2014confirmed by Eddington\u2019s experiments in 1919), and which would, if they turned out to be false, falsify the whole theory, nothing could, even in principle, falsify psychoanalytic theories. These latter, Popper came to feel, have more in common with primitive myths than with genuine science. That is to say, he saw that what is apparently the chief source of strength of psychoanalysis, and the principal basis on which its claim to scientific status is grounded, viz. its capability to accommodate, and explain, every possible form of human behaviour, is in fact a critical weakness, for it entails that it is not, and could not be, genuinely predictive. Psychoanalytic theories by their nature are insufficiently precise to have negative implications, and so are immunised from experiential falsification.-->\nGiven an empirical basis, the criterion of demarcation draws a sharp line between those theories that are scientific, and those that are un-scientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if, for no other reason, than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.\n\nThe demarcation criterion excludes theories that we cannot declare scientific, but it does not say which scientific theories we must keep. For Popper, no methodology rigorously describes the choices made by scientists and he never tried to prescribe such a methodology: he always insisted that the methodology can hardly made rigorous.  In particular, a scientific theory that is  falsified remains scientific and can still be used in science.  This view was in contradistinction to the claimed rigor of the inductive methodology of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]]. \n\n===Logical positivism and its inadequate demarcation criterion===\nIn the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific.\nThis was an essential feature of the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n===Demarcation and growth of knowledge===\nIn contradistinction with the verificationists, Popper never meant that science grows by applying fixed logical rules to scientific statements or theories.  In Popper's view, unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics, which have not themselves emerged from fixed logical rules only, play a role in the growth of science. He wrote that important ''metaphysical research programmes'' have influenced the development of physics since the days of Pythagoras and Heraclitus.{{sfn|Popper|1982|p=162}}  Thornton explains{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}} that science, like virtually every other human, and indeed organic, activity, Popper believes, consists largely of problem-solving. Science, in Popper's view, starts with problems rather than with observations.  Problems emerge from internal conflicts in the theory, between the theory and the metaphysical program or between the theory and observations.<ref name=\"problemsemergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In the latter case, these observations do not come first. Thornton writes that, for Popper, \"it is in the context of grappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the first instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the extent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to a given problem.\"\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, \"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.\"{{sfn|Einstein|2010}}\n\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|l2=Scientific method and mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|l3=Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's_two_senses_of_number_statements|l4=Popper's \"two senses\" theory}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Black swan theory}}\n* {{annotated link|Contingency (philosophy)|Contingency}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical rationalism}}\n* {{annotated link|Defeasible reasoning}}\n* {{annotated link|Duhem\u2013Quine thesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Experimentum crucis|''Experimentum crucis''}}\n* {{annotated link|Explanatory power}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallibilism}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallacy}} ([[informal logic]] and [[rhetoric]])\n* {{annotated link|Raven paradox}}, or Hempel's paradox\n* {{annotated link|Hitchens's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Hypothetico-deductive model}}\n* {{annotated link|Inquiry}}\n* {{annotated link|Metaphysical solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Methodological solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Mike Alder|Newton's Flaming Laser Sword}}\n* {{annotated link|Occam's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of mathematics}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of science}}\n* {{annotated link|Pragmatic maxim}}\n* {{annotated link|Precambrian rabbit}}\n* {{annotated link|Predictive power}}\n* {{annotated link|Reproducibility}}\n* {{annotated link|Russell's teapot}}\n* {{annotated link|Superseded scientific theories}}\n* {{annotated link|Tautology (logic)|Tautology}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory-ladenness}}\n* {{annotated link|Trial and error}}\n{{div col end}}\n{{Wiktionary pipe | falsifiable | falsifiability}}\n{{clear}}\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist| group=upper-alpha| refs=\n\n<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\">The fallacy affirming the consequent is: p &#10230; q & q; therefore p.

Popper was concerned that Lakatos meant that Newton theory could be put in the same category as Freud theory and wrote a response of 5 pages in {{harvnb|Popper|1974|pp=1004-1009}} to clarify this issue.

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==Demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\n<!--Popper was profoundly impressed by the differences between the allegedly \u2018scientific\u2019 theories of Freud and Adler and the revolution effected by Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity in physics in the first two decades of this century. The main difference between them, as Popper saw it, was that while Einstein\u2019s theory was highly \u2018risky\u2019, in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were, in the light of the then dominant Newtonian physics, highly improbable (e.g., that light is deflected towards solid bodies\u2014confirmed by Eddington\u2019s experiments in 1919), and which would, if they turned out to be false, falsify the whole theory, nothing could, even in principle, falsify psychoanalytic theories. These latter, Popper came to feel, have more in common with primitive myths than with genuine science. That is to say, he saw that what is apparently the chief source of strength of psychoanalysis, and the principal basis on which its claim to scientific status is grounded, viz. its capability to accommodate, and explain, every possible form of human behaviour, is in fact a critical weakness, for it entails that it is not, and could not be, genuinely predictive. Psychoanalytic theories by their nature are insufficiently precise to have negative implications, and so are immunised from experiential falsification.-->\nGiven an empirical basis, the criterion of demarcation draws a sharp line between those theories that are scientific, and those that are un-scientific.  It is useful to know if a statement or theory is falsifiable, if, for no other reason, than that it provides us with an understanding of the ways in which one might assess the theory. One might at the least be saved from attempting to falsify a non-falsifiable theory. Popper claimed that, if a theory is falsifiable, then it is scientific.\n\nThe demarcation criterion excludes theories that we cannot declare scientific, but it does not say which scientific theories we must keep. For Popper, no methodology rigorously describes the choices made by scientists and he never tried to prescribe such a methodology: he always insisted that the methodology can hardly made rigorous.  In particular, a scientific theory that is  falsified remains scientific and can still be used in science.  This view was in contradistinction to the claimed rigor of the inductive methodology of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]]. \n\n===Logical positivism and its inadequate demarcation criterion===\nIn the [[philosophy of science]], verificationism holds that a statement must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific.\nThis was an essential feature of the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n===Demarcation and growth of knowledge===\nIn contradistinction with the verificationists, Popper never meant that science grows by applying fixed logical rules to scientific statements or theories.  In Popper's view, unfalsifiable systems such as logic, mathematics and metaphysics, which have not themselves emerged from fixed logical rules only, play a role in the growth of science. He wrote that important ''metaphysical research programmes'' have influenced the development of physics since the days of Pythagoras and Heraclitus.{{sfn|Popper|1982|p=162}}  Thornton explains{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 3}} that science, like virtually every other human, and indeed organic, activity, Popper believes, consists largely of problem-solving. Science, in Popper's view, starts with problems rather than with observations.  Problems emerge from internal conflicts in the theory, between the theory and the metaphysical program or between the theory and observations.<ref name=\"problemsemergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In the latter case, these observations do not come first. Thornton writes that, for Popper, \"it is in the context of grappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the first instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the extent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to a given problem.\"\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, \"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.\"{{sfn|Einstein|2010}}\n\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|l2=Scientific method and mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|l3=Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's_two_senses_of_number_statements|l4=Popper's \"two senses\" theory}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Black swan theory}}\n* {{annotated link|Contingency (philosophy)|Contingency}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical rationalism}}\n* {{annotated link|Defeasible reasoning}}\n* {{annotated link|Duhem\u2013Quine thesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Experimentum crucis|''Experimentum crucis''}}\n* {{annotated link|Explanatory power}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallibilism}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallacy}} ([[informal logic]] and [[rhetoric]])\n* {{annotated link|Raven paradox}}, or Hempel's paradox\n* {{annotated link|Hitchens's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Hypothetico-deductive model}}\n* {{annotated link|Inquiry}}\n* {{annotated link|Metaphysical solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Methodological solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Mike Alder|Newton's Flaming Laser Sword}}\n* {{annotated link|Occam's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of mathematics}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of science}}\n* {{annotated link|Pragmatic maxim}}\n* {{annotated link|Precambrian rabbit}}\n* {{annotated link|Predictive power}}\n* {{annotated link|Reproducibility}}\n* {{annotated link|Russell's teapot}}\n* {{annotated link|Superseded scientific theories}}\n* {{annotated link|Tautology (logic)|Tautology}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory-ladenness}}\n* {{annotated link|Trial and error}}\n{{div col end}}\n{{Wiktionary pipe | falsifiable | falsifiability}}\n{{clear}}\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist| group=upper-alpha| refs=\n\n<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\">The fallacy affirming the consequent is: p &#10230; q & q; therefore p.

Prediction by UN in 2019.]]\n'''Human migration''' is the movement of people from one place to another with the intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily at a new location (geographic region). The movement is often over long distances and from one country to another, but [[internal migration]] is also possible; indeed, this is the dominant form globally.<ref>''[https://www.iom.int/wmr/ World Migration Report 2020]''. International Organization for Migration, 2019. \"The great majority of people in the world do not migrate across borders; much larger numbers migrate within countries (an estimated 740 million internal migrants in 2009)\" (p. 19). \"In 2019, there were an estimated 272 million international migrants globally (3.5% of the world\u2019s population) ....  it is evident that the vast majority of people continue to live in the countries in which they were born\" (p. 21).</ref> People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in [[Mass migration|large groups]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://migrationsmap.net/#/USA/arrivals |title= Migrations country wise |accessdate= 7 June 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160211025416/http://migrationsmap.net/#/USA/arrivals#/USA/arrivals |archive-date= 2016-02-11 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref> There are four major forms of migration: invasion, conquest, colonization and immigration.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=461}}</ref> \n\nA person who moves from their home due to [[forced displacement]] (such as a natural disaster or civil disturbance) may be described as a displaced person or, if remaining in the home country, an [[internally displaced person]]. A person who is seeking refuge in another country can, if the reason for leaving the home country is political, religious, or another form of persecution, make a formal application to that country where refuge is sought and is then usually described as an [[asylum seeker]]. If this application is successful this person's legal status becomes that of a [[refugee]].\n\nIn contemporary times, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State.<ref>For example, a permanent population and a defined territory, as per article 1 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and\nDuties of States.</ref> Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas.\n\n==Definitions==\n\nThe distinction between involuntary (fleeing political conflict or natural disaster) and voluntary migration (economic or [[labour migration|labor migration]]) is difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated.

Sociocultural contributions occur in the following areas of societies: food/cuisine, sport, music, art/culture, ideas and beliefs; civic-political contributions relate to participation in civic duties in the context of accepted authority of the State.<ref>McAuliffe, Kitimbo & Khadria, 2019, 'Reflections on migrations' contributions in an era of increasing disruption and disinformation', World Migration Report 2020, IOM: Geneva.</ref>\n\n==Voluntary migration==\n\nMigration is usually divided into two categories: '''voluntary migration''' and '''forced migration'''. \n\nVoluntary migration is based on the initiative and the free will of the person and is influenced by a combination of factors: economic, political and social: either in the migrants` country of origin (determinant factors or \"push factors\") or in the country of destination (attraction factors or \"pull factors\"). \n\n\"Push-pull factors\" are the reasons that push or attract people to a particular place. \"Push\" factors are the negative aspects of the country of origin, often decisive in people`s choice to emigrate and the \"pull\" factors are the positive aspects of a different country that encourages people to emigrate in search of a better life. Although the push-pull factors are apparently diametrically opposed, both are sides of the same coin, being equally important. Although specific to forced migration, any other harmful factor can be considered a \"push factor\" or determinant / trigger factor, such examples being: poor quality of life, lack of jobs, excessive pollution, hunger, drought or natural disasters. Such conditions represent decisive reasons for voluntary migration, the population preferring to migrate in order to prevent financially unfavorable situations or even emotional and physical suffering. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tataru|first=Georgiana|date=2020-01-14|title=Migration \u2013 an Overview on Terminology, Causes and Effects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338590488_Migration_-_an_Overview_on_Terminology_Causes_and_Effects|journal=Logos Universality Mentality Education Novelty: Law|volume=7|pages=10\u201329|doi=10.18662/lumenlaw/24}}</ref>\u00a0\n\n==Forced migration==\n\nThere exist contested definitions of \"forced migration\".

The long-term trend shows a gradual increase in academic publishing on migration, which is likely to be related to both the general expansion of academic literature production, and the increased prominence of migration research.<ref>IOM. 'Chapter 4: Migration research and analysis: Growth, reach and recent contributions.' World Migration Report 2020. p.127. https://www.iom.int/wmr/2020/chapter/04</ref>\n\n===Neoclassical economic theory===\n{{main|Neoclassical economics}}\n\nThis theory of migration states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\" />\n\n===Dual labor market theory===\n\nDual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labor, and the secondary market, which is very labor-intensive requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===New economics of labor migration===\n\nThis theory states that migration flows and patterns can't be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/> Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers\u2019 ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf |journal=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]] |title=Understanding the Long-Run Decline in Interstate Migration |date=April 2012 |access-date=18 May 2019 |first=Greg |last=Kaplan |first2=Sam |last2=Schulhofer-Wohl |pages=58}}</ref> Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labor reallocation.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf |journal=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]] |title=The Role of Housing in Labour Reallocation |date=29 November 2010 |access-date=18 May 2019 |first=Morris |last=Davis |first2=Jonas |last2=Fisher |first3=Marcelo |last3=Veracierto |pages=50}}</ref>\n\n===Relative deprivation theory===\n{{main|Relative deprivation}}\nRelative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===World systems theory===\n\n[[World-systems theory]] looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===Osmosis: the unifying theory of human migration===\n\nOld migration theories are generally embedded in geography, sociology or economics. They explain migration in specific periods and spaces. In fact, Osmosis theory explains the whole phenomenon of human migration. Based on the [[history of human migration]], Djelti (2017a)<ref>Djelti S, \"The Evolution of the Human Migration Determinants\" draft paper pr\u00e9sented in the international conference on \u201cCrossing Boundaries: Youth, Migration, and Development\u201d, At Alakhawayn university in Ifran, Morocco \u2013 March 2\u20134, 2017 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427737_The_Evolution_of_the_Human_Migration_Determinants_1_Draft_paper</ref> studies the evolution of its natural determinants. According to him, human migration is divided into two main types: the simple migration and the complicated one. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. For the complicated migration, it is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants notably earning, unemployment, networks and migration policies. Osmosis theory (Djelti, 2017b)<ref>Djelti S, \"Osmosis: the Unifying Theory of Human Migration\" Revue Alg\u00e9rienne d\u2019Economie et du Management Vol. 08, N\u00b0: 02(2017) http://www.asjp.cerist.dz/raem{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427688_Osmosis_the_unifying_theory_of_human_migration</ref> explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of [[osmosis]]. In this respect, the countries are represented by [[animal cells]], the borders by the [[semipermeable membranes]] and the humans by [[ions]] of water. As to osmosis phenomenon, according to the theory, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. In order to measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the [[second principle of thermodynamics]] used to measure the [[osmotic pressure]].\n\n==Sociological and political science theories==\n\n===Sociology===\n{{main|Sociology of immigration}}A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a [[Sociology| sociological]] perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects, and is affected by, matters of [[Race (human categorization) |race]] and [[Ethnic group| ethnicity]], as well as [[social structure]]. They have produced three main sociological perspectives: \n\n* [[symbolic interactionism]], which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level\n* [[social conflict theory]], which examines migration through the prism of competition for [[Power (social and political) | power]] and [[resource]]s\n* [[structural functionalism]] (based on the ideas of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]), which examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of [[Anomie |despair and aimlessness]] and the consolidation of [[social network]]s\n\nMore recently,{{when?|date=January 2020}} as attention has shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how [[transnationalism]] allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins.<ref>{{Cite book|url=

The laws are as follows:\n\n# ''every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.''\n# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance.\n# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.\n# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.\n# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.\n# ''most migrants are adults.\n# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.\n# ''migration stage by stage ([[step migration]]).''\n# ''urban rural difference.\n# ''migration and technology.\n# ''economic condition.\n\n===Lee===\nLee's laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors.

People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]], or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term \"migratory domino effect\" to describe this process in the context of [[Sea People]] invasion.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil. ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges''. CEDEM, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, 2012</ref>\n\n===Other models===\n* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''<ref>Idyorough, 2008</ref>  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.\n* [[Zipf's law|Zipf's inverse distance law]] (1956)\n* [[Gravity model of migration]] and the [[friction of distance]]\n* [[Radiation law for human mobility]]\n* [[Buffer theory]]\n* Stouffer's [[theory of intervening opportunities]] (1940)\n* [[Zelinsky Model|Zelinsky's Mobility Transition Model]] (1971)\n* Bauder's regulation of [[labour economics|labour markets]] (2006) \"suggests that the international migration of workers is necessary for the survival of industrialised economies...[It] turns the conventional view of international migration on its head: it investigates how migration regulates labour markets, rather than labour markets shaping migration flows.\"<ref>Bauder, Harald.

And yet, somewhat paradoxically, the majority of migration governance has historically remained with individual States, their policies and regulations on migration typically made at the national level.<ref> McAuliffe, M. and A.M. Goossens. 2018. Regulating international migration in an era of increasing interconnectedness. In:Handbook of Migration and Globalisation (A. Triandafyllidou, ed.). Edward Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham/Northampton, pp. 86\u2013104. </ref> For the most part, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State.<ref>For example, a permanent population and a defined territory, as per article 1 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and\nDuties of States.</ref> Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas. The 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (Refugee Convention) are two significant examples, notable for being widely ratified. Other migration conventions have not been so broadly accepted, such as the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which still has no traditional countries of destination among its States parties. Beyond this, there have been numerous multilateral and global initiatives, dialogues and processes on migration over several decades. The [[Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration]] ([[Global Compact for Migration]]) is another milestone, as the first internationally negotiated statement of objectives for migration governance striking a balance between migrants\u2019 rights and the principle of States\u2019 sovereignty over their territory. Although it is not legally binding, the Global Compact for Migration was adopted by consensus in December 2018 at a United Nations conference in which more than 150 [[United Nations Member States]] participated and, later that same month, in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA), by a vote among the Member States of 152 to 5 (with 12 abstentions).<ref>IOM.

A person who is seeking refuge in another country can, if the reason for leaving the home country is political, religious, or another form of persecution, make a formal application to that country where refuge is sought and is then usually described as an [[asylum seeker]]. If this application is successful this person's legal status becomes that of a [[refugee]].\n\nIn contemporary times, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State.<ref>For example, a permanent population and a defined territory, as per article 1 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and\nDuties of States.</ref> Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas.\n\n==Definitions==\n\nThe distinction between involuntary (fleeing political conflict or natural disaster) and voluntary migration (economic or [[labour migration|labor migration]]) is difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated.

Sociocultural contributions occur in the following areas of societies: food/cuisine, sport, music, art/culture, ideas and beliefs; civic-political contributions relate to participation in civic duties in the context of accepted authority of the State.<ref>McAuliffe, Kitimbo & Khadria, 2019, 'Reflections on migrations' contributions in an era of increasing disruption and disinformation', World Migration Report 2020, IOM: Geneva.</ref>\n\n<br />\n==Voluntary migration==\n\nMigration is usually divided into two categories: '''voluntary migration''' and '''forced migration'''. \n\nVoluntary migration is based on the initiative and the free will of the person and is influenced by a combination of factors: economic, political and social: either in the the migrants` country of origin (determinant factors or \"push factors\") or in the country of destination (attraction factors or \"pull factors\"). \n\n\"Push-pull factors\" are the reasons that push or attract people to a particular place. \"Push\" factors are the negative aspects of the country of origin, often decisive in people`s choice to emigrate and the \"pull\" factors are the positive aspects of a different country that encourages people to emigrate in search of a better life. Although the push-pull factors are apparently diametrically opposed, both are sides of the same coin, being equally important. Although specific to forced migration, any other harmful factor can be considered a \"push factor\" or determinant / trigger factor, such examples being: poor quality of life, lack of jobs, excessive pollution, hunger, drought or natural disasters. Such conditions represent decisive reasons for voluntary migration, the population preferring to migrate in order to prevent financially unfavorable situations or even emotional and physical suffering. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tataru|first=Georgiana|date=2020-01-14|title=Migration \u2013 an Overview on Terminology, Causes and Effects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338590488_Migration_-_an_Overview_on_Terminology_Causes_and_Effects|journal=Logos Universality Mentality Education Novelty: Law|volume=7|pages=10\u201329|doi=10.18662/lumenlaw/24}}</ref>\u00a0\n\n==Forced migration==\n\nThere exist contested definitions of \"forced migration\". However, the editors of a leading scientific journal on the subject, the Forced Migration Review, offer the following definition: \nForced migration refers to the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (displaced by conflict) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects. <ref>Forced Migration Review, see https://www.fmreview.org/</ref>\n\nBy the end of 2018, there were an estimated 67.2 million forced migrants globally - 25.9 million refugees displaced from their countries, and 41.3 million internally displaced persons that had been displaced within their countries for different reasons. <ref>IOM's World Migration Report 2020, see https://publications.iom.int/books/world-migration-report-2020</ref>\n\n==Labor migration theories in the 21st century==\n\n===Overview===\n\nNumerous causes impel migrants to move to another country.

The long-term trend shows a gradual increase in academic publishing on migration, which is likely to be related to both the general expansion of academic literature production, and the increased prominence of migration research.<ref>IOM. 'Chapter 4: Migration research and analysis: Growth, reach and recent contributions.' World Migration Report 2020. p.127. https://www.iom.int/wmr/2020/chapter/04</ref>\n\n===Neoclassical economic theory===\n{{main|Neoclassical economics}}\n\nThis theory of migration states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\" />\n\n===Dual labor market theory===\n\nDual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labor, and the secondary market, which is very labor-intensive requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===New economics of labor migration===\n\nThis theory states that migration flows and patterns can't be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/> Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers\u2019 ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf |journal=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]] |title=Understanding the Long-Run Decline in Interstate Migration |date=April 2012 |access-date=18 May 2019 |first=Greg |last=Kaplan |first2=Sam |last2=Schulhofer-Wohl |pages=58}}</ref> Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labor reallocation.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf |journal=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]] |title=The Role of Housing in Labour Reallocation |date=29 November 2010 |access-date=18 May 2019 |first=Morris |last=Davis |first2=Jonas |last2=Fisher |first3=Marcelo |last3=Veracierto |pages=50}}</ref>\n\n===Relative deprivation theory===\n{{main|Relative deprivation}}\nRelative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===World systems theory===\n\n[[World-systems theory]] looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.<ref name=\"Jennissen, R 2007\"/>\n\n===Osmosis: the unifying theory of human migration===\n\nOld migration theories are generally embedded in geography, sociology or economics. They explain migration in specific periods and spaces. In fact, Osmosis theory explains the whole phenomenon of human migration. Based on the [[history of human migration]], Djelti (2017a)<ref>Djelti S, \"The Evolution of the Human Migration Determinants\" draft paper pr\u00e9sented in the international conference on \u201cCrossing Boundaries: Youth, Migration, and Development\u201d, At Alakhawayn university in Ifran, Morocco \u2013 March 2\u20134, 2017 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427737_The_Evolution_of_the_Human_Migration_Determinants_1_Draft_paper</ref> studies the evolution of its natural determinants. According to him, human migration is divided into two main types: the simple migration and the complicated one. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. For the complicated migration, it is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants notably earning, unemployment, networks and migration policies. Osmosis theory (Djelti, 2017b)<ref>Djelti S, \"Osmosis: the Unifying Theory of Human Migration\" Revue Alg\u00e9rienne d\u2019Economie et du Management Vol. 08, N\u00b0: 02(2017) http://www.asjp.cerist.dz/raem{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427688_Osmosis_the_unifying_theory_of_human_migration</ref> explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of [[osmosis]]. In this respect, the countries are represented by [[animal cells]], the borders by the [[semipermeable membranes]] and the humans by [[ions]] of water. As to osmosis phenomenon, according to the theory, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. In order to measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the [[second principle of thermodynamics]] used to measure the [[osmotic pressure]].\n\n==Sociological and political science theories==\n\n===Sociology===\n{{main|Sociology of immigration}}A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a [[Sociology| sociological]] perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects, and is affected by, matters of [[Race (human categorization) |race]] and [[Ethnic group| ethnicity]], as well as [[social structure]]. They have produced three main sociological perspectives: \n\n* [[symbolic interactionism]], which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level\n* [[social conflict theory]], which examines migration through the prism of competition for [[Power (social and political) | power]] and [[resource]]s\n* [[structural functionalism]] (based on the ideas of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]), which examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of [[Anomie |despair and aimlessness]] and the consolidation of [[social network]]s\n\nMore recently,{{when?|date=January 2020}} as attention has shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how [[transnationalism]] allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins.<ref>{{Cite book|url=

The laws are as follows:\n\n# ''every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.''\n# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance.\n# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.\n# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.\n# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.\n# ''most migrants are adults.\n# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.\n# ''migration stage by stage ([[step migration]]).''\n# ''urban rural difference.\n# ''migration and technology.\n# ''economic condition.\n\n===Lee===\nLee's laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors.

People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]], or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term \"migratory domino effect\" to describe this process in the context of [[Sea People]] invasion.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil. ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges''. CEDEM, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, 2012</ref>\n\n===Other models===\n* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''<ref>Idyorough, 2008</ref>  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.\n* [[Zipf's law|Zipf's inverse distance law]] (1956)\n* [[Gravity model of migration]] and the [[friction of distance]]\n* [[Radiation law for human mobility]]\n* [[Buffer theory]]\n* Stouffer's [[theory of intervening opportunities]] (1940)\n* [[Zelinsky Model|Zelinsky's Mobility Transition Model]] (1971)\n* Bauder's regulation of [[labour economics|labour markets]] (2006) \"suggests that the international migration of workers is necessary for the survival of industrialised economies...[It] turns the conventional view of international migration on its head: it investigates how migration regulates labour markets, rather than labour markets shaping migration flows.\"<ref>Bauder, Harald. ''Labour Movement: How Migration Regulates Labour Markets''. Oxford University Press, 1st edition, February 2006, English, 288 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-19-518088-6}}</ref>\n\n==Migration governance==\nBy their very nature, international migration and displacement are transnational issues concerning origin and destination States, as well as States through which migrants may travel (often referred to as \u201ctransit\u201d States) or in which they are hosted following displacement across national borders. And yet, somewhat paradoxically, the majority of migration governance has historically remained with individual States, their policies and regulations on migration typically made at the national level.<ref> McAuliffe, M. and A.M. Goossens. 2018. Regulating international migration in an era of increasing interconnectedness. In:Handbook of Migration and Globalisation (A. Triandafyllidou, ed.). Edward Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham/Northampton, pp. 86\u2013104. </ref> For the most part, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State.<ref>For example, a permanent population and a defined territory, as per article 1 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and\nDuties of States.</ref> Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas. The 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (Refugee Convention) are two significant examples, notable for being widely ratified. Other migration conventions have not been so broadly accepted, such as the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which still has no traditional countries of destination among its States parties. Beyond this, there have been numerous multilateral and global initiatives, dialogues and processes on migration over several decades. The [[Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration]] ([[Global Compact for Migration]]) is another milestone, as the first internationally negotiated statement of objectives for migration governance striking a balance between migrants\u2019 rights and the principle of States\u2019 sovereignty over their territory. Although it is not legally binding, the Global Compact for Migration was adopted by consensus in December 2018 at a United Nations conference in which more than 150 [[United Nations Member States]] participated and, later that same month, in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA), by a vote among the Member States of 152 to 5 (with 12 abstentions).<ref>IOM.

War broke out in April 1861 when [[Confederate States of America|secessionist]] forces attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]] shortly after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inaugurated]] as the [[President of the United States]]. The loyalists of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. They faced secessionists of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in the South, who advocated for [[states' rights]] in order to uphold slavery.\n\nOf the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861, seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|slave-holding states\"]] were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  [[Confederate States of America]] was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from [[Government in exile|native secessionists fleeing Union authority]]. These states were given full representation in the [[Confederate States Congress|Confederate Congress]] throughout the Civil War. The two remaining \"slave states\", Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to [[Ex parte Merryman|intervention]] [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|by federal troops]].\n\nThe Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union.{{Efn|Including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years.

The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights, and as the first step in a grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' votes were distributed nationally and [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]'s votes centered in [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]]. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally; thus Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]], seven slave states with [[cotton]]-based economies declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, with an average of 49 percent.<ref>[https://cwemancipation.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/slavery-and-secession-1860-census-statistics/ \"Date of Secession Related to 1860 Black Population\"], America's Civil War</ref> Of those states whose legislatures resolved for secession, the first seven voted with split majorities for unionist candidates Douglas and Bell ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with 51% and [[Louisiana]] with 55%), or with sizable minorities for those unionists ([[Alabama]] with 46%, [[Mississippi]] with 40%, [[Florida]] with 38%, [[Texas]] with 25%, and [[South Carolina]], which cast [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes without a popular vote for president).<ref>Burnham, Walter Dean.

While in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] the Union made significant permanent gains, in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], the battle was inconclusive during 1861\u20131862. Later, in September 1862, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal.<ref name=\"proclamation\" /> To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of its western armies, and seized [[New Orleans]]. The successful 1863 Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1863, [[Robert E. Lee]]'s Confederate incursion north ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Western successes led to [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the [[fall of Atlanta]] to [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|his march to the sea]]. The last significant battles raged around the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Lee's escape attempt ended with his [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|surrender at Appomattox Court House]], on April 9, 1865. While the military war was coming to an end, the political reintegration of the nation was to take another 12 years, known as the [[Reconstruction era]].\n\n[[File:Flag of the Confederate States of America (1861\u20131863).svg|thumb|Confederate flag, the \"Stars and Bars\".]]\n\nThe American Civil War was among the earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]].

The convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted the \"[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]\". It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution.

Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas.

The U.S. Navy eventually gained control of the Red, Tennessee, Cumberland, Mississippi, and Ohio rivers. In the East, the Navy supplied and moved army forces about, and occasionally shelled Confederate installations.\n\n===Modern navy evolves===\n[[File:NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Clashes on the rivers were melees of [[ironclads]], [[Cottonclad warship|cottonclads]], [[gunboats]] and rams, complicated by torpedoes and [[Fire ship|fire rafts]].]]The Civil War occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution. Many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the [[ironclad warship]]. It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match the Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=92}} Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with ram bows, creating \"ram fever\" among Union squadrons wherever they threatened. But in the face of overwhelming Union superiority and the Union's ironclad warships, they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Hampton Roads 3g01752u.jpg|240px|thumb|left| Battle between the Monitor and Merrimack.]]\n\nIn addition to ocean-going warships coming up the Mississippi, the Union Navy used timberclads, tinclads, and armored gunboats. Shipyards at Cairo, Illinois, and St. Louis built new boats or modified steamboats for action.<ref>Myron J.

The resulting three hour [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] was a draw, but it proved that ironclads were effective warships.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=345}} Not long after the battle the Confederacy was forced to scuttle the ''Virginia'' to prevent its capture, while the Union built many copies of the ''Monitor''.

The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. \"King Cotton\" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288\u201389, 296\u201398}}\n\n==== Blockade runners ====\n{{Main|Blockade runners of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:First Charleston Harbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gunline of nine Union ironclads.

There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies.\n\nMost historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy; however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.<ref>Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)</ref>\n\nSurdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Surdam |first1=David G. |year=1998 |title=The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=51 |issue=4|pages=85\u2013107}}</ref> The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it.

Surdam, ''Northern Naval Superiority and the Economics of the American Civil War'' (University of South Carolina Press, 2001).</ref>\n\nTo fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}} After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15&nbsp;million in 1871.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=225}}\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\n\nAlthough the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=546\u201357}}{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=237}} The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}}\n[[File:USS Wissahickon Crewmembers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Crewmembers of {{USS|Wissahickon|1861|6}} by the ship's {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Dahlgren gun]], circa 1863|alt=A group of twenty-six sailors posing around a rifled naval cannon]]\n[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860\u201362 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that \"King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton\", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}} When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.<ref name=\"nevins73\" />\n\nLincoln's administration failed to appeal to European public opinion. Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. The European aristocracy was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.\"<ref>Don H.

The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in Britain ({{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah}}, {{ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}}, {{ship|CSS|Tallahassee}}, {{ship|CSS|Florida}}, and some others). The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.<ref>Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)</ref>\n\nWar loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States. British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.<ref name=\"approaching\" />\n\nThe Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=261}}\n\n==Eastern theater==\n[[File:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|County]] map of Civil War battles by theater and year]]\n\n{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}The Eastern theater refers to the military operations east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the coastal fortifications and seaports of [[North Carolina]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Potomac \nMaj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}\n\n# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.\n# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.\n# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.\n# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee]]\n; Army of Northern Virginia\n\nThe primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\n\nWhen Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.\n\nLee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.<ref>Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.</ref> However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. [[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.\n\n=== Battles ===\n\n;First Bull Run\n\nIn one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas). \n[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|\"Stonewall\" got his nickname at Bull Run.]]\nThe Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\".\n\n; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign\n[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan]]\nUpon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],{{sfn|Foote|1974|p=464\u2013519}}<ref name=\"terrible\" />{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=424\u201327}}\n\nAlso in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond.

[[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=664}} However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat.\n\n==Western theater==\n{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}\nThe Western theater refers to military operations between the Appalachian Mountains and the [[Mississippi River]], including the states of [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]], as well as parts of [[Louisiana]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Tennessee and Army of the Cumberland \n[[File:Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (4228634580).jpg|thumb|160px|Ulysses S. Grant]]\nThe primary Union forces in the Western theater were the [[Army of the Tennessee]] and the [[Army of the Cumberland]], named for the two rivers, the [[Tennessee River]] and [[Cumberland River]]. After Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\n; Army of Tennessee \nThe primary Confederate force in the Western theater was the [[Army of Tennessee]]. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, when General [[Braxton Bragg]] renamed the former [[Army of Mississippi]]. While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;Fort Henry and Fort Donelson\n\nThe Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant, who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] (February 6, 1862) and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (February 11 to 16, 1862), earning him the nickname of \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant, by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] rallied nearly 4,000 Confederate troops and led them to escape across the Cumberland. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] thus fell to the Union, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.\n\n[[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned it against the Confederacy. Grant used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's \"Gibraltar of the West\" at Columbus, Kentucky. Although rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky and opened Tennessee in March 1862.\n\n[[File:ASJohnston.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Albert Sidney Johnston died at Shiloh.]]\n;Shiloh\nAt [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]] (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell.

Union Naval activities were dictated by the Anaconda Plan.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;South Carolina\nOne of the earliest battles of the war was fought at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal Sound]], south of Charleston. Much of the war along the South Carolina coast concentrated on capturing [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In attempting to capture Charleston, the Union military tried two approaches, by land over James or Morris Islands or through the harbor. However, the Confederates were able to drive back each Union attack. One of the most famous of the land attacks was the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], in which the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts Infantry]] took part. The Federals suffered a serious defeat in this battle, losing 1,500 men while the Confederates lost only 175.\n\n;Georgia\nFort Pulaski on the Georgia coast was an early target for the Union navy. Following the capture of Port Royal, an expedition was organized with engineer troops under the command of Captain [[Quincy Adams Gillmore|Quincy A. Gillmore]], forcing a Confederate surrender. The Union army occupied the fort for the rest of the war after making repair.\n\n;Louisiana\n[[File:New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220px|thumb| New Orleans captured.]]\nIn April 1862, a Union naval task force commanded by Commander [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]] attacked [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], which guarded the river approach to New Orleans from the south. While part of the fleet bombarded the forts, other vessels forced a break in the obstructions in the river and enabled the rest of the fleet to steam upriver to the city. A Union army force commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] landed near the forts and forced their surrender. Butler's controversial command of New Orleans earned him the nickname \"Beast\".\n\nThe following year, the Union [[Army of the Gulf]] commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks laid [[Siege of Port Hudson|siege to Port Hudson]] for nearly eight weeks, the longest siege in US military history. The Confederates attempted to defend with the [[Bayou Teche Campaign]], but surrendered after Vicksburg.

Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war.<ref name=\"history\" /> This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said \"would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion.

The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.\n\nAn attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724\u201342}}\n[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]\n\n=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===\nGrant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war, and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen.

This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops.

The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich Southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second-class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=851}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including [[James M.

He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.<ref name=\"confederacy\" />\n\nConfederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.<ref name=\"confederacy\" /> Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could continue to fight the war only as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=771\u201372}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:2em;\"\n|+ Comparison of Union and Confederacy, 1860\u20131864<ref name=\"census74\" />\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Union\n! scope=\"col\" | Confederacy\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|'''Population'''\n|1860\n| 22,100,000 (71%)\n| 9,100,000 (29%)\n|-\n|1864\n| 28,800,000 (90%){{refn|name=UnionPop|group=lower-alpha|\"Union population 1864\" aggregates 1860 population, average annual immigration 1855\u20131864, and population governed formerly by CSA per Kenneth Martis source.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.<ref name=\"WarLeader\" /> The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=382\u201388}}\n\nHistorian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history.<ref>Don H.

Fox complained, however, that records were incomplete, especially during the last year of the war, and that battlefield reports likely under-counted deaths (many men counted as wounded in battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds). Thomas L. Livermore, using Fox's data, put the number of Confederate non-combat deaths at 166,000, using the official estimate of Union deaths from disease and accidents and a comparison of Union and Confederate enlistment records, for a total of 260,000 deaths.<ref name=\"civilwarhome.com\" /> However, this excludes the 30,000 deaths of Confederate troops in prisons, which would raise the minimum number of deaths to 290,000.\n\nThe United States National Park Service uses the following figures in its official tally of war losses:<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/>\n\n'''Union: 853,838'''\n* 110,100 killed in action\n* 224,580 disease deaths\n* 275,154 wounded in action\n* 211,411 captured (including 30,192 who died as POWs)\n\n'''Confederate: 914,660'''\n* 94,000 killed in action\n* 164,000 disease deaths\n* 194,026 wounded in action\n* 462,634 captured (including 31,000 who died as POWs)\n\n[[File:Burial of the dead on the Antietam battlefield army.mil-2008-09-10-145638.jpg|thumb|Burying Union dead on the [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] battlefield, 1862]]\n\nWhile the figures of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy remained commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. [[Francis Amasa Walker]], superintendent of the 1870 census, used census and surgeon general data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.<ref name=\"recounting\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307\u201348}} This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.\n\nDeaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, or exposure, and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1&nbsp;million.<ref>Professor James Downs. \"Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction\".

One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the century, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Mini\u00e9 ball]]s, and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer Repeating Rifle]] and the [[Henry rifle|Henry Repeating Rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open.

By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves \"...&nbsp;cannot be neutral.

From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].}} About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders\u2014until 1865\u2014opposed enlisting slaves.

Trefousse, ''Historical Dictionary of Reconstruction'' (Greenwood, 1991) covers all the main events and leaders.</ref> It comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the outstanding issues of the war's aftermath, the most important of which were the three \"[[Reconstruction Amendments]]\" to the Constitution, which remain in effect to the present time: the 13th (1865), the 14th (1868) and the 15th (1870). From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to consolidate the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a \"[[Republicanism in the United States|republican form of government]] for the ex-Confederate states; and to permanently end slavery\u2014and prevent semi-slavery status.<ref>Eric Foner's ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990) is a brief survey.</ref>\n\nPresident Johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865, when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. [[Radical Republicans]] demanded proof that Confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free. They came to the fore after the 1866 elections and undid much of Johnson's work. In 1872 the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|\"Liberal Republicans\"]] argued that the war goals had been achieved and that Reconstruction should end. They ran a presidential ticket in 1872 but were decisively defeated. In 1874, Democrats, primarily Southern, took control of Congress and opposed any more reconstruction. The [[Compromise of 1877]] closed with a national consensus that the Civil War had finally ended.<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction'' (2nd edn 1991).</ref> With the withdrawal of federal troops, however, whites retook control of every Southern legislature; the [[Jim Crow]] period of disenfranchisement and legal segregation was about to begin.\n\n===Post-War Politics===\nThe Civil War would have a huge impact on American politics in the years to come.

There are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections. The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war.<ref name=\"controversy\" /> The last theme includes moral evaluations of [[racism]] and slavery, heroism in combat and heroism behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an \"[[Empire of Liberty]]\" influencing the world.<ref name=\"american83\" />\n\nProfessional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the war, than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside academia, leading to a proliferation of studies by non-scholars who nevertheless are familiar with the primary sources and pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and who write for the general public, rather than the scholarly community. [[Bruce Catton]] and [[Shelby Foote]] are among the best-known writers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E.

Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black [[Baptists|Baptist]] preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:\n{{quote|God had chastised them and given them a special mission\u2014to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.<ref>Wilson Fallin Jr, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\nIn sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:\n{{quote|God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Fallin, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\n===Lost Cause===\n{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}\nMemory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|\"Lost Cause\"]]: that the Confederate cause was a just and heroic one. The myth shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.<ref name=\"confederacy84\" /> Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly \"a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame\" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.<ref>Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12\u201319.</ref> Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|\"virulent racism\" of the 19th century]], sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause \"a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every instance.<ref>Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Beardian historiography===\nThe economic and political-power determinism forcefully presented by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:\n\n{{quote|[A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.<ref>Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54.</ref>}}\n\nThe Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Progressive Historians|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iLdMzbv2IDQC|page=459}}|origyear=1968|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=304|isbn=9780307809605}}</ref>\n\n===Battlefield preservation===\n[[File:Civil War centennial issues.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Beginning in 1961 the U.S. Post Office released [[Commemorative stamp]]s for five famous battles, each issued on the 100th anniversary of the respective battle.]]\n\nThe first efforts at Civil War battlefield preservation and memorialization came during the war itself with the establishment of National Cemeteries at Gettysburg, Mill Springs and Chattanooga.

The [[Shiloh National Military Park]] was established in 1894, followed by the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in 1895 and [[Vicksburg National Military Park]] in 1899.

In 1991, the original Civil War Trust was created in the mold of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Foundation, but failed to attract corporate donors and soon helped manage the disbursement of U.S. Mint Civil War commemorative coin revenues designated for battlefield preservation. Although the two non-profit organizations joined forces on a number of battlefield acquisitions, ongoing conflicts prompted the boards of both organizations to facilitate a merger, which happened in 1999 with the creation of the Civil War Preservation Trust.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behind-the-bitter-war-to-preserve-the-civil-war-battlefields/2017/07/21/6a1c8dd4-6591-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html] The Washington Post, July 21, 2007, \"\"Behind the bitter war to preserve Civil War battlefields.\" Accessed May 30, 2018.</ref> In 2011, the organization was renamed, again becoming the [[Civil War Trust]].

The loyalists of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. They faced secessionists of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in the South, who advocated for [[states' rights]] in order to uphold slavery.\n\nOf the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861, seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|slave-holding states\"]] were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  [[Confederate States of America]] was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from [[Government in exile|native secessionists fleeing Union authority]]. These states were given full representation in the [[Confederate States Congress|Confederate Congress]] throughout the Civil War. The two remaining \"slave states\", Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to [[Ex parte Merryman|intervention]] [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|by federal troops]].\n\nThe Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union.{{Efn|Including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years.

The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights, and as the first step in a grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Stephen A.

The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally; thus Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]], seven slave states with [[cotton]]-based economies declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

Later, in September 1862, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal.<ref name=\"proclamation\" /> To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of its western armies, and seized [[New Orleans]]. The successful 1863 Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1863, [[Robert E. Lee]]'s Confederate incursion north ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Western successes led to [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the [[fall of Atlanta]] to [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|his march to the sea]]. The last significant battles raged around the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Lee's escape attempt ended with his [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|surrender at Appomattox Court House]], on April 9, 1865. While the military war was coming to an end, the political reintegration of the nation was to take another 12 years, known as the [[Reconstruction era]].\n\n[[File:Flag of the Confederate States of America (1861\u20131863).svg|thumb|Confederate flag, the \"Stars and Bars\".]]\n\nThe American Civil War was among the earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]].

Of all these interpretations, the states'-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, states' rights for what purpose?

Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with [[subsistence agriculture]] for poor whites. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=648\u2013649}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether economic differences between the mainly industrial North and the mainly agricultural South helped cause the war.

The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.\n\nAccording to Lincoln, the American people had shown that they had been successful in ''establishing'' and ''administering'' a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, ''maintaining'' a republic based on the people's vote against an attempt to overthrow it.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u1xgWBntGYICA|page=1}}|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780847699537|language=en|p=1}} {{dead link|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Outbreak of the war==\n\n===Secession crisis===\nThe election of Lincoln provoked the legislature of South Carolina to call a state convention to consider secession. Prior to the war, South Carolina did more than any other Southern state to advance the notion that a state had the right to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] federal laws, and even to secede from the United States. The convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted the \"[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]\". It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution.

These states agreed to form a new federal government, the [[Confederate States of America]], on February 4, 1861.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=24}} They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President [[James Buchanan]], whose term ended on March 4, 1861.

Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. marshals and judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S. mints in Louisiana, Georgia, and North Carolina. He stated that it would be U.S. policy to only collect import duties at its ports; there could be no serious injury to the South to justify armed revolution during his administration.

Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted.

In the East, the Navy supplied and moved army forces about, and occasionally shelled Confederate installations.\n\n===Modern navy evolves===\n[[File:NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Clashes on the rivers were melees of [[ironclads]], [[Cottonclad warship|cottonclads]], [[gunboats]] and rams, complicated by torpedoes and [[Fire ship|fire rafts]].]]The Civil War occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution. Many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the [[ironclad warship]]. It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match the Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=92}} Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with ram bows, creating \"ram fever\" among Union squadrons wherever they threatened.

The resulting three hour [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] was a draw, but it proved that ironclads were effective warships.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=345}} Not long after the battle the Confederacy was forced to scuttle the ''Virginia'' to prevent its capture, while the Union built many copies of the ''Monitor''.

The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. \"King Cotton\" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288\u201389, 296\u201398}}\n\n==== Blockade runners ====\n{{Main|Blockade runners of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:First Charleston Harbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gunline of nine Union ironclads.

There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies.\n\nMost historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy; however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.<ref>Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)</ref>\n\nSurdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Surdam |first1=David G. |year=1998 |title=The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=51 |issue=4|pages=85\u2013107}}</ref> The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it.

Surdam, ''Northern Naval Superiority and the Economics of the American Civil War'' (University of South Carolina Press, 2001).</ref>\n\nTo fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}} After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15 million in 1871.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=225}}\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\n\nAlthough the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=546\u201357}}{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=237}} The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}}\n[[File:USS Wissahickon Crewmembers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Crewmembers of {{USS|Wissahickon|1861|6}} by the ship's {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Dahlgren gun]], circa 1863|alt=A group of twenty-six sailors posing around a rifled naval cannon]]\n[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860\u201362 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that \"King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton\", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}} When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.<ref name=\"nevins73\" />\n\nLincoln's administration failed to appeal to European public opinion. Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. The European aristocracy was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.\"<ref>Don H.

The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.<ref>Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)</ref>\n\nWar loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States. British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.<ref name=\"approaching\" />\n\nThe Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=261}}\n\n==Eastern theater==\n[[File:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|County]] map of Civil War battles by theater and year]]\n\n{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}The Eastern theater refers to the military operations east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the coastal fortifications and seaports of [[North Carolina]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Potomac \nMaj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}\n\n# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.\n# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.\n# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.\n# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee]]\n; Army of Northern Virginia\n\nThe primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\n\nWhen Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.\n\nLee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.<ref>Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.</ref> However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. [[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.\n\n=== Battles ===\n\n;First Bull Run\n\nIn one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas). \n[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|\"Stonewall\" got his nickname at Bull Run.]]\nThe Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\".\n\n; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign\n[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan]]\nUpon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond.

Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of \"[[foot cavalry]]\".\n\nJohnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E.

[[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=664}} However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat.\n\n==Western theater==\n{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}\nThe Western theater refers to military operations between the Appalachian Mountains and the [[Mississippi River]], including the states of [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]], as well as parts of [[Louisiana]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Tennessee and Army of the Cumberland \n[[File:Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (4228634580).jpg|thumb|160px|Ulysses S. Grant]]\nThe primary Union forces in the Western theater were the [[Army of the Tennessee]] and the [[Army of the Cumberland]], named for the two rivers, the [[Tennessee River]] and [[Cumberland River]]. After Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\n; Army of Tennessee \nThe primary Confederate force in the Western theater was the [[Army of Tennessee]]. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, when General [[Braxton Bragg]] renamed the former [[Army of Mississippi]]. While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;Fort Henry and Fort Donelson\n\nThe Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant, who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] (February 6, 1862) and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (February 11 to 16, 1862), earning him the nickname of \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant, by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] rallied nearly 4,000 Confederate troops and led them to escape across the Cumberland. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] thus fell to the Union, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.\n\n[[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned it against the Confederacy. Grant used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's \"Gibraltar of the West\" at Columbus, Kentucky. Although rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky and opened Tennessee in March 1862.\n\n[[File:ASJohnston.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Albert Sidney Johnston died at Shiloh.]]\n;Shiloh\nAt [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]] (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell.

The Union in turn did not directly engage him.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=220\u201321}} Its 1864 [[Red River Campaign]] to take Shreveport, Louisiana, was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war.\n\n== Lower Seaboard theater ==\n{{details|Lower Seaboard Theater of the American Civil War}}\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Lower Seaboard theater refers to military and naval operations that occurred near the coastal areas of the Southeast (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas) as well as southern part of the Mississippi River (Port Hudson and south). Union Naval activities were dictated by the Anaconda Plan.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;South Carolina\nOne of the earliest battles of the war was fought at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal Sound]], south of Charleston. Much of the war along the South Carolina coast concentrated on capturing [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In attempting to capture Charleston, the Union military tried two approaches, by land over James or Morris Islands or through the harbor. However, the Confederates were able to drive back each Union attack. One of the most famous of the land attacks was the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], in which the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts Infantry]] took part. The Federals suffered a serious defeat in this battle, losing 1,500 men while the Confederates lost only 175.\n\n;Georgia\nFort Pulaski on the Georgia coast was an early target for the Union navy. Following the capture of Port Royal, an expedition was organized with engineer troops under the command of Captain [[Quincy Adams Gillmore|Quincy A. Gillmore]], forcing a Confederate surrender. The Union army occupied the fort for the rest of the war after making repair.\n\n;Louisiana\n[[File:New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220px|thumb| New Orleans captured.]]\nIn April 1862, a Union naval task force commanded by Commander [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]] attacked [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], which guarded the river approach to New Orleans from the south. While part of the fleet bombarded the forts, other vessels forced a break in the obstructions in the river and enabled the rest of the fleet to steam upriver to the city. A Union army force commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] landed near the forts and forced their surrender. Butler's controversial command of New Orleans earned him the nickname \"Beast\".\n\nThe following year, the Union [[Army of the Gulf]] commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks laid [[Siege of Port Hudson|siege to Port Hudson]] for nearly eight weeks, the longest siege in US military history. The Confederates attempted to defend with the [[Bayou Teche Campaign]], but surrendered after Vicksburg.

Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war.<ref name=\"history\" /> This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said \"would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion.

The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.\n\nAn attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724\u201342}}\n[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]\n\n=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===\nGrant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war, and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]].

This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops.

The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich Southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second-class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=851}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including [[James M.

He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.<ref name=\"confederacy\" />\n\nConfederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.<ref name=\"confederacy\" /> Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could continue to fight the war only as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=771\u201372}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:2em;\"\n|+ Comparison of Union and Confederacy, 1860\u20131864<ref name=\"census74\" />\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Union\n! scope=\"col\" | Confederacy\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|'''Population'''\n|1860\n| 22,100,000 (71%)\n| 9,100,000 (29%)\n|-\n|1864\n| 28,800,000 (90%){{refn|name=UnionPop|group=lower-alpha|\"Union population 1864\" aggregates 1860 population, average annual immigration 1855\u20131864, and population governed formerly by CSA per Kenneth Martis source.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.<ref name=\"WarLeader\" /> The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=382\u201388}}\n\nHistorian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history.<ref>Don H.

Fox complained, however, that records were incomplete, especially during the last year of the war, and that battlefield reports likely under-counted deaths (many men counted as wounded in battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds). Thomas L. Livermore, using Fox's data, put the number of Confederate non-combat deaths at 166,000, using the official estimate of Union deaths from disease and accidents and a comparison of Union and Confederate enlistment records, for a total of 260,000 deaths.<ref name=\"civilwarhome.com\" /> However, this excludes the 30,000 deaths of Confederate troops in prisons, which would raise the minimum number of deaths to 290,000.\n\nThe United States National Park Service uses the following figures in its official tally of war losses:<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/>\n\n'''Union: 853,838'''\n* 110,100 killed in action\n* 224,580 disease deaths\n* 275,154 wounded in action\n* 211,411 captured (including 30,192 who died as POWs)\n\n'''Confederate: 914,660'''\n* 94,000 killed in action\n* 164,000 disease deaths\n* 194,026 wounded in action\n* 462,634 captured (including 31,000 who died as POWs)\n\n[[File:Burial of the dead on the Antietam battlefield army.mil-2008-09-10-145638.jpg|thumb|Burying Union dead on the [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] battlefield, 1862]]\n\nWhile the figures of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy remained commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. [[Francis Amasa Walker]], superintendent of the 1870 census, used census and surgeon general data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.<ref name=\"recounting\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307\u201348}} This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.\n\nDeaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, or exposure, and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1 million.<ref>Professor James Downs. \"Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction\".

One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the century, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Mini\u00e9 ball]]s, and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer Repeating Rifle]] and the [[Henry rifle|Henry Repeating Rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open.

By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves \"...&nbsp;cannot be neutral.

From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].}} About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders\u2014until 1865\u2014opposed enlisting slaves.

Trefousse, ''Historical Dictionary of Reconstruction'' (Greenwood, 1991) covers all the main events and leaders.</ref> It comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the outstanding issues of the war's aftermath, the most important of which were the three \"[[Reconstruction Amendments]]\" to the Constitution, which remain in effect to the present time: the 13th (1865), the 14th (1868) and the 15th (1870). From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to consolidate the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a \"[[Republicanism in the United States|republican form of government]] for the ex-Confederate states; and to permanently end slavery\u2014and prevent semi-slavery status.<ref>Eric Foner's ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990) is a brief survey.</ref>\n\nPresident Johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865, when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. [[Radical Republicans]] demanded proof that Confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free. They came to the fore after the 1866 elections and undid much of Johnson's work. In 1872 the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|\"Liberal Republicans\"]] argued that the war goals had been achieved and that Reconstruction should end. They ran a presidential ticket in 1872 but were decisively defeated. In 1874, Democrats, primarily Southern, took control of Congress and opposed any more reconstruction. The [[Compromise of 1877]] closed with a national consensus that the Civil War had finally ended.<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction'' (2nd edn 1991).</ref> With the withdrawal of federal troops, however, whites retook control of every Southern legislature; the [[Jim Crow]] period of disenfranchisement and legal segregation was about to begin.\n\n===Post-War Politics===\nThe Civil War would have a huge impact on American politics in the years to come.

There are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections. The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war.<ref name=\"controversy\" /> The last theme includes moral evaluations of [[racism]] and slavery, heroism in combat and heroism behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an \"[[Empire of Liberty]]\" influencing the world.<ref name=\"american83\" />\n\nProfessional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the war, than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside academia, leading to a proliferation of studies by non-scholars who nevertheless are familiar with the primary sources and pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and who write for the general public, rather than the scholarly community. [[Bruce Catton]] and [[Shelby Foote]] are among the best-known writers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E.

Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black [[Baptists|Baptist]] preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:\n{{quote|God had chastised them and given them a special mission\u2014to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.<ref>Wilson Fallin Jr, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\nIn sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:\n{{quote|God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Fallin, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\n===Lost Cause===\n{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}\nMemory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|\"Lost Cause\"]]: that the Confederate cause was a just and heroic one. The myth shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.<ref name=\"confederacy84\" /> Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly \"a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame\" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.<ref>Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12\u201319.</ref> Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|\"virulent racism\" of the 19th century]], sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause \"a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every instance.<ref>Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Beardian historiography===\nThe economic and political-power determinism forcefully presented by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:\n\n{{quote|[A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.<ref>Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54.</ref>}}\n\nThe Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Progressive Historians|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iLdMzbv2IDQC|page=459}}|origyear=1968|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=304|isbn=9780307809605}}</ref>\n\n===Battlefield preservation===\n[[File:Civil War centennial issues.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Beginning in 1961 the U.S. Post Office released [[Commemorative stamp]]s for five famous battles, each issued on the 100th anniversary of the respective battle.]]\n\nThe first efforts at Civil War battlefield preservation and memorialization came during the war itself with the establishment of National Cemeteries at Gettysburg, Mill Springs and Chattanooga.

The [[Shiloh National Military Park]] was established in 1894, followed by the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in 1895 and [[Vicksburg National Military Park]] in 1899.

In 1991, the original Civil War Trust was created in the mold of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Foundation, but failed to attract corporate donors and soon helped manage the disbursement of U.S. Mint Civil War commemorative coin revenues designated for battlefield preservation. Although the two non-profit organizations joined forces on a number of battlefield acquisitions, ongoing conflicts prompted the boards of both organizations to facilitate a merger, which happened in 1999 with the creation of the Civil War Preservation Trust.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behind-the-bitter-war-to-preserve-the-civil-war-battlefields/2017/07/21/6a1c8dd4-6591-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html] The Washington Post, July 21, 2007, \"\"Behind the bitter war to preserve Civil War battlefields.\" Accessed May 30, 2018.</ref> In 2011, the organization was renamed, again becoming the [[Civil War Trust]].

He was born and raised in [[Vigo]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and now lives in Madrid. He has published two acclaimed bestsellers featuring Inspector Leo Caldas, a dyed-in-the-wool Galician detective, and Rafael Est\u00e9vez, his down to earth assistant from Zaragoza who finds it difficult to cope with the Galician sense of irony. Both novels were originally published in [[Galician language|Galician]] before being translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by the author himself. They have also been translated into several other European languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/authors/detail.page?id=IQxbVixFOKNItGgKmBUslVEtCEvwmdM5HdX-IzZ4CZc0nuMqLGZ61bffwL1b|title=Domingo Villar - Little, Brown Book Group|website=littlebrown.co.uk|access-date=2016-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115082656/https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/authors/detail.page?id=IQxbVixFOKNItGgKmBUslVEtCEvwmdM5HdX-IzZ4CZc0nuMqLGZ61bffwL1b|archive-date=2017-11-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n2006: Ojos de agua (Spanish)\n*(Galician: Ollos de auga)\n*(English : Water-blue eyes, tr.

He was born and raised in [[Vigo]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and now lives in Madrid. He has published two acclaimed bestsellers featuring Inspector Leo Caldas, a dyed-in-the-wool Galician detective, and Rafael Est\u00e9vez, his down to earth assistant from Zaragoza who finds it difficult to cope with the Galician sense of irony. Both novels were originally published in [[Galician language|Galician]] before being translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by the author himself. They have also been translated into several other European languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/authors/detail.page?id=IQxbVixFOKNItGgKmBUslVEtCEvwmdM5HdX-IzZ4CZc0nuMqLGZ61bffwL1b|title=Domingo Villar - Little, Brown Book Group|website=littlebrown.co.uk|access-date=2016-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115082656/https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/authors/detail.page?id=IQxbVixFOKNItGgKmBUslVEtCEvwmdM5HdX-IzZ4CZc0nuMqLGZ61bffwL1b|archive-date=2017-11-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n2006: Ojos de agua (Spanish)\n*(Galician: Ollos de auga)\n*(English : Water-blue eyes, tr.
