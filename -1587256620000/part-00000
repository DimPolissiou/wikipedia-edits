It is a branch of the '''Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County (PLSJ)''', which services a large area in southeast Ohio \u2013 otherwise known as the [[Ohio Valley]].  Besides the Schiappa Library, PLSJ has branches all over [[Jefferson County, Ohio]] located in [[Toronto, Ohio|Toronto]], [[Brilliant, Ohio|Brilliant]], [[Tiltonsville, Ohio|Tiltonsville]], [[Dillonvale, Jefferson County, Ohio|Dillonvale]] and [[Adena, Ohio|Adena]] with the Main Library located in Steubenville.  The Schiappa branch is located at the west end of Steubenville on the [[Fort Steuben Mall]] property.  It not only serves as an additional library for the city of Steubenville, but also as a library for the neighboring village of [[Wintersville, Ohio]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Schiappa Branch Library opened its doors on February 2, 1987 in the west end of Steubenville, at 4141 Mall Drive, where it still sits on property donated by the Siciliano family.  This plot of land was one of many looked at in the time leading up to a final decision, but it was this area's location, being adjacent to a large [[shopping center]] attracting people from all over the Ohio Valley, that made it so desirable.  Huberta Siciliano made it clear that if she were to donate the land to the library, she would like the facility to be named after her parents: Albert and Mary A. Schiappa.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\">Lash, John.  ''The history of the Schiappa Branch Library in Steubenville, Ohio''.  May 2005.</ref>\n\nOne concern with the property that the Schiappa Library now sits upon was that the land was a former [[strip-mining]] area.  This caused many to note that the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] would be in danger of cracking and heaving once the [[pyrites]] swelled with moisture.  To resolve this, the library was built upon 110 [[concrete]] [[pylon (disambiguation)|pylons]], drilled to solid rock, which is between 4 and 14 feet deep at the site.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\">Hall, Alan.

To remedy this, returned books were shelved quickly and the State Regional Library sent over boxes of books to make the shelves more full temporarily.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\"/>   Over the years, the collection of books has grown exponentially to include [[VHS|videotapes]], [[DVDs]], [[CDs]], [[audiobook]]s, [[periodicals]], and [[graphic novels]].\n\n==Renovations==\n\nBy 1990, the collection at Schiappa Branch Library had grown so large that talk of expanding the building had begun.  A larger children's area was needed, more [[Reference#Libraries|reference]] shelving would be required, and the collection in Schiappa's Ohio History and [[Genealogy]] room was beginning to take up more space than the shelves could fit.  There was also talk of adding a conference room, a children's activity room, and offices for the branch manager.  The project went forward in 1992 and the library was renovated with all of the above changes while the building itself stayed open to the public.  An extra wing was added for the children's area and activity room, a conference room and three study rooms were built, offices for the branch manager and extra workspaces were added behind the [[library circulation|Circulation]] desk, and the Reference and Genealogy departments were given their own closed in space for quiet studying and for keeping reference materials from leaving the room.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\"/>\n\nBeginning in 2007, plans were drawn up for another renovation project.  This time, it was the front [[lobby (room)|lobby]] and adult fiction/nonfiction areas that would be getting a makeover.  New flooring was put into the front lobby and periodical section.  New furniture was brought in, including new desks, workspaces, chairs and a counter for the Circulation department.  [[Vending machines]] were added beside new study areas for a more modern and customer friendly look.<ref>Hall, Alan.

Items may be returned or taken out at the circulation desk.  Borrowers may also pick up items that have been placed on hold (brought in from other libraries).

The collection consists of birth, death and marriage [[record (computer science)|records]], newspaper clippings, [[photo albums]], [[high school]] [[yearbooks]], and United States [[census]] materials, among other things.  There is also a large collection the Steubenville area's local newspaper, [http://www.hsconnect.com The ''Herald-Star''], dating back to the early 19th century on [[microfilm]].
