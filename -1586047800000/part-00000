As the region's largest convener of business leadership, GLI leads economic and global outreach strategies focused on business attraction; nurtures the entrepreneurial eco-system; and champions the development of the community's talent base.  As the voice of Greater Louisville's business community, GLI advocates for a pro-business environment and facilitates businesses engagement on issues that impact regional competitiveness.\n\n==History==\nIn 1862, 220 firms paid $1 each to join the Louisville Board of Trade. Prior to that, there was a Merchants Exchange that met monthly during the 1850s on the southeast corner of Second and Main. In 1913, a Convention Bureau was formed. And, in 1943, a convention Bureau was formed. By 1950, these groups and the Retail Merchants Association incorporated into the Louisville Chamber of Commerce. It was renamed Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce, and was one of the first such groups accredited by the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].\n\nKenneth Vinsel was named the first chief executive officer of The Chamber. The first issue of ''Louisville Magazine'' was unveiled on March 1, 1950. The offices were located on Fifth Street, between Jefferson and Liberty. In 1951, The Chamber moved to the Courier-Journal and Louisville Times Building at 300 West Liberty. The Chamber also played a key role in attracting General Electric to Louisville.\n\nIn 1966, Charles Herd succeeded Vinsel as The Chamber's executive vice president. Herd held a similar position with the Knoxville, Tennessee, Chamber of Commerce. In 1967, the official name of the organization was changed to the Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1968, the Chamber's convention Bureau was split off as a separate organization.\n\nIn 1970, the Louisville Development Committee was formed. Its corollary, the Louisville Development Association, later funded a study that paved the way for the creation of the Kentucky Center for the Arts. The foundation also established offices in New York to generate national publicity for Louisville.\n\nIn 1972, Chamber efforts began to help revitalize the Kentucky Derby Festival. The minority Business Resource Center was also launched. This Chamber-backed effort to assist minority-operated companies still exists today under the title of the Tri-state Minority Supplier Development Council.\n\nIn 1974, The Chamber began the Bicentennial Corporation. An offshoot, Heritage Corporation, ran Heritage Weekends until 1988 from the Chamber offices. In 1978, Leadership Louisville was launched at The Chamber. This program, designed to broaden the horizons of local leaders, continues to grow and now operates out of separate offices. In 1979, the Chamber's Visitors Bureau was split off and joined the Convention Bureau, opening an office in Founders' Square. Russel Anderson was hired as president.\n\nIn the early 1980s, The Chamber started a new program for small to medium-sized businesses, which evolved into the Center for Small Business and later, the Inc. Tank. In 1983, James O. Roberson, an economic development executive, most recently from Maryland, was appointed Chamber president. Also in 1983, The Chamber moved to One Riverfront Plaza. In 1984, the Development Finance Center was created at The Chamber to help provide venture capital for emerging businesses.\n\nIn 1986, the Government and Public Affairs division of The Chamber helped Louisville businesses save millions of dollars by leading the charge to repeal the antiquated \"Unitary Tax.\" The Chamber was also instrumental in phasing out the city and county inventory tax, saving businesses $4 million a year. I 1987, The Chamber launched the Campaign for Greater Louisville, a $10 million guest to create new jobs in the Louisville area. Later renamed the [[Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership]], it became the major business attraction agency in the area.\n\nIn 1988, Charles H. Buddeke lll became the fourth Chamber President. The Chamber/Partnership was named one of the nations 10 best economic development programs by the Industrial Development Research Council. In 1990, The Chamber's Kentuckiana Education & Workforce Institute published its first annual Labor Day Report, establishing a model for bridging the gap between education and the needs of employers in Louisville.\n\nDuring the 1990 State Legislative session, The Chamber successfully lobbied for 12 of its 15 priorities, including the Airport Expansion and Education Reform.  The Chamber, the Partnership and the Office for Economic Development won an award from the American Economic Development Council for forming a successful partnership in economic development efforts.\n\nIn 1991, Mary Anne Cronan served as acting president as a nationwide search for a new chamber president was conducted.\n\nIn May 1991, at the initiative of the mayor, the County Judge, the Partnership and The Chamber, a Regional Economic Development Strategic Plan involving a broad-based, 230-person Planning Committee was developed. As a result of this process, the following priorities for implementation were established:  State and Federal Relations, Jefferson County Governance, Comprehensive Land Use and Infrastructure Planning, African American and Minority Economic Development, Workforce Development, and Coordinated Economic Development.\n\nRobert H. Gayle, Jr. was named president and CEO in June 1991.\n\nIn 1992, a new program was launched \u2013 the Area Councils, as a grassroots effort to make The Chamber more accessible, responsive and representative to the entire community. Also during 1992, Business Advocates merged with The Chamber. This group, composed of approximately 60 businesses, decided on merger because it believed that The Chamber was beginning to address the needs of its members.\n\nIn 1993, The Chamber moved to West Main, a five-story cornerstone building in the heart of the revitalized West Main Street district. Joining the organization in this renovated facility were the Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership, the Kentuckiana Minority Supplier Development Council, the Louisville/Jefferson County Office for Economic Development and the Louisville Development Authority.  The Chamber also sold ''Louisville Magazine'' in 1993. Also during 1993, The Chamber began implementation of the Regional Economic Development Strategy, a four-year initiative designed to improve the competitiveness of the Louisville region.\n\nIn 1996, The Chamber and the Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership hired M. Ross Boyle, a nationally renowned consultant, to do a comprehensive study of the region's economic competitiveness. Boyle's conclusion:  Louisville is a \u201cnice, average town.\" Also in 1996, Bob Gayle, Chamber president, resigned to take a new position with the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce. Jim Ratcliffe served as interim president as a nationwide search for a new Chamber president was conducted.\n\nIn 1997, a 30-member community task force worked with consultant Boyle to produce an economic Visioning Report for the community. Goal:  Transform Louisville from a \u201cnice, average town\u201d into an \u201ceconomic hot spot\u201d. In August 1997, Tricon Global Restaurants, a Fortune 500 company, chose Louisville for its corporate headquarters, a project coordinated by the Economic Development Partnership.\n\nIn September 1997, as a first step in achieving the Economic Vision, The Chamber merged with the Economic Development Partnership. Doug Cobb was named president and CEO of Greater Louisville Inc., the new name for the newly merged organization.

Prior to that, there was a Merchants Exchange that met monthly during the 1850s on the southeast corner of Second and Main. In 1913, a Convention Bureau was formed. And, in 1943, a convention Bureau was formed. By 1950, these groups and the Retail Merchants Association incorporated into the Louisville Chamber of Commerce. It was renamed Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce, and was one of the first such groups accredited by the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].\n\nKenneth Vinsel was named the first chief executive officer of The Chamber. The first issue of ''Louisville Magazine'' was unveiled on March 1, 1950. The offices were located on Fifth Street, between Jefferson and Liberty. In 1951, The Chamber moved to the Courier-Journal and Louisville Times Building at 300 West Liberty. The Chamber also played a key role in attracting General Electric to Louisville.\n\nIn 1966, Charles Herd succeeded Vinsel as The Chamber's executive vice president. Herd held a similar position with the Knoxville, Tennessee, Chamber of Commerce. In 1967, the official name of the organization was changed to the Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1968, the Chamber's convention Bureau was split off as a separate organization.\n\nIn 1970, the Louisville Development Committee was formed. Its corollary, the Louisville Development Association, later funded a study that paved the way for the creation of the Kentucky Center for the Arts. The foundation also established offices in New York to generate national publicity for Louisville.\n\nIn 1972, Chamber efforts began to help revitalize the Kentucky Derby Festival. The minority Business Resource Center was also launched. This Chamber-backed effort to assist minority-operated companies still exists today under the title of the Tri-state Minority Supplier Development Council.\n\nIn 1974, The Chamber began the Bicentennial Corporation. An offshoot, Heritage Corporation, ran Heritage Weekends until 1988 from the Chamber offices. In 1978, Leadership Louisville was launched at The Chamber. This program, designed to broaden the horizons of local leaders, continues to grow and now operates out of separate offices. In 1979, the Chamber's Visitors Bureau was split off and joined the Convention Bureau, opening an office in Founders' Square. Russel Anderson was hired as president.\n\nIn the early 1980s, The Chamber started a new program for small to medium-sized businesses, which evolved into the Center for Small Business and later, the Inc. Tank. In 1983, James O. Roberson, an economic development executive, most recently from Maryland, was appointed Chamber president. Also in 1983, The Chamber moved to One Riverfront Plaza.

Joining the organization in this renovated facility were the Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership, the Kentuckiana Minority Supplier Development Council, the Louisville/Jefferson County Office for Economic Development and the Louisville Development Authority.

Also during 1993, The Chamber began implementation of the Regional Economic Development Strategy, a four-year initiative designed to improve the competitiveness of the Louisville region.\n\nIn 1996, The Chamber and the Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership hired M.

They cause cold water to rise from below the surface layer of the ocean, bringing with it many nutrients that ultimately benefit local fisheries. As the winds blow over the ocean, sea surface temperatures drop about 4[[\u00b0C]] (7[[\u00b0F]]), indicating the [[upwelling]]. [[Chlorophyll]] concentrations in the surface water go from negligible, in the absence of winds, to very active at more than 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter in the presence of the winds.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n====Local maritime impacts====\nDuring the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves come from a northeasterly direction; toward the normally sheltered side of [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]]. Protected harbors such as [[Avalon, California|Avalon]] and [[Two Harbors, California|Two Harbors]] are normally sheltered and the waters within the harbors are very calm. In strong Santa Ana conditions, these harbors develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings and crash them onto the shore. During a Santa Ana, it is advised that boaters moor on the back side of the island to avoid the dangerous conditions of the front side.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Related phenomena==\n\n=== Santa Ana fog ===\nA ''Santa Ana fog'' is a derivative phenomenon in which a ground [[fog]] settles in coastal [[Southern California]] at the end of a Santa Ana wind episode. When Santa Ana conditions prevail, with winds in the lower two to three kilometers (1.25-1.8 miles) of the atmosphere from the north through east, the air over the coastal basin is extremely dry, and this dry air extends out over offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. When the Santa Ana winds cease, the cool and moist [[marine layer]] may re-form rapidly over the ocean if conditions are right. The air in the marine layer becomes very moist and very low clouds or fog occurs.<ref name = \"fog1\">Leipper, D. F., Fog development at San Diego, California, J. Mar. Research, 7, 337-346, 1948.</ref><ref name = \"fog2\">Leipper, D. F., Fog on the United States West Coast: a review. Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc. 75, 229-240.</ref> If wind gradients turn on-shore with enough strength, this sea fog is blown onto the coastal areas. This marks a sudden and surprising transition from the hot, dry Santa Ana conditions to cool, moist, and gray marine weather, as the Santa Ana fog can blow onshore and envelop cities in as quickly as fifteen minutes. However, a true Santa Ana fog is rare, because it requires conditions conducive to rapid re-forming of the marine layer, plus a rapid and strong reversal in wind gradients from off-shore to on-shore winds. More often, the high pressure system over the Great Basin, which caused the Santa Ana conditions in the first place, is slow to weaken or move east across the United States. In this more usual case, the Santa Ana winds cease, but warm, dry conditions under a stationary air mass continue for days or even weeks after the Santa Ana wind event ends.\n\nA related phenomenon occurs when the Santa Ana condition is present but weak, allowing hot dry air to accumulate in the inland valleys that may not push all the way to sea level.  Under these conditions auto commuters can drive from the San Fernando Valley where conditions are sunny and warm, over the low Santa Monica Mountains, to plunge into the cool cloudy air, low clouds, and fog characteristic of the marine air mass.  This and the \"Santa Ana fog\" above constitute examples of an air [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]].\n\n=== Sundowner winds ===\n{{main|Sundowner (wind)}}\nThe similar winds in the Santa Barbara and Goleta coast area occur most frequently in the late spring to early summer, and are strongest at sunset, or \"sundown\"; hence their name: sundowner.  Because high pressure areas usually migrate east, changing the pressure gradient in southern California to the northeast, it is common for \"sundowner\" wind events to precede Santa Ana events by a day or two.<ref>Ryan, G., and L. E. Burch, 1992: An analysis of sundowner winds: A California downslope wind event. Preprints, Sixth Conf. on Mountain Meteorology, Portland, OR, Amer. Meteor. Soc., 64-67.</ref>\n\n===Arctic and Antarctic katabatic winds===\nWinds blowing off the elevated glaciated plateaus of [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] experience the most extreme form of [[katabatic wind]], of which the Santa Ana is a type, for the most part.  The winds start at a high elevation and flow outward and downslope, attaining hurricane gusts in valleys, along the shore, and even out to sea.  Like the Santa Ana, these winds also heat up by compression and lose humidity, but because they start out so extraordinarily cold and dry and blow over snow and ice all the way to the sea, the perceived similarity is negligible.\n\n== Historical impact ==\nThe Santa Ana winds and the accompanying raging wildfires have been a part of the ecosystem of the Los Angeles Basin for over 5,000 years, dating back to the earliest habitation of the region by the [[Tongva]] and [[Tataviam people|Tataviam]] peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-rutten15-2008oct15,0,2110984.column|title =L.A., land of fire -- always|last =Rutten|first =Tim|date =October 15, 2000|website =latimes.com|publisher =[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate =May 3, 2013|url-status =live|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110606164351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-rutten15-2008oct15,0,2110984.column|archivedate =June 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Santa Ana winds have been recognized and reported in English-language records as a weather phenomenon in Southern California since at least the mid-nineteenth century.<ref name=\"KCET Devil Winds\"/> Various episodes of hot, dry winds have been described over this history as dust storms, hurricane-force winds, and violent north-easters, damaging houses and destroying fruit orchards.

By 1893, controversy had broken out over whether this name was a corruption of the Spanish term ''Santana'' (a running together of the words ''Santa Ana''), or the different term ''Satan\u00e1s'', meaning Satan. However, newspaper mention of the term \"Satan\u00e1s\" in reference to the winds did not begin appearing until more than 60 years later. A possible explanation is that the spoken Spanish language merges two identical vowels in [[elision]], when one ends a word and the other begins the next word. Thus the Spanish pronunciation of the phrase \"Santa Ana\" sounds like \"Santana\".\n\nAnother attempt at explanation of the name claims that it derives from a Native American term for \"devil wind\" that was altered by the Spanish into the form \"Satan\u00e1s\" (meaning Satan), and then later corrupted into \"Santa Ana\". However, an authority on Native American language claims this term \"Santana\" never existed in that tongue.<ref name=\"UCLA explains\"/>\n\nA third explanation places the origin of the term Santa Ana winds with an [[Associated Press]] correspondent stationed in Santa Ana in 1902, who documented the name \"Santa Ana winds\", or possibly mistook the term \"Santana\" or \"Satan\u00e1s\" for \"Santa Ana\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/12/santa-ana-winds-name-los-angeles-popular-culture/1#.UYR1FMrLtSI|title=Why are they called Santa Ana winds?|last=Riha, Jr.|first=Bob|website=usatoday.com|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother derivation favored by the late well-known KABC television meteorologist, Dr. George Fischbeck, cited the etymology of the Santana winds as coming from the early Mexicano/Angeleno: \"Caliente aliento de Satan\u00e1s\" or \"hot breath of Satan\".

They cause cold water to rise from below the surface layer of the ocean, bringing with it many nutrients that ultimately benefit local fisheries. As the winds blow over the ocean, sea surface temperatures drop about 4[[\u00b0C]] (7[[\u00b0F]]), indicating the [[upwelling]]. [[Chlorophyll]] concentrations in the surface water go from negligible, in the absence of winds, to very active at more than 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter in the presence of the winds.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n====Local maritime impacts====\nDuring the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves come from a northeasterly direction; toward the normally sheltered side of [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]]. Protected harbors such as [[Avalon, California|Avalon]] and [[Two Harbors, California|Two Harbors]] are normally sheltered and the waters within the harbors are very calm. In strong Santa Ana conditions, these harbors develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings and crash them onto the shore. During a Santa Ana, it is advised that boaters moor on the back side of the island to avoid the dangerous conditions of the front side.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Related phenomena==\n\n=== Santa Ana fog ===\nA ''Santa Ana fog'' is a derivative phenomenon in which a ground [[fog]] settles in coastal [[Southern California]] at the end of a Santa Ana wind episode. When Santa Ana conditions prevail, with winds in the lower two to three kilometers (1.25-1.8 miles) of the atmosphere from the north through east, the air over the coastal basin is extremely dry, and this dry air extends out over offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. When the Santa Ana winds cease, the cool and moist [[marine layer]] may re-form rapidly over the ocean if conditions are right. The air in the marine layer becomes very moist and very low clouds or fog occurs.<ref name = \"fog1\">Leipper, D. F., Fog development at San Diego, California, J. Mar. Research, 7, 337-346, 1948.</ref><ref name = \"fog2\">Leipper, D. F., Fog on the United States West Coast: a review. Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc. 75, 229-240.</ref> If wind gradients turn on-shore with enough strength, this sea fog is blown onto the coastal areas. This marks a sudden and surprising transition from the hot, dry Santa Ana conditions to cool, moist, and gray marine weather, as the Santa Ana fog can blow onshore and envelop cities in as quickly as fifteen minutes. However, a true Santa Ana fog is rare, because it requires conditions conducive to rapid re-forming of the marine layer, plus a rapid and strong reversal in wind gradients from off-shore to on-shore winds. More often, the high pressure system over the Great Basin, which caused the Santa Ana conditions in the first place, is slow to weaken or move east across the United States. In this more usual case, the Santa Ana winds cease, but warm, dry conditions under a stationary air mass continue for days or even weeks after the Santa Ana wind event ends.\n\nA related phenomenon occurs when the Santa Ana condition is present but weak, allowing hot dry air to accumulate in the inland valleys that may not push all the way to sea level.  Under these conditions auto commuters can drive from the San Fernando Valley where conditions are sunny and warm, over the low Santa Monica Mountains, to plunge into the cool cloudy air, low clouds, and fog characteristic of the marine air mass.  This and the \"Santa Ana fog\" above constitute examples of an air [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]].\n\n=== Sundowner winds ===\n{{main|Sundowner (wind)}}\nThe similar winds in the Santa Barbara and Goleta coast area occur most frequently in the late spring to early summer, and are strongest at sunset, or \"sundown\"; hence their name: sundowner.  Because high pressure areas usually migrate east, changing the pressure gradient in southern California to the northeast, it is common for \"sundowner\" wind events to precede Santa Ana events by a day or two.<ref>Ryan, G., and L. E. Burch, 1992: An analysis of sundowner winds: A California downslope wind event. Preprints, Sixth Conf. on Mountain Meteorology, Portland, OR, Amer. Meteor. Soc., 64-67.</ref>\n\n===Arctic and Antarctic katabatic winds===\nWinds blowing off the elevated glaciated plateaus of [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] experience the most extreme form of [[katabatic wind]], of which the Santa Ana is a type, for the most part.  The winds start at a high elevation and flow outward and downslope, attaining hurricane gusts in valleys, along the shore, and even out to sea.  Like the Santa Ana, these winds also heat up by compression and lose humidity, but because they start out so extraordinarily cold and dry and blow over snow and ice all the way to the sea, the perceived similarity is negligible.\n\n== Historical impact ==\nThe Santa Ana winds and the accompanying raging wildfires have been a part of the ecosystem of the Los Angeles Basin for over 5,000 years, dating back to the earliest habitation of the region by the [[Tongva]] and [[Tataviam people|Tataviam]] peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-rutten15-2008oct15,0,2110984.column|title =L.A., land of fire -- always|last =Rutten|first =Tim|date =October 15, 2000|website =latimes.com|publisher =[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate =May 3, 2013|url-status =live|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110606164351/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-rutten15-2008oct15,0,2110984.column|archivedate =June 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Santa Ana winds have been recognized and reported in English-language records as a weather phenomenon in Southern California since at least the mid-nineteenth century.<ref name=\"KCET Devil Winds\"/> Various episodes of hot, dry winds have been described over this history as dust storms, hurricane-force winds, and violent north-easters, damaging houses and destroying fruit orchards.

By 1893, controversy had broken out over whether this name was a corruption of the Spanish term ''Santana'' (a running together of the words ''Santa Ana''), or the different term ''Satan\u00e1s'', meaning Satan. However, newspaper mention of the term \"Satan\u00e1s\" in reference to the winds did not begin appearing until more than 60 years later. A possible explanation is that the spoken Spanish language merges two identical vowels in [[elision]], when one ends a word and the other begins the next word. Thus the Spanish pronunciation of the phrase \"Santa Ana\" sounds like \"Santana\".\n\nAnother attempt at explanation of the name claims that it derives from a Native American term for \"devil wind\" that was altered by the Spanish into the form \"Satan\u00e1s\" (meaning Satan), and then later corrupted into \"Santa Ana\". However, an authority on Native American language claims this term \"Santana\" never existed in that tongue.<ref name=\"UCLA explains\"/>\n\nA third explanation places the origin of the term Santa Ana winds with an [[Associated Press]] correspondent stationed in Santa Ana in 1902, who documented the name \"Santa Ana winds\", or possibly mistook the term \"Santana\" or \"Satan\u00e1s\" for \"Santa Ana\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/12/santa-ana-winds-name-los-angeles-popular-culture/1#.UYR1FMrLtSI|title=Why are they called Santa Ana winds?|last=Riha, Jr.|first=Bob|website=usatoday.com|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother derivation favored by the late well-known KABC television meteorologist, Dr. George Fischbeck, cited the etymology of the Santana winds as coming from the early Mexicano/Angeleno: \"Caliente aliento de Satan\u00e1s\" or \"hot breath of Satan\". This is likely a [[false etymology]] or [[folk etymology]], though.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{main|Santa Ana winds in popular culture}}\nThe Santa Ana winds are commonly portrayed in fiction as being responsible for a tense, uneasy, wrathful mood among Angelenos.
