This gave a contemporary French resonance to the window's portrayal of Becket resisting a 'bad king' interfering in the Church, whereas a 'good king' should protect the Church<ref name=CC/> - Philip had ejected [[Odo of Sully]] as archbishop of Paris after the latter spoke against Philip's divorce, but Odo placed the kingdom under [[interdict]].\n\n==Differences==\nThe window's composition is very different to others at Chartres,<ref name=CC/> in which the main subject's story was told uninterrupted from bottom to top. That of Becket shows the saint's exile in the first main circle on the bottom two registers, whilst the third register shows the donors in an unusually high position (they were usually shown at the base and sides of the lowest register).\n\nThe main hagiography of Becket only begins in the fourth register onwards, with a halo only added on his deathbed after his martyrdom, though the exile images also show him with a halo. These anomalies suggest that the first main circle should be read as an independent narrative and a specific memorial to his visit to Chartres, perhaps even drawing on accounts of him by those who saw him there. This interpretation would make the register with the donors a border between the exile window and the main hagiography.\n\n== Description ==\n===Thomas crosses to France===\n\n{|\n|| '''1a : Thomas Becket in Exile''' :\n\nA man holding a club pushes Thomas out of town towards a tree, shown with its crenellations and open gate (opening conventionally shown in red). Thomas is shown with a halo in episcopal vestments with his episcopal mitre and cross.\n\nHis exile followed Henry II's promulgation on 30 January 1164 of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], a collection of juridical procedures controlling the election of new prelates and gave royal courts the right to summon clergy. Becket was the only one to refuse to sign them and - accused of opposing royal authority - he decided to go into exile.\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -01a.jpg|350px]] \n|---\n|| '''1b : Exile of Thomas Becket's Family and Friends''' :\nContinuing 1a, it shows two men with clubs herding three men, a woman with a 'touret' hairstyle and two children before them. The first man in the centre carries a rectangular shape, possibly a book or a jewel-box. The treatment of the children's heads is unclear - one may be resting its head on the shoulder of another figure or the piece of glass may have been mis-assembled. The representation suggests an explusion by force as a criticism of Henry, whereas in reality Thomas willingly chose exile.\n\n:\"all the saint's friends and family, without distinction of condition or fortune, dignity or order, age or sex, were exiled like him\" (from the collected Chartres liturgies \u2014 ''actus ergo in exilium'').<ref name=CC/>\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -01b.jpg|350px]] \n|---\n|| '''2a : Thomas Becket Meets Louis VII''' :\n\nThe collection of liturgies at Chartres states that Thomas disembarked at [[Wissant]], a village to the south-west of [[Calais]] on the [[C\u00f4te d'Opale]] and that he that during his subsequent journey to [[Sens]] he met [[Louis VII of France]] at [[Soissons]] and talked amicably with him.<ref name=CC/> The panel shows Thomas with his episcopal mitre, vestments and cross at the centre and Louis with his crown and sceptre, contrasting his good kingship with Henry's bad kingship in trying to impose his will on the Church.\n\nTo the left, behind Thomas, is a [[tonsure]]d clergyman holding something in his right hand, possibly a gospel (attribute of a bishop, whose main mission was to evangelise) and making what seems to be the sign of peace with his left hand. Behind Thomas and the cleric is a stylised tree, meant to symbolise the meeting taking place outside the city walls, which contradicts the king's masonry throne, thought to symbolise the city of Soissons.\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -02a.jpg|350px]]\n\n|---\n|| '''2b : Thomas Becket Enters a City''' :\n\nRecognisable by his mitre, Thomas enters the city on horseback through a yellow doorway into the red inner city with a crenellated roof, talking to a man behind him, probably also on horseback.\n\nThe scene's significance is unclear, possibly showing his entry into [[Sens]], where he placed himself under papal protection;<ref name=CC/> or more probably his re-entry into Canterbury after his return from exile, a scene which also replies to the first panel of the exile account.<ref name=CC/>\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -02b.jpg|350px]] \n|}\n\n=== Donors ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable center\"\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -03a.jpg|200px]]\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -03b.jpg|220px]]\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -03c.jpg|200px]]\n|}<!---\n\u00c0 gauche, un \u00ab trempeur \u00bb plonge la peau dans une cuve, avec une perche pour ne pas \u00eatre br\u00fbl\u00e9 par les liquides corrosifs utilis\u00e9s<ref name=CC/>.

Behind him two clerks assist in the ceremony, the one on the left holding a gospel (symbolising the bishop's central role of evangelising) and the other holding a box with three jars of [[holy chrism]] with which Thomas is about to be anointed.

Behind the mitred Thomas is an [[alb]]ed clerk, again carrying a gospel. To the right Henry is shown higher than the other two figures on his throne, wearing a royal crown and resting his feet on a stool. Behind him, a yellow devil whispers bad advice into his ear, conventional iconography to show bad human behaviour as being guided by demons<ref name=CC/>. The interior's decoration is symbolised by a column and two arcades, supporting a crenellated wall - behind the king is a window (whose opening is shown in red according to convention) through which is seen a covered tower.\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -04b.jpg|350px]] \n|-----\n|| '''5a : Thomas Becket Leaves for Exile''' :<!---\n:\u00ab Thomas opposed the king's cupidity with his constancy, meaning that - unwilling to bend, neither to promises nor threats - he was obliged to retire secretly, because he was going to be imprisoned. Soon all his family, friends and supporters were expelled from the kingdom, after all those who were old enough to swear were ordered to go find Thomas, in order that he might break this holy resolution by seeing the pitiful state of his own people, since his own sufferings had not turned him aside from it in the slightest.

As is conventional in art of the time, the water is not shown horizontally but raised on a small mound to the right of the figure it is decorating. At the top of the boat's mast is a cross, the still sail provides a protective canopy over Thomas and on the poop is a green monstrous figurehead, held on a leash by the cross and rigging.\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -05a.jpg|350px]] \n|}\n\n==== (ii) Thomas in Exile ====\n\n{|\n|| '''5b : Thomas Meets the Pope''' :\n:\"There he met Pope Alexander III, who received him well and recommended him to the monks at [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny]], of the Cistercian Order, towards which he headed.\"<ref name=introibo/>\nAt Sens in 1164 due to his expulsion from Rome by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], [[Pope Alexander III]] is shown in a conical tiara, whilst Thomas wears his mitre, with a red gateway behind them.

Their hand gestures show that they are in discussio - Alexander points an accusing finger at Thomas with his left hand, whilst Thomas protests with his right hand.

The decoration evokes the interior of a palace, with a crenellated wall behind the king. The red panel is for once not an opening but represents the king's warrior role, in contrast to the praying role of the clergymen, represented by a blue background. The king's sceptre is over-large and more resembles a herald's [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]], underlining his role as bearer of diplomatic messages.\n\nFinally, on 22 July 1170, a patched-up peace was made between Thomas and Henry at [[Fr\u00e9teval]], allowing the archbishop to return to England.

Two columns support two arches and a crenallated frieze, whilst to the left is a roofed and crenallated tower.\n\nThe bishop shown may be the [[Archbishop of York]], whom Henry commanded to crown his son during his lifetime, a major cause of controversy with Thomas since royal coronations were normally the prerogative of the Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name=CCSG/> However, that coronation occurred on 14 June 1170, long before Thomas' return to England, leading him to excommunicate the Archbishop of York and the Bishops of London and Salisbury who had taken part.<ref name=CCSG/> It is more likely that the bishop shown is one of these three bishops complaining to Henry of his excommunication.<ref name=CC/>\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -08a.jpg|350px]] \n|-\n|| '''8b : Henry's Anger''' :\nThomas is shown in his mitre, his left hand open and the index finger of his right hand pointing in a gesture of request. A figure to the right with a  crown and sceptre turns away in anger. Two figures stand between them, the one in the foreground showing the king to the archbishop, perhaps introducing him or perhaps telling him of the king's refusal to meet with him.\n\nThe crowned figure may be Thomas' former pupil Henry III or Henry II, but it is more likely the scene continues the previous one, showing Henry II still furious at the bishops' excommunication and making the outburst which led the four knights to head for Canterbury. This latter interpretation would make the middle figures two of the four knights. Whichever interpretation is correct, panels 8a and 8b both show the leading English clergy's role in the tensions, with Henry II refusing to receive Thomas but welcoming the excommunicated bishops.\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -08b.jpg|350px]]\n\n|-\n|| '''9a : Four Knights Menace Thomas''' :\n:\"These words of the king made some detestable hangers-on believe they would give great pleasure to the king by killing Thomas, and so they secretly went to Canterbury\"<ref name=introibo/>\nThomas is shown mitred and enthroned, with his feet on a stool.

He then made him Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, hoping he would submit the church to state power, but Thomas took the opposite course and was exiled to France, where he spent several long stays in Chartres, accompanied by his friend and secretary [[John of Salisbury]], who in 1176 became [[Bishop of Chartres]]<ref name=CC>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.vitraux-chartres.fr/vitraux/18_vitrail_vie_st_thomas_becket/index.htm Vie de Saint Thomas Becket], vitrail 18, [http://www.cathedrale-chartres.fr/ La Cath\u00e9drale de Chartres].</ref>. In the meantime Thomas was murdered in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by four of the king's knights in 1170 and canonised only three years later.\n\nThe window was made only fifty years after Becket's exile and martyrdom, during the final years of [[Philip II Augustus]]'s reign, which also saw the struggle against local powers giving rise to the [[Kingdom of France]]. This gave a contemporary French resonance to the window's portrayal of Becket resisting a 'bad king' interfering in the Church, whereas a 'good king' should protect the Church<ref name=CC/> - Philip had ejected [[Odo of Sully]] as archbishop of Paris after the latter spoke against Philip's divorce, but Odo placed the kingdom under [[interdict]].\n\n==Differences==\nThe window's composition is very different to others at Chartres<ref name=CC/>, in which the main subject's story was told uninterrupted from bottom to top. That of Becket shows the saint's exile in the first main circle on the bottom two registers, whilst the third register shows the donors in an unusually high position (they were usually shown at the base and sides of the lowest register). \n\nThe main hagiography of Becket only begins in the fourth register onwards, with a halo only added on his deathbed after his martyrdom, though the exile images also show him with a halo. These anomalies suggest that the first main circle should be read as an independent narrative and a specific memorial to his visit to Chartres, perhaps even drawing on accounts of him by those who saw him there.

Thomas is shown with a halo in episcopal vestments with his episcopal mitre and cross. \n\nHis exile followed Henry II's promulgation on 30 January 1164 of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], a collection of juridicial procedures controlling the election of new prelates and gave royal courts the right to summon clergy. Becket was the only one to refuse to sign them and - accused of opposing royal authority - he decided to go into exile.\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -01a.jpg|350px]] \n|---\n|| '''1b : Exile of Thomas Becket's Family and Friends''' :\nContinuing 1a, it shows two men with clubs herding three men, a woman with a 'touret' hairstyle and two children before them. The first man in the centre carries a rectangular shape, possibly a book or a jewel-box. The treatment of the children's heads is unclear - one may be resting its head on the shoulder of another figure or the piece of glass may have been mis-assembled. The representation suggests an explusion by force as a criticism of Henry, whereas in reality Thomas willingly chose exile.\n\n:\"all the saint's friends and family, without distinction of condition or fortune, dignity or order, age or sex, were exiled like him\" (from the collected Chartres liturgies \u2014 ''actus ergo in exilium'')<ref name=CC/>.\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -01b.jpg|350px]] \n|---\n|| '''2a : Thomas Becket Meets Louis VII''' :\n\nThe collection of liturgies at Chartres states that Thomas disembarked at [[Wissant]], a village to the south-west of [[Calais]] on the [[C\u00f4te d'Opale]] and that he that during his subsequent journey to [[Sens]] he met [[Louis VII of France]] at [[Soissons]] and talked amicably with him<ref name=CC/>. The panel shows Thomas with his episcopal mitre, vestments and cross at the centre and Louis with his crown and sceptre, contrasting his good kingship with Henry's bad kingship in trying to impose his will on the Church.\n\nTo the left, behind Thomas, is a [[tonsure]]d clergyman holding something in his right hand, possibly a gospel (attribute of a bishop, whose main mission was to evangelise) and making what seems to be the sign of peace with his left hand.

Behind the mitred Thomas is an [[alb]]ed clerk, again carrying a gospel.

Their hand gestures show that they are in discussio - Alexander points an accusing finger at Thomas with his left hand, whilst Thomas protests with his right hand.

The red panel is for once not an opening but represents the king's warrior role, in contrast to the praying role of the clergymen, represented by a blue background. The king's sceptre is over-large and more resembles a herald's [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]], underlining his role as bearer of diplomatic messages.\n\nFinally, on 22 July 1170, a patched-up peace was made between Thomas and Henry at [[Fr\u00e9teval]], allowing the archbishop to return to England.

However, that coronation occurred on 14 June 1170, long before Thomas' return to England, leading him to excommunicate the Archbishop of York and the Bishops of London and Salisbury who had taken part<ref name=CCSG/>.

This latter interpretation would make the middle figures two of the four knights. Whichever interpretation is correct, panels 8a and 8b both show the leading English clergy's role in the tensions, with Henry II refusing to receive Thomas but welcoming the excommunicated bishops.\n\n|| [[File:Chartres 18 -08b.jpg|350px]] \n\n|-\n|| '''9a : Four Knights Menace Thomas''' :\n:\"These words of the king made some detestable hangers-on believe they would give great pleasure to the king by killing Thomas, and so they secretly went to Canterbury\"<ref name=introibo/>\nThomas is shown mitred and enthroned, with his feet on a stool.

Most modern chronologies are based on the work of [[E. K. Chambers|E.K. Chambers]] in \"The Problem of Chronology\" (1930), published in his book ''William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, Vol. I''.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSince the surviving evidence is fragmentary, there is not, neither can there be a definitive or precise chronology. Performance history is often of limited use, as the first recorded performance of many plays was not necessarily when that play was first performed. For example, the first recorded performance of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was not until 1662, yet we know the play was performed in Shakespeare's lifetime.<ref name=\"Levinson 70-71\">{{cite book | editor-last=Levenson| editor-first=Jill L. | title=Romeo and Juliet | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=70\u201371 | isbn=978-0-19-953589-7}}</ref> Thus,  performance history reveals little about the date of composition.\n\nSimilarly, dates of first publication are often relatively useless in determining a chronology, as roughly half the plays were not published until seven years after Shakespeare's death, in the ''[[First Folio]]'' (1623), prepared by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], and published by [[Edward Blount]], [[William Jaggard]] and Isaac Jaggard. Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published. For example, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' was performed in 1592, but not published until 1594, ''[[Othello]]'' was performed in 1604 but not published until 1622, ''[[King Lear]]'' was performed in 1606 but not published until 1608.

This dramatic improvement in his writing is attributed to his absorbing the lessons of [[Senecan tragedy]] when composing ''Titus'', which he was then able to incorporate into ''Richard''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mincoff | first=Marco | authorlink=Marco Mincoff | title=Shakespeare: The First Steps | location=Sofia | publisher=Bulgarian Academy of Sciences | year=1976 | pages=110\u2013137}}</ref> Additionally, in his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues that the play may originally have been written for [[Lord Strange's Men]], but Shakespeare added some new material after it had passed to [[Pembroke's Men]], a company which formed in mid-1592 and disbanded in September 1593. The patron of Strange's Men was [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], a direct descent of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]], a major character in the play. However Shakespeare altered much of his source material (Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''History of King Richard III'') regarding this character, presenting him as far more heroic and honourable than does More. For example, Shakespeare has Thomas lead a battalion against Richard at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], when it was in fact his brother [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William]] who led them. This suggests Shakespeare was writing with Ferdinando in mind, knowingly praising the ancestor of the company's patron. However, the play also takes the time to praise the ancestors of the patron of Pembroke's Men, [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]. Prior to the Battle of Bosworth, a list of names of lords who have joined [[Henry VII of England|Richmond]]'s cause is read aloud, two of whom are \"Sir Walter Herbert, a renown'd soldier\" (4.5.9) and \"redoubted [[William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]]\" (4.5.11). This passage is completely extraneous to the rest of the plot, is almost always cut in performance and has been argued to be an addition to the original composition. Pembroke is later mentioned by Richmond, who asks for him to be sent to his tent to consult on the eve of battle (5.4.5-8), a request never mentioned again. Additionally, in Q1, Richmond is flanked by \"three lords\" in 5.2, but in F1, the lords are all named, one of whom is the previously mentioned Walter Herbert. Both the request for Pembroke, which is subsequently forgotten, and the change of the anonymous lord to a specific historical individual suggest addition after initial composition. Jowett argues that coupled with the narratively vital praise of Stanley's ancestor, the less integrated references to Herbert and Pembroke create something of a hypothetical internal chronology of composition in which Shakespeare initially writes the play for Strange's Men, but, perhaps due to the closing of the theatres in June 1592, the play passes to Pembroke's Men for a regional tour, at which point he adds the lines praising the ancestors of the new company in whose hands the play has now found itself.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Tragedy of King Richard III | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 5\u20137] | isbn=978-0-19-953588-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' (1592\u20131593) ===\n[[File:Edward the third title page.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1596 quarto of ''Edward III'']]\n:'''''First official record''''': entered into the Stationers' Register by Cuthbert Burby on 1 December 1595 as \"a booke intituled Edward the Third and the blacke prince their warres w{{sup|th}} kinge Iohn of Fraunce.\"\n:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1596 as ''The Raigne Of King Edvvard the third'' (printed anonymously for Burby).

Giorgio Melchiori believes the connection to Pembroke's Men can help date the play. All of the Shakespearean plays performed by Pembroke's Men are pre-plague; ''Taming of the Shrew'', ''The Contention'', ''True Tragedy'', ''Titus'' and ''Richard III''. These plays all feature relatively large casts, with an emphasis on platforms, at least two doors and an upper stage. ''Edward III'', however, needs only ten adult actors and one boy (the most cast intensive scene is 5.1). Battle scenes are also muted, especially when compared to ''True Tragedy'' or ''Richard III'', and the siege scene (4.2) requires no doors or upper stage. The conclusion reached by Melchiori regarding this evidence is that the writer(s) of the play were unsure where it was going to be staged, and therefore wrote it in such a way that it could be adequately staged by a small company performing on a basic stage. This would suggest it was written during the closure of the theatres, which places the date of composition sometime between mid-1592 and late 1593.<ref>{{cite book | last=Slater | first=Eliot | title=The Problem of The Reign of King Edward III: A Statistical Approach | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1988 | pages=80\u2013101 | isbn=978-0-521-12348-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=King Edward III | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=6\u20139 | isbn=978-0-521-59673-2}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' (1594) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': Francis Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'' (1598), referred to as \"''Errors''.\"\n:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': probably on [[Massacre of the Innocents|Innocents Day]], 28 December 1594, at [[Gray's Inn]] (one of the four London [[Inns of Court]]).

These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career when he was experimenting with rhyming [[iambic pentameter]] as an alternative form to standard blank verse; ''Richard II'' has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), ''Romeo and Juliet'' more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and ''Love's Labour's'' and ''Midsummer Night'' more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively).<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Harbage | editor-first=Alfred | editor-link=Alfred Harbage | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Penguin | year=1973 | edition=Revised | series=The Pelican Shakespeare | origyear=1963 | page=31}}</ref> All four tend to be dated to the period 1594\u20131595.<ref name=\"Woudhuysen 60\">{{cite book | editor-last=Woudhuysen | editor-first=H.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Thomas Nelson | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=1998 | page=60 | isbn=978-1-904271-10-9}}</ref> In support of this, [[Ants Oras]]' pause test places the play after ''Richard III'', which is usually dated 1592.

One is in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', the other is a fragment of [[Christopher Hunt]]'s inventory, listing sixteen \"ludes and tragedyes\" sold from 9 to 17 August 1603. The list includes four Shakespearean plays; ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''The Taming of a Shrew'', ''Love's Labour's Lost'', and ''Love's Labour's Won''. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of [[Thomas Gataker]]'s ''Certaine Sermones''. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 in ''Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won''. Baldwin argues that the title of the play suggests it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost'', which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play (the main characters all vow to meet again in a year's time). However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', which was originally performed with the title ''All is True''. As Meres refers to ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona'', ''The Comedy of Errors'' and ''The Merchant of Venice'', prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was ''The Taming of the Shrew'', but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be ''Love's Labour's Won''. ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' have also been cited as possibilities, with ''All's Well'' the most favoured. However, these plays all tend to be dated later than 1598 (although the argument is that ''Love's Labour's Won'' is an early draft). As there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=81\u201383 | isbn=978-0-19-953681-8}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the play's position in the chronology is based purely on the speculation that it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost''.<ref name=\"Taylor 117\" />\n\n=== ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' (1595) ===\n[[File:Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|''[[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]]'', by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]] (1596).

This is thought to refer to the ''San Andr\u00e9s'', a Spanish [[galleon]] that ran aground in [[C\u00e1diz]] in June 1596 after a surprise attack under the command of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. The ship was subsequently captured, renamed the ''St. Andrew'' and incorporated into the [[Royal Navy]]. However, she remained in the news throughout 1596. Upon arriving in England, she nearly ran aground on the [[Thames Estuary]]. In August, she served as a [[troopship]] during the [[Islands Voyage]], and upon returning to a stormy England in October, Essex refused to allow her to sail past the [[Goodwin Sands]], a location also referred to by Salarino (3.1.4-5).

''1 Henry IV'' was definitely written by early 1597. ''Henry V'' was completed by September 1599. ''2 Henry IV'' was written at some point between these two. Exactly where ''Merry Wives'' fits into the sequence is unknown, but attempts to date the composition of the play by locating the plot within the overall ''Henriad'' have proved fruitless. The plot of ''Merry Wives'' does not fit into the plot of the ''Henriad'' in any chronological or logical sense; there are continuity problems no matter where in the sequence one locates the play. For example, Falstaff and [[Mistress Quickly]] don't know one another at the start of ''Merry Wives'', whereas in ''1 Henry IV'', they have known one another for over thirty years.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Craik | editor-first=T.W. | title=The Merry Wives of Windsor | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=11\u201312 | isbn=978-0-19-953682-5}}</ref> John Jowett, editor of the play for the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'', argues it is not supposed to fit into the ''Henriad'' at all, it is \"essentially an [[Shakespearean comedy|Elizabethan comedy]], the only one that Shakespeare set firmly in England.

Hotson believes the play was commissioned for the Feast by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, who had recently succeeded his father as patron of Shakespeare's Lord Chamberlain's Men and was to be one of the newly elected knights.

There is some tentative evidence to narrow the date further, however. For example, the fact that Falstaff seems to have been called Falstaff from the very inception of ''2 Henry IV'' would suggest the play was written after the censoring of ''1 Henry IV'' in 1596/1597.<ref name=\"Richard James\" /> The fact that the 25 February 1598 Stationers' Register entry for ''1 Henry IV'' does not identity it as the first part of a two-part play has led some scholars to speculate that ''2 Henry IV'' could not have been completed by that date.<ref name=\"Taylor 120\" /> There is also a reference to the character of Justice Shallow in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', which was first acted in 1599, indicating the play was well enough known by then for an audience to understand the allusion. All of this seems to place the date of composition as somewhere in late 1597/early 1598.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=The Second Part of King Henry IV | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2007 | edition=Revised | origyear=1989 | page=3 | isbn=978-0-521-68950-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Weis | editor-first=Ren\u00e9 | title=Henry IV, Part 2 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1997 | pages=8\u201316 | isbn=978-0-19-953713-6}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1598\u20131599) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': mentioned in the Stationers' Register on a [[Book design#Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket|flyleaf]] dated 4 August 1600 as \"The c\u014dmedie of muche A doo about nothinge.\" Grouped with ''Henry V'', ''As You Like It'' and Ben Jonson's ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' under the heading \"to be staied.\" Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of \"to be staied\" is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain's Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed.<ref name=\"McEachern\">{{cite book | editor-last=McEachern | editor-first=Claire | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=125\u2013126 | isbn=978-1-903436-83-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Mares 41-42\">{{cite book | editor-last=Mares | editor-first=F.H. | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1988 | pages=41\u201342 | isbn=978-0-521-53250-1}}</ref> The play was formally entered into the Register by Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August as \"Muche a Doo about nothing.\" Jointly entered with ''2 Henry IV''.<ref name=\"Humphries xi\" />\n:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1600 as ''Much adoe about Nothing'' (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': on or around 14 February 1613, when the play was performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elzabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine.<ref name=\"Mares 10\">{{cite book | editor-last=Mares | editor-first=F.H. | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1988 | page=10 | isbn=978-0-521-53250-1}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the play is not mentioned in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', which tentatively suggests it had not been performed by September 1598.

The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the ''[[Red Dragon (1595)|Red Dragon]]'', anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall's ''Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496\u20131631'' (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain [[William Keeling]], who was in charge of three ships sponsored by the [[East India Company]] that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The ''Red Dragon'', Keeling's flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed ''Hamlet'' on the nights of 5 September and \"31 September\" (presumably 1 October), and ''Richard II'' on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling's journal entry. Prior to Rundall's book, Keeling's journal had been published in 1625, but the references to ''Hamlet'' and ''Richard II'' were not included by the editor, [[Samuel Purchas]]. In his 1898 book, ''Life of Shakespeare'', [[Sidney Lee]] claimed the entire ''Red Dragon'' episode was probably a forgery by [[John Payne Collier]], and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship's crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. However, [[William Foster (historiographer)|William Foster]] pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant pages, and he countered Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=53\u201355 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}</ref> The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Red Dragon in Sierra Leone | editor1-last=Kamps | editor1-first=Ivo | editor2-last=Singh | editor2-first=Jyotsna | title=Travel Knowledge: European \"Discoveries\" in the Early Modern Period | location=Basingstoke | publisher=Palgrave | pages=211\u2013222 | isbn=978-0-312-22299-4}}</ref> The earliest recorded performance of the play in England took place at court over Christmas 1619.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | page=97 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Hamlet Q1 Frontispiece 1603.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1603 quarto of ''Hamlet'']]\n:'''''Evidence''''': because the three versions of ''Hamlet'' which appeared in 1603, 1604/1605 and 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult.

For example, he cites the substitution of the name \"Montano\" for \"Reynaldo.\" Montano occurs in no other play except ''Othello'', and Honigmann believes the actor who worked on ''Hamlet'' Q1 played Reynaldo, but had played Montano in an earlier production of ''Othello'', and unconsciously mixed up the names.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

Often cited as immature were Helen's discussion about virginity in 1.1 and the [[Couplet|rhyming couplets]] in 2.1 and 2.2.

The publication of ''Leir'' in 1605 is often taken as evidence that Shakespeare's ''Lear'' was on stage by 1605. ''Leir'' was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 May 1594, but had already been staged, and is usually dated to ''c.''1590. There is no evidence it was ever published prior to 1605, and its sudden appearance in print over ten years after its composition could represent evidence of an attempt to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's newly released play.<ref name=\"Halio 1-2\">{{cite book | editor-last=Halio | editor-first=Jay L. | title=The Tragedy of King Lear | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2005 | edition=Revised | origyear=1992 | pages=1\u20132 | isbn=978-0-521-61263-0}}</ref> On the other hand, in his 1997 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, [[R. A. Foakes|R.A. Foakes]] argues the 1605 publication of ''Leir'' inspired Shakespeare to write his own version of the story. There is little doubt that Shakespeare used ''Leir'' as a source, and Foakes' believes that some of the parallels are too specific to represent Shakespeare's remembrance of a performance, rather he must have been working with a printed copy. Foakes also argues that the title page of Q1 specifically recalls the title page of the 1605 ''Leir'' to \"alert\" readers to the fact that Shakespeare's version is based on the older version, but is much improved. For example, this explains the reference to Edgar and Gloucester on the title page. These characters are not in ''Leir'', and their inclusion in the title of Q1 serves as an advertisement that Shakespeare's version of the story is more complex than ''Leir''.

In 1603, Annesley's eldest daughter, Grace, tried to have him declared a lunatic so she would be placed in charge of his estate. She seems to have been supported in this by her husband (Sir John Wildgose), her sister (Christian) and her brother-in-law (William Sandys). However, Annesley's youngest daughter, Cordell, wrote to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury for help, and successfully blocked Grace's plan. Annesley died in July 1604, and most of his estate was left to Cordell. Whether or not Shakespeare knew about the case is unknown, but if he did, it provides more evidence for a date of composition in the period 1604\u20131606.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Foakes | editor-first=R.A. | editor-link=R.

A possible ''terminus ante quem'' is 1608. In his 2004 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues the lack of act divisions in the ''Folio'' text is an important factor in determining a date. The King's Men only began to use act divisions in their scripts when they occupied the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608 as their winter playhouse. ''Timon'' is notoriously difficult to divide into acts, suggesting to Jowett that it was written at a time when act divisions were of no concern to the writer, hence it must have been written prior to August 1608.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Life of Timon of Athens | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2004 | page=4 | isbn=978-0-19-953744-0}}</ref> A ''terminus post quem'' may come from a possible topical allusion to the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of November 1605; \"those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire\" (Sc.7.32-33<ref>John Jowett's 2004 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare does not divide the play into acts.

Although the collaboration theory dates back to at least 1709 (Nicholas Rowe's ''The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare''), the theory of Wilkins' involvement originated in 1868, suggested by [[Nicolaus Delius]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=A Reconstructed Text of Pericles, Prince of Tyre | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2003 | page=62 | isbn=978-0-19-953683-2}}</ref> Wilkins status as co-author is generally accepted by modern scholars, and Delius' original breakdown of scenes remains the most widely agreed upon; Wilkins worked on scenes 1-9 and Shakespeare on scenes 10-22.<ref name=\"Taylor 130\" /> However, because the 1609 quarto is so badly corrupted and generally regarded as a poorly constructed memorial reconstruction,<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 1059] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 }}</ref> there is no complete agreement as to the motives or mechanism of the collaboration, with some scholars arguing for Shakespeare as sole author. For example, in their 1998 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Doreen Delvecchio and Anthony Hammond reject the theory of co-authorship, arguing that the problems inherent in the text arise not because of collaborative writing, but because of especially poor memorial reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Delvecchio | editor1-first=Doreen | editor2-last=Hammond | editor2-first=Anthony | title=Pericles, Prince of Type | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=197\u2013210 | isbn=978-0-521-29710-3}}</ref> On the other hand, in his 2002 book ''Shakespeare, Co-Author'', Brian Vickers is highly critical of Delvecchio and Hammond's analysis, arguing that co-authorship of the play is a virtual certainty.<ref>{{cite book | last=Vickers | first=Brian | authorlink=Brian Vickers | title=Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002 | pages=291\u2013332 | isbn=978-0-19-926916-7}}</ref> Similarly, in 2003 book, ''Defining Shakespeare'', MacDonald P.

In fact, some scholars consider Wilkins' prose version to be a more accurate record of the original script than the 1609 quarto, and several modern editors have incorporated passages from Wilkins' prose into the play text, such as Roger Warren's 2003 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, based on a text prepared by Gary Taylor and MacDonald P. Jackson, or the version in the 2nd edition of the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'' (2005), edited by Taylor. Stylistic analysis places the play in the period of 1607\u20131608. A rare word test of scenes 10-22 place them closest to ''The Tempest'', whereas a rare word test of scenes 1-9 place them closest to ''1 Henry IV''. If Shakespeare wrote 10-22, the proximity to ''The Tempest'' makes sense. If Wilkins wrote 1-9, Gary Taylor has suggested that due to the immense popularity of ''1 Henry IV'', Wilkins may have read it during composition in an effort to write in a Shakespearean manner. Ants Oras' pause test places scenes 10-22 closest to ''Macbeth'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra''.<ref name=\"Taylor 130\" /> Taken together, the stylistic evidence, the 1608 Stationers' Register entry, Wilkins' 1608 prose version, the 1608 performance seen by Giustinian, and the 1609 quarto, all serve to suggest a date of composition of 1607 or very early 1608.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barroll | first=J.

''Philaster'' and ''Cymbeline'' have strong verbal and tonal parallels, and both feature a broadly similar plot. Scholars are in general agreement that the plays were written around the same period, and that one influenced the other. The direction of influence, however, is not certain. If Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by ''Cymbeline'', they must have seen it in performance. However, the theatres were closed until at least December 1609, meaning the play could not have been staged until early 1610. ''Philaster'' was read in MS by John Davies in October 1610, so if ''Philaster'' was influenced by ''Cymbeline'', it must have been written in the first half of 1610.<ref name=\"Taylor 132\">{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}</ref> However, this contradicts Andrew Gurr's evidence that ''Philaster'' was written in late 1609.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Gurr | editor-first=Andrew | editor-link=Andrew Gurr | title=Philaster Or, Love Lies a-Bleeding | location=Manchester | publisher=Manchester University Press | series=The Revels Plays | year=2003 | origyear=1969 | edition=Revised | page=xxvi-xxix | isbn=978-0-7190-6485-2}}</ref> On the other hand, Shakespeare would have had access to the ''Philaster'' MS, making it more likely that ''Philaster'' preceded ''Cymbeline''.

As Heywood commonly borrowed from Shakespeare's work, the likely explanation here is that ''Cymbeline'' preceded ''Golden Age''. However, the date of ''Golden Age'' is uncertain. It was published in 1611, but there is some evidence it may have been written in late 1610.

Warren argues that the play was performed at court during the [[investiture]] of James' eldest son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]] as [[Prince of Wales]], which ran from 31 May to 6 June. Central to the celebrations was Samuel Daniels' ''Tethys' Festival'', which foregrounded [[Milford Haven]] as the \"port of union\" where Henry's ancestor Henry Tudor had landed to face Richard III. Milford is similarly foregrounded in ''Cymbeline'', which also deals with the iconography and cultural significance of Welshness, providing a correlation between the geography of the play and the politics of the period.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=Cymbeline | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=64\u201365 | isbn=978-0-19-953650-4}}</ref> In his 2005 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Martin Butler, citing much of the same evidence as Warren (although he is unconvinced by the connection with ''Golden Age''), agrees with a date of mid-1610.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Butler | editor-first=Martin | title=Cymbeline | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2012 | edition=Revised | origyear=2005 | page=5 | isbn=978-0-521-29694-6}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[The Tempest]]'' (1610\u20131611) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 1 November 1611.\n:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 1 November 1611, performed by the King's Men.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Tempest | url=https://archive.org/details/tempest00will | url-access=registration | editor-last=Orgel | editor-first=Stephen | editor-link=Stephen Orgel | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1987 | page=[https://archive.org/details/tempest00will/page/62 62] | isbn=978-0-19-812917-2}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the date of ''The Tempest'' can be securely fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, it must have been completed before November, and it is unlikely that the Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The ''terminus post quem'' of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda.

Most modern chronologies are based on the work of [[E. K. Chambers|E.K. Chambers]] in \"The Problem of Chronology\" (1930), published in his book ''William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, Vol. I''.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSince the surviving evidence is fragmentary, there is not, neither can there be a definitive or precise chronology. Performance history is often of limited use, as the first recorded performance of many plays was not necessarily when that play was first performed. For example, the first recorded performance of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was not until 1662, yet we know the play was performed in Shakespeare's lifetime.<ref name=\"Levinson 70-71\">{{cite book | editor-last=Levenson| editor-first=Jill L. | title=Romeo and Juliet | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=70\u201371 | isbn=978-0-19-953589-7}}</ref> Thus,  performance history reveals little about the date of composition.\n\nSimilarly, dates of first publication are often relatively useless in determining a chronology, as roughly half the plays were not published until seven years after Shakespeare's death, in the ''[[First Folio]]'' (1623), prepared by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], and published by [[Edward Blount]], [[William Jaggard]] and Isaac Jaggard. Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published. For example, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' was performed in 1592, but not published until 1594, ''[[Othello]]'' was performed in 1604 but not published until 1622, ''[[King Lear]]'' was performed in 1606 but not published until 1608. Performance and publication dates can thus be used only to determine terminal dates of composition, with the initial dates often remaining so much more speculative.<ref>{{cite book | last=Chambers | first=E.K. | authorlink=E.

A notable scholar to do so is [[E. A. J. Honigmann]], who has attempted to push back the beginning of Shakespeare's career four or five years to the mid-1580s, with his \"early start\" theory. Honigmann argues that Shakespeare began his career with ''Titus Andronicus'' in 1586 (the conventional school of thought is that Shakespeare began writing plays upon arriving in London ''c.''1590).<ref>{{cite book | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

This dramatic improvement in his writing is attributed to his absorbing the lessons of [[Senecan tragedy]] when composing ''Titus'', which he was then able to incorporate into ''Richard''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mincoff | first=Marco | authorlink=Marco Mincoff | title=Shakespeare: The First Steps | location=Sofia | publisher=Bulgarian Academy of Sciences | year=1976 | pages=110\u2013137}}</ref> Additionally, in his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues that the play may originally have been written for [[Lord Strange's Men]], but Shakespeare added some new material after it had passed to [[Pembroke's Men]], a company which formed in mid-1592 and disbanded in September 1593. The patron of Strange's Men was [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], a direct descent of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]], a major character in the play. However Shakespeare altered much of his source material (Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''History of King Richard III'') regarding this character, presenting him as far more heroic and honourable than does More. For example, Shakespeare has Thomas lead a battalion against Richard at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], when it was in fact his brother [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William]] who led them. This suggests Shakespeare was writing with Ferdinando in mind, knowingly praising the ancestor of the company's patron. However, the play also takes the time to praise the ancestors of the patron of Pembroke's Men, [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]. Prior to the Battle of Bosworth, a list of names of lords who have joined [[Henry VII of England|Richmond]]'s cause is read aloud, two of whom are \"Sir Walter Herbert, a renown'd soldier\" (4.5.9) and \"redoubted [[William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]]\" (4.5.11). This passage is completely extraneous to the rest of the plot, is almost always cut in performance and has been argued to be an addition to the original composition. Pembroke is later mentioned by Richmond, who asks for him to be sent to his tent to consult on the eve of battle (5.4.5-8), a request never mentioned again. Additionally, in Q1, Richmond is flanked by \"three lords\" in 5.2, but in F1, the lords are all named, one of whom is the previously mentioned Walter Herbert. Both the request for Pembroke, which is subsequently forgotten, and the change of the anonymous lord to a specific historical individual suggest addition after initial composition. Jowett argues that coupled with the narratively vital praise of Stanley's ancestor, the less integrated references to Herbert and Pembroke create something of a hypothetical internal chronology of composition in which Shakespeare initially writes the play for Strange's Men, but, perhaps due to the closing of the theatres in June 1592, the play passes to Pembroke's Men for a regional tour, at which point he adds the lines praising the ancestors of the new company in whose hands the play has now found itself.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Tragedy of King Richard III | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 5\u20137] | isbn=978-0-19-953588-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' (1592\u20131593) ===\n[[File:Edward the third title page.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1596 quarto of ''Edward III'']]\n:'''''First official record''''': entered into the Stationers' Register by Cuthbert Burby on 1 December 1595 as \"a booke intituled Edward the Third and the blacke prince their warres w{{sup|th}} kinge Iohn of Fraunce.\"\n:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1596 as ''The Raigne Of King Edvvard the third'' (printed anonymously for Burby).

Giorgio Melchiori believes the connection to Pembroke's Men can help date the play. All of the Shakespearean plays performed by Pembroke's Men are pre-plague; ''Taming of the Shrew'', ''The Contention'', ''True Tragedy'', ''Titus'' and ''Richard III''. These plays all feature relatively large casts, with an emphasis on platforms, at least two doors and an upper stage. ''Edward III'', however, needs only ten adult actors and one boy (the most cast intensive scene is 5.1). Battle scenes are also muted, especially when compared to ''True Tragedy'' or ''Richard III'', and the siege scene (4.2) requires no doors or upper stage. The conclusion reached by Melchiori regarding this evidence is that the writer(s) of the play were unsure where it was going to be staged, and therefore wrote it in such a way that it could be adequately staged by a small company performing on a basic stage. This would suggest it was written during the closure of the theatres, which places the date of composition sometime between mid-1592 and late 1593.<ref>{{cite book | last=Slater | first=Eliot | title=The Problem of The Reign of King Edward III: A Statistical Approach | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1988 | pages=80\u2013101 | isbn=978-0-521-12348-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=King Edward III | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=6\u20139 | isbn=978-0-521-59673-2}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' (1594) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': Francis Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'' (1598), referred to as \"''Errors''.\"\n:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': probably on [[Massacre of the Innocents|Innocents Day]], 28 December 1594, at [[Gray's Inn]] (one of the four London [[Inns of Court]]).

These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career when he was experimenting with rhyming [[iambic pentameter]] as an alternative form to standard blank verse; ''Richard II'' has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), ''Romeo and Juliet'' more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and ''Love's Labour's'' and ''Midsummer Night'' more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively).<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Harbage | editor-first=Alfred | editor-link=Alfred Harbage | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Penguin | year=1973 | edition=Revised | series=The Pelican Shakespeare | origyear=1963 | page=31}}</ref> All four tend to be dated to the period 1594\u20131595.<ref name=\"Woudhuysen 60\">{{cite book | editor-last=Woudhuysen | editor-first=H.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Thomas Nelson | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=1998 | page=60 | isbn=978-1-904271-10-9}}</ref> In support of this, [[Ants Oras]]' pause test places the play after ''Richard III'', which is usually dated 1592.

One is in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', the other is a fragment of [[Christopher Hunt]]'s inventory, listing sixteen \"ludes and tragedyes\" sold from 9 to 17 August 1603. The list includes four Shakespearean plays; ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''The Taming of a Shrew'', ''Love's Labour's Lost'', and ''Love's Labour's Won''. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of [[Thomas Gataker]]'s ''Certaine Sermones''. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 in ''Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won''. Baldwin argues that the title of the play suggests it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost'', which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play (the main characters all vow to meet again in a year's time). However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', which was originally performed with the title ''All is True''. As Meres refers to ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona'', ''The Comedy of Errors'' and ''The Merchant of Venice'', prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was ''The Taming of the Shrew'', but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be ''Love's Labour's Won''. ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' have also been cited as possibilities, with ''All's Well'' the most favoured. However, these plays all tend to be dated later than 1598 (although the argument is that ''Love's Labour's Won'' is an early draft). As there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=81\u201383 | isbn=978-0-19-953681-8}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the play's position in the chronology is based purely on the speculation that it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost''.<ref name=\"Taylor 117\" />\n\n=== ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' (1595) ===\n[[File:Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|''[[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]]'', by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]] (1596).

This is thought to refer to the ''San Andr\u00e9s'', a Spanish [[galleon]] that ran aground in [[C\u00e1diz]] in June 1596 after a surprise attack under the command of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. The ship was subsequently captured, renamed the ''St. Andrew'' and incorporated into the [[Royal Navy]]. However, she remained in the news throughout 1596. Upon arriving in England, she nearly ran aground on the [[Thames Estuary]]. In August, she served as a [[troopship]] during the [[Islands Voyage]], and upon returning to a stormy England in October, Essex refused to allow her to sail past the [[Goodwin Sands]], a location also referred to by Salarino (3.1.4-5).

''1 Henry IV'' was definitely written by early 1597. ''Henry V'' was completed by September 1599. ''2 Henry IV'' was written at some point between these two. Exactly where ''Merry Wives'' fits into the sequence is unknown, but attempts to date the composition of the play by locating the plot within the overall ''Henriad'' have proved fruitless. The plot of ''Merry Wives'' does not fit into the plot of the ''Henriad'' in any chronological or logical sense; there are continuity problems no matter where in the sequence one locates the play. For example, Falstaff and [[Mistress Quickly]] don't know one another at the start of ''Merry Wives'', whereas in ''1 Henry IV'', they have known one another for over thirty years.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Craik | editor-first=T.W. | title=The Merry Wives of Windsor | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=11\u201312 | isbn=978-0-19-953682-5}}</ref> John Jowett, editor of the play for the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'', argues it is not supposed to fit into the ''Henriad'' at all, it is \"essentially an [[Shakespearean comedy|Elizabethan comedy]], the only one that Shakespeare set firmly in England.

Hotson believes the play was commissioned for the Feast by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, who had recently succeeded his father as patron of Shakespeare's Lord Chamberlain's Men and was to be one of the newly elected knights.

There is some tentative evidence to narrow the date further, however. For example, the fact that Falstaff seems to have been called Falstaff from the very inception of ''2 Henry IV'' would suggest the play was written after the censoring of ''1 Henry IV'' in 1596/1597.<ref name=\"Richard James\" /> The fact that the 25 February 1598 Stationers' Register entry for ''1 Henry IV'' does not identity it as the first part of a two-part play has led some scholars to speculate that ''2 Henry IV'' could not have been completed by that date.<ref name=\"Taylor 120\" /> There is also a reference to the character of Justice Shallow in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', which was first acted in 1599, indicating the play was well enough known by then for an audience to understand the allusion. All of this seems to place the date of composition as somewhere in late 1597/early 1598.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=The Second Part of King Henry IV | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2007 | edition=Revised | origyear=1989 | page=3 | isbn=978-0-521-68950-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Weis | editor-first=Ren\u00e9 | title=Henry IV, Part 2 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1997 | pages=8\u201316 | isbn=978-0-19-953713-6}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1598\u20131599) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': mentioned in the Stationers' Register on a [[Book design#Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket|flyleaf]] dated 4 August 1600 as \"The c\u014dmedie of muche A doo about nothinge.\" Grouped with ''Henry V'', ''As You Like It'' and Ben Jonson's ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' under the heading \"to be staied.\" Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of \"to be staied\" is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain's Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed.<ref name=\"McEachern\">{{cite book | editor-last=McEachern | editor-first=Claire | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=125\u2013126 | isbn=978-1-903436-83-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Mares 41-42\">{{cite book | editor-last=Mares | editor-first=F.H. | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1988 | pages=41\u201342 | isbn=978-0-521-53250-1}}</ref> The play was formally entered into the Register by Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August as \"Muche a Doo about nothing.\" Jointly entered with ''2 Henry IV''.<ref name=\"Humphries xi\" />\n:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1600 as ''Much adoe about Nothing'' (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': on or around 14 February 1613, when the play was performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elzabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine.<ref name=\"Mares 10\">{{cite book | editor-last=Mares | editor-first=F.H. | title=Much Ado About Nothing | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1988 | page=10 | isbn=978-0-521-53250-1}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the play is not mentioned in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', which tentatively suggests it had not been performed by September 1598.

The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the ''[[Red Dragon (1595)|Red Dragon]]'', anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall's ''Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496\u20131631'' (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain [[William Keeling]], who was in charge of three ships sponsored by the [[East India Company]] that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The ''Red Dragon'', Keeling's flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed ''Hamlet'' on the nights of 5 September and \"31 September\" (presumably 1 October), and ''Richard II'' on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling's journal entry. Prior to Rundall's book, Keeling's journal had been published in 1625, but the references to ''Hamlet'' and ''Richard II'' were not included by the editor, [[Samuel Purchas]]. In his 1898 book, ''Life of Shakespeare'', [[Sidney Lee]] claimed the entire ''Red Dragon'' episode was probably a forgery by [[John Payne Collier]], and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship's crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. However, [[William Foster (historiographer)|William Foster]] pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant pages, and he countered Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=53\u201355 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}</ref> The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Red Dragon in Sierra Leone | editor1-last=Kamps | editor1-first=Ivo | editor2-last=Singh | editor2-first=Jyotsna | title=Travel Knowledge: European \"Discoveries\" in the Early Modern Period | location=Basingstoke | publisher=Palgrave | pages=211\u2013222 | isbn=978-0-312-22299-4}}</ref> The earliest recorded performance of the play in England took place at court over Christmas 1619.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | page=97 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Hamlet Q1 Frontispiece 1603.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1603 quarto of ''Hamlet'']]\n:'''''Evidence''''': because the three versions of ''Hamlet'' which appeared in 1603, 1604/1605 and 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult.

For example, he cites the substitution of the name \"Montano\" for \"Reynaldo.\" Montano occurs in no other play except ''Othello'', and Honigmann believes the actor who worked on ''Hamlet'' Q1 played Reynaldo, but had played Montano in an earlier production of ''Othello'', and unconsciously mixed up the names.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

Often cited as immature were Helen's discussion about virginity in 1.1 and the [[Couplet|rhyming couplets]] in 2.1 and 2.2.

The publication of ''Leir'' in 1605 is often taken as evidence that Shakespeare's ''Lear'' was on stage by 1605. ''Leir'' was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 May 1594, but had already been staged, and is usually dated to ''c.''1590. There is no evidence it was ever published prior to 1605, and its sudden appearance in print over ten years after its composition could represent evidence of an attempt to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's newly released play.<ref name=\"Halio 1-2\">{{cite book | editor-last=Halio | editor-first=Jay L. | title=The Tragedy of King Lear | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2005 | edition=Revised | origyear=1992 | pages=1\u20132 | isbn=978-0-521-61263-0}}</ref> On the other hand, in his 1997 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, [[R. A. Foakes|R.A. Foakes]] argues the 1605 publication of ''Leir'' inspired Shakespeare to write his own version of the story. There is little doubt that Shakespeare used ''Leir'' as a source, and Foakes' believes that some of the parallels are too specific to represent Shakespeare's remembrance of a performance, rather he must have been working with a printed copy. Foakes also argues that the title page of Q1 specifically recalls the title page of the 1605 ''Leir'' to \"alert\" readers to the fact that Shakespeare's version is based on the older version, but is much improved. For example, this explains the reference to Edgar and Gloucester on the title page. These characters are not in ''Leir'', and their inclusion in the title of Q1 serves as an advertisement that Shakespeare's version of the story is more complex than ''Leir''.

In 1603, Annesley's eldest daughter, Grace, tried to have him declared a lunatic so she would be placed in charge of his estate. She seems to have been supported in this by her husband (Sir John Wildgose), her sister (Christian) and her brother-in-law (William Sandys). However, Annesley's youngest daughter, Cordell, wrote to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury for help, and successfully blocked Grace's plan. Annesley died in July 1604, and most of his estate was left to Cordell. Whether or not Shakespeare knew about the case is unknown, but if he did, it provides more evidence for a date of composition in the period 1604\u20131606.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Foakes | editor-first=R.A. | editor-link=R.

A possible ''terminus ante quem'' is 1608. In his 2004 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues the lack of act divisions in the ''Folio'' text is an important factor in determining a date. The King's Men only began to use act divisions in their scripts when they occupied the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608 as their winter playhouse. ''Timon'' is notoriously difficult to divide into acts, suggesting to Jowett that it was written at a time when act divisions were of no concern to the writer, hence it must have been written prior to August 1608.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Life of Timon of Athens | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2004 | page=4 | isbn=978-0-19-953744-0}}</ref> A ''terminus post quem'' may come from a possible topical allusion to the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of November 1605; \"those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire\" (Sc.7.32-33<ref>John Jowett's 2004 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare does not divide the play into acts.

Although the collaboration theory dates back to at least 1709 (Nicholas Rowe's ''The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare''), the theory of Wilkins' involvement originated in 1868, suggested by [[Nicolaus Delius]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=A Reconstructed Text of Pericles, Prince of Tyre | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2003 | page=62 | isbn=978-0-19-953683-2}}</ref> Wilkins status as co-author is generally accepted by modern scholars, and Delius' original breakdown of scenes remains the most widely agreed upon; Wilkins worked on scenes 1-9 and Shakespeare on scenes 10-22.<ref name=\"Taylor 130\" /> However, because the 1609 quarto is so badly corrupted and generally regarded as a poorly constructed memorial reconstruction,<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 1059] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 }}</ref> there is no complete agreement as to the motives or mechanism of the collaboration, with some scholars arguing for Shakespeare as sole author. For example, in their 1998 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Doreen Delvecchio and Anthony Hammond reject the theory of co-authorship, arguing that the problems inherent in the text arise not because of collaborative writing, but because of especially poor memorial reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Delvecchio | editor1-first=Doreen | editor2-last=Hammond | editor2-first=Anthony | title=Pericles, Prince of Type | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=197\u2013210 | isbn=978-0-521-29710-3}}</ref> On the other hand, in his 2002 book ''Shakespeare, Co-Author'', Brian Vickers is highly critical of Delvecchio and Hammond's analysis, arguing that co-authorship of the play is a virtual certainty.<ref>{{cite book | last=Vickers | first=Brian | authorlink=Brian Vickers | title=Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002 | pages=291\u2013332 | isbn=978-0-19-926916-7}}</ref> Similarly, in 2003 book, ''Defining Shakespeare'', MacDonald P.

In fact, some scholars consider Wilkins' prose version to be a more accurate record of the original script than the 1609 quarto, and several modern editors have incorporated passages from Wilkins' prose into the play text, such as Roger Warren's 2003 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, based on a text prepared by Gary Taylor and MacDonald P. Jackson, or the version in the 2nd edition of the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'' (2005), edited by Taylor. Stylistic analysis places the play in the period of 1607\u20131608. A rare word test of scenes 10-22 place them closest to ''The Tempest'', whereas a rare word test of scenes 1-9 place them closest to ''1 Henry IV''. If Shakespeare wrote 10-22, the proximity to ''The Tempest'' makes sense. If Wilkins wrote 1-9, Gary Taylor has suggested that due to the immense popularity of ''1 Henry IV'', Wilkins may have read it during composition in an effort to write in a Shakespearean manner. Ants Oras' pause test places scenes 10-22 closest to ''Macbeth'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra''.<ref name=\"Taylor 130\" /> Taken together, the stylistic evidence, the 1608 Stationers' Register entry, Wilkins' 1608 prose version, the 1608 performance seen by Giustinian, and the 1609 quarto, all serve to suggest a date of composition of 1607 or very early 1608.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barroll | first=J.

''Philaster'' and ''Cymbeline'' have strong verbal and tonal parallels, and both feature a broadly similar plot. Scholars are in general agreement that the plays were written around the same period, and that one influenced the other. The direction of influence, however, is not certain. If Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by ''Cymbeline'', they must have seen it in performance. However, the theatres were closed until at least December 1609, meaning the play could not have been staged until early 1610. ''Philaster'' was read in MS by John Davies in October 1610, so if ''Philaster'' was influenced by ''Cymbeline'', it must have been written in the first half of 1610.<ref name=\"Taylor 132\">{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}</ref> However, this contradicts Andrew Gurr's evidence that ''Philaster'' was written in late 1609.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Gurr | editor-first=Andrew | editor-link=Andrew Gurr | title=Philaster Or, Love Lies a-Bleeding | location=Manchester | publisher=Manchester University Press | series=The Revels Plays | year=2003 | origyear=1969 | edition=Revised | page=xxvi-xxix | isbn=978-0-7190-6485-2}}</ref> On the other hand, Shakespeare would have had access to the ''Philaster'' MS, making it more likely that ''Philaster'' preceded ''Cymbeline''.

As Heywood commonly borrowed from Shakespeare's work, the likely explanation here is that ''Cymbeline'' preceded ''Golden Age''. However, the date of ''Golden Age'' is uncertain. It was published in 1611, but there is some evidence it may have been written in late 1610.

Warren argues that the play was performed at court during the [[investiture]] of James' eldest son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]] as [[Prince of Wales]], which ran from 31 May to 6 June. Central to the celebrations was Samuel Daniels' ''Tethys' Festival'', which foregrounded [[Milford Haven]] as the \"port of union\" where Henry's ancestor Henry Tudor had landed to face Richard III. Milford is similarly foregrounded in ''Cymbeline'', which also deals with the iconography and cultural significance of Welshness, providing a correlation between the geography of the play and the politics of the period.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=Cymbeline | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=64\u201365 | isbn=978-0-19-953650-4}}</ref> In his 2005 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Martin Butler, citing much of the same evidence as Warren (although he is unconvinced by the connection with ''Golden Age''), agrees with a date of mid-1610.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Butler | editor-first=Martin | title=Cymbeline | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2012 | edition=Revised | origyear=2005 | page=5 | isbn=978-0-521-29694-6}}</ref>\n\n=== ''[[The Tempest]]'' (1610\u20131611) ===\n:'''''First official record''''': an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 1 November 1611.\n:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).\n:'''''First recorded performance''''': in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 1 November 1611, performed by the King's Men.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Tempest | url=https://archive.org/details/tempest00will | url-access=registration | editor-last=Orgel | editor-first=Stephen | editor-link=Stephen Orgel | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1987 | page=[https://archive.org/details/tempest00will/page/62 62] | isbn=978-0-19-812917-2}}</ref>\n:'''''Evidence''''': the date of ''The Tempest'' can be securely fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, it must have been completed before November, and it is unlikely that the Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The ''terminus post quem'' of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda.

When one of the robot policemen, known as the Electric Warriors, or Leks, develops self-awareness, it begins to question the correctness of the social order and decides to help the Zigs. This robot is called 9-03, and it falls in love with a Zig crone called Kinsolving, whom he protects from any and all harm.\nHe then helps the Zigs by giving them food and supplies taken from the Elites up above.\n\nAt the same time, a man named Derek Two-Shadow is living in the forest with a tribe of natural born natives called {{Not a typo|Primmies}}. They have rejected all forms of modern technology. A female scholar, Quintana, is sent into the forest to live with the {{Not a typo|Primmies}} and study them. She gets to know Derek Two-Shadow, and learns of his history and life. He was born as a Zig, but escaped to the wilderness when he was still a child. One night, a group of genetic mutants (Genidiots) sneaks into the {{Not a typo|Primmie}} camp to steal food. Quintana is startled to see one, and she shoots and kills three of them with her laser pistol. She did not know that the Genidiots were allowed to steal food in exchange for peace between the two factions. With the killing of the three intruders, the peace is broken and the Genidiots will attack. She offers her weapons to defend the village, but since this goes against the {{Not a typo|Primmie}} principle of rejecting technology, she is told to leave and never come back. \n\nWhen the Leks sent to capture 9-03 learn of Kinsolving's close relationship with 9-03, they decide to kidnap her and take her to headquarters for further questioning. 9-03 storms into the Elite leader's office and demands he release Kinsolving. The leader's name is Magistrate Marder. He agrees to free Kinsolving in exchange for letting his techs examine 9-03 and figure out how he became sentient. 9-03 manages to free Kinsolving, but when a group of gunships sent to pursue them fires a warning shot, 9-03 sees that the shot is going to kill a Zig family. He throws himself in front of the shot and saves the Zigs, but he is blown to pieces. \n\nMagistrate Marder has learned about a fleet of what appear to be alien vessels and wishes to fuse man and machine to create a new breed of Electric Warrior, the Synthoids. He had hoped to duplicate 9-03's autonomy and intelligence, but since that failed, he has the {{Not a typo|Primmies}} rounded up, captured, then taken to the city where they are converted into cyborgs and most of them die from the shock. Two-Shadow, however, is one of the lucky ones: the components of 9-03 are fused to his body after most of it has been amputated. Upon awakening after his surgery, Derek feels the essence of 9-03 within his altered body, escapes, and finds a component of the robot at Kinsolving's home that he uses to flood his body with nanites and merge 9-03's mind with his own; although they retain their independent brain patterns, they can never again be separated.\n\nThe Electric Warrior forces an alliance between the {{Not a typo|Primmies}}, Zigs, Genidiots, and Elites to fight the invasion, but when the \"aliens\" come, they are revealed to be very human \u2013 the Electric Warrior's planet had been an experiment set up to determine how civilizations develop. Derek Two-Shadow was actually a resident of Earth who had signed up for the experiment after discovering that his wife had had herself rendered cybernetically immortal. This disgusted him into leaving her forever due to the fact that the surgery required had left horrible scars on her back and her body had been changed so that they could no longer enjoy a normal physical relationship.

When one of the robot policemen, known as the Electric Warriors, or Leks, develops self-awareness, it begins to question the correctness of the social order and decides to help the Zigs. This robot is called 9-03, and it falls in love with a Zig crone called Kinsolving, whom he protects from any and all harm.\nHe then helps the Zigs by giving them food and supplies taken from the Elites up above.\n\nAt the same time, a man named Derek Two-Shadow is living in the forest with a tribe of natural born natives called {{Not a typo|Primmies}}. They have rejected all forms of modern technology. A female scholar, Quintana, is sent into the forest to live with the {{Not a typo|Primmies}} and study them. She gets to know Derek Two-Shadow, and learns of his history and life. He was born as a Zig, but escaped to the wilderness when he was still a child. One night, a group of genetic mutants (Genidiots) sneaks into the{{Not a typo|Primmie}} camp to steal food. Quintana is startled to see one, and she shoots and kills three of them with her laser pistol. She did not know that the Genidiots were allowed to steal food in exchange for peace between the two factions. With the killing of the three intruders, the peace is broken and the Genidiots will attack. She offers her weapons to defend the village, but since this goes against the {{Not a typo|Primmie}} principle of rejecting technology, she is told to leave and never come back. \n\nWhen the Leks sent to capture 9-03 learn of Kinsolving's close relationship with 9-03, they decide to kidnap her and take her to headquarters for further questioning. 9-03 storms into the Elite leader's office and demands he release Kinsolving. The leader's name is Magistrate Marder. He agrees to free Kinsolving in exchange for letting his techs examine 9-03 and figure out how he became sentient. 9-03 manages to free Kinsolving, but when a group of gunships sent to pursue them fires a warning shot, 9-03 sees that the shot is going to kill a Zig family. He throws himself in front of the shot and saves the Zigs, but he is blown to pieces. \n\nMagistrate Marder has learned about a fleet of what appear to be alien vessels and wishes to fuse man and machine to create a new breed of Electric Warrior, the Synthoids. He had hoped to duplicate 9-03's autonomy and intelligence, but since that failed, he has the {{Not a typo|Primmies}} rounded up, captured, then taken to the city where they are converted into cyborgs and most of them die from the shock. Two-Shadow, however, is one of the lucky ones: the components of 9-03 are fused to his body after most of it has been amputated. Upon awakening after his surgery, Derek feels the essence of 9-03 within his altered body, escapes, and finds a component of the robot at Kinsolving's home that he uses to flood his body with nanites and merge 9-03's mind with his own; although they retain their independent brain patterns, they can never again be separated.\n\nThe Electric Warrior forces an alliance between the {{Not a typo|Primmies}}, Zigs, Genidiots, and Elites to fight the invasion, but when the \"aliens\" come, they are revealed to be very human \u2013 the Electric Warrior's planet had been an experiment set up to determine how civilizations develop. Derek Two-Shadow was actually a resident of Earth who had signed up for the experiment after discovering that his wife had had herself rendered cybernetically immortal. This disgusted him into leaving her forever due to the fact that the surgery required had left horrible scars on her back and her body had been changed so that they could no longer enjoy a normal physical relationship. The Electric Warrior agrees to go back to Earth with the \"aliens\" to give them their experimental data, while the rest of the people remain behind but in a more mutually beneficial and cooperative peace.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{gcdb series|id=3146|title=Electric Warrior}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=title|id=4624|title=''Electric Warrior''}}\n\n\n[[Category:1986 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:1987 comics endings]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Comics by Doug Moench]]\n[[Category:Science fiction comics]]\n[[Category:Dystopian comics]]\n", "name_user": "Sct72", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSummary", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Warrior_(comics)"}

It holds that manna was layered out over 2,000 [[cubit]]s square, between 50 and 60 cubits in height, enough to nourish the Israelites for 2,000 years<ref name=autogenerated3/> and to be seen from the palaces of every king in the East and West.<ref>Yoma 76a</ref> This is probably a metaphorical statement.\n\n===Sabbath===\nAccording to Exodus, [[Shabbat]] (Sabbath) was reinstituted the first week manna appeared.<ref name=autogenerated14>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:23|HE}}</ref> It states that twice as much manna as usual was available on the sixth morning of the week, and none at all could be found on the seventh day;<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:5|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|16:22|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|16:26-27|HE}}</ref> although manna usually rotted and became maggot-infested after a single night,<ref name=autogenerated1/> that which had been collected on the sixth day remained fresh until the second night.<ref name=autogenerated7>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:24|HE}}</ref> Moses stated that the double portion of Preparation Day was to be consumed on Shabbat;<ref name=autogenerated14/> and that [[God]] instructed him that no one should leave his place on Shabbat,<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:27-29|HE}}</ref> so that the people could rest during it.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:30|HE}}</ref>\n\n[[Form critic]]s regard this part of the manna narrative to be spliced together from the Yahwist and Priestly traditions, with the Yahwist tradition emphasizing rest during Shabbat, while the Priestly tradition merely states that Shabbat exists, implying that the meaning of \"Shabbat\" was already known.<ref name=autogenerated5/><ref name=autogenerated13>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', \"Book of Exodus\"</ref> These critics regard this part of the manna narrative as an [[etiology|etiological]] supernature story designed to explain the origin of Shabbat observance, which in reality was probably pre-[[Moses|Mosaic]].<ref name=autogenerated5/>\n\n==Duration of supply==\nExodus states that the Israelites consumed the manna for 40 years, starting from the fifteenth day of the second month ([[Iyar]] 15),<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:1-4|HE}}</ref> but that it then ceased to appear once they had reached a settled land, and once they had reached the borders of Canaan (inhabited by the [[Canaanites]]).<ref name=autogenerated9>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:35|HE}}</ref> Form critics attribute this variation to the view that each expression of the manna ceasing derives from different lore; the \"settled land\" is attributed to the Priestly tradition,<ref name=autogenerated5/><ref name=autogenerated13/> and \"Canaan's borders\" to the Yahwist tradition, or to a hypothetical [[Documentary hypothesis|later redaction]] to synchronize the account with that of the [[Book of Joshua]],<ref name=autogenerated5/><ref name=autogenerated13/> which states that the manna ceased to appear on the day after the annual [[Passover]] festival ([[Nisan 14]]), when the Israelites had reached [[Gilgal]].<ref name=j5>{{bibleverse||Joshua|5:10-12|HE}}</ref> The duration from Iyar 15 to Nisan 14, taken literally, is forty years less one month.\n\nThere is also a disagreement among classical rabbinical writers as to when the manna ceased, particularly in regard to whether it remained after the death of Moses for a further 40 days, 70 days, or 14 years;<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', \"Manna\"</ref> indeed, according to [[Joshua ben Levi]], the manna ceased to appear at the moment that Moses died.<ref name=autogenerated3/>\n\nDespite the eventual termination of the supply of manna, Exodus states that a small amount of it survived within an omer-sized pot or jar, which was kept facing the Testimony (possibly, adjacent to the [[Ark of the Covenant]]);<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:34|HE}}</ref> it indicates that God instructed this of Moses, who delegated it to [[Aaron]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:32-33|HE}}</ref> The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] states that the pot was stored inside the Ark.<ref>{{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:4|KJV}}</ref> Classical rabbinical sources believe the pot was made of [[gold]];
