It was taken over by the Kylsant Royal Mail Company in 1917 and renamed [[Coast Lines]] which by the end of 1917 held all the shares in the B&I.

Air moves upwards at approximately 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph or 55 [[Metre per second|m/s]]), the [[terminal velocity]] of a falling human body belly-downwards. A vertical wind tunnel is frequently called 'indoor skydiving' due to the popularity of vertical wind tunnels among skydivers, who report that the sensation is extremely similar to skydiving.{{Clarify|date=September 2018}}  The human body 'floats' in midair in a vertical wind tunnel, replicating the physics of 'body flight' or '[[bodyflight]]' experienced during [[freefall]].<ref>[http://news.discovery.com/adventure/extreme-sports/what-is-indoor-skydiving-2.htm Discovery News Blog Post about Indoor Skydiving]</ref>\n\n===History===\nThe first human to fly in a vertical wind tunnel was Jack Tiffany in 1964 at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] located in Greene and Montgomery County, Ohio.\n\nIn 1982 Jean St-Germain, an inventor from Drummondville, Quebec,<ref>{{cite news |last=Ha |first=Tu Thanh|date=23 September 2016|title=Jean St-Germain, Quebec\u2019s eccentric inventor of diverse devices |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/obituary-jean-st-germain-quebecs-eccentric-inventor-of-diversedevices/article32040314/| work=The Globe and Mail |location= |access-date= }}</ref> sold a vertical wind tunnel concept to both Les Thompson and Marvin Kratter, both of whom went on to build their own wind tunnels.

The first vertical wind tunnel, built solely for a commercial use, opened in the summer of 1982 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  Later that same year, a second wind tunnel opened in [[Pigeon Forge]], [[Tennessee]].  Both facilities opened and operated under the name of Flyaway Indoor Skydiving. In 2005 the 15-year Flyaway Manager Keith Fields purchased the Las Vegas facility and later renamed it \"Vegas Indoor Skydiving\".\n\nIn the 1990s William Kitchen, an inventor living in Orlando, FL filed patents for a vertical wind tunnel<ref>{{Cite patent|title=Skydiving trainer windtunnel|gdate=1995-03-06|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5655909A/en}}</ref> and founded the US Company \"Sky Venture\" in July 1998.  This tunnel is specifically designed to simulate the free fall skydiving experience.  Popularity grew quickly and the Orlando, FL site was visited by former U.S. President George H.W. Bush.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fodors Walt Disney World with Universal Orlando and Seaworld 2008|last=Laura|first=Kidder|publisher=Random House|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4000-1808-6|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fodorswaltdisney00fodo_0/page/434 434]|url=https://archive.org/details/fodorswaltdisney00fodo_0/page/434}}</ref>  After the initial location continued to rise in popularity, the rights were sold to Alan Metni, who divided the company into a manufacturing and distribution company (Sky Venture) and public experience company (iFly) which now operates or has licensed tunnels to over 80 locations around the world, including 5 cruise ships, with more in the works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indoorskydivingsource.com/tunnels/manufacturers/skyventure/|title=SkyVenture|last=ISS|first=Wind Tunnels|date=|website=ISS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\nAnother milestone in vertical wind tunnel history was 'Wind Machine' at the [[2006 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony|closing ceremonies]] of the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Torino Winter Olympics]].<ref name=\"Olympic Wind Machine 2006 Closing Ceremonies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyflight.net/2006_torinno_olympics_.html|title=Olympic Wind Machine 2006 Closing Ceremonies|work=Bodyflight Network Vertical Wind Tunnels|accessdate=2 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825050634/http://www.bodyflight.net/2006_torinno_olympics_.html|archivedate=25 August 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> This was a custom-built unit by [[Aerodium]] (Latvia/Canada) for the closing ceremony.

Portable vertical wind tunnels are often used in movies and demonstrations, and are often rented for large events such as conventions and state fairs.  Portable units offer a dramatic effect for the flying person and the spectators, because there are no walls around the flight area.  These vertical wind tunnels allow people to fly with a full or partial outdoor/sky view.  Outdoor vertical wind tunnels may also have walls or netting around the wind column, to keep beginner tunnel flyers from falling out of the tunnel.<ref>[http://extremesports.about.com/od/skydiving/g/Definition-Of-Vertical-Wind-Tunnel.htm About.com description]</ref>\n\nStationary indoor vertical wind tunnels include recirculating and non-recirculating types.  Non-recirculating vertical wind tunnels usually suck air through inlets near the bottom of the building, through the bodyflight area, and exhaust through the top of the building.  Recirculating wind tunnels form an aerodynamic loop with turning vanes, similar to a scientific [[wind tunnel]], but using a vertical loop with a bodyflight chamber within a vertical part of the loop. Recirculating wind tunnels are usually built in climates that are too cold for non-recirculating wind tunnels. The airflow of an indoor vertical wind tunnel is usually smoother and more controlled than that of an outdoor unit. Indoor tunnels are more temperature-controllable, so they are operated year-round even in cold climates.\n\nVarious propellers and fan types can be used as the mechanism to move air through a vertical wind tunnel. Motors can either be diesel-powered or electric-powered, and typically provide a vertical column of air between 6 and 16&nbsp;feet wide.  A control unit allows for air speed adjustment by a controller in constant view of the flyers.  Wind speed can be adjusted at many vertical wind tunnels, usually between 130 and 300&nbsp;km/h (80 and 185&nbsp;mph, or 35 and 80 [[Metre per second|m/s]]), to accommodate the abilities of an individual and to compensate for variable body drag during advanced acrobatics.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140228112028/http://www.eng.fiu.edu/mme/robotics/EML4905SeniorDesignProject/SampleSeniorDesignProjects/2011Fall/2011fall-T6-VerticalWindTunnel.pdf University Of Florida, THESIS, VERTICAL WIND TUNNEL (VWT) Final Report, November 16, 2011]</ref>\n\n===Safety and market appeal===\nIndoor skydiving also appeals to the [[mass market]] audience that are [[Acrophobia|afraid of heights]], since in a vertical wind tunnel, one only floats a few meters above trampoline-type netting. Indoor vertical wind tunnels contain the person within a chamber through the use of walls. While wind tunnel flying is considered a low impact activity, it does exert some strain on the flier's back, neck, and shoulders.  Therefore, people with shoulder dislocations or back/neck problems should check with a doctor first.  While actual skydiving out of an aircraft is subject to age limitations which vary from country to country, and even from state to state in the US, bodyflying has no set lower or upper limits.\n\n=== Competitions ===\nA number of competitions based on indoor skydiving have emerged, such as the FAI [[World Cup of Indoor Skydiving]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/singaporean-crowned-junior-freestyle-champion-at-indoor/3209096.html|title=Singaporean crowned junior freestyle champion at indoor skydiving World Cup|newspaper=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en}}</ref> and the Windoor [[Wind Games]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Skydivers compete in Wind Games 2017|date=2017-02-03|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38863714|language=en-GB|accessdate=2017-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/spore-teen-kyra-poh-wins-junior-freestyle-gold-in-at-indoor-skydiving-world-cup-in-poland|title=Singapore teen Kyra Poh wins junior freestyle gold at Indoor Skydiving World Cup|last=Wong|first=Jonathan|date=2016-10-16|newspaper=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-02-06|work=|language=en|via=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Vertical wind tunnels}}\n* [http://www.indoorskydivingsource.com/ Indoor Skydiving Source - Complete Wind Tunnel Database & Resource]\n*[http://kidbots.com/WEBADD/INVENTIONS/ETERNITY_MACHINE.html First published article about a Vertical Wind Tunnel specifically designed for Free Fall, Skydiving, Sport Parachuting in CANPARA, the Canadian Sport Parachuting Magazine, at the end of 1979]\n* [https://www.dropzone.com/indoor/ Dropzone.com Indoor Section - Information Resource and Wind Tunnel Database]\n\n<!-- \n     ATTENTION: Owners of individual wind tunnels : DO NOT ADD specific individual wind tunnels \n     Wikipedia policy is against this -- you're not supposed to list every single McDonalds or Starbucks locations in other Wikipedia articles, so don't list specific locations of wind tunnels franchises here!\n     \n     DO NOT ADD  Airkix, Freezone, Bodyflight.co.uk, Skyventurecolorado.com, Iflyhollywood.com, VegasIndoorSkydiving.com, etc...\n\n     Same goes for the manufacturers listing, removed because of too many manufacturers. \n     * gmi-ventilateur.eu - manufacturer of vertical wind tunnels high speed \n     * aerodium-technologies.com \u2013 Manufacturer of vertical wind tunnels, producer of flight shows \n     * bodyflight.net/wind_tunnels.html ''Bodyflight Network'' Worldwide list of vertical wind tunnels.\n     * tunnelflight.com/ ''International Bodyflight Association'' Tunnel instructor training, listing of vertical wind tunnels\n     * skyventure.com ''SkyVenture'' A manufacturer of vertical wind tunnels.\n     * [http://kineticflying.com/ Kinetic Flying]\n     * [http://freeflytechnology.net/index-en.php?lang=en/ FreeFly Technology]\n\n                                                                                                                    -->\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vertical Wind Tunnel}}\n[[Category:Air sports]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Wind tunnels]]\n[[Category:Parachuting]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n[[File:Vertical wind tunnel at TsAGI.jpg|right|thumb|Research vertical wind tunnel at [[TsAGI]].]]\n[[Image:Vwt nonrecirculating.jpg|right|thumb|Non-recirculating indoor recreational vertical wind tunnel.]]\n[[File:Wind tunnel instructors.jpg|alt=Wind Tunnel instructors|thumb|Two instructors practice flying inside an indoor wind tunnel]]\n[[Image:Vwt recirculating.jpg|right|thumb|Recirculating indoor recreational vertical wind tunnel.]]\n\nA '''vertical wind tunnel''' (VWT) is a [[wind tunnel]] which moves air up in a vertical column.

A vertical wind tunnel is frequently called 'indoor skydiving' due to the popularity of vertical wind tunnels among skydivers, who report that the sensation is extremely similar to skydiving.{{Clarify|date=September 2018}}  The human body 'floats' in midair in a vertical wind tunnel, replicating the physics of 'body flight' or '[[bodyflight]]' experienced during [[freefall]].<ref>[http://news.discovery.com/adventure/extreme-sports/what-is-indoor-skydiving-2.htm Discovery News Blog Post about Indoor Skydiving]</ref>\n\n===History===\nThe first human to fly in a vertical wind tunnel was Jack Tiffany in 1964 at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] located in Greene and Montgomery County, Ohio.\n\nIn 1982 Jean St-Germain, an inventor from Drummondville, Quebec,<ref>{{cite news |last=Ha |first=Tu Thanh|date=23 September 2016|title=Jean St-Germain, Quebec\u2019s eccentric inventor of diverse devices |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/obituary-jean-st-germain-quebecs-eccentric-inventor-of-diversedevices/article32040314/| work=The Globe and Mail |location= |access-date= }}</ref> sold a vertical wind tunnel concept to both Les Thompson and Marvin Kratter, both of whom went on to build their own wind tunnels.

The first vertical wind tunnel, built solely for a commercial use, opened in the summer of 1982 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  Later that same year, a second wind tunnel opened in [[Pigeon Forge]], [[Tennessee]].  Both facilities opened and operated under the name of Flyaway Indoor Skydiving. In 2005 the 15-year Flyaway Manager Keith Fields purchased the Las Vegas facility and later renamed it \"Vegas Indoor Skydiving\".\n\nIn the 1990\u2019s William Kitchen, an inventor living in Orlando, FL filed patents for a vertical wind tunnel<ref>{{Cite patent|title=Skydiving trainer windtunnel|gdate=1995-03-06|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5655909A/en}}</ref> and founded the US Company \"Sky Venture\" in July 1998.  This tunnel is specifically designed to simulate the free fall skydiving experience.  Popularity grew quickly and the Orlando, FL site was visited by former U.S. President George H.W. Bush.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fodors Walt Disney World with Universal Orlando and Seaworld 2008|last=Laura|first=Kidder|publisher=Random House|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4000-1808-6|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fodorswaltdisney00fodo_0/page/434 434]|url=https://archive.org/details/fodorswaltdisney00fodo_0/page/434}}</ref>  After the initial location continued to rise in popularity, the rights were sold to Alan Metni, who divided the company into a manufacturing and distribution company (Sky Venture) and public experience company (iFly) which now operates or has licensed tunnels to over 80 locations around the world, including 5 cruise ships, with more in the works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indoorskydivingsource.com/tunnels/manufacturers/skyventure/|title=SkyVenture|last=ISS|first=Wind Tunnels|date=|website=ISS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\nAnother milestone in vertical wind tunnel history was 'Wind Machine' at the [[2006 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony|closing ceremonies]] of the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Torino Winter Olympics]].<ref name=\"Olympic Wind Machine 2006 Closing Ceremonies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyflight.net/2006_torinno_olympics_.html|title=Olympic Wind Machine 2006 Closing Ceremonies|work=Bodyflight Network Vertical Wind Tunnels|accessdate=2 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825050634/http://www.bodyflight.net/2006_torinno_olympics_.html|archivedate=25 August 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> This was a custom-built unit by [[Aerodium]] (Latvia/Canada) for the closing ceremony.

Portable vertical wind tunnels are often used in movies and demonstrations, and are often rented for large events such as conventions and state fairs.  Portable units offer a dramatic effect for the flying person and the spectators, because there are no walls around the flight area.  These vertical wind tunnels allow people to fly with a full or partial outdoor/sky view.  Outdoor vertical wind tunnels may also have walls or netting around the wind column, to keep beginner tunnel flyers from falling out of the tunnel.<ref>[http://extremesports.about.com/od/skydiving/g/Definition-Of-Vertical-Wind-Tunnel.htm About.com description]</ref>\n\nStationary indoor vertical wind tunnels include recirculating and non-recirculating types.  Non-recirculating vertical wind tunnels usually suck air through inlets near the bottom of the building, through the bodyflight area, and exhaust through the top of the building.  Recirculating wind tunnels form an aerodynamic loop with turning vanes, similar to a scientific [[wind tunnel]], but using a vertical loop with a bodyflight chamber within a vertical part of the loop. Recirculating wind tunnels are usually built in climates that are too cold for non-recirculating wind tunnels. The airflow of an indoor vertical wind tunnel is usually smoother and more controlled than that of an outdoor unit. Indoor tunnels are more temperature-controllable, so they are operated year-round even in cold climates.\n\nVarious propellers and fan types can be used as the mechanism to move air through a vertical wind tunnel. Motors can either be diesel-powered or electric-powered, and typically provide a vertical column of air between 6 and 16&nbsp;feet wide.  A control unit allows for air speed adjustment by a controller in constant view of the flyers.  Wind speed can be adjusted at many vertical wind tunnels, usually between 130 and 300&nbsp;km/h (80 and 185&nbsp;mph, or 35 and 80 [[Metre per second|m/s]]), to accommodate the abilities of an individual and to compensate for variable body drag during advanced acrobatics.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140228112028/http://www.eng.fiu.edu/mme/robotics/EML4905SeniorDesignProject/SampleSeniorDesignProjects/2011Fall/2011fall-T6-VerticalWindTunnel.pdf University Of Florida, THESIS, VERTICAL WIND TUNNEL (VWT) Final Report, November 16, 2011]</ref>\n\n===Safety and market appeal===\nIndoor skydiving also appeals to the [[mass market]] audience that are [[Acrophobia|afraid of heights]], since in a vertical wind tunnel, one only floats a few meters above trampoline-type netting. Indoor vertical wind tunnels contain the person within a chamber through the use of walls. While wind tunnel flying is considered a low impact activity, it does exert some strain on the flier's back, neck, and shoulders.  Therefore, people with shoulder dislocations or back/neck problems should check with a doctor first.  While actual skydiving out of an aircraft is subject to age limitations which vary from country to country, and even from state to state in the US, bodyflying has no set lower or upper limits.\n\n=== Competitions ===\nA number of competitions based on indoor skydiving have emerged, such as the FAI [[World Cup of Indoor Skydiving]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/singaporean-crowned-junior-freestyle-champion-at-indoor/3209096.html|title=Singaporean crowned junior freestyle champion at indoor skydiving World Cup|newspaper=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en}}</ref> and the Windoor [[Wind Games]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Skydivers compete in Wind Games 2017|date=2017-02-03|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38863714|language=en-GB|accessdate=2017-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/spore-teen-kyra-poh-wins-junior-freestyle-gold-in-at-indoor-skydiving-world-cup-in-poland|title=Singapore teen Kyra Poh wins junior freestyle gold at Indoor Skydiving World Cup|last=Wong|first=Jonathan|date=2016-10-16|newspaper=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-02-06|work=|language=en|via=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Vertical wind tunnels}}\n* [http://www.indoorskydivingsource.com/ Indoor Skydiving Source - Complete Wind Tunnel Database & Resource]\n*[http://kidbots.com/WEBADD/INVENTIONS/ETERNITY_MACHINE.html First published article about a Vertical Wind Tunnel specifically designed for Free Fall, Skydiving, Sport Parachuting in CANPARA, the Canadian Sport Parachuting Magazine, at the end of 1979]\n* [https://www.dropzone.com/indoor/ Dropzone.com Indoor Section - Information Resource and Wind Tunnel Database]\n\n<!-- \n     ATTENTION: Owners of individual wind tunnels : DO NOT ADD specific individual wind tunnels \n     Wikipedia policy is against this -- you're not supposed to list every single McDonalds or Starbucks locations in other Wikipedia articles, so don't list specific locations of wind tunnels franchises here!\n     \n     DO NOT ADD  Airkix, Freezone, Bodyflight.co.uk, Skyventurecolorado.com, Iflyhollywood.com, VegasIndoorSkydiving.com, etc...\n\n     Same goes for the manufacturers listing, removed because of too many manufacturers. \n     * gmi-ventilateur.eu - manufacturer of vertical wind tunnels high speed \n     * aerodium-technologies.com \u2013 Manufacturer of vertical wind tunnels, producer of flight shows \n     * bodyflight.net/wind_tunnels.html ''Bodyflight Network'' Worldwide list of vertical wind tunnels.\n     * tunnelflight.com/ ''International Bodyflight Association'' Tunnel instructor training, listing of vertical wind tunnels\n     * skyventure.com ''SkyVenture'' A manufacturer of vertical wind tunnels.\n     * [http://kineticflying.com/ Kinetic Flying]\n     * [http://freeflytechnology.net/index-en.php?lang=en/ FreeFly Technology]\n\n                                                                                                                    -->\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vertical Wind Tunnel}}\n[[Category:Air sports]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Wind tunnels]]\n[[Category:Parachuting]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_wind_tunnel"}

In 1928, as one of [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms]] in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] was replaced with a [[Turkish alphabet|Latin alphabet]].\n\nThe distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are [[vowel harmony]] and extensive [[agglutination]]. The basic word order of Turkish is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. Turkish has no [[noun class]]es or [[grammatical gender]]. The language makes usage of [[honorific]]s and has a strong [[T\u2013V distinction]] which distinguishes varying levels of politeness, [[social distance]], age, courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee. The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Main|Turkic languages}}\n[[File:Kuli Chur inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] [[Kul-chur inscription]] with the [[Old Turkic alphabet]] (c. 8th century).

There is a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between Turkish and the other Oghuz Turkic languages, including [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Qashqai language|Qashqai]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], and [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]].{{r|ucla}}\n\nThe Turkic languages were grouped into the controversial [[Altaic languages|Altaic language group]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Turkish people|Turkic peoples#History}}\n\n[[File:Irk bitig 07.jpg|thumb|right|The 10th-century ''[[Irk Bitig]]'' or \"Book of Divination\"]]\n\nThe earliest known [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic inscriptions]] are the three monumental [[Orkhon inscriptions]] found in modern [[Mongolia]]. Erected in honour of the prince [[Kul Tigin]] and his brother Emperor [[Bilge Khagan]], these date back to the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]].{{r|erdal}} After the discovery and excavation of these monuments and associated stone slabs by Russian archaeologists in the wider area surrounding the [[Orkhon Valley]] between 1889 and 1893, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the [[Old Turkic language]] written using the [[Old Turkic alphabet]], which has also been referred to as \"Turkic runes\" or \"runiform\" due to a superficial similarity to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[runic alphabet]]s.{{r|runiform}}\n\nWith the [[Turkic expansion]] during Early Middle Ages (c. 6th\u201311th centuries), peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across [[Central Asia]], covering a vast geographical region stretching from [[Siberia]] all the way to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] of the [[Oghuz Turks]], in particular, brought their language, [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]]\u2014the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language\u2014into [[Anatolia]] during the 11th century.<ref name=\"Findley\">Findley{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}</ref> Also during the 11th century, an early linguist of the Turkic languages, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] from the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], published the first comprehensive Turkic language dictionary and map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers in the ''Compendium of the Turkic Dialects'' (Ottoman Turkish: ''Div\u00e2n\u00fc L\u00fcgati't-T\u00fcrk'').<ref name=\"Soucek\">{{harvnb|Soucek|2000|pp=}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman Turkish===\n{{Main|Ottoman Turkish language}}\n{{See also|Old Anatolian Turkish}}\n\nFollowing the adoption of [[Islam]] c. 950 by the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who are both regarded as the ethnic and cultural ancestors of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the administrative language of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Turkish literature]] during the Ottoman period, particularly [[Ottoman poetry|Divan poetry]], was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words. The literary and official language during the [[Ottoman Empire]] period (c. 1299\u20131922) is termed [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], which was a mixture of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic that differed considerably and was largely unintelligible to the period's everyday Turkish. The everyday Turkish, known as ''kaba T\u00fcrk\u00e7e'' or \"rough Turkish\", spoken by the less-educated lower and also rural members of society, contained a higher percentage of native vocabulary and served as basis for the modern Turkish language.<ref>{{harvnb|Glenny|2001|p=99}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Turkish language reform}}Language reform and modern Turkish ===\n{{See also|Turkish alphabet reform|Replacement of loanwords in Turkish}}\nAfter the foundation of the modern state of [[Turkey]] and the [[#Writing system|script reform]], the [[Turkish Language Association]] (TDK) was established in 1932 under the patronage of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a [[language reform]] to replace [[loanword]]s of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents.<ref>See Lewis (2002) for a thorough treatment of the Turkish language reform.</ref> By banning the usage of imported words in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries.<ref name=\"TDK History\"/>\n\nOwing to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in their vocabularies. While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions. It is considered particularly ironic that Atat\u00fcrk himself, in [[Nutuk|his lengthy speech]] to the new [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] in 1927, used a style of Ottoman which sounded so alien to later listeners that it had to be \"translated\" three times into modern Turkish: first in 1963, again in 1986, and most recently in 1995.<ref>See Lewis (2002): 2\u20133 for the first two translations.

Many of these new words, particularly information technology terms, have received widespread acceptance. However, the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial. Some earlier changes\u2014such as ''{{lang|tr|b\u00f6lem}}'' to replace ''{{lang|tr|f\u0131rka}}'', \"political party\"\u2014also failed to meet with popular approval (''{{lang|tr|f\u0131rka}}'' has been replaced by the French loanword ''{{lang|tr|parti}}'').

(Photo taken during the 28th [[Istanbul Marathon]] in 2006)]]\n\nTurkish is an [[agglutinative language]] where a series of suffixes are added to the stem word; vowel harmony is a phonological process which ensures a smooth flow, requiring the least amount of oral movement as possible. Vowel harmony can be viewed as a process of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], whereby following vowels take on the characteristics of the preceding vowel.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Turkish Grammar|last=Underhill|first=Robert|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1976|isbn=0-262-21006-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=25}}</ref> It may be useful to think of Turkish vowels as two symmetrical sets: the a-undotted (a, \u0131, o, u) which are all back vowels, articulated at the back of the mouth; and the e-dotted (e, i, \u00f6, \u00fc) vowels which are articulated at the front of the mouth. The place and manner of articulation of the vowels will determine which pattern of vowel harmony a word will adopt. The pattern of vowels is shown in the table above.<ref>Note that this table is essentially the same as the IPA vowel chart shown above: both table and chart indicate the physical location and quality of each vowel. However, the second table includes additional information on how Turkish harmonies vowels sounds across syllables based on the physical location and quality of the initial syllable.</ref>\n\nGrammatical [[affix]]es have \"a chameleon-like quality\",<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1953|p=21}}</ref> and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony:\n* '''twofold (''-e/-a'')''':<ref>For the terms ''twofold'' and ''fourfold'', as well as the superscript notation, see Lewis (1953):21\u201322. In his more recent works Lewis prefers to omit the superscripts, on the grounds that \"there is no need for this once the principle has been grasped\" (Lewis [2001]:18).</ref> the [[locative case]] suffix, for example, is ''-de'' after front vowels and ''-da'' after back vowels. The notation ''-de''\u00b2 is a convenient shorthand for this pattern.\n* '''fourfold (''-i/-\u0131/-\u00fc/-u'')''': the [[genitive case]] suffix, for example, is ''-in'' or ''-\u0131n'' after unrounded vowels (front or back respectively); and ''-\u00fcn'' or ''-un'' after the corresponding rounded vowels. In this case, the shorthand notation ''-in''<sup>4</sup> is used.\n\nPractically, the twofold pattern (also referred to as the e-type vowel harmony) means that in the environment where the vowel in the word stem is formed in the front of the mouth, the suffix will take the e-form, while if it is formed in the back it will take the a-form. The fourfold pattern (also called the i-type) accounts for rounding as well as for front/back.<ref name=\":02\"/> The following examples, based on the [[Turkish copula|copula]] ''-dir''<sup>4</sup> (\"[it] is\"), illustrate the principles of i-type vowel harmony in practice: ''T\u00fcrkiye'<nowiki/>'''dir''''' (\"it is Turkey\"),<ref>In modern Turkish orthography, an apostrophe is used to separate proper names from any suffixes.</ref> ''kap\u0131'''d\u0131r''''' (\"it is the door\"), but ''g\u00fcn'''d\u00fcr''''' (\"it is the day\"), ''palto'''dur''''' (\"it is the coat\").<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Husby|first=Olaf|date=|title=Diagnostic use of nonword repetition for detection of language impairment among Turkish speaking minority children in Norway|url=https://www.academia.edu/3029750|journal=Working Papers Department of Language and Communication Studies NTNV|language=en|volume=3/2006|pages=139\u2013149|via=Academia.edu}}</ref>\n\nThere are several exceptions to the vowel harmony rules, which can be categorised as follows:\n# A few native root words such as anne (mother), elma (apple) and karde\u015f (brother). In these cases the suffixes harmonise with the final vowel.\n# [[Compound word|Compounds]] such as the bu-g\u00fcn (today) and ba\u015f-kent (capital). In these cases vowels are not required to harmonise between the constituent words.\n# [[Loanword]]s often don't harmonise, however, in some cases the suffixes will harmonise with the front vowel even in words that may not have a front vowel in the final syllable. Usually this occurs when the words end in a palatal [l],  for example ''halsiz'' < ''hal'' + ''-siz'' \"listless\", ''me\u00e7huld\u00fcr'' < ''me\u00e7hul'' + ''-dir'' \"it is unknown\". However, affixes borrowed from foreign languages do not harmonise, such as -izm (ateizm \"atheism\"), -en (derived from French -ment as in taxmen \"completely), anti- (antidemokratik \"antidemocratic\").\n# A few native suffixes are also invariable (or at least partially so) such as the second vowel in the bound auxiliary -abil, or in the marker -ken as well as in the imperfect suffix -yor. There are also a few derivational suffixes that do not harmonise such as -gen in u\u00e7gen (triangle) or altigen (hexagon).&nbsp;<ref name=\":12\"/>\nSome rural dialects lack some or all of these exceptions mentioned above.\n\nThe [[Turkish language#Phonology|road sign in the photograph]] above illustrates several of these features:\n* a native compound which does not obey vowel harmony: ''Orta+k\u00f6y'' (\"middle village\"\u2014a place name)\n* a loanword also violating vowel harmony: ''viyad\u00fck'' (< French ''viaduc'' \"viaduct\")\n* the possessive suffix'' -i''<sup>4</sup> harmonizing with the final vowel (and softening the ''k'' by consonant [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]]): ''viyad\u00fc\u011f\u00fc''{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe rules of vowel harmony may vary by regional dialect. The dialect of Turkish spoken in the [[Trabzon]] region of northeastern Turkey follows the reduced vowel harmony of [[Old Anatolian Turkish]], with the additional complication of two missing vowels (\u00fc and \u0131), thus there is no [[palatal harmony]]. It's likely that ''el\u00fcn'' meant \"your hand\" in Old Anatolian. While the 2nd person singular possessive would vary between back and front vowel, -\u00fcn or -un, as in  ''el\u00fcn'' for \"your hand\" and ''kitabun'' for \"your book\", the lack of \u00fc vowel in the Trabzon dialect means -un would be used in both of these cases \u2014 ''elun'' and ''kitabun''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn = 978-3-447-05212-2| last1 = Boeschoten| first1 = Hendrik| last2 = Johanson| first2 = Lars| last3 = Milani| first3 = Vildan| title = Turkic Languages in Contact| date = 2006}}</ref>\n{{expand section|reason=Minor vowel harmony (low rounded vowel placement in first syllable only) not covered.|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Word-accent ==\n{{Details|Turkish phonology#Word-accent}}\nWord-accent is usually on the last syllable in most words.<ref name=\"IPA 19993\"/> There are however, several exceptions. Exceptions include certain [[loanword]]s, particularly from Italian and Greek, as well as interjections, certain question words, adverbs (although not adjectives functioning as adverbs), and many proper names. Loanwords are usually accented on the penultimate syllable ({{IPA|[\u026bo\u02c8kanta]}} ''lokanta'' \"restaurant\" or {{IPA|[is\u02c8cele]}} ''iskele'' \"quay\"). Proper names are usually accented on the penultimate syllable as in {{IPA|[is\u02c8tanbu\u026b]}} ''\u0130stanbul'', but sometimes on the antepenultimate, if the word ends in a cretic rhythm (<sub><span style=\"font-size:200%;\">\u00af&nbsp;\u02d8&nbsp;\u00af</span></sub> or <sub><span style=\"font-size:200%;\">\u00af&nbsp;\u02d8&nbsp;\u02d8</span></sub>), as in {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014bka\u027ea]}} ''Ankara''. (See [[Turkish phonology#Place names]].)\n\nIn addition, there are certain suffixes such as ''-le'' \"with\" and the verbal negative particle ''-me-/-ma-'', which place an accent on the syllable which precedes them, e.g. ''kit\u00e1p-la'' \"with the book\", ''d\u00e9-me-mek'' \"not to say\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Levi |first=Susannah V. |date=2005 |title=Acoustic correlates of lexical accent in Turkish |journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association |language=en |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=76 |doi=10.1017/S0025100305001921}}</ref>\n\nIn some circumstances (for example, in the second half of compound words or when verbs are preceded by an indefinite object) the accent on a word is suppressed and cannot be heard.\n\n== Syntax ==\n\n=== Sentence groups ===\nTurkish has two groups of sentences: verbal and nominal sentences. In the case of a verbal sentence, the predicate is a finite verb, while the predicate in nominal sentence will have either no overt verb or a verb in the form of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''ol'' or ''y'' (variants of \"be\"). Examples of both are given below:<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=Turkish: A Comprehensive Grammar|last=Goksel|first=Asli|last2=Kerslake|first2=Celia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-11494-2|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sentence type\n! colspan=\"2\" |Turkish\n!English\n|-\n|\n|Subject\n|Predicate\n|\n|-\n|Verbal\n|Necla\n|okula gitti\n|Necla went to school\n|-\n|Nominal (no verb)\n|Necla\n|o\u011fretmen\n|Necla is a teacher\n|-\n|(copula)\n|Necla\n|ev-de-'''y'''-mi\u015f (hyphens delineate suffixes)\n|Apparently Necla is at home\n|}\n\n==== Negation ====\nThe two groups of sentences have different ways of forming negation. A nominal sentence can be negated with the addition of the word ''de\u011fil''. For example, the sentence above would become ''Necla o\u011fretmen de\u011fil'' ('Necla is not a teacher'). However, the verbal sentence requires the addition of a negative suffix ''-me'' to the verb (the suffix comes after the stem but before the tense): ''Necla okula gitmedi'' ('Necla did not go to school').<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=Turkish Grammar|last=Underhill|first=Robert|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1976|isbn=0-262-21006-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Yes/no questions ====\nIn the case of a verbal sentence, an interrogative clitic ''mi'' is added after the verb and stands alone, for example ''Necla okula gitti mi?'' ('Did Necla go to school?'). In the case of a nominal sentence, then ''mi'' comes after the predicate but before the personal ending, so for example ''Necla, siz o\u011fretmen misiniz''? ('Necla, are you [formal, plural] a teacher?').<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n===Word order===\nWord order in simple Turkish sentences is generally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], as in Korean and [[Latin]], but unlike English, for verbal sentences and subject-predicate for nominal sentences. However, as Turkish possesses a case-marking system, and most grammatical relations are shown using morphological markers, often the SOV structure has diminished relevance and may vary. The SOV structure may thus be considered a \"pragmatic word order\" of language, one that does not rely on word order for grammatical purposes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Sandra|date=April 1978|title=Modern English from a Typological Point of View: Some Implications of the Function of Word Order|url=|journal=Linguistische Berlichte|volume=1978|issue=54|pages=19\u201335|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n==== Immediately preverbal ====\n\nConsider the following simple sentence which demonstrates that the focus in Turkish is on the element that immediately precedes the verb:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Function of Word Order in Turkish Grammar|last=Erguvanl\u0131|first=Eser Emine|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|isbn=0-520-09955-9|series=Linguistics Vol. 106|location=Berkeley|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Word order\n!\n!\n!\n!Focus\n|-\n|SOV\n|Ahmet\nAhmet\n|yumurta-y\u0131\negg (accusative)\n|yedi\nate\n|unmarked: Ahmet ate the egg\n|-\n|SVO\n|Ahmet\n|yedi\n|yumurta-y\u0131\n|the focus is on the subject: Ahmet (it was Ahmet who ate the egg)\n|-\n|OVS\n|Yumurta-y\u0131\n|yedi\n|Ahmet\n|the focus is on the object: egg (it was an egg that Ahmet ate)\n|}\n\n==== Postpredicate ====\n\nThe postpredicate position signifies what is referred to as background information in Turkish- information that is assumed to be known to both the speaker and the listener, or information that is included in the context.

There can be S/O inversion in sentences where the topic is of greater importance than the subject.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{main|Turkish grammar}}\n\nTurkish is an [[agglutinative language]] and frequently uses [[affix]]es, and specifically suffixes, or endings.<ref>This section draws heavily on Lewis (2001) and, to a lesser extent, Lewis (1953). Only the most important references are specifically flagged with footnotes.</ref> One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root (see the section on [[#Word formation|Word formation]]). Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word.<ref>see Lewis (2001) Ch XIV.</ref>\nThe only native prefixes are [[alliteration|alliterative]] intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs: for example '''''s\u0131m'''s\u0131cak'' (\"boiling hot\" < ''s\u0131cak'') and '''''mas'''mavi'' (\"bright blue\" < ''mavi'').<ref>\"The prefix, which is accented, is modelled on the first syllable of the simple adjective or adverb but with the substitution of '''m, p, r''', or '''s''' for the last consonant of that syllable.\" Lewis (2001):55.  The prefix retains the first vowel of the base form and thus exhibits a form of reverse vowel harmony.</ref>\n\nThe extensive use of affixes can give rise to long words, e.g. ''\u00c7ekoslovakyal\u0131la\u015ft\u0131ramad\u0131klar\u0131m\u0131zdanm\u0131\u015fs\u0131n\u0131zcas\u0131na'', meaning \"In the manner of you being one of those that we apparently couldn't manage to convert to Czechoslovakian\". While this case is contrived, long words frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: ''Bayramla\u015famad\u0131klar\u0131m\u0131z'' (Bayram [festival]-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; \"Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season's greetings\").<ref>This \"splendid word\" appeared at the time of ''Bayram'', the festival marking the end of the [[Ramadan|month of fasting]]. Lewis (2001):287.</ref> Another example can be seen in the final word of this heading of the online Turkish Spelling Guide (''\u0130ml\u00e2 K\u0131lavuzu''): ''Dilde birlik, ulusal birli\u011fin vazge\u00e7ilemezlerindendir'' (\"Unity in language is among the indispensables [dispense-Pass-Impot-Plur-PossS3-Abl-Copula] of national unity ~ Linguistic unity is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of national unity\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dilimiz.com/dil/imlakilavuzu/TDK/imlaanasayfa.htm |title=\u0130ml\u00e2 Kilavuzu |publisher=Dilimiz.com |accessdate=2011-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006001226/http://www.dilimiz.com/dil/imlakilavuzu/TDK/imlaanasayfa.htm |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Nouns ===\nThere is no [[definite article]] in Turkish, but definiteness of the object is implied when the accusative ending is used (see below). Turkish nouns decline by taking case endings. There are six [[Declension|noun cases]] in Turkish, with all the endings following vowel harmony (shown in the table using the shorthand [[#Vowel harmony|superscript notation]]. The [[plural]] marker ''-ler'' \u00b2 immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes (e.g. ''k\u00f6ylerin'' \"of the villages\").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Case\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ending\n!colspan=\"2\"|Examples\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Meaning\n|-\n!''k\u00f6y'' \"village\"\n!''a\u011fa\u00e7'' \"tree\"\n|-\n|[[Nominative case|Nominative]]\n|\u2205 (none)\n|''k\u00f6y''\n|''a\u011fa\u00e7''\n|(the) village/tree\n|-\n|[[Genitive case|Genitive]]\n|''-in'' <sup>4</sup>\n|''k\u00f6y\u00fcn''\n|''a\u011fa'''c'''\u0131n''\n|the village's/tree's<br />of the village/tree\n|-\n|[[Dative case|Dative]]\n|''-e'' \u00b2\n|''k\u00f6ye''\n|''a\u011fa'''c'''a''\n|to the village/tree\n|-\n|[[Accusative case|Accusative]]\n|''-i'' <sup>4</sup>\n|''k\u00f6y\u00fc''\n|''a\u011fa'''c'''\u0131''\n|the village/tree\n|-\n|[[Ablative case|Ablative]]\n|''-den'' \u00b2\n|''k\u00f6yden''\n|''a\u011fa\u00e7'''t'''an''\n|from the village/tree\n|-\n|[[Locative case|Locative]]\n|''-de'' \u00b2\n|''k\u00f6yde''\n|''a\u011fa\u00e7'''t'''a''\n|in the village/on the tree\n|}\n\nThe accusative case marker is used only for definite objects; compare ''(bir) a\u011fa\u00e7 g\u00f6rd\u00fck'' \"we saw '''a''' tree\" with ''a\u011fac\u0131 g\u00f6rd\u00fck'' \"we saw '''the''' tree\".<ref>Because it is also used for the indefinite accusative, Lewis uses the term \"absolute case\" in preference to \"nominative\". Lewis (2001):28.</ref> The plural marker ''-ler'' \u00b2 is generally not used when a class or category is meant: ''a\u011fa\u00e7 g\u00f6rd\u00fck'' can equally well mean \"we saw trees [as we walked through the forest]\"\u2014as opposed to ''a\u011fa\u00e7lar\u0131 g\u00f6rd\u00fck'' \"we saw the trees [in question]\".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe declension of ''a\u011fa\u00e7'' illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology: consonant [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] in [[suffix]]es (''a\u011fa\u00e7'''t'''an, a\u011fa\u00e7'''t'''a'') and [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] of final consonants before vowels (''a\u011fa'''c'''\u0131n, a\u011fa'''c'''a, a\u011fa'''c'''\u0131'').{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nAdditionally, nouns can take suffixes that assign [[grammatical person|person]]: for example ''-imiz'' <sup>4</sup>, \"our\". With the addition of the [[Turkish copula|copula]] (for example ''-im'' <sup>4</sup>, \"I am\") complete sentences can be formed. The [[interrogative word|interrogative]] particle ''mi'' <sup>4</sup> immediately follows the word being questioned: ''k\u00f6ye mi?'' \"[going] to the village?\", ''a\u011fa\u00e7 m\u0131?'' \"[is it a] tree?\".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Turkish\n!English\n|-\n|''ev''\n|align=\"right\"|(the) house\n|-\n|''evler''\n|align=\"right\"|(the) houses\n|-\n|''evin''\n|align=\"right\"|your (sing.) house\n|-\n|''eviniz''\n|align=\"right\"|your (pl./formal) house\n|-\n|''evim''\n|align=\"right\"|my house\n|-\n|''evimde''\n|align=\"right\"|at my house\n|-\n|''evlerinizin''\n|align=\"right\"|of your houses\n|-\n|''evlerinizden''\n|align=\"right\"|from your houses\n|-\n|''evlerinizdendi''\n|align=\"right\"|(he/she/it) was from your houses\n|-\n|''evlerinizdenmi\u015f''\n|align=\"right\"|(he/she/it) was (apparently/said to be) from your houses\n|-\n|''Evinizdeyim.''\n|align=\"right\"|I am at your house.\n|-\n|''Evinizdeymi\u015fim.''\n|align=\"right\"|I was (apparently) at your house.\n|-\n|''Evinizde miyim?''\n|align=\"right\"|Am I at your house?\n|}\n\n=== Personal pronouns ===\n\nThe Turkish [[personal pronoun]]s in the nominative case are ''ben'' (1s), ''sen'' (2s), ''o'' (3s), ''biz'' (1pl), ''siz'' (2pl, or 2h), and ''onlar'' (3pl). They are declined regularly with some exceptions: ''benim'' (1s gen.); ''bizim'' (1pl gen.); ''bana'' (1s dat.); ''sana'' (2s dat.); and the oblique forms of ''o'' use the root ''on''. All other pronouns (reflexive ''kendi'' and so on) are declined regularly.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==== Noun phrases (''tamlama'') ====\n\nTwo nouns, or groups of nouns, may be joined in either of two ways:\n\n* definite (possessive) compound (''belirtili tamlama''). E.g. ''T\u00fcrkiye'nin sesi'' \"the voice of Turkey (radio station)\": the voice belonging to Turkey. Here the relationship is shown by the genitive ending ''-in''<sup>4</sup> added to the first noun; the second noun has the third-person suffix of possession ''-(s)i''<sup>4</sup>.\n* indefinite (qualifying) compound (''belirtisiz tamlama''). E.g. ''T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti'' \"Turkey-Republic<ref>Lewis points out that \"an indefinite izafet group can be turned into intelligible (though not necessarily normal) English by the use of a hyphen\". Lewis (2001): 42.</ref> = the Republic of Turkey\": not the republic belonging to Turkey, but the Republic that is Turkey. Here the first noun has no ending; but the second noun has the ending ''-(s)i''<sup>4</sup>\u2014the same as in definite compounds.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe following table illustrates these principles.<ref>The examples are taken from Lewis (2001): 41\u201347.</ref> In some cases the constituents of the compounds are themselves compounds; for clarity these subsidiary compounds are marked with [square brackets]. The suffixes involved in the linking are underlined. Note that if the second noun group already had a possessive suffix (because it is a compound by itself), no further suffix is added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em;\"\n|+ Linked nouns and noun groups\n|-\n!

However most adjectives can also be used as nouns, in which case they are declined: e.g. ''g\u00fczel'' (\"beautiful\") \u2192 ''g\u00fczeller'' (\"(the) beautiful ones / people\"). Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives ''var'' (\"existent\") and ''yok'' (\"[[non-existent]]\") are used in many cases where English would use \"there is\" or \"have\", ''e.g.'' ''s\u00fct yok'' (\"there is no milk\", ''lit.'' \"(the) milk (is) non-existent\"); the construction \"''noun 1''-GEN ''noun 2''-POSS var/yok\" can be translated \"''noun 1'' has/doesn't have ''noun 2''\"; ''imparatorun elbisesi yok'' \"the emperor has no clothes\" (\"(the) emperor-''of'' clothes-''his'' non-existent\"); ''kedimin ayakkab\u0131lar\u0131 yoktu'' (\"my cat had no shoes\", ''lit.'' \"cat-''my''-''of'' shoe-''plur.''-''its'' non-existent-''past tense''\").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{see also|Turkish copula}}\nTurkish verbs indicate [[Grammatical person|person]]. They can be made negative, potential (\"can\"), or impotential (\"cannot\"). Furthermore, Turkish verbs show [[Grammatical tense|tense]] ([[Present tense|present]], [[Past tense|past]], [[Future tense|future]], and [[aorist]]), [[Grammatical mood|mood]] ([[Conditional mood|conditional]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Inferential mood|inferential]], [[Necessitative mood|necessitative]], and [[Optative mood|optative]]), and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].

For the sake of simplicity the term \"tense\" is used here throughout, although for some forms \"aspect\" or \"mood\" might be more appropriate.) There are 9 simple and 20 compound tenses in Turkish. 9 simple tenses are simple  past (''di'li ge\u00e7mi\u015f''), inferential past (''mi\u015f'li ge\u00e7mi\u015f''), present continuous, simple present ([[Aorist#Turkish|aorist]]), future, optative, subjunctive, necessitative (\"must\") and imperative.<ref>[http://tr.scribd.com/doc/115291192/TURKISH-GRAMMAR-UPDATED-ACADEMIC-EDITION-YUKSEL-GOKNEL-OCTOBER-2012-signed-pdf Y\u00fcksel G\u00f6knel:Turkish Grammar]{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}</ref> There are three groups of compound forms.

''Bil'' is the suffix for the sufficiency mood. It is the equivalent of the English auxiliary verbs \"able to\", \"can\" or \"may\". ''Ver'' is the suffix for the swiftness mood, ''kal'' for the perpetuity mood and ''yaz'' for the approach (\"almost\") mood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dersimizedebiyat.com/icerik_detay.asp?icr=63&bs=S%F6zc%FCk%20(%20Kelime%20)%20T%FCrleri%20-%20Fiiller%20(%20Eylemler%20) |title=Dersimiz Edebiyat Online course|language=Turkish |publisher=Dersimizedebiyat.com |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref> Thus, while ''gittin'' means \"you went\", ''gidebildin'' means \"you could go\" and ''gidiverdin'' means \"you went swiftly\". The tenses of the combined verbs are formed the same way as for simple verbs.\n\n==== Attributive verbs (participles) ====\n\nTurkish verbs have [[Attributive verb|attributive forms]], including present,<ref>The conventional translation of the film title ''[[D\u00fcnyay\u0131 Kurtaran Adam]]'', ''The Man Who Saved the World'', uses the past tense. Semantically, his saving the world takes place though in the (narrative) present.</ref> similar to the English [[present participle]] (with the ending {{italics correction|''-en''}}<sup>2</sup>); future ({{italics correction|''-ecek''}}<sup>2</sup>); indirect/inferential past ({{italics correction|''-mi\u015f''}}<sup>4</sup>); and [[Aorist#Turkish|aorist]] ({{italics correction|''-er''}}<sup>2</sup> or {{italics correction|''-ir''}}<sup>4</sup>).\n\nThe most important function of some of these attributive verbs is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the [[relative clause]]s found in most European languages. The subject of the verb in an {{italics correction|''-en''}}<sup>2</sup> form is (possibly implicitly) in the third person (he/she/it/they); this form, when used in a modifying phrase, does not change according to number. The other attributive forms used in these constructions are the future ({{italics correction|''-ecek''}}<sup>2</sup>) and an older form ({{italics correction|''-dik''}}<sup>4</sup>), which covers both present and past meanings.<ref>See Lewis (2001):163\u2013165, 260\u2013262 for an exhaustive treatment.</ref> These two forms take \"personal endings\", which have the same form as the [[Possessive affix#Turkish|possessive suffix]]es but indicate the person and possibly number of the subject of the attributive verb; for example, ''yedi\u011f'''im''''' means \"what '''I''' eat\", ''yedi\u011f'''in''''' means \"what '''you''' eat\", and so on. The use of these \"personal or relative participles\" is illustrated in the following table, in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause.<ref>For the terms ''personal'' and ''relative'' participle see Lewis (1958):98 and Lewis (2001):163 respectively.

Most suffixes in Turkish will have more than one form, depending on the vowels and consonants in the root- vowel harmony rules will apply; consonant-initial suffixes will follow the voiced/ voiceless character of the consonant in the final unit of the root; and in the case of vowel-initial suffixes an additional consonant may be inserted if the root ends in a vowel, or the suffix may lose its initial vowel.  There is also a prescribed order of affixation of suffixes- as a rule of thumb, derivative suffixes precede inflectional suffixes which are followed by [[clitic]]s, as can be seen in the example set of words derived from a substantive root below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Turkish\n!Components\n!English\n!Word class\n|-\n|''g\u00f6z''\n|''g\u00f6z''\n|eye\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zl\u00fck''\n|''g\u00f6z + -l\u00fck''\n|eyeglasses\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zl\u00fck\u00e7\u00fc''\n|''g\u00f6z + -l\u00fck + -\u00e7\u00fc''\n|optician\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zl\u00fck\u00e7\u00fcl\u00fck''\n|''g\u00f6z + -l\u00fck + -\u00e7\u00fc + -l\u00fck''\n|optician's trade\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zlem''\n|''g\u00f6z + -lem''\n|observation\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zlemci''\n|''g\u00f6z + -lem + -ci''\n|observer\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zle-''\n|''g\u00f6z + -le''\n|observe\n|Verb (order)\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zlemek''\n|''g\u00f6z + -le + -mek''\n|to observe\n|Verb (infinitive)\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zetlemek''\n|''g\u00f6z + -et + -le + -mek''\n|to peep\n|Verb (infinitive)\n|}\n\nAnother example, starting from a verbal root:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Turkish\n!Components\n!English\n!Word class\n|-\n|''yat-''\n|''yat-''\n|lie down\n|Verb (order)\n|-\n|''yatmak''\n|''yat-mak''\n|to lie down\n|Verb (infinitive)\n|-\n|''yat\u0131k''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)k''\n|leaning\n|Adjective\n|-\n|''yatak''\n|''yat- + -ak''\n|bed, place to sleep\n|Noun\n|-\n|''yatay''\n|''yat- + -ay''\n|horizontal\n|Adjective\n|-\n|''yatk\u0131n''\n|''yat- + -g\u0131n''\n|inclined to; stale (from lying too long)\n|Adjective\n|-\n|''yat\u0131r-''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)r-''\n|lay down\n|Verb (order)\n|-\n|''yat\u0131rmak''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)r-mak''\n|to lay down something/someone\n|Verb (infinitive)\n|-\n|''yat\u0131r\u0131m''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)r- + -(\u0131)m''\n|laying down; deposit, investment\n|Noun\n|-\n|''yat\u0131r\u0131mc\u0131''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)r- + -(\u0131)m + -c\u0131''\n|depositor, investor\n|Noun\n|}\n\nNew words are also frequently formed by [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]] two existing words into a new one, as in German. Compounds can be of two types- bare and (s)I. The bare compounds, both nouns and adjectives are effectively two words juxtaposed without the addition of suffixes for example the word for girlfriend ''k\u0131zarkada\u015f'' (''k\u0131z+arkada\u015f'') or black pepper ''karabiber'' (''kara+biber'').

The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowels\u2014long ''\u0101, \u016b'' and ''\u012b''\u2014and included several redundant consonants, such as variants of ''z'' (which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish). The omission of short vowels in the Arabic script was claimed to make it particularly unsuitable for Turkish, which has [[#Vowel harmony|eight vowels]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zimmer|Orgun|1999|p=155}}</ref>\n\nThe reform of the script was an important step in the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|cultural reforms]] of the period. The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a [[Turkish alphabet#Modern Turkish alphabet|Language Commission]] composed of prominent linguists, academics, and writers. The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by public education centers opened throughout the country, cooperation with publishing companies, and encouragement by Atat\u00fcrk himself, who toured the country teaching the new letters to the public.<ref name=\"Dilacar\">{{cite journal|last=Dila\u00e7ar|first=Agop|authorlink=Agop Dila\u00e7ar|title=Atat\u00fcrk ve Yaz\u0131m|journal=T\u00fcrk Dili|issn= 1301-465X|volume=35|issue=307|url= http://www.dildernegi.org.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFC3C6D81741DBEB05|accessdate=2007-03-19|year=1977|ref=harv|language=Turkish}}</ref> As a result, there was a dramatic increase in literacy from its original Third World levels.<ref>{{harvnb|Coulmas|1989|pp=243\u2013244}}</ref>\n\nThe Latin alphabet was applied to the Turkish language for educational purposes even before the 20th-century reform.

The region consists of a series of deep valleys and the unusual mode of communication allows for conversation over distances of up to 5 kilometres. Turkish authorities estimate that there are still around 10,000 people using the whistled language. However, in 2011 [[UNESCO]] found whistling Turkish to be a dying language and included it in its [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage list]]. Since then the local education directorate has introduced it as a course in schools in the region, hoping to revive its use.\n\nA study was conducted by a German scientist of Turkish origin [[Onur G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn]] at Ruhr University, observing 31 \"speakers\" of ''{{Lang|tr|ku\u015f dili}}'' (\"bird's tongue\") from Ku\u015fk\u00f6y, and he found that the whistled language mirrored the lexical and syntactical structure of Turkish language.<ref>{{Cite

In 1928, as one of [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms]] in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] was replaced with a [[Turkish alphabet|Latin alphabet]].\n\nThe distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are [[vowel harmony]] and extensive [[agglutination]]. The basic word order of Turkish is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. Turkish has no [[noun class]]es or [[grammatical gender]]. The language makes usage of [[honorific]]s and has a strong [[T\u2013V distinction]] which distinguishes varying levels of politeness, [[social distance]], age, courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee. The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Main|Turkic languages}}\n[[File:Kuli Chur inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] [[Kul-chur inscription]] with the [[Old Turkic alphabet]] (c. 8th century).

The Turkic family comprises some 30 living languages spoken across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Siberia.\n\nTurkish is a member of the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz group of languages]], a subgroup of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] family. There is a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between Turkish and the other Oghuz Turkic languages, including [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Qashqai language|Qashqai]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], and [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]].{{r|ucla}}\n\nThe Turkic languages were grouped into the controversial [[Altaic languages|Altaic language group]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Turkish people|Turkic peoples#History}}\n\n[[File:Irk bitig 07.jpg|thumb|right|The 10th-century ''[[Irk Bitig]]'' or \"Book of Divination\"]]\n\nThe earliest known [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic inscriptions]] are the three monumental [[Orkhon inscriptions]] found in modern [[Mongolia]]. Erected in honour of the prince [[Kul Tigin]] and his brother Emperor [[Bilge Khagan]], these date back to the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]].{{r|erdal}} After the discovery and excavation of these monuments and associated stone slabs by Russian archaeologists in the wider area surrounding the [[Orkhon Valley]] between 1889 and 1893, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the [[Old Turkic language]] written using the [[Old Turkic alphabet]], which has also been referred to as \"Turkic runes\" or \"runiform\" due to a superficial similarity to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[runic alphabet]]s.{{r|runiform}}\n\nWith the [[Turkic expansion]] during Early Middle Ages (c. 6th\u201311th centuries), peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across [[Central Asia]], covering a vast geographical region stretching from [[Siberia]] all the way to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] of the [[Oghuz Turks]], in particular, brought their language, [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]]\u2014the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language\u2014into [[Anatolia]] during the 11th century.<ref name=\"Findley\">Findley{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}</ref> Also during the 11th century, an early linguist of the Turkic languages, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] from the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], published the first comprehensive Turkic language dictionary and map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers in the ''Compendium of the Turkic Dialects'' (Ottoman Turkish: ''Div\u00e2n\u00fc L\u00fcgati't-T\u00fcrk'').<ref name=\"Soucek\">{{harvnb|Soucek|2000|pp=}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman Turkish===\n{{Main|Ottoman Turkish language}}\n{{See also|Old Anatolian Turkish}}\n\nFollowing the adoption of [[Islam]] c. 950 by the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who are both regarded as the ethnic and cultural ancestors of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the administrative language of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Turkish literature]] during the Ottoman period, particularly [[Ottoman poetry|Divan poetry]], was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words. The literary and official language during the [[Ottoman Empire]] period (c. 1299\u20131922) is termed [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], which was a mixture of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic that differed considerably and was largely unintelligible to the period's everyday Turkish. The everyday Turkish, known as ''kaba T\u00fcrk\u00e7e'' or \"rough Turkish\", spoken by the less-educated lower and also rural members of society, contained a higher percentage of native vocabulary and served as basis for the modern Turkish language.<ref>{{harvnb|Glenny|2001|p=99}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Turkish language reform}}Language reform and modern Turkish ===\n{{See also|Turkish alphabet reform|Replacement of loanwords in Turkish}}\nAfter the foundation of the modern state of [[Turkey]] and the [[#Writing system|script reform]], the [[Turkish Language Association]] (TDK) was established in 1932 under the patronage of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a [[language reform]] to replace [[loanword]]s of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents.<ref>See Lewis (2002) for a thorough treatment of the Turkish language reform.</ref> By banning the usage of imported words in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries.<ref name=\"TDK History\"/>\n\nOwing to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in their vocabularies. While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions. It is considered particularly ironic that Atat\u00fcrk himself, in [[Nutuk|his lengthy speech]] to the new [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] in 1927, used a style of Ottoman which sounded so alien to later listeners that it had to be \"translated\" three times into modern Turkish: first in 1963, again in 1986, and most recently in 1995.<ref>See Lewis (2002): 2\u20133 for the first two translations. For the third see {{cite web |author=Bedi Yaz\u0131c\u0131 |url=http://www.nutuk.org/ |title=Nutuk: \u00d6zg\u00fcn metin ve \u00e7eviri (Atat\u00fcrk's Speech: original text and translation) |accessdate=2007-09-28 |language=Turkish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928221336/http://www.nutuk.org/ |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language, mostly from English. Many of these new words, particularly information technology terms, have received widespread acceptance. However, the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial. Some earlier changes\u2014such as ''{{lang|tr|b\u00f6lem}}'' to replace ''{{lang|tr|f\u0131rka}}'', \"political party\"\u2014also failed to meet with popular approval (''{{lang|tr|f\u0131rka}}'' has been replaced by the French loanword ''{{lang|tr|parti}}''). Some words restored from Old Turkic have taken on specialized meanings; for example ''{{lang|tr|betik}}'' (originally meaning \"book\") is now used to mean \"[[scripting language|script]]\" in [[computer science]].<ref name=cokbilgi>{{cite web|title=\u00d6z T\u00fcrk\u00e7ele\u015ftirme \u00c7al\u0131\u015fmalar\u0131|url=http://www.cokbilgi.com/yazi/oz-turkcelestirme-calismalari/|work=\u00c7ok Bilgi|accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! align=left | Ottoman Turkish\n! align=left | Modern Turkish\n! align=left | English translation\n! align=left | Comments\n|-\n| ''{{lang|ota-Latn|m\u00fcselles}}'' || ''{{lang|tr|\u00fc\u00e7gen}}'' || triangle || Compound of the noun ''{{lang|tr|\u00fc\u00e7}}'' the suffix ''{{lang|tr|-gen}}''\n|-\n| ''{{lang|ota-Latn|tayyare}}'' || ''{{lang|tr|u\u00e7ak}}'' || aeroplane || Derived from the verb ''{{lang|tr|u\u00e7mak}}'' (\"to fly\").

Vowel harmony can be viewed as a process of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], whereby following vowels take on the characteristics of the preceding vowel.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Turkish Grammar|last=Underhill|first=Robert|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1976|isbn=0-262-21006-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=25}}</ref> It may be useful to think of Turkish vowels as two symmetrical sets: the a-undotted (a, \u0131, o, u) which are all back vowels, articulated at the back of the mouth; and the e-dotted (e, i, \u00f6, \u00fc) vowels which are articulated at the front of the mouth. The place and manner of articulation of the vowels will determine which pattern of vowel harmony a word will adopt. The pattern of vowels is shown in the table above.<ref>Note that this table is essentially the same as the IPA vowel chart shown above: both table and chart indicate the physical location and quality of each vowel. However, the second table includes additional information on how Turkish harmonies vowels sounds across syllables based on the physical location and quality of the initial syllable.</ref>\n\nGrammatical [[affix]]es have \"a chameleon-like quality\",<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1953|p=21}}</ref> and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony:\n* '''twofold (''-e/-a'')''':<ref>For the terms ''twofold'' and ''fourfold'', as well as the superscript notation, see Lewis (1953):21\u201322. In his more recent works Lewis prefers to omit the superscripts, on the grounds that \"there is no need for this once the principle has been grasped\" (Lewis [2001]:18).</ref> the [[locative case]] suffix, for example, is ''-de'' after front vowels and ''-da'' after back vowels. The notation ''-de''\u00b2 is a convenient shorthand for this pattern.\n* '''fourfold (''-i/-\u0131/-\u00fc/-u'')''': the [[genitive case]] suffix, for example, is ''-in'' or ''-\u0131n'' after unrounded vowels (front or back respectively); and ''-\u00fcn'' or ''-un'' after the corresponding rounded vowels. In this case, the shorthand notation ''-in''<sup>4</sup> is used.\n\nPractically, the twofold pattern (also referred to as the e-type vowel harmony) means that in the environment where the vowel in the word stem is formed in the front of the mouth, the suffix will take the e-form, while if it is formed in the back it will take the a-form. The fourfold pattern (also called the i-type) accounts for rounding as well as for front/back.<ref name=\":02\"/> The following examples, based on the [[Turkish copula|copula]] ''-dir''<sup>4</sup> (\"[it] is\"), illustrate the principles of i-type vowel harmony in practice: ''T\u00fcrkiye'<nowiki/>'''dir''''' (\"it is Turkey\"),<ref>In modern Turkish orthography, an apostrophe is used to separate proper names from any suffixes.</ref> ''kap\u0131'''d\u0131r''''' (\"it is the door\"), but ''g\u00fcn'''d\u00fcr''''' (\"it is the day\"), ''palto'''dur''''' (\"it is the coat\").<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Husby|first=Olaf|date=|title=Diagnostic use of nonword repetition for detection of language impairment among Turkish speaking minority children in Norway|url=https://www.academia.edu/3029750|journal=Working Papers Department of Language and Communication Studies NTNV|language=en|volume=3/2006|pages=139\u2013149|via=Academia.edu}}</ref>\n\nThere are several exceptions to the vowel harmony rules, which can be categorised as follows:\n# A few native root words such as anne (mother), elma (apple) and karde\u015f (brother). In these cases the suffixes harmonise with the final vowel.\n# [[Compound word|Compounds]] such as the bu-g\u00fcn (today) and ba\u015f-kent (capital). In these cases vowels are not required to harmonise between the constituent words.\n# [[Loanword]]s often don't harmonise, however, in some cases the suffixes will harmonise with the front vowel even in words that may not have a front vowel in the final syllable. Usually this occurs when the words end in a palatal [l],  for example ''halsiz'' < ''hal'' + ''-siz'' \"listless\", ''me\u00e7huld\u00fcr'' < ''me\u00e7hul'' + ''-dir'' \"it is unknown\". However, affixes borrowed from foreign languages do not harmonise, such as -izm (ateizm \"atheism\"), -en (derived from French -ment as in taxmen \"completely), anti- (antidemokratik \"antidemocratic\").\n# A few native suffixes are also invariable (or at least partially so) such as the second vowel in the bound auxiliary -abil, or in the marker -ken as well as in the imperfect suffix -yor. There are also a few derivational suffixes that do not harmonise such as -gen in u\u00e7gen (triangle) or altigen (hexagon).&nbsp;<ref name=\":12\"/>\nSome rural dialects lack some or all of these exceptions mentioned above.\n\nThe [[Turkish language#Phonology|road sign in the photograph]] above illustrates several of these features:\n* a native compound which does not obey vowel harmony: ''Orta+k\u00f6y'' (\"middle village\"\u2014a place name)\n* a loanword also violating vowel harmony: ''viyad\u00fck'' (< French ''viaduc'' \"viaduct\")\n* the possessive suffix'' -i''<sup>4</sup> harmonizing with the final vowel (and softening the ''k'' by consonant [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]]): ''viyad\u00fc\u011f\u00fc''{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe rules of vowel harmony may vary by regional dialect. The dialect of Turkish spoken in the [[Trabzon]] region of northeastern Turkey follows the reduced vowel harmony of [[Old Anatolian Turkish]], with the additional complication of two missing vowels (\u00fc and \u0131), thus there is no [[palatal harmony]]. It's likely that ''el\u00fcn'' meant \"your hand\" in Old Anatolian. While the 2nd person singular possessive would vary between back and front vowel, -\u00fcn or -un, as in  ''el\u00fcn'' for \"your hand\" and ''kitabun'' for \"your book\", the lack of \u00fc vowel in the Trabzon dialect means -un would be used in both of these cases \u2014 ''elun'' and ''kitabun''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn = 978-3-447-05212-2| last1 = Boeschoten| first1 = Hendrik| last2 = Johanson| first2 = Lars| last3 = Milani| first3 = Vildan| title = Turkic Languages in Contact| date = 2006}}</ref>\n{{expand section|reason=Minor vowel harmony (low rounded vowel placement in first syllable only) not covered.|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Word-accent ==\n{{Details|Turkish phonology#Word-accent}}\nWord-accent is usually on the last syllable in most words.<ref name=\"IPA 19993\"/> There are however, several exceptions.

Loanwords are usually accented on the penultimate syllable ({{IPA|[\u026bo\u02c8kanta]}} ''lokanta'' \"restaurant\" or {{IPA|[is\u02c8cele]}} ''iskele'' \"quay\"). Proper names are usually accented on the penultimate syllable as in {{IPA|[is\u02c8tanbu\u026b]}} ''\u0130stanbul'', but sometimes on the antepenultimate, if the word ends in a cretic rhythm (<sub><span style=\"font-size:200%;\">\u00af&nbsp;\u02d8&nbsp;\u00af</span></sub> or <sub><span style=\"font-size:200%;\">\u00af&nbsp;\u02d8&nbsp;\u02d8</span></sub>), as in {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014bka\u027ea]}} ''Ankara''. (See [[Turkish phonology#Place names]].)\n\nIn addition, there are certain suffixes such as ''-le'' \"with\" and the verbal negative particle ''-me-/-ma-'', which place an accent on the syllable which precedes them, e.g. ''kit\u00e1p-la'' \"with the book\", ''d\u00e9-me-mek'' \"not to say\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Levi |first=Susannah V. |date=2005 |title=Acoustic correlates of lexical accent in Turkish |journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association |language=en |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=76 |doi=10.1017/S0025100305001921}}</ref>\n\nIn some circumstances (for example, in the second half of compound words or when verbs are preceded by an indefinite object) the accent on a word is suppressed and cannot be heard.\n\n== Syntax ==\n\n=== Sentence groups ===\nTurkish has two groups of sentences: verbal and nominal sentences. In the case of a verbal sentence, the predicate is a finite verb, while the predicate in nominal sentence will have either no overt verb or a verb in the form of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''ol'' or ''y'' (variants of \"be\"). Examples of both are given below:<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=Turkish: A Comprehensive Grammar|last=Goksel|first=Asli|last2=Kerslake|first2=Celia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-11494-2|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sentence type\n! colspan=\"2\" |Turkish\n!English\n|-\n|\n|Subject\n|Predicate\n|\n|-\n|Verbal\n|Necla\n|okula gitti\n|Necla went to school\n|-\n|Nominal (no verb)\n|Necla\n|o\u011fretmen\n|Necla is a teacher\n|-\n|(copula)\n|Necla\n|ev-de-'''y'''-mi\u015f (hyphens delineate suffixes)\n|Apparently Necla is at home\n|}\n\n==== Negation ====\nThe two groups of sentences have different ways of forming negation. A nominal sentence can be negated with the addition of the word ''de\u011fil''. For example, the sentence above would become ''Necla o\u011fretmen de\u011fil'' ('Necla is not a teacher'). However, the verbal sentence requires the addition of a negative suffix ''-me'' to the verb (the suffix comes after the stem but before the tense): ''Necla okula gitmedi'' ('Necla did not go to school').<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=Turkish Grammar|last=Underhill|first=Robert|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1976|isbn=0-262-21006-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Yes/no questions ====\nIn the case of a verbal sentence, an interrogative clitic ''mi'' is added after the verb and stands alone, for example ''Necla okula gitti mi?'' ('Did Necla go to school?'). In the case of a nominal sentence, then ''mi'' comes after the predicate but before the personal ending, so for example ''Necla, siz o\u011fretmen misiniz''? ('Necla, are you [formal, plural] a teacher?').<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n===Word order===\nWord order in simple Turkish sentences is generally [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], as in Korean and [[Latin]], but unlike English, for verbal sentences and subject-predicate for nominal sentences. However, as Turkish possesses a case-marking system, and most grammatical relations are shown using morphological markers, often the SOV structure has diminished relevance and may vary. The SOV structure may thus be considered a \"pragmatic word order\" of language, one that does not rely on word order for grammatical purposes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Sandra|date=April 1978|title=Modern English from a Typological Point of View: Some Implications of the Function of Word Order|url=|journal=Linguistische Berlichte|volume=1978|issue=54|pages=19\u201335|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n==== Immediately preverbal ====\n\nConsider the following simple sentence which demonstrates that the focus in Turkish is on the element that immediately precedes the verb:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Function of Word Order in Turkish Grammar|last=Erguvanl\u0131|first=Eser Emine|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|isbn=0-520-09955-9|series=Linguistics Vol. 106|location=Berkeley|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Word order\n!\n!\n!\n!Focus\n|-\n|SOV\n|Ahmet\nAhmet\n|yumurta-y\u0131\negg (accusative)\n|yedi\nate\n|unmarked: Ahmet ate the egg\n|-\n|SVO\n|Ahmet\n|yedi\n|yumurta-y\u0131\n|the focus is on the subject: Ahmet (it was Ahmet who ate the egg)\n|-\n|OVS\n|Yumurta-y\u0131\n|yedi\n|Ahmet\n|the focus is on the object: egg (it was an egg that Ahmet ate)\n|}\n\n==== Postpredicate ====\n\nThe postpredicate position signifies what is referred to as background information in Turkish- information that is assumed to be known to both the speaker and the listener, or information that is included in the context.

There can be S/O inversion in sentences where the topic is of greater importance than the subject.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{main|Turkish grammar}}\n\nTurkish is an [[agglutinative language]] and frequently uses [[affix]]es, and specifically suffixes, or endings.<ref>This section draws heavily on Lewis (2001) and, to a lesser extent, Lewis (1953). Only the most important references are specifically flagged with footnotes.</ref> One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root (see the section on [[#Word formation|Word formation]]). Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word.<ref>see Lewis (2001) Ch XIV.</ref>\nThe only native prefixes are [[alliteration|alliterative]] intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs: for example '''''s\u0131m'''s\u0131cak'' (\"boiling hot\" < ''s\u0131cak'') and '''''mas'''mavi'' (\"bright blue\" < ''mavi'').<ref>\"The prefix, which is accented, is modelled on the first syllable of the simple adjective or adverb but with the substitution of '''m, p, r''', or '''s''' for the last consonant of that syllable.\" Lewis (2001):55.  The prefix retains the first vowel of the base form and thus exhibits a form of reverse vowel harmony.</ref>\n\nThe extensive use of affixes can give rise to long words, e.g. ''\u00c7ekoslovakyal\u0131la\u015ft\u0131ramad\u0131klar\u0131m\u0131zdanm\u0131\u015fs\u0131n\u0131zcas\u0131na'', meaning \"In the manner of you being one of those that we apparently couldn't manage to convert to Czechoslovakian\". While this case is contrived, long words frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: ''Bayramla\u015famad\u0131klar\u0131m\u0131z'' (Bayram [festival]-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; \"Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season's greetings\").<ref>This \"splendid word\" appeared at the time of ''Bayram'', the festival marking the end of the [[Ramadan|month of fasting]]. Lewis (2001):287.</ref> Another example can be seen in the final word of this heading of the online Turkish Spelling Guide (''\u0130ml\u00e2 K\u0131lavuzu''): ''Dilde birlik, ulusal birli\u011fin vazge\u00e7ilemezlerindendir'' (\"Unity in language is among the indispensables [dispense-Pass-Impot-Plur-PossS3-Abl-Copula] of national unity ~ Linguistic unity is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of national unity\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dilimiz.com/dil/imlakilavuzu/TDK/imlaanasayfa.htm |title=\u0130ml\u00e2 Kilavuzu |publisher=Dilimiz.com |accessdate=2011-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006001226/http://www.dilimiz.com/dil/imlakilavuzu/TDK/imlaanasayfa.htm |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Nouns ===\nThere is no [[definite article]] in Turkish, but definiteness of the object is implied when the accusative ending is used (see below). Turkish nouns decline by taking case endings. There are six [[Declension|noun cases]] in Turkish, with all the endings following vowel harmony (shown in the table using the shorthand [[#Vowel harmony|superscript notation]]. The [[plural]] marker ''-ler'' \u00b2 immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes (e.g. ''k\u00f6ylerin'' \"of the villages\").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Case\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ending\n!colspan=\"2\"|Examples\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Meaning\n|-\n!''k\u00f6y'' \"village\"\n!''a\u011fa\u00e7'' \"tree\"\n|-\n|[[Nominative case|Nominative]]\n|\u2205 (none)\n|''k\u00f6y''\n|''a\u011fa\u00e7''\n|(the) village/tree\n|-\n|[[Genitive case|Genitive]]\n|''-in'' <sup>4</sup>\n|''k\u00f6y\u00fcn''\n|''a\u011fa'''c'''\u0131n''\n|the village's/tree's<br />of the village/tree\n|-\n|[[Dative case|Dative]]\n|''-e'' \u00b2\n|''k\u00f6ye''\n|''a\u011fa'''c'''a''\n|to the village/tree\n|-\n|[[Accusative case|Accusative]]\n|''-i'' <sup>4</sup>\n|''k\u00f6y\u00fc''\n|''a\u011fa'''c'''\u0131''\n|the village/tree\n|-\n|[[Ablative case|Ablative]]\n|''-den'' \u00b2\n|''k\u00f6yden''\n|''a\u011fa\u00e7'''t'''an''\n|from the village/tree\n|-\n|[[Locative case|Locative]]\n|''-de'' \u00b2\n|''k\u00f6yde''\n|''a\u011fa\u00e7'''t'''a''\n|in the village/on the tree\n|}\n\nThe accusative case marker is used only for definite objects; compare ''(bir) a\u011fa\u00e7 g\u00f6rd\u00fck'' \"we saw '''a''' tree\" with ''a\u011fac\u0131 g\u00f6rd\u00fck'' \"we saw '''the''' tree\".<ref>Because it is also used for the indefinite accusative, Lewis uses the term \"absolute case\" in preference to \"nominative\". Lewis (2001):28.</ref> The plural marker ''-ler'' \u00b2 is generally not used when a class or category is meant: ''a\u011fa\u00e7 g\u00f6rd\u00fck'' can equally well mean \"we saw trees [as we walked through the forest]\"\u2014as opposed to ''a\u011fa\u00e7lar\u0131 g\u00f6rd\u00fck'' \"we saw the trees [in question]\".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe declension of ''a\u011fa\u00e7'' illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology: consonant [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] in [[suffix]]es (''a\u011fa\u00e7'''t'''an, a\u011fa\u00e7'''t'''a'') and [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] of final consonants before vowels (''a\u011fa'''c'''\u0131n, a\u011fa'''c'''a, a\u011fa'''c'''\u0131'').{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nAdditionally, nouns can take suffixes that assign [[grammatical person|person]]: for example ''-imiz'' <sup>4</sup>, \"our\". With the addition of the [[Turkish copula|copula]] (for example ''-im'' <sup>4</sup>, \"I am\") complete sentences can be formed. The [[interrogative word|interrogative]] particle ''mi'' <sup>4</sup> immediately follows the word being questioned: ''k\u00f6ye mi?'' \"[going] to the village?\", ''a\u011fa\u00e7 m\u0131?'' \"[is it a] tree?\".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Turkish\n!English\n|-\n|''ev''\n|align=\"right\"|(the) house\n|-\n|''evler''\n|align=\"right\"|(the) houses\n|-\n|''evin''\n|align=\"right\"|your (sing.) house\n|-\n|''eviniz''\n|align=\"right\"|your (pl./formal) house\n|-\n|''evim''\n|align=\"right\"|my house\n|-\n|''evimde''\n|align=\"right\"|at my house\n|-\n|''evlerinizin''\n|align=\"right\"|of your houses\n|-\n|''evlerinizden''\n|align=\"right\"|from your houses\n|-\n|''evlerinizdendi''\n|align=\"right\"|(he/she/it) was from your houses\n|-\n|''evlerinizdenmi\u015f''\n|align=\"right\"|(he/she/it) was (apparently/said to be) from your houses\n|-\n|''Evinizdeyim.''\n|align=\"right\"|I am at your house.\n|-\n|''Evinizdeymi\u015fim.''\n|align=\"right\"|I was (apparently) at your house.\n|-\n|''Evinizde miyim?''\n|align=\"right\"|Am I at your house?\n|}\n\n=== Personal pronouns ===\n\nThe Turkish [[personal pronoun]]s in the nominative case are ''ben'' (1s), ''sen'' (2s), ''o'' (3s), ''biz'' (1pl), ''siz'' (2pl, or 2h), and ''onlar'' (3pl). They are declined regularly with some exceptions: ''benim'' (1s gen.); ''bizim'' (1pl gen.); ''bana'' (1s dat.); ''sana'' (2s dat.); and the oblique forms of ''o'' use the root ''on''. All other pronouns (reflexive ''kendi'' and so on) are declined regularly.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==== Noun phrases (''tamlama'') ====\n\nTwo nouns, or groups of nouns, may be joined in either of two ways:\n\n* definite (possessive) compound (''belirtili tamlama''). E.g. ''T\u00fcrkiye'nin sesi'' \"the voice of Turkey (radio station)\": the voice belonging to Turkey. Here the relationship is shown by the genitive ending ''-in''<sup>4</sup> added to the first noun; the second noun has the third-person suffix of possession ''-(s)i''<sup>4</sup>.\n* indefinite (qualifying) compound (''belirtisiz tamlama''). E.g. ''T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti'' \"Turkey-Republic<ref>Lewis points out that \"an indefinite izafet group can be turned into intelligible (though not necessarily normal) English by the use of a hyphen\". Lewis (2001): 42.</ref> = the Republic of Turkey\": not the republic belonging to Turkey, but the Republic that is Turkey. Here the first noun has no ending; but the second noun has the ending ''-(s)i''<sup>4</sup>\u2014the same as in definite compounds.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe following table illustrates these principles.<ref>The examples are taken from Lewis (2001): 41\u201347.</ref> In some cases the constituents of the compounds are themselves compounds; for clarity these subsidiary compounds are marked with [square brackets]. The suffixes involved in the linking are underlined. Note that if the second noun group already had a possessive suffix (because it is a compound by itself), no further suffix is added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em;\"\n|+ Linked nouns and noun groups\n|-\n!

However most adjectives can also be used as nouns, in which case they are declined: e.g. ''g\u00fczel'' (\"beautiful\") \u2192 ''g\u00fczeller'' (\"(the) beautiful ones / people\"). Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives ''var'' (\"existent\") and ''yok'' (\"[[non-existent]]\") are used in many cases where English would use \"there is\" or \"have\", ''e.g.'' ''s\u00fct yok'' (\"there is no milk\", ''lit.'' \"(the) milk (is) non-existent\"); the construction \"''noun 1''-GEN ''noun 2''-POSS var/yok\" can be translated \"''noun 1'' has/doesn't have ''noun 2''\"; ''imparatorun elbisesi yok'' \"the emperor has no clothes\" (\"(the) emperor-''of'' clothes-''his'' non-existent\"); ''kedimin ayakkab\u0131lar\u0131 yoktu'' (\"my cat had no shoes\", ''lit.'' \"cat-''my''-''of'' shoe-''plur.''-''its'' non-existent-''past tense''\").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{see also|Turkish copula}}\nTurkish verbs indicate [[Grammatical person|person]].

''Bil'' is the suffix for the sufficiency mood. It is the equivalent of the English auxiliary verbs \"able to\", \"can\" or \"may\". ''Ver'' is the suffix for the swiftness mood, ''kal'' for the perpetuity mood and ''yaz'' for the approach (\"almost\") mood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dersimizedebiyat.com/icerik_detay.asp?icr=63&bs=S%F6zc%FCk%20(%20Kelime%20)%20T%FCrleri%20-%20Fiiller%20(%20Eylemler%20) |title=Dersimiz Edebiyat Online course|language=Turkish |publisher=Dersimizedebiyat.com |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref> Thus, while ''gittin'' means \"you went\", ''gidebildin'' means \"you could go\" and ''gidiverdin'' means \"you went swiftly\". The tenses of the combined verbs are formed the same way as for simple verbs.\n\n==== Attributive verbs (participles) ====\n\nTurkish verbs have [[Attributive verb|attributive forms]], including present,<ref>The conventional translation of the film title ''[[D\u00fcnyay\u0131 Kurtaran Adam]]'', ''The Man Who Saved the World'', uses the past tense. Semantically, his saving the world takes place though in the (narrative) present.</ref> similar to the English [[present participle]] (with the ending {{italics correction|''-en''}}<sup>2</sup>); future ({{italics correction|''-ecek''}}<sup>2</sup>); indirect/inferential past ({{italics correction|''-mi\u015f''}}<sup>4</sup>); and [[Aorist#Turkish|aorist]] ({{italics correction|''-er''}}<sup>2</sup> or {{italics correction|''-ir''}}<sup>4</sup>).\n\nThe most important function of some of these attributive verbs is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the [[relative clause]]s found in most European languages. The subject of the verb in an {{italics correction|''-en''}}<sup>2</sup> form is (possibly implicitly) in the third person (he/she/it/they); this form, when used in a modifying phrase, does not change according to number. The other attributive forms used in these constructions are the future ({{italics correction|''-ecek''}}<sup>2</sup>) and an older form ({{italics correction|''-dik''}}<sup>4</sup>), which covers both present and past meanings.<ref>See Lewis (2001):163\u2013165, 260\u2013262 for an exhaustive treatment.</ref> These two forms take \"personal endings\", which have the same form as the [[Possessive affix#Turkish|possessive suffix]]es but indicate the person and possibly number of the subject of the attributive verb; for example, ''yedi\u011f'''im''''' means \"what '''I''' eat\", ''yedi\u011f'''in''''' means \"what '''you''' eat\", and so on. The use of these \"personal or relative participles\" is illustrated in the following table, in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause.<ref>For the terms ''personal'' and ''relative'' participle see Lewis (1958):98 and Lewis (2001):163 respectively.

Most suffixes in Turkish will have more than one form, depending on the vowels and consonants in the root- vowel harmony rules will apply; consonant-initial suffixes will follow the voiced/ voiceless character of the consonant in the final unit of the root; and in the case of vowel-initial suffixes an additional consonant may be inserted if the root ends in a vowel, or the suffix may lose its initial vowel.  There is also a prescribed order of affixation of suffixes- as a rule of thumb, derivative suffixes precede inflectional suffixes which are followed by [[clitic]]s, as can be seen in the example set of words derived from a substantive root below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Turkish\n!Components\n!English\n!Word class\n|-\n|''g\u00f6z''\n|''g\u00f6z''\n|eye\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zl\u00fck''\n|''g\u00f6z + -l\u00fck''\n|eyeglasses\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zl\u00fck\u00e7\u00fc''\n|''g\u00f6z + -l\u00fck + -\u00e7\u00fc''\n|optician\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zl\u00fck\u00e7\u00fcl\u00fck''\n|''g\u00f6z + -l\u00fck + -\u00e7\u00fc + -l\u00fck''\n|optician's trade\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zlem''\n|''g\u00f6z + -lem''\n|observation\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zlemci''\n|''g\u00f6z + -lem + -ci''\n|observer\n|Noun\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zle-''\n|''g\u00f6z + -le''\n|observe\n|Verb (order)\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zlemek''\n|''g\u00f6z + -le + -mek''\n|to observe\n|Verb (infinitive)\n|-\n|''g\u00f6zetlemek''\n|''g\u00f6z + -et + -le + -mek''\n|to peep\n|Verb (infinitive)\n|}\n\nAnother example, starting from a verbal root:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Turkish\n!Components\n!English\n!Word class\n|-\n|''yat-''\n|''yat-''\n|lie down\n|Verb (order)\n|-\n|''yatmak''\n|''yat-mak''\n|to lie down\n|Verb (infinitive)\n|-\n|''yat\u0131k''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)k''\n|leaning\n|Adjective\n|-\n|''yatak''\n|''yat- + -ak''\n|bed, place to sleep\n|Noun\n|-\n|''yatay''\n|''yat- + -ay''\n|horizontal\n|Adjective\n|-\n|''yatk\u0131n''\n|''yat- + -g\u0131n''\n|inclined to; stale (from lying too long)\n|Adjective\n|-\n|''yat\u0131r-''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)r-''\n|lay down\n|Verb (order)\n|-\n|''yat\u0131rmak''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)r-mak''\n|to lay down something/someone\n|Verb (infinitive)\n|-\n|''yat\u0131r\u0131m''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)r- + -(\u0131)m''\n|laying down; deposit, investment\n|Noun\n|-\n|''yat\u0131r\u0131mc\u0131''\n|''yat- + -(\u0131)r- + -(\u0131)m + -c\u0131''\n|depositor, investor\n|Noun\n|}\n\nNew words are also frequently formed by [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]] two existing words into a new one, as in German. Compounds can be of two types- bare and (s)I. The bare compounds, both nouns and adjectives are effectively two words juxtaposed without the addition of suffixes for example the word for girlfriend ''k\u0131zarkada\u015f'' (''k\u0131z+arkada\u015f'') or black pepper ''karabiber'' (''kara+biber'').

The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowels\u2014long ''\u0101, \u016b'' and ''\u012b''\u2014and included several redundant consonants, such as variants of ''z'' (which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish).

The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a [[Turkish alphabet#Modern Turkish alphabet|Language Commission]] composed of prominent linguists, academics, and writers.

The region consists of a series of deep valleys and the unusual mode of communication allows for conversation over distances of up to 5 kilometres. Turkish authorities estimate that there are still around 10,000 people using the whistled language. However, in 2011 [[UNESCO]] found whistling Turkish to be a dying language and included it in its [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage list]]. Since then the local education directorate has introduced it as a course in schools in the region, hoping to revive its use.\n\nA study was conducted by a German scientist of Turkish origin [[Onur G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn]] at Ruhr University, observing 31 \"speakers\" of ''{{Lang|tr|ku\u015f dili}}'' (\"bird's tongue\") from Ku\u015fk\u00f6y, and he found that the whistled language mirrored the lexical and syntactical structure of Turkish language.<ref>{{Cite
