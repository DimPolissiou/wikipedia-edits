Centrally planned building programmes included large estates, carefully connected by new road networks, of commercial and residential use by [[Hampshire County Council]]'s architects, led by [[Colin Stansfield Smith]].

Centrally planned building programmes included large estates, carefully connected by new road networks, of commercial and residential use by [[Hampshire County Council]]'s architects, led by [[Colin Stansfield Smith]].
