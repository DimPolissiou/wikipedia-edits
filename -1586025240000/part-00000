[[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\nMassive areas of land were cleared for agriculture and various other purposes in the first 100 years of European settlement. In addition to the obvious impacts this early clearing of land and importation of hard-hoofed animals had on the ecology of particular regions, it severely affected indigenous Australians, by reducing the resources they relied on for food, shelter and other essentials. This progressively forced them into smaller areas and reduced their numbers as the majority died of newly introduced diseases and lack of resources. [[Australian frontier wars|Indigenous resistance]] against the settlers was widespread, and prolonged fighting between 1788 and the 1920s led to the deaths of at least 20,000 indigenous people and between 2,000 and 2,500 Europeans.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grey |first=Jeffrey |title=A Military History of Australia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Port Melbourne |year=2008 |edition=Third |isbn=978-0-521-69791-0 |pages=28\u201340}}</ref>\n==European Discovery==\n{{main|European maritime exploration of Australia}}\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 117460 Duyfhen (ship).jpg|upright|thumb|left|19th-century artist impression of the ship ''[[Duyfken]]'' in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]].]]\n[[Dutch people|Dutch]] explorers, in 1606, made the first recorded European sightings and first recorded landfalls of the Australian mainland.

Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

By 1850, large areas of the inland were still unknown to Europeans. Trailblazers like [[Edmund Kennedy]] and the Prussian naturalist [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] had met tragic ends attempting to fill in the gaps during the 1840s, but explorers remained ambitious to discover new lands for agriculture or answer scientific enquiries. Surveyors also acted as explorers and the colonies sent out expeditions to discover the best routes for lines of communication. The size of expeditions varied considerably from small parties of just two or three to large, well-equipped teams led by gentlemen explorers assisted by smiths, carpenters, labourers and Aboriginal guides accompanied by horses, camels or bullocks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/explorers/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408183209/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/explorers/ |archivedate=8 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1858 onwards, the so-called [[Afghan (Australia)|\"Afghan\" cameleers]] and their beasts played an instrumental role in opening up the outback and helping to build infrastructure.<ref name=australia.gov>{{cite web|url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/afghan-cameleers|website=australia.gov.au|title=Afghan cameleers in Australia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815171331/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/afghan-cameleers |archive-date=15 August 2014|url-status=dead|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills]] led the first north-south crossing of the continent from Melbourne to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. Lacking bushcraft and unwilling to learn from the local Aboriginal people, Burke and Wills died in 1861, having returned from the Gulf to their rendezvous point at [[Cooper Creek|Coopers Creek]] only to discover the rest of their party had departed the location only a matter of hours previously. Though an impressive feat of navigation, the expedition was an organisational disaster which continues to fascinate the Australian public.\n\nIn 1862, [[John McDouall Stuart]] succeeded in traversing Central Australia from south to north. His expedition mapped out the route which was later followed by the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Tim Flannery; ''The Explorers''; Text Publishing 1998</ref>\n\n[[Uluru]] and [[Kata Tjuta]] were first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]]. In separate expeditions, [[Ernest Giles]] and [[William Gosse (explorer)|William Gosse]] were the first European explorers to this area. While exploring the area in 1872, Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from a location near [[Kings Canyon (Northern Territory)|Kings Canyon]] and called it Mount Olga, while the following year Gosse observed Uluru and named it Ayers Rock, in honour of the [[Chief Secretary of South Australia]], Sir [[Henry Ayers]].

In addition to the obvious impacts this early clearing of land and importation of hard-hoofed animals had on the ecology of particular regions, it severely affected indigenous Australians, by reducing the resources they relied on for food, shelter and other essentials. This progressively forced them into smaller areas and reduced their numbers as the majority died of newly introduced diseases and lack of resources.

Over 16 weeks in 1824\u201325, [[Hume and Hovell expedition|Hume and Hovell journeyed]] to Port Phillip and back. They made many important discoveries including the [[Murray River]] (which they named the Hume), many of its tributaries, and good agricultural and grazing lands between [[Gunning, New South Wales]] and [[Corio Bay]], [[Port Phillip]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Hume |first=Stuart H. |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010527b.htm?hilite=hume%3Band%3Bhovell |title=Biography \u2013 Hamilton Hume \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adbonline.anu.edu.au |date=17 August 1960 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Sturt]] led an expedition along the [[Macquarie River]] in 1828 and discovered the [[Darling River]]. A theory had developed that the inland rivers of New South Wales were draining into an inland sea. Leading a second expedition in 1829, Sturt followed the [[Murrumbidgee River]] into a 'broad and noble river', the Murray River, which he named after Sir George Murray, secretary of state for the colonies. His party then followed this river to its junction with the [[Darling River]], facing two threatening encounters with local Aboriginal people along the way. Sturt continued down river on to [[Lake Alexandrina (South Australia)|Lake Alexandrina]], where the Murray meets the sea in South Australia. Suffering greatly, the party had to row hundreds of kilometres back upstream for the return journey.<ref>{{cite web |author=H.J.

The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

By 1850, large areas of the inland were still unknown to Europeans. Trailblazers like [[Edmund Kennedy]] and the Prussian naturalist [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] had met tragic ends attempting to fill in the gaps during the 1840s, but explorers remained ambitious to discover new lands for agriculture or answer scientific enquiries. Surveyors also acted as explorers and the colonies sent out expeditions to discover the best routes for lines of communication. The size of expeditions varied considerably from small parties of just two or three to large, well-equipped teams led by gentlemen explorers assisted by smiths, carpenters, labourers and Aboriginal guides accompanied by horses, camels or bullocks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/explorers/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408183209/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/explorers/ |archivedate=8 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1858 onwards, the so-called [[Afghan (Australia)|\"Afghan\" cameleers]] and their beasts played an instrumental role in opening up the outback and helping to build infrastructure.<ref name=australia.gov>{{cite web|url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/afghan-cameleers|website=australia.gov.au|title=Afghan cameleers in Australia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815171331/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/afghan-cameleers |archive-date=15 August 2014|url-status=dead|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills]] led the first north-south crossing of the continent from Melbourne to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. Lacking bushcraft and unwilling to learn from the local Aboriginal people, Burke and Wills died in 1861, having returned from the Gulf to their rendezvous point at [[Cooper Creek|Coopers Creek]] only to discover the rest of their party had departed the location only a matter of hours previously. Though an impressive feat of navigation, the expedition was an organisational disaster which continues to fascinate the Australian public.\n\nIn 1862, [[John McDouall Stuart]] succeeded in traversing Central Australia from south to north. His expedition mapped out the route which was later followed by the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Tim Flannery; ''The Explorers''; Text Publishing 1998</ref>\n\n[[Uluru]] and [[Kata Tjuta]] were first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]]. In separate expeditions, [[Ernest Giles]] and [[William Gosse (explorer)|William Gosse]] were the first European explorers to this area. While exploring the area in 1872, Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from a location near [[Kings Canyon (Northern Territory)|Kings Canyon]] and called it Mount Olga, while the following year Gosse observed Uluru and named it Ayers Rock, in honour of the [[Chief Secretary of South Australia]], Sir [[Henry Ayers]]. These barren desert lands of Central Australia disappointed the Europeans as unpromising for pastoral expansion, but would later come to be appreciated as emblematic of Australia.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Australian History |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-19-553597-6 |author=Davison, Graeme |author2=Hirst, John |author-link2=John Hirst (historian) |author3=Macintyre, Stuart |author-link3=Stuart Macintyre |ref= CITEREFDavison, Hirst and Macintyre}}\n\n[[Category:1605 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Exploration of Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Parkwells", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExploration of the continent:Move Flinders image to the right, as he is looking left", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_exploration_of_Australia"}
