Set on the [[colonized]] [[fictional planet]] of Theron in the [[future]], where an [[alien race]] led by Gaudy have [[invaded]] the [[human]]-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) [[fighter pilot]] taking control of the SW475 [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] craft in a effort to counterattack the invaders. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[microcomputer]] and [[Home video game console|console]] [[Video game#Platforms|platforms]] by various [[third-party developer]]s, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.\n\n''Slap Fight'' proved to be popular for Toaplan among arcades players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, however it was met with mixed reception from [[video game magazines]] across western regions, specifically the home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are currently owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nIt takes its inspiration from ''[[Xevious]]'' (being a vertical scroller) and ''[[Gradius]]'' (from which it borrows its [[power-up]] system), and helps to establish Toaplan's trademark style.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"SFss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> The game takes place in an Earth-type environment with metallic, land-based enemies; some are mobile armor and others are fortifications embedded in natural terrain.\n\nCertain enemies leave power-up stars upon destruction. Collecting these stars \"turns on\" an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen and moves a lit cursor through the list of power-ups described below. If any power-up is lit, but a ship is lost before a power-up could be selected, the star is \"carried over\" and the Speed block is lit on the next life. Single hits to the unshielded main ship destroy it, and the player loses any accumulated upgrades including Speed. This can make successive lives difficult to keep in the heat of battle.\n\nThis game does not support [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]s with extra credits, and is believed to \"loop\" endlessly; that is, after the final boss, gameplay resumes at the beginning of the play map but at successively higher difficulty, with enemies shooting faster and more frequently. Also, the score stops increasing when it displays 9,999,990 points, which might be achieved as early as the 15th, 16th, or 17th loops ([http://replay.marpirc.net/r/slapfighb1 beginning of 17th verified via MAME]).\n\n=== Power-ups ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nPower-ups appearing on the upgrade menu are somewhat similar to those in ''Gradius'':\n\n* Speed (upgradeable five times cumulatively)\n* Side-Shot (rapid-fire assistant; remains with ship regardless of main weapon unless/until ship is destroyed)\n* Shot (short-range, rapid-fire)\n* Wing (accessory; increases both the width and the exposure of the craft; improves the power or speed of equipped weapon; upgradeable to three pairs; two external pairs can be used to absorb hits but the whole pair will be lost)\n* Bomb (short-range, slow fire, area effect)\n* Laser (long-range)\n* Homing Missile (releases up to sixteen guided missiles) \n* Shield (invulnerability; lasts approx. 25 seconds, or 3 hits, whichever comes first; ends with audible warning)\n\nThe major weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with Laser or Homing Missile; other enemies are destroyed ''much faster'' with specific weapons to match. If Bomb or Homing Missile are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear, or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If Laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to 'grow' and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.\nIt has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.[http://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/page-2 Slap Fight bug]\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot summary of ''Slap Fight'' varies between each region and version.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/><ref name=\"ALCONflyer\">''Alcon'' arcade flyer (Taito, US)</ref> The game takes place in the year 2059 on another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac.

America|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] [[Shoot 'em up#Types|vertically scrolling shooter]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[Toaplan]] and published by [[Taito]]. Set on the [[colonized]] [[fictional planet]] of Theron in the [[future]], where an [[alien race]] led by Gaudy have [[invaded]] the [[human]]-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) [[fighter pilot]] taking control of the SW475 [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] craft in a effort to counterattack the invaders. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[microcomputer]] and [[Home video game console|console]] [[Video game#Platforms|platforms]] by various [[third-party developer]]s, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.\n\n''Slap Fight'' proved to be popular for Toaplan among arcades players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, however it was met with mixed reception from [[video game magazines]] across western regions, specifically the home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are currently owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nIt takes its inspiration from ''[[Xevious]]'' (being a vertical scroller) and ''[[Gradius]]'' (from which it borrows its [[power-up]] system), and helps to establish Toaplan's trademark style.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"SFss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> The game takes place in an Earth-type environment with metallic, land-based enemies; some are mobile armor and others are fortifications embedded in natural terrain.\n\nCertain enemies leave power-up stars upon destruction. Collecting these stars \"turns on\" an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen and moves a lit cursor through the list of power-ups described below. If any power-up is lit, but a ship is lost before a power-up could be selected, the star is \"carried over\" and the Speed block is lit on the next life. Single hits to the unshielded main ship destroy it, and the player loses any accumulated upgrades including Speed. This can make successive lives difficult to keep in the heat of battle.\n\nThis game does not support [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]s with extra credits, and is believed to \"loop\" endlessly; that is, after the final boss, gameplay resumes at the beginning of the play map but at successively higher difficulty, with enemies shooting faster and more frequently. Also, the score stops increasing when it displays 9,999,990 points, which might be achieved as early as the 15th, 16th, or 17th loops ([http://replay.marpirc.net/r/slapfighb1 beginning of 17th verified via MAME]).\n\n=== Power-ups ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nPower-ups appearing on the upgrade menu are somewhat similar to those in ''Gradius'':\n\n* Speed (upgradeable five times cumulatively)\n* Side-Shot (rapid-fire assistant; remains with ship regardless of main weapon unless/until ship is destroyed)\n* Shot (short-range, rapid-fire)\n* Wing (accessory; increases both the width and the exposure of the craft; improves the power or speed of equipped weapon; upgradeable to three pairs; two external pairs can be used to absorb hits but the whole pair will be lost)\n* Bomb (short-range, slow fire, area effect)\n* Laser (long-range)\n* Homing Missile (releases up to sixteen guided missiles) \n* Shield (invulnerability; lasts approx. 25 seconds, or 3 hits, whichever comes first; ends with audible warning)\n\nThe major weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with Laser or Homing Missile; other enemies are destroyed ''much faster'' with specific weapons to match. If Bomb or Homing Missile are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear, or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If Laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to 'grow' and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.\nIt has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.[http://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/page-2 Slap Fight bug]\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot summary of ''Slap Fight'' varies between each region and version.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/><ref name=\"ALCONflyer\">''Alcon'' arcade flyer (Taito, US)</ref> The game takes place in the year 2059 on another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac.

However, Theon is now under attack by the same alien fleet, but the humans are ready.

Both Toaplan and M.N.M wanted the port to be catered towards casual and hardcore players.<ref name=\"EuroGSFMD\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Slap Fight'' was first released in arcades across Japan on July 1986 and later in North America on September of the same year, as well as in Europe by Taito.<ref name=\"ATVGL:JaO1971-2005\"/> Known commercial ports of the game released across European and North American markets include: [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Thomson MO5]], [[Thomson TO8]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Almost all microcomputer versions of the game would later be re-released as budget titles by [[Ocean Software|The Hit Squad]] respectively.\n\n''Slap Fight MD'' itself is a new game mode featuring featured new levels, graphics, weapons, music, etc., plus a new \"smart bomb\" feature at the cost of Wing powerups. The music for it was composed and arranged by [[Yuzo Koshiro]], which is presented on the title screen.\n\nThe original game was also included, but with changes such as configuration for the Shield's timer and an in-game announcer.\n\n=== Taito Nostalgia 2 version ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nIn ''Taito Nostalgia 2'' for Bandai's \"Let's! TV play CLASSIC\" series of plug-and-play game systems, the original Japanese version and a new ''Slap Fight Tiger'' are included.\n\nIn ''Slap Fight Tiger'', the player controls the Heli from ''[[Tiger Heli]]'' instead of the SW475. The laser is changed to fire in a 3-way forward spread. New enemies include the Invaders Army (from ''[[Space Invaders]]'').<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.changevworld.com/letsplay/letsplay.htm|title=Let's!

The War of the Falklands War, for example, was fought in the Americas but the Islands were invaded by a military from the Americas (the Argentine military). They were subsequently defended (not ''invaded'') by the UK. Another example, Pearl Harbor, experienced an attack, not an ''invasion'' by the Japanese. The only possible exception to the Cinco de Mayo claim above might be the brief occupation/invasion of two of the Alaskan Aleutian Islands by the Japanese military during WWII. This event, however, was so insignificant as to be virtually negligible: the islands invaded had a total population of 12 Americans and some 45 natives, the invasion was short-lived, and the battle fought there had no notoriety other than the psychological effect on the Americans that the Japanese had invaded American territory again (Alaska was not yet a full-fledged state).

The War of the Falklands War, for example, was fought in the Americas but the Islands were invaded by a military from the Americas (the Argentine military). They were subsequently defended (not ''invaded'') by the UK. Another example, Pearl Harbor, experienced an attack, not an ''invasion'' by the Japanese. The only possible exception to the Cinco de Mayo claim above might be the brief occupation/invasion of two of the Alaskan Aleutian Islands by the Japanese military during WWII. This event, however, was so insignificant as to be virtually negligible: the islands invaded had a total population of 12 Americans and some 45 natives, the invasion was short-lived, and the battle fought there had no notoriety other than the psychological effect on the Americans that the Japanese had invaded American territory again (Alaska was not yet a full-fledged state). In short, the military importance of these small pieces of land was nowhere comparable to the superior military significance of the Battle of Puebla.|group=note}} Historian [[Justo Sierra]] has written in his ''Political Evolution of the Mexican People'' that, had Mexico not defeated the French in Puebla on May 5, 1862, France would have gone to the aid of the [[Confederate States of America]] in the [[American Civil War]] and the United States' destiny would have been different.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.banderasnews.com/0705/edat-frenchdefeat.htm |title=Mexico's Lasting European Influence.

Lebowitz has discussed the impact of the \"plague years\" on American culture. In particular, she has spoken about the cultural void that was left behind from losing a generation of talented artists and intellectuals. Many of these men not only produced art and intellectual culture, but they also were the passionate audiences that nurtured such culture. As she explained in a 2016 interview:<blockquote>What is culture without gay people? This is America, what is the culture? Not just New York. AIDS completely changed American culture...  And with AIDS, a whole generation of gay men died practically all at once, within a couple of years. And especially the ones that I knew. The first people who died of AIDS were artists. They were also the most interesting people... The knowing audience also died and no longer exists in a real way... There\u2019s a huge gap in what people know, and there\u2019s no context for it anymore.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>In 1987, Lebowitz published a piece in the ''[[New York Times]]'' entitled \"The Impact of AIDS on the Artistic Community.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lebowitz|first=Fran|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/arts/the-impact-of-aids-on-the-artistic-community.html|title=The Impact of Aids on the Artistic Community|date=1987-09-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n=== Feminism ===\n\nLebowitz has been called the \"opposite of [[Lean In|lean-in]] feminism.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> She said in a 2019 interview, <blockquote>If [feminism] really worked, there wouldn\u2019t be feminism anymore. There\u2019s a couple of things that have changed so much for the better, and the life of a girl is a billion times better than when I was a girl. There\u2019s no comparison. It\u2019s so much better, and yet it\u2019s still horrible.

Lebowitz has discussed the impact of the \"plague years\" on American culture. In particular, she has spoken about the cultural void that was left behind from losing a generation of talented artists and intellectuals. Many of these men not only produced art and intellectual culture, but they also were the passionate audiences that nurtured such culture. As she explained in a 2016 interview:<blockquote>What is culture without gay people? This is America, what is the culture? Not just New York. AIDS completely changed American culture...  And with AIDS, a whole generation of gay men died practically all at once, within a couple of years. And especially the ones that I knew. The first people who died of AIDS were artists. They were also the most interesting people... The knowing audience also died and no longer exists in a real way... There\u2019s a huge gap in what people know, and there\u2019s no context for it anymore.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>In 1987, Lebowitz published a piece in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] entitled \"The Impact of AIDS on the Artistic Community.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lebowitz|first=Fran|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/arts/the-impact-of-aids-on-the-artistic-community.html|title=The Impact of Aids on the Artistic Community|date=1987-09-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n=== Feminism ===\n\nLebowitz has been called the \"opposite of [[Lean In|lean-in]] feminism.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> She said in a 2019 interview, <blockquote>If [feminism] really worked, there wouldn\u2019t be feminism anymore.

I was, unfortunately, largely right.\" However, she had also said, \"The way girls are raised now. It\u2019s so different... when I was a child. If you wanted to do something and you were not allowed to do it, very often, the answer to why not would be: because you\u2019re a girl.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/women-arts-fran-lebowitz|title=Women in the Arts: Fran Lebowitz|last=Durbin|first=Andrew|website=Frieze|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  \n\nOn the [[Me Too movement]], she said, <blockquote>It never occurred to me this would ever change.

Initially used in the [[Daimler SP250|SP250 sports car]] and the [[Daimler Majestic Major|Majestic Major]] saloon, the engine was mostly used in the [[Daimler 250|Daimler 2.5 V8 (later named V8-250)]] saloon made with [[Jaguar Mark 2]] [[Unibody|unit bodies]] from 1962 to 1969. Approximately 20,000 of the 2.5-litre version of the engine were made for use in the SP250 and the 250 saloon, while approximately 2,000 of the 4.5-litre version were made for use in the Majestic Major saloon and its [[Daimler DR450|limousine variant]] which remained in production until 1968.\n\n==Design and development==\nShortly after being appointed Managing Director (Chief Executive) of BSA's Automotive Division in 1956, [[Edward Turner]] was asked to design a [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon car]] powered by a [[V8 engine]].{{Sfn|Clew|2007|p=82}}{{Sfn|Long|2008|p=19}}  Turner and his design engineer Jack Wickes began considering the initial concept of their new engine by examining the manual and spare parts list of a [[Cadillac V8 engine#331|Cadillac V8 engine]].<ref group=note>Feedback. The '''Type 51''' was the first Cadillac V8. Introduced in 1914, it was the standard engine for 1915 Cadillac models. It was a 90\u00b0 design with an L-head ([[sidevalve]]) configuration and was [[water-cooled]]. This engine was designed under the leadership of Cadillac's chief engineer 1914-1917, Scottish-born D (D'Orsay) McCall White (1880 -), later a vice president of Cadillac.(Cadillac puts White in Vice-Presidency, ''Automobile Topics'' 13 October 1917 Volume 47) Hired by [[Henry M.

Tait.{{Sfn|Long|2008|pp=22\u201323}} Tait had been involved with [[Donald Healey]] in the early post war years, working successfully on modified [[Riley RM#Riley RM car models|Riley 2\u00bd-litre Big Four]] engines, the final incarnation of which was used in 1953 Zethrin Rennsport prototype, delivering close to 200&nbsp;bhp with surprising tractability.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe two sizes of the Daimler derivative engines share similar but not identical external dimensions and design, the 4.5 litre being longer, deeper and wider . Although it is just possible to substitute one for the other , it requires a good deal of alteration of mountings, exhaust piping, etc.\n\nLimited investment in tooling for the 2.5-litre engine led to limited production capacity, with a maximum weekly output of 140 engines, and the 4.5 litre was only ever made in small quantities.

The '''Type 51''' was the first Cadillac V8. Introduced in 1914, it was the standard engine for 1915 Cadillac models. It was a 90\u00b0 design with an L-head ([[sidevalve]]) configuration and was [[water-cooled]]. This engine was designed under the leadership of Cadillac's chief engineer 1914-1917, Scottish-born D (D'Orsay) McCall White (1880 -), later a vice president of Cadillac.(Cadillac puts White in Vice-Presidency, ''Automobile Topics'' 13 October 1917 Volume 47) Hired by [[Henry M.
