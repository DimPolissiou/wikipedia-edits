Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.\n\nPatriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"Henslin\"/>\n\nHistorically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.<ref>{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-02-865960-2}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}</ref> Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111\u2013114 |quote=Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies, 5 Volume Set|pages=1\u20133|last1=Pateman|chapter=Sexual Contract|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n''Patriarchy'' literally means \"the rule of the father\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Ferguson, Kathy E. |chapter=Patriarchy |editor=Tierney, Helen |title=Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Volume 2 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-31072-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 1048] |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&pg=PA1048 |url=https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Green, Fiona Joy |chapter=Patriarchal Ideology of Motherhood |editor=O'Reilly, Andrea |title= Encyclopedia of Motherhood, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-6846-1 |page=969 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcxqzal4bEYC&pg=PA969 }}</ref> and comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''patriarkh\u0113s''),<ref>{{cite web |title=patriarchy |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/patriarchy |website=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> \"father or chief of a race\",<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2Frxhs |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> which is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac (''patria''), \"lineage, descent\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2F |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> (from \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 ''pat\u0113r'', \"father\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1^\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpath%2Fr |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>) and \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 (''arkh\u014d''), \"rule, govern\".<ref>{{cite web |title=\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the term ''patriarchy'' has been used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family; however, since the late 20th century it has also been used to refer to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men,<ref name=\"Cannell & Green\">{{cite book |last1=Cannell |first1=Fenella |last2=Green |first2=Sarah |editor1-last=Kuper |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Kuper |editor2-first=Jessica |title=The Social Science Encyclopedia |date=1996 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-41-510829-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 592] |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Science_Encyclopedia.html?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC&q=patriarchy |chapter=Patriarchy |url=https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 }}</ref><ref name=\"Meagher\">{{Cite book |last=Meagher |first=Michelle |chapter=patriarchy |editor1-last=Ritzer |editor1-first=George |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first=J.

[[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of [[oppression]] of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.<ref name=\":0\" /> Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.\n\nInteractive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and [[capitalism]] interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.<ref name=\"Tong\">{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|last1=Rosemarie|first1=Tong|last2=Botts|first2=Tina Fernandes|date=2017-07-18|isbn=9780813350707|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=979993556}}</ref> According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the [[Division of labour|labour division]] to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a [[gender]].

Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour, which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.\n\nOther proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this basis, \"the existence of a [[Sexual division of labour|sexual division of labor]] in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological.\"<ref name=\"Lewontin\" />{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent \"sexual division\".<ref name=\"Lewontin\" />\n\nSome [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than [[social conditioning]]. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of [[Culture|human culture]]. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, \"The [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all.\"<ref name=\"Goldberg, Steven\">{{cite book | last = Goldberg | first = Steven | title = The inevitability of patriarchy | publisher = W.

Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.\n\nPatriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"Henslin\"/>\n\nHistorically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.<ref>{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-02-865960-2}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}</ref> Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111\u2013114 |quote=Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies, 5 Volume Set|pages=1\u20133|last1=Pateman|chapter=Sexual Contract|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n''Patriarchy'' literally means \"the rule of the father\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Ferguson, Kathy E. |chapter=Patriarchy |editor=Tierney, Helen |title=Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Volume 2 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-31072-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 1048] |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&pg=PA1048 |url=https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Green, Fiona Joy |chapter=Patriarchal Ideology of Motherhood |editor=O'Reilly, Andrea |title= Encyclopedia of Motherhood, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-6846-1 |page=969 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcxqzal4bEYC&pg=PA969 }}</ref> and comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''patriarkh\u0113s''),<ref>{{cite web |title=patriarchy |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/patriarchy |website=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> \"father or chief of a race\",<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2Frxhs |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> which is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac (''patria''), \"lineage, descent\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2F |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> (from \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 ''pat\u0113r'', \"father\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1^\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpath%2Fr |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>) and \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 (''arkh\u014d''), \"rule, govern\".<ref>{{cite web |title=\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the term ''patriarchy'' has been used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family; however, since the late 20th century it has also been used to refer to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men,<ref name=\"Cannell & Green\">{{cite book |last1=Cannell |first1=Fenella |last2=Green |first2=Sarah |editor1-last=Kuper |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Kuper |editor2-first=Jessica |title=The Social Science Encyclopedia |date=1996 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-41-510829-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 592] |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Science_Encyclopedia.html?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC&q=patriarchy |chapter=Patriarchy |url=https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 }}</ref><ref name=\"Meagher\">{{Cite book |last=Meagher |first=Michelle |chapter=patriarchy |editor1-last=Ritzer |editor1-first=George |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first=J.

This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male).

[[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of [[oppression]] of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.<ref name=\":0\" /> Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression.

Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour, which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.\n\nOther proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this basis, \"the existence of a [[Sexual division of labour|sexual division of labor]] in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological.\"<ref name=\"Lewontin\" />{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent \"sexual division\".<ref name=\"Lewontin\" />\n\nSome [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than [[social conditioning]].

He tells the investigator Roscoe to keep watch for them outside the house, and suggests he get rid of them if he sees them. Leanne realizes that she doesn't know where Jericho is, and looks around the house frantically for him, finally finding him with Aunt May in the nursery. Meanwhile Uncle George approaches Sean in the basement. Sean offers him the money he and Julian have set aside for this, but George refuses it. George induces Sean to share his true desire, to have his son back, and confess what afflictions he's had since Leanne came into the house, the splinters and loss of taste. May tells Leanne that she has interfered with God's plan for the Turners and must leave the family and let the baby be a doll. A police officer comes to the house looking into a missing child, but it is unrelated to Jericho. Thinking she had recognized Aunt May, she reviews footage of her old newscasts. She finds a standoff between a cult, the Church of the Lesser Saints, led by May Markham in Wilmington, which ended in an explosion, fire, and gunshots. Meanwhile, Sean holds his hand over the stove burner long enough to burn it severely, but feels nothing. Leanne leaves and her people find her in the street for a mass group hug.

Inside, Dorothy approaches the crib and sees the reborn doll instead of Jericho.\n |LineColor       = 7B4E1D\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn February 27, 2018, it was announced that [[Apple Inc.]] had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.
