The teams are members of the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American), which from 1979 to 2013 was known as the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]]. Cincinnati and Wichita State University are currently the only members of The American that are located in the [[Midwestern United States]]; all other members are in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] or [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nThe Bearcats were previously members of [[Conference USA]], where they were a founding member. The creation of Conference USA was the result of a merger between the [[Great Midwest Conference]] (of which Cincinnati was a member) and the [[Metro Conference]] (whom Cincinnati had previously been a member) in 1995. Other collegiate athletic conferences which the school has belonged to includes the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], 1957\u20131969; the [[Mid-American Conference]], 1947\u20131952; the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]], 1925\u20131935, and the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]], 1910\u20131924.\n\n==The Bearcat==\n[[File:Cincinnati Bearcat.png|thumb|left|Current version of the Bearcat.]]\nThe Bearcat became the UC mascot on October 31, 1914 in a football game against the UK Wildcats. The key players in the birth of the Bearcat were a star UC player named Baehr, a creative cheerleader, and a talented cartoonist. During the second half of that hard-fought football game, UC cheerleader Norman \"Pat\" Lyon, building on the efforts of fullback Leonard K. \"Teddy\" Baehr, created the chant: \"They may be Wildcats, but we have a Baehr-cat on our side.\"\nThe crowd took up the cry: \"Come on, Baehr-cat!\" Cincinnati prevailed, 14\u20137, and the victory was memorialized in a cartoon published on the front page of the student newspaper, the weekly University News, on November 3. The cartoon, by John \"Paddy\" Reece, depicted a bedraggled Kentucky Wildcat being chased by a creature labeled \"Cincinnati Bear Cat\".\n\nThe name stuck, but not immediately. Following Teddy Baehr's graduation in 1916, the name dropped out of use, at least in print, for a few years. On November 15, 1919, Cincinnati played at Tennessee. ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' writer [[Frederick Bushnell \"Jack\" Ryder|Jack Ryder]]'s dispatch on the game was the first time that the major media called UC's teams \"Bearcats.\" From then on, the university's teams were regularly called Bearcats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/about/history.html |title=History of the Bearcat, University of Cincinnati |publisher=Uc.edu |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 the Cincinnati Zoo adopted a three-month-old [[binturong]] or \"bearcat\". The zoo had a public naming contest where they decided on the name \"Lucy.\"  Lucy was a prominent figure at the University of Cincinnati often to be found on Sheakley Lawn before home football games.  On August 30th 2019, it was announced that \"Lucy\", the Cincinnati Zoo's binturong (Bearcat) would be retiring from her duties as Mascot. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wlwt.com/article/lucy-the-bearcat-ucs-live-mascot-is-retiring/28861207 |title=Lucy the bearcat, UC's live mascot, is retiring  |publisher=wlwt.com}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Varsity sports==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats baseball|Baseball]] || [[Cincinnati Bearcats women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Basketball]] || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country || Golf\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Football]] || Lacrosse\n|-\n| Golf || Soccer\n|-\n| Swimming & diving || Swimming & diving\n|-\n| Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Tennis\n|-\n| || Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|Cincinnati Bearcats}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor.}}\n|}\nThe University of Cincinnati sponsors teams in eight men's and 10 women's [[NCAA]]-sanctioned sports, competing in the American Athletic Conference.\n\n===Baseball===\n{{main article|Cincinnati Bearcats baseball}}\n\n===Men's basketball===\n{{main article|Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball}}\n[[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati's men's basketball]] squads have been a perennial bracket team in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]]. A prolific era in [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats basketball]] was during the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Bearcats posted five consecutive [[Final Four]] appearances. Unanimous three-time All American guard [[Oscar Robertson]] led the nation in scoring during the 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, and 1959\u201360 seasons and posted a career average of 33.8 points per game, which ranks as the third all-time best in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]].\n\nCincinnati has won two [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|national championships]] in 1961 and 1962. The 1961 and 1962 titles were won under rookie coach [[Ed Jucker]].\n\nCincinnati fell out of prominence during the early 1970s. After a brief resurgence in the mid-1970s, the program fell on hard times in the 1980s, but was revitalized under head coach [[Bob Huggins]] following his hiring in 1989. Under Huggins, the Bearcats compiled a 399\u2013127 record in sixteen seasons, and posted fourteen straight NCAA tournament appearances. The most notable of the teams from the Huggins era was the 1991\u20131992 team, which lost to the [[University of Michigan|Michigan Wolverines]] in the [[Final Four]]. In addition, Huggins was responsible for recruiting several future [[NBA]] players including [[Kenyon Martin]], [[Corie Blount]], [[Ruben Patterson]], [[Nick Van Exel]] and [[DerMarr Johnson]].\n\n'''Postseason tournaments'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;

The Tennis Club competes in the USTA Tennis on Campus and the Great Lakes Tennis Conference. The Waterski Team were 2008 DII National Champions. The University of Cincinnati Rugby Football Club was established in 1971 and competes in Division 1 [[college rugby]] in the MAC conference.

The [[Victory Bell (Miami-Cincinnati)|Victory Bell]] awarded to the winner of each contest.\n\nThe teams take each other on annual in many other sports. Unfortunately, the teams have not played in men's basketball since 2011.\n\n===Xavier===\n{{main|Cincinnati\u2013Xavier rivalry}}\nIn [[college basketball|basketball]], the Bearcats' crosstown rival is the [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier University]] Musketeers. Xavier is located less than 3 miles from the University of Cincinnati's main campus. The Bearcats and the Musketeers meet annually in the popular [[Crosstown Shootout]]. \n\nCincinnati and Xavier used to have a fierce rivalry in football, before Xavier eliminated their program after the 1973 season. The schools routinely battle each other in other sports annually as well. \n\n===Louisville===\n{{main|Cincinnati\u2013Louisville rivalry}}\nCincinnati and the [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]] battled annually for the [[Keg of Nails]]. This rivalry dated back to 1929, but ended when Louisville joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in 2014. \n\nThe men's basketball teams of both schools have also participated in a fierce rivalry historically, with Louisville leading the all time series 53\u201343. \n\nThe schools continue to play in other sports, primarily an annual game in baseball.\n\n===Memphis===\n{{main|Cincinnati\u2013Memphis rivalry}}\nThe rivalry between these two schools dates to their first men's [[college football]] game in 1966, and has continued across all sports, with the [[college basketball|basketball]] series gaining attention as well, having started in 1968.\n\nInterest in the series was renewed with both teams reuniting in the [[American Athletic Conference]] and Memphis's basketball reemergence. Football has also intensified, with both teams playing in the [[2019 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game]]. \n\n===Others===\nWhen Cincinnati joined the Big East in 2005, they and the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]] started the [[River City Rivalry]]. The game is a battle for the River City Rivalry trophy. In 2013 the rivalry series ended due to Pittsburgh's exit from the Big East to the Atlantic Coast Conference. \n\nCincinnati and the [[Dayton Flyers]] were another regional rivalry that has lost significance recently. The teams would play periodically in football, before Dayton went down to NCAA Division III in 1977. The teams also frequently played in men's basketball, though the series has ceased since 2011. \n\nCincinnati also has had intermittent rivalries with the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]], [[Ohio Bobcats]], and the [[Kentucky Wildcats]]. Although Cincinnati does not play these schools regularly, these are geographic rivals and are all universities of similar size and stature. In 1961 and 1962 Cincinnati defeated Ohio State in both of its back-to-back national title games in basketball.\n\n==Athletic facilities==\n[[File:UCchargedownthesteps.JPG|right|thumb|The UC Bearcat Band charges down Nippert Stadium's steps.]]\nAll of the athletic facilities (with the exception of Fifth Third Arena and Marge Schott Stadium) are open 24/7 for student use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/facilities/cinn-facilities.html |title=University of Cincinnati Official Athletic Site |publisher=Gobearcats.com |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref>\n*Richard E.

The teams are members of the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American), which from 1979 to 2013 was known as the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]]. Cincinnati and Wichita State University are currently the only members of The American that are located in the [[Midwestern United States]]; all other members are in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] or [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nThe Bearcats were previously members of [[Conference USA]], where they were a founding member. The creation of Conference USA was the result of a merger between the [[Great Midwest Conference]] (of which Cincinnati was a member) and the [[Metro Conference]] (whom Cincinnati had previously been a member) in 1995. Other collegiate athletic conferences which the school has belonged to includes the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], 1957\u20131969; the [[Mid-American Conference]], 1947\u20131952; the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]], 1925\u20131935, and the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]], 1910\u20131924.\n\n==The Bearcat==\n[[File:Cincinnati Bearcat.png|thumb|left|Current version of the Bearcat.]]\nThe Bearcat became the UC mascot on October 31, 1914 in a football game against the UK Wildcats. The key players in the birth of the Bearcat were a star UC player named Baehr, a creative cheerleader, and a talented cartoonist. During the second half of that hard-fought football game, UC cheerleader Norman \"Pat\" Lyon, building on the efforts of fullback Leonard K. \"Teddy\" Baehr, created the chant: \"They may be Wildcats, but we have a Baehr-cat on our side.\"\nThe crowd took up the cry: \"Come on, Baehr-cat!\" Cincinnati prevailed, 14\u20137, and the victory was memorialized in a cartoon published on the front page of the student newspaper, the weekly University News, on November 3. The cartoon, by John \"Paddy\" Reece, depicted a bedraggled Kentucky Wildcat being chased by a creature labeled \"Cincinnati Bear Cat\".\n\nThe name stuck, but not immediately. Following Teddy Baehr's graduation in 1916, the name dropped out of use, at least in print, for a few years. On November 15, 1919, Cincinnati played at Tennessee. ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' writer [[Frederick Bushnell \"Jack\" Ryder|Jack Ryder]]'s dispatch on the game was the first time that the major media called UC's teams \"Bearcats.\" From then on, the university's teams were regularly called Bearcats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/about/history.html |title=History of the Bearcat, University of Cincinnati |publisher=Uc.edu |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 the Cincinnati Zoo adopted a three-month-old [[binturong]] or \"bearcat\". The zoo had a public naming contest where they decided on the name \"Lucy.\"  Lucy was a prominent figure at the University of Cincinnati often to be found on Sheakley Lawn before home football games.  On August 30th 2019, it was announced that \"Lucy\", the Cincinnati Zoo's binturong (Bearcat) would be retiring from her duties as Mascot. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wlwt.com/article/lucy-the-bearcat-ucs-live-mascot-is-retiring/28861207 |title=Lucy the bearcat, UC's live mascot, is retiring  |publisher=wlwt.com}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Varsity sports==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats baseball|Baseball]] || [[Cincinnati Bearcats women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Basketball]] || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country || Golf\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Football]] || Lacrosse\n|-\n| Golf || Soccer\n|-\n| Swimming & diving || Swimming & diving\n|-\n| Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Tennis\n|-\n| || Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|Cincinnati Bearcats}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor.}}\n|}\nThe University of Cincinnati sponsors teams in eight men's and 10 women's [[NCAA]]-sanctioned sports, competing in the American Athletic Conference.\n\n===Baseball===\n{{main article|Cincinnati Bearcats baseball}}\n\n===Men's basketball===\n{{main article|Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball}}\n[[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati's men's basketball]] squads have been a perennial bracket team in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]]. A prolific era in [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats basketball]] was during the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Bearcats posted five consecutive [[Final Four]] appearances. Unanimous three-time All American guard [[Oscar Robertson]] led the nation in scoring during the 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, and 1959\u201360 seasons and posted a career average of 33.8 points per game, which ranks as the third all-time best in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]].\n\nCincinnati has won two [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|national championships]] in 1961 and 1962. The 1961 and 1962 titles were won under rookie coach [[Ed Jucker]].\n\nCincinnati fell out of prominence during the early 1970s. After a brief resurgence in the mid-1970s, the program fell on hard times in the 1980s, but was revitalized under head coach [[Bob Huggins]] following his hiring in 1989. Under Huggins, the Bearcats compiled a 399\u2013127 record in sixteen seasons, and posted fourteen straight NCAA tournament appearances. The most notable of the teams from the Huggins era was the 1991\u20131992 team, which lost to the [[University of Michigan|Michigan Wolverines]] in the [[Final Four]]. In addition, Huggins was responsible for recruiting several future [[NBA]] players including [[Kenyon Martin]], [[Corie Blount]], [[Ruben Patterson]], [[Nick Van Exel]] and [[DerMarr Johnson]].\n\n'''Postseason tournaments'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;

The game is a battle for the River City Rivalry trophy. In 2013 the rivalry series ended due to Pittsburgh's exit from the Big East to the Atlantic Coast Conference. \n\nIn [[college basketball|basketball]], the Bearcats' crosstown rival is the [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier University]] Musketeers. Xavier is located less than 3 miles from the University of Cincinnati's main campus. The Bearcats and the Musketeers meet annually in the popular [[Skyline Chili]] [[Crosstown Shootout]]. The Bearcats also have basketball rivalries with the [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple Owls]], and [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis Tigers]].\n\nCincinnati also has an intermittent rivalry with [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State University]], [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]] and the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]]. Although Cincinnati does not play these schools regularly, these are geographic rivals. Other than Xavier, they are geographically the closest universities of similar size and/or stature.

sex-selective abortion and one-child policy, the Chinese government has taken some effective measures.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> Laws forbidding infanticide, abandonment, and neglect of female children already exist.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2009\" />  There are also penalties for trafficking and kidnapping.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2009\" />  The Chinese government has also published laws forbidding foetal sex determination and sex-selective abortion.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" />\n\nChina has recruited unmarried young males from poor backgrounds into the [[People's Liberation Army]] and into the paramilitary [[People's Armed Police]].<ref name=\"Poston & Glover\" />  These armed personnel who were poor and unmarried males from China's rural areas have helped government maintain social stability in 1989.<ref name=\"Poston & Glover\" />\n\nImproving women's status can also help reduce the sex ratio at birth.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> The Chinese government pays more attention to women's legal rights, especially their economic development.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> More emphasis has been placed on forming laws and regulations for women's economic status, education opportunities, inheritance of family property, willingness of marriage, and old-age supports.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" />\n\nFrom 2005, 600 [[Chinese

environment for girls in Chaohu city, Anhui province, the \"Chaohu Experimental Zone Improving Girl-Child Survival Environment\" was established and implemented in 2003.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> The main activities were \"establishing specialized organizations, conducting trainings, punishing those found to be committing non-medical sex-selective abortions and infanticide, advocating for regulations and laws addressing gender equality, holding focus-group discussions for mothers-in-law, helping women to participate in socioeconomic activities by providing economic support, encouraging active male participation in the improvement of women's status, enhancing the social-security system, and popularizing uxorilocal marriages (in which husbands marry into wives' birth families), in addition to other activities.\"<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" />  The outcomes after three years was encouraging: the sex ratio at birth declined from more than 125 in 1999 to 114 in 2002.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> Based on this program, in 2003, the Population and Family Planning Commission initiated a campaign called \"Care for Girls\" to

its family planning laws to finally allow married couples to have a second child. In 2016 the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China reported that live births in national hospitals numbered 18.46 million and that the fertility rate reached 1.7 percent, the highest rate since 2000. The effect of the new policy to relax birth-planning regulations has debunked 400 million averted births. Since the policy has been enacted, 261.4 million unregistered people who have lived at their residence for at least 6 months were found.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hvistendahl|first1=Mara|title=China's Population Growing Slowly, Changing Fast|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6030/650.full|website=Science|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> The policy change has taken pressure off parents to participate in sex-selective abortion or even avoiding registering female babies at birth, as they now have room for two children. The implementation of the two-child policy has given families room to grow but also control population in the country, in a managed and more humane way.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lili|first1=Liu|title=China's two-child police one year on|journal=Economics, Politics and Public Policy in East Asia and the Pacific|date=19 April 2017|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2017/04/19/chinas-two-child-policy-one-year-on/|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> Although the two-child policy was implemented, the 35-year old social policy is unlikely to take part in a baby boom, in attempt to spark economic growth.

Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys over Girls, and the Consequences of a World Full of Men. PublicAffairs, 2012.</ref> The two-child policy is not expected to serve as a baby boom, rather a moderate increase in fertility among Chinese women. There are still effects resulting from the one-child policy which the two-child policy is intended to attempt to reverse, including population aging, reduction in sex ratio birth, more oppressive elements of child policy, contributions to economic growth and allow freedom to couples to have their desired number of children.<ref>Zhang, G and Zhao, Z.

Abnormal sex ratios in human populations: causes and consequences. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2006;103: 13271\u20135</ref> According to the Canadian Medical Association, it is crucial to both outlaw sex selection and fix the primary issue of son preference. Many laws already forbid fetal sex determination throughout countries in Asia, including China, but still continues to be a problem. Establishing responsibility to those performing illegal acts such as abortion is one step closer to ensuring a healthy, family oriented society. Holding doctors, clinics and establishments accountable by law is believed to make astounding differences in the sex preference.<ref>All-China Women's Federation Laws and regulations. Available: www.women.org.cn/english/english/laws/02.htm (accessed 2018 Apr. 16).</ref>\n\nSon preference as a whole, is largely challenging in the country. It is primarily important to spread public awareness though campaigns, media, and posters including advantages of females. The results of many campaigns such as the \"Care for Girls\" campaign on China, by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, encourages female births and requests participation from many neighboring countries. In one of the participating counties in Shanxi providence, the sex ratio birth was reduced from 135 in the year 2003 to 117 just three years later.<ref>Li SZ, Yan SH. A special study on \"care for girls\" campaign [article in Chinese]. Population and Family Planning 2008;10:23\u20134</ref> The country must implement a less traditional form of gender approach and encourage women for higher status positions in society. The Chinese government is essential in improving their gender and social rights. In 1992, the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women ensured women equal rights among politics, culture, education, work property rights and even marriage. Evidence shows that a country who supports higher status of women leads to a less traditional view of gender and lowers the level of son preference. All these socioeconomic improvements have led to a steer away from traditional views of women to a more modern approach, working to end the gender gap in entirety.\n\n=== Change in attitudes ===\nAlthough China's sex ratio at birth is still one of the highest in the world, growing evidence has shown that son preference in China is declining.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  In recent interviews, many young Chinese adults expressed the view that they do not care about the gender of their future child, even though son preference was common in their parents' generation.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  A recent study showed that among the 66% claiming to be gender indifferent, 13% (10% urban 16% rural) prefer a boy, and 21% (22% urban and 18% rural) want a girl.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" /> Hesketh points out that with the consideration of advantages of raising girls, including that they are easier to care for, easier to find a spouse for, and take good care of aging parents, gender indifference and girl preference increase in comparison with previous son preference.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Abortion in China]]\n* [[Female infanticide in China]]\n* [[Feminism in China]]\n* [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by gender ratio]]\n* [[One-child policy]]\n* [[Prostitution in China]]\n* [[Rural society in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Sex trafficking in China]]\n* [[Urban society in the People's Republic of China]] \n* [[Women's healthcare in the People's Republic of China]]\n\n===General===\n* [[Sex-selective abortion]]\n* [[Women in China]]\n* [[Missing women of Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in China]]\n[[Category:Sex selection in China]]\n", "text_old": "'''Missing women of China''' is a widely known phenomenon referring to the unusual shortfall of female population resulting from cultural influences and government policy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Xuefeng|first1=Chen|title=The Social Impact of China's One-child Policy|url=http://web.mit.edu/lipoff/www/hapr/summer03_security/CHEN.pdf|publisher=Harvard Asia Pacific Review|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> The term \"missing women\" was coined by economist [[Amartya Sen]], winner of the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, to describe a distorted population sex ratio in which the number of males far outweighs the number of females.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Siwan |authorlink1=Siwan Anderson |last2=Ray |first2=Debraj |authorlink2=Debraj Ray (economist) |title=Missing women: age and disease.|journal=The Review of Economic Studies |volume=77 |issue=4 |date=2010 |pages=1262\u20131300 |jstor=40836647 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-937X.2010.00609.x |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3f8983075355f4cc26b2d4eed8335d5fbf9f1c61 }}</ref> Female disadvantages in child survival throughout China reflects a long pattern of sex-based discrimination.

system.<ref name=\"aging-25years, F & M\" />\n\n== Reaction ==\n\n=== Change in laws and policies ===\n\nTo control the imbalanced sex ratio, which is caused by the combined effects of son preference, sex-selective abortion and one-child policy, the Chinese government has taken some effective measures.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> Laws forbidding infanticide, abandonment, and neglect of female children already exist.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2009\" />  There are also penalties for trafficking and kidnapping.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2009\" />  The Chinese government has also published laws forbidding foetal sex determination and sex-selective abortion.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" />\n\nChina has recruited unmarried young males from poor backgrounds into the [[People's Liberation Army]] and into the paramilitary [[People's Armed Police]].<ref name=\"Poston & Glover\" />  These armed personnel who were poor and unmarried males from China's rural areas have helped government maintain social stability in 1989.<ref name=\"Poston & Glover\" />\n\nImproving women's status can also help reduce the sex ratio at birth.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> The Chinese government pays more attention to women's legal rights, especially their economic development.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> More emphasis has been placed on forming laws and regulations for women's economic status, education opportunities, inheritance of family property, willingness of marriage, and old-age supports.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" />\n\nFrom 2005, 600 [[Chinese yuan]] per month is given as a pension to parents in rural areas who have daughters.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  In 2000, in order to establish a better survival environment for girls in Chaohu city, Anhui province, the \"Chaohu Experimental Zone Improving Girl-Child Survival Environment\" was established and implemented in 2003.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> The main activities were \"establishing specialized organizations, conducting trainings, punishing those found to be committing non-medical sex-selective abortions and infanticide, advocating for regulations and laws addressing gender equality, holding focus-group discussions for mothers-in-law, helping women to participate in socioeconomic activities by providing economic support, encouraging active male participation in the improvement of women's status, enhancing the social-security system, and popularizing uxorilocal marriages (in which husbands marry into wives' birth families), in addition to other activities.\"<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" />  The outcomes after three years was encouraging: the sex ratio at birth declined from more than 125 in 1999 to 114 in 2002.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\" /> Based on this program, in 2003, the Population and Family Planning Commission initiated a campaign called \"Care for Girls\" to encourage couples to consider the advantages of having girl children.<ref name=\"4th Asia Pacific Conference\">{{cite book|last=Li|first=Shuzhuo|title=Imbalanced sex ratio at birth and comprehensive intervention in China.|year=2007}}</ref>  The results were also significant: a survey in 2007 showed that son preference had decreased in participating areas and the sex ratio at birth in the rural of Shanxi province fell from 135 in 2003 to 118 in 2007.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />\n\n==== Two-child policy ====\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, the Chinese government modified its family planning laws to finally allow married couples to have a second child. In 2016 the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China reported that live births in national hospitals numbered 18.46 million and that the fertility rate reached 1.7 percent, the highest rate since 2000. The effect of the new policy to relax birth-planning regulations has debunked 400 million averted births. Since the policy has been enacted, 261.4 million unregistered people who have lived at their residence for at least 6 months were found.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hvistendahl|first1=Mara|title=China's Population Growing Slowly, Changing Fast|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6030/650.full|website=Science|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> The policy change has taken pressure off parents to participate in sex-selective abortion or even avoiding registering female babies at birth, as they now have room for two children. The implementation of the two-child policy has given families room to grow but also control population in the country, in a managed and more humane way.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lili|first1=Liu|title=China's two-child police one year on|journal=Economics, Politics and Public Policy in East Asia and the Pacific|date=19 April 2017|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2017/04/19/chinas-two-child-policy-one-year-on/|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> Although the two-child policy was implemented, the 35-year old social policy is unlikely to take part in a baby boom, in attempt to spark economic growth. The country is believed to be a true single-society even when given the option to take part in extending their family count.<ref>Hvistendahl, Mara. Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys over Girls, and the Consequences of a World Full of Men. PublicAffairs, 2012.</ref> The two-child policy is not expected to serve as a baby boom, rather a moderate increase in fertility among Chinese women. There are still effects resulting from the one-child policy which the two-child policy is intended to attempt to reverse, including population aging, reduction in sex ratio birth, more oppressive elements of child policy, contributions to economic growth and allow freedom to couples to have their desired number of children.<ref>Zhang, G and Zhao, Z. Re-examining China's fertility puzzle: data collection and quality over the last two decades. Popul Dev Rev. 2006; 32: 293\u2013321</ref>\n\n==== Policy responses ====\n\nAlthough there is extensive damage to the gender ratio throughout the country, it is still possible to implement change to benefit future generations of the country.<ref>Hesketh T, Zhu WX. Abnormal sex ratios in human populations: causes and consequences. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2006;103: 13271\u20135</ref> According to the Canadian Medical Association, it is crucial to both outlaw sex selection and fix the primary issue of son preference. Many laws already forbid fetal sex determination throughout countries in Asia, including China, but still continues to be a problem. Establishing responsibility to those performing illegal acts such as abortion is one step closer to ensuring a healthy, family oriented society. Holding doctors, clinics and establishments accountable by law is believed to make astounding differences in the sex preference.<ref>All-China Women's Federation Laws and regulations. Available: www.women.org.cn/english/english/laws/02.htm (accessed 2018 Apr. 16).</ref>\n\nSon preference as a whole, is largely challenging in the country. It is primarily important to spread public awareness though campaigns, media, and posters including advantages of females. The results of many campaigns such as the \"Care for Girls\" campaign on China, by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, encourages female births and requests participation from many neighboring countries. In one of the participating counties in Shanxi providence, the sex ratio birth was reduced from 135 in the year 2003 to 117 just three years later.<ref>Li SZ, Yan SH. A special study on \"care for girls\" campaign [article in Chinese]. Population and Family Planning 2008;10:23\u20134</ref> The country must implement a less traditional form of gender approach and encourage women for higher status positions in society. The Chinese government is essential in improving their gender and social rights. In 1992, the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women ensured women equal rights among politics, culture, education, work property rights and even marriage. Evidence shows that a country who supports higher status of women leads to a less traditional view of gender and lowers the level of son preference. All these socioeconomic improvements have led to a steer away from traditional views of women to a more modern approach, working to end the gender gap in entirety.\n\n=== Change in attitudes ===\nAlthough China's sex ratio at birth is still one of the highest in the world, growing evidence has shown that son preference in China is declining.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  In recent interviews, many young Chinese adults expressed the view that they do not care about the gender of their future child, even though son preference was common in their parents' generation.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  A recent study showed that among the 66% claiming to be gender indifferent, 13% (10% urban 16% rural) prefer a boy, and 21% (22% urban and 18% rural) want a girl.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" /> Hesketh points out that with the consideration of advantages of raising girls, including that they are easier to care for, easier to find a spouse for, and take good care of aging parents, gender indifference and girl preference increase in comparison with previous son preference.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Abortion in China]]\n* [[Female infanticide in China]]\n* [[Feminism in China]]\n* [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by gender ratio]]\n* [[One-child policy]]\n* [[Prostitution in China]]\n* [[Rural society in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Sex trafficking in China]]\n* [[Urban society in the People's Republic of China]] \n* [[Women's healthcare in the People's Republic of China]]\n\n===General===\n* [[Sex-selective abortion]]\n* [[Women in China]]\n* [[Missing women of Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in China]]\n[[Category:Sex selection in China]]\n", "name_user": "Vli66", "label": "safe", "comment": "added a link to the main article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_women_of_China"}

People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences, [[creation myth|creation]], or [[mythology]]. Different cultures and countries adopted their own constellations, some of which lasted into the early [[20th century]] before today's constellations were internationally recognized. The recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many have changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Others were limited to a single culture or nation.\n\nThe 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in [[Aratus]]' work ''Phenomena'' and [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries. Constellations in the far [[southern celestial hemisphere|southern sky]] were added from the [[15th century]] until the mid-[[18th century]] when European explorers began traveling to the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Twelve ancient constellations belong to the [[zodiac]] (straddling the [[ecliptic]], which the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain; its [[astrology|astrological]] divisions became prominent [[circa|c.]] 400 BC in [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]] or [[Chaldea]]n astronomy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=John P. |date=2010 |title=Studies in Babylonian lunar theory: part III.

Some [[stellar designation|astronomical naming systems]] include the constellation where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. The [[Flamsteed designation]] of a star, for example, consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation name.\n\nOther star patterns or groups called [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] are not constellations per se, but are used by observers to navigate the night sky. Asterisms may be several stars within a constellation, or they may share stars with more than one constellation. Examples of asterisms include the [[Pleiades]] and [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] within the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and the [[False Cross]] split between the southern constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], or Venus' Mirror in the constellation of [[Orion_(constellation)|Orion]].<ref name=\"DOCdb2018\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.docdb.net/show_object.php?id=saucepan\n|title=DOCdb Deep Sky Observer's Companion \u2013 the online database\n|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"SoftBisque2018\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.bisque.com/tom/asterisms/list.asp\n|title=A Complete List of Asterisms\n|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\nThe word \"constellation\" comes from the [[Late Latin]] term {{lang|la|c\u014dnstell\u0101ti\u014d}}, which can be translated as \"set of stars\"; it came into use in [[Middle English|English]] during the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/constellation#etymonline_v_18252}}</ref> The [[Ancient Greek]] word for constellation is [[wikt:\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd.]] These terms generally referred to a recognisable pattern of stars whose appearance is associated with mythological characters or creatures, earthbound animals, or objects.<ref name=\"oxforddic\" /> A more modern astronomical sense of the term \"constellation\" denotes one of the 88 [[IAU designated constellations]] recognized today.<ref name=\"oxforddicastro\">{{cite web |url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095633860 |title=constellation |work=Oxford Dictionary of Astronomy |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n \nColloquial usage does not draw a sharp distinction between \"constellations\" and smaller \"asterisms\" (pattern of stars), yet the modern accepted astronomical constellations employ such a distinction. E.g., the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] are both asterisms, and each lies within the boundaries of the constellation of Taurus. Another example is the northern asterism popularly known as the [[Big Dipper]] (US) or the Plough (UK), composed of the seven brightest stars within the area of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]-defined constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. The southern [[False Cross]] asterism includes portions of the constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] and the [[Summer Triangle]] is composed of the brightest stars in the constellations [[Lyra (constellation)|Lyra]], [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].\n\nA constellation (or star), viewed from a particular latitude on [[Earth]], that never sets below the [[horizon]] is termed [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]]. From the [[North Pole]] or [[South Pole]], all constellations south or north of the [[celestial equator]] are [[circumpolar constellation|circumpolar]]. Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie between declinations 45\u00b0 north and 45\u00b0 south,<ref name=harbord_goodwin1897/> or those that pass through the declination range of the ecliptic or [[zodiac]] ranging between 23\u00bd\u00b0 north, the celestial equator, and 23\u00bd\u00b0 south.<ref name=\"Norton14th\" /><ref name=steele1884 />\n\nStars in constellations can appear near each other in the sky, but they usually lie at a variety of distances away from the Earth. Since each star has its own independent motion, all constellations will change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, familiar outlines will become unrecognizable.<ref name=\"marc\">{{cite web\n|url=http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-space/constellations.html\n|title=Do Constellations Ever Break Apart or Change?\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref> Astronomers can predict the past or future constellation outlines by measuring individual stars' [[proper motion|common proper motions]] or cpm<ref name=\"Koupelis2007\">{{cite book\n|author=Theo Koupelis \n|author2=Karl F.

People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences, [[creation myth|creation]], or [[mythology]]. Different cultures and countries adopted their own constellations, some of which lasted into the early [[20th century]] before today's constellations were internationally recognized. The recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many have changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Others were limited to a single culture or nation.\n\nThe 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in [[Aratus]]' work ''Phenomena'' and [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries. Constellations in the far [[southern celestial hemisphere|southern sky]] were added from the [[15th century]] until the mid-[[18th century]] when European explorers began traveling to the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Twelve ancient constellations belong to the [[zodiac]] (straddling the [[ecliptic]], which the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain; its [[astrology|astrological]] divisions became prominent [[circa|c.]] 400 BC in [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]] or [[Chaldea]]n astronomy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=John P. |date=2010 |title=Studies in Babylonian lunar theory: part III.

Some [[stellar designation|astronomical naming systems]] include the constellation where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. The [[Flamsteed designation]] of a star, for example, consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation name.\n\nOther star patterns or groups called [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] are not constellations per se, but are used by observers to navigate the night sky. Asterisms may be several stars within a constellation, or they may share stars with more than one constellation. Examples of asterisms include the [[Pleiades]] and [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] within the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and the [[False Cross]] split between the southern constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], or Venus' Mirror in the constellation of [[Orion_(constellation)|Orion]].<ref name=\"DOCdb2018\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.docdb.net/show_object.php?id=saucepan\n|title=DOCdb Deep Sky Observer's Companion \u2013 the online database\n|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"SoftBisque2018\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.bisque.com/tom/asterisms/list.asp\n|title=A Complete List of Asterisms\n|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\nThe word \"constellation\" comes from the [[Late Latin]] term {{lang|la|c\u014dnstell\u0101ti\u014d}}, which can be translated as \"set of stars\"; it came into use in [[Middle English|English]] during the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/constellation#etymonline_v_18252}}</ref> The [[Ancient Greek]] word for constellation is [[wikt:\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd.]] These terms generally referred to a recognisable pattern of stars whose appearance is associated with mythological characters or creatures, earthbound animals, or objects.<ref name=\"oxforddic\" /> A more modern astronomical sense of the term \"constellation\" denotes one of the 88 [[IAU designated constellations]] recognized today.<ref name=\"oxforddicastro\">{{cite web |url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095633860 |title=constellation |work=Oxford Dictionary of Astronomy |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n \nColloquial usage does not draw a sharp distinction between \"constellations\" and smaller \"asterisms\" (pattern of stars), yet the modern accepted astronomical constellations employ such a distinction. E.g., the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] are both asterisms, and each lies within the boundaries of the constellation of Taurus. Another example is the northern asterism popularly known as the [[Big Dipper]] (US) or the Plough (UK), composed of the seven brightest stars within the area of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]-defined constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. The southern [[False Cross]] asterism includes portions of the constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] and the [[Summer Triangle]] is composed of the brightest stars in the constellations [[Lyra (constellation)|Lyra]], [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].\n\nA constellation (or star), viewed from a particular latitude on [[Earth]], that never sets below the [[horizon]] is termed [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]]. From the [[North Pole]] or [[South Pole]], all constellations south or north of the [[celestial equator]] are [[circumpolar constellation|circumpolar]]. Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie between declinations 45\u00b0 north and 45\u00b0 south,<ref name=harbord_goodwin1897/> or those that pass through the declination range of the ecliptic or [[zodiac]] ranging between 23\u00bd\u00b0 north, the celestial equator, and 23\u00bd\u00b0 south.<ref name=\"Norton14th\" /><ref name=steele1884 />\n\nStars in constellations can appear near each other in the sky, but they usually lie at a variety of distances away from the Earth. Since each star has its own independent motion, all constellations will change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, familiar outlines will become unrecognizable.<ref name=\"marc\">{{cite web\n|url=http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-space/constellations.html\n|title=Do Constellations Ever Break Apart or Change?\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref> Astronomers can predict the past or future constellation outlines by measuring individual stars' [[proper motion|common proper motions]] or cpm<ref name=\"Koupelis2007\">{{cite book\n|author=Theo Koupelis \n|author2=Karl F.
