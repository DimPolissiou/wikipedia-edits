It connects [[Middlesbrough]], on the south bank, to [[Port Clarence]], on the north bank.  It is a [[transporter bridge]], carrying a travelling 'car', or 'gondola', suspended from the bridge, across the river in 90 seconds. The gondola can carry 200 people, 9 cars, or 6 cars and one minibus. It carries the [[A178 road|A178]] Middlesbrough to Hartlepool road. Locally, the bridge is often referred to simply as 'the Transporter'.\n\n[[File:Middlesbrough transporter bridge (Wonder Book of Engineering Wonders, 1931).jpg|thumbnail|The gondola in 1931]]\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea of a transporter bridge across the River Tees was first mooted in 1872 when Charles Smith, Manager of the Hartlepool Iron Works, submitted a scheme to Middlesbrough Corporation.  However, the scheme was not pursued, and it would not be until the new century that the idea of a transporter bridge across the river would again be revisited. Following a 1907 [[Act of Parliament]] the Bridge was built at a cost of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]68,026 6[[Shilling (British coin)|s]] 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|68026|1907|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}} values),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} by [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]] of Glasgow between 1910 and 1911 to replace the 'Hugh Bell' and 'Erimus' steam [[ferry]] services.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howes |first= Brian |authorlink= |date=May 2009 |title=Building the Past \u2013 Middlesbrough Transport Bridge|journal=Best of British |volume= |issue= |pages=73 |issn=1355-6681}}</ref> A transporter bridge was chosen because Parliament ruled that the new scheme of crossing the river had to avoid affecting the river navigation.

In 1953, the gondola got stuck half-way. While it was stuck, [[gale]] force winds lashed water to within inches of it. However, despite this the gondola and the Transporter Bridge are still running in perfect order.\n\nIn 1974, the comedy actor [[Terry Scott]], travelling between his hotel in Middlesbrough and a performance at the [[Billingham]] Forum, mistook the bridge for a regular toll crossing and drove his [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] off the end of the roadway, landing in the safety netting beneath.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-19947021 |title=Transporter Bridge celebrations end with time capsule |work=BBC News (Tees) Website |date=15 October 2012 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1993, the bridge was awarded the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]' highest honour, The Heritage Plaque, for engineering excellence, in recognition of the Council's efforts in keeping the bridge in good working order. Its historical importance was also recognised in 1985 by its listing as a Grade II* [[Listed Building]] and its prominence as a local landmark was further enhanced in 1993 by the installation of floodlights that operate during the winter months.\n\nIt has been featured in films and TV programmes including ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[The Fast Show]]'', ''[[Spender]]'', and ''[[Steel River Blues]]''. In the [[millennium]] celebrations of 2000, [[firework]]s were fired from its length. The storyline of the third series of ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'', saw the bridge dismantled to be sold to and re-erected in the USA.

The bridge is the longest remaining transporter bridge in the world.\n[[File:Transporter Bridge.jpg|alt=Transporter Bridge - April 2018|thumb|269x269px|Transporter Bridge - April 2018]]\nThe bridge is currently owned by Middlesbrough Council and Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. Middlesbrough Council has control of the day-to-day operations and maintenance.  In 2011 the Tees Transporter Bridge received a \u00a32.6&nbsp;million Heritage Lottery Fund award for improvement and renovation work to mark the Bridge's centenary.

It connects [[Middlesbrough]], on the south bank, to [[Port Clarence]], on the north bank.  It is a [[transporter bridge]], carrying a travelling 'car', or 'gondola', suspended from the bridge, across the river in 90 seconds. The gondola can carry 200 people, 9 cars, or 6 cars and one minibus. It carries the [[A178 road|A178]] Middlesbrough to Hartlepool road. Locally, the bridge is often referred to simply as 'the Transporter'.\n\n[[File:Middlesbrough transporter bridge (Wonder Book of Engineering Wonders, 1931).jpg|thumbnail|The gondola in 1931]]\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea of a transporter bridge across the River Tees was first mooted in 1872 when Charles Smith, Manager of the Hartlepool Iron Works, submitted a scheme to Middlesbrough Corporation.  However, the scheme was not pursued, and it would not be until the new century that the idea of a transporter bridge across the river would again be revisited. Following a 1907 [[Act of Parliament]] the Bridge was built at a cost of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]68,026 6[[Shilling (British coin)|s]] 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|68026|1907|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}} values),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} by [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]] of Glasgow between 1910 and 1911 to replace the 'Hugh Bell' and 'Erimus' steam [[ferry]] services.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howes |first= Brian |authorlink= |date=May 2009 |title=Building the Past \u2013 Middlesbrough Transport Bridge|journal=Best of British |volume= |issue= |pages=73 |issn=1355-6681}}</ref> A transporter bridge was chosen because Parliament ruled that the new scheme of crossing the river had to avoid affecting the river navigation.

In 1953, the gondola got stuck half-way. While it was stuck, [[gale]] force winds lashed water to within inches of it. However, despite this the gondola and the Transporter Bridge are still running in perfect order.\n\nIn 1974, the comedy actor [[Terry Scott]], travelling between his hotel in Middlesbrough and a performance at the [[Billingham]] Forum, mistook the bridge for a regular toll crossing and drove his [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] off the end of the roadway, landing in the safety netting beneath.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-19947021 |title=Transporter Bridge celebrations end with time capsule |work=BBC News (Tees) Website |date=15 October 2012 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1993, the bridge was awarded the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]' highest honour, The Heritage Plaque, for engineering excellence, in recognition of the Council's efforts in keeping the bridge in good working order. Its historical importance was also recognised in 1985 by its listing as a Grade II* [[Listed Building]] and its prominence as a local landmark was further enhanced in 1993 by the installation of floodlights that operate during the winter months.\n\nIt has been featured in films and TV programmes including ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[The Fast Show]]'', ''[[Spender]]'', and ''[[Steel River Blues]]''. In the [[millennium]] celebrations of 2000, [[firework]]s were fired from its length. The storyline of the third series of ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'', saw the bridge dismantled to be sold to and re-erected in the USA. The local council received calls from people worried that the bridge was really being pulled down,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1985075.stm |title=Bridge not under threat, pet |work=BBC News |date=13 May 2002 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=20 January 2009 }}</ref> with the BBC adding a disclaimer on the end of the final episode of the series stating that 'The Transporter Bridge is still in Middlesbrough'.\n\nIn July 2000 a visitor centre was opened on land previously occupied by the bridge workshop<ref name=allan111>{{cite book |last=Allan |first=Dave |date=2011 |title=The Transporter 100 Years of the Tees Transporter Bridge |publisher=Middlesbrough Council |page=111 |isbn=0860830896 }}</ref> In August 2019, the bridge was temporarily closed for engineering works.\n\n== Facts and figures ==\n\nThe Tees Transporter Bridge has an overall length (including cantilevers) of {{convert|851|ft|m}}, leaving a span between the centres of the towers of {{convert|590|ft|m}}, the beam of the bridge being carried at a height of {{convert|160|ft|m}} above the road.

Middlesbrough Council has control of the day-to-day operations and maintenance.  In 2011 the Tees Transporter Bridge received a \u00a32.6&nbsp;million Heritage Lottery Fund award for improvement and renovation work to mark the Bridge's centenary.

The oldest known building in the Palace District, it was rebuilt in 1945 after being destroyed in World War II - and then was damaged badly again in 1956.  The Szent R\u00f3kus K\u00f3rh\u00e1z (St Roch Hospital) next door - was opened in 1796, but in its current incarnation offers few clues to its antiquity.\n\nA major impetus for the area's development after the great flood was the construction at its western end of the magnificent neo-classical [[Hungarian National Museum]] between 1837 and 1847, designed by the Viennese-born architect [[Mih\u00e1ly Pollack]], after whom the square behind the museum is named.  Meetings of the upper house of the Hungarian parliament, established as part of the compromise which founded the dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1867, were held in the National Museum until the opening of the new [[Hungarian parliament building]] in 1904.  The rest of Hungary's original parliament was established next door to the museum at F\u0151herceg S\u00e1ndor utca (Archduke Alexander Street) (today Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca) 8.  This street was named in honour of Hungary's Habsburg Palatine, or Viceroy, during the years 1790-95, [[Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria]], in 1840.\n\nThe building, completed in 1866, was designed by one of 19th century Budapest's great architects, [[Mikl\u00f3s Ybl]], who also designed the Opera House and the Basilica, as well as five of the Palotanegyed's palaces (Festetics, P\u00e1lffy, K\u00e1rolyi (on Pollack Mih\u00e1ly t\u00e9r), B\u00f3kay and Odescalchi/Degenfeld-Schomburg).  Today the old parliament building houses the Italian Cultural Institute.\n\nBetween 1860 and the outbreak of the First World War, members of the dual monarchy's aristocratic and mercantile elite - many of whom were members of parliament - built around 36 city palaces or mansions in the same area.<ref>R\u00e1cz Attila ed, Palotanegyed Most, Jelen, J\u00f6v\u00f6, J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros \u00d6nkorm\u00e1nyzat, 2012</ref>  The K\u00e1rolyi family built four palaces in the district, Count J\u00e1nos Zichy and his family three, while the B\u00e1nffy and Wenckheim families each built two.  The district's palaces were mostly constructed in the streets surrounding the Museum (today's Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca, Pollack Mih\u00e1ly t\u00e9r, Muzeum utca, Reviczky utca and \u00d6tpacsirta utca.\nBut a number were also built further east, including on today's L\u0151rinc pap t\u00e9r, Gyulai P\u00e1l utca, Hor\u00e1nszky utca, Szentkir\u00e1lyi utca and Trefort utca.  The other residential buildings constructed in the Palace District around the same time were designed mainly for middle or upper-middle class occupants.<ref>See, for example, the descriptions of J\u00f3zsef k\u00f6r\u00fat 37-39 and Kr\u00fady Gyula utca 12 in Lajos Csord\u00e1s, Walks Along the Great Boulevard, Budapest, Vince Books, 2008, pp. 166 and 170</ref> The term 'palota' ('palace') is used more elastically in Hungary (and in much of Continental Europe) than in the English-speaking world. In the Palotanegyed it refers to everything from genuine palaces (such as the Wenckeim Palace, now Szab\u00f3 Ervin Library) for aristocratic families, to buildings with generously-proportioned apartments for the wealthy upper-middle classes (such as the Emich Palace on Hor\u00e1nszky utca).\n\nThe Palace District is also notable for one of Budapest\u2019s two surviving buildings designed by the famous Viennese architects [[Fellner & Helmer]], the Istv\u00e1n K\u00e1rolyi or K\u00e1rolyi-Csekonics palace at M\u00fazeum utca 17. (The other is the [[V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z]] on the Szent Istv\u00e1n k\u00f6r\u00fat).\n\nOne of the great classical architects of Pest, [[J\u00f3zsef Hild]], designed one of the earlier buildings in the district, the 1842 Vir\u00e1gf\u00fcz\u00e9res h\u00e1z (\u2018Garland House\u2019) at Baross utca 40.

However there are also a number of buildings in the Hungarian Secession style, championed most famously by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]], notably the Gutenberg Otthon and several buildings on Vas utca, Baross utca and Kr\u00fady utca. Lechner\u2019s Jewish student B\u00e9la Lajta\u2019s designed the 1912 Count Sz\u00e9chenyi School of Trade on Vas utca, a striking contrast to most of the Palace District\u2019s architecture, fusing modernism, art deco and folk motifs. Its rich interior decoration, remarkably, survived World War II.\n \nOne of the lesser-known architects who designed buildings in the Palotanegyed's pre-World War One boom period was another Jewish architect, Adolf Greiner (born Losoncz, now Slovakia, 1847, died Budapest 1931). He designed the \u00dajpest synagogue, built 1885-86, and a number of inner Pest apartment buildings in the 1890s, including the four-storey building at Hor\u00e1nszky utca 27, built in 1892.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jvo.hu/dokumentumok/foepitesz/36608.pdf |title=Specs |website=www.jozsefvaros.hu |format=PDF |access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://adoc.tips/varosunk-budapesti-honismereti-hirado-szaz-eve-indult-meg-bu.html|title=V\u00e1rosunk.

It also contains a synagogue.<ref>Frojimovic et al, ibid., pp.202-3</ref> Its construction was financed by the Emperor and King Franz Joseph, and was originally named after him. (He visited it a month after its opening in November 1877). After the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, the rabbinical institute was seized by the SS and turned into a prison. [[Adolf Eichmann]] used it as a base to organise the deportation of Hungarian Jews, mainly to Auschwitz.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article on the institute, an important part of its library was seized by the Nazis. \u20183000 books were dispatched to Prague, where Eichmann planned the construction of a \"Museum of an extinct race\" in the former Jewish quarter. Only in the 1980s were the books discovered in the cellar of the Jewish Museum of Prague and brought back to Budapest in 1989. \u2018The library remains a source of pride for the university.

The damage was particularly bad around the Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat and K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r. But while buildings on the former were reconstructed more or less to their original state, on K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r many of the fine 19th century buildings on both sides of the square were demolished. More damage in both parts of the Palace District was inflicted during the 1956 uprising and the subsequent Soviet attack.\n\nThe communist regime neglected the district's buildings and committed some great acts of vandalism, especially the demolition in 1965 of the city's National Theatre, until 1908 the N\u00e9psz\u00ednh\u00e1z (People's Theatre - or Volkstheater) on Blaha Lujza t\u00e9r.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hungarytoday.hu/thursday-top-ten-lost-buildings-budapest-98926/|title=Top ten lost buildings in Budapest}}</ref> This building, much loved by Budapesters, had been constructed in 1875<ref>[[National Theatre (Budapest)]]</ref> to the designs of [[Fellner & Helmer]].  The loss of the National Theatre still seems to leave a gap on Blaha Lujza t\u00e9r.

In 1948 the regime also demolished the National Stables behind the Museum in 1948, replacing them in 1969 with a modern office block unsympathetic to its grand surroundings.\n\nAs the post-war communist regime consolidated its grip, the names of a number of streets and institutions in the Palotanegyed were changed.

At the same time, by the early post-communist period, the J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros had acquired a reputation amongst Hungarians as the poorest and most crime-ridden of the Pest districts.  This reputation reflected the dilapidation and poverty especially of the outer part of the district (i.e. east of the J\u00f3zsefk\u00f6r\u00fat) and the proportionately high population of typically poor gypsies in that area.  This reputation coloured perceptions of the whole of J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros, including, probably unfairly, the Palotanegyed. It was ironic given that historically the area had been one of the wealthiest parts of the city.\n\nOne of the early decisions of the post-1989 democratic authorities was to restore some pre-communist streetnames.  Hor\u00e1nszky utca and \u00d6tpacsirta utca reappeared although Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca, Puskin utca and Szab\u00f3 Ervin t\u00e9r remained unchanged.

Many of the district's palaces have been restored, and slowly but surely other buildings are following suit.  Local and international investors have seen that the area combines charm and inner-city convenience.  And the J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros local government has made much progress rebuilding the district's streets to make pedestrian-only areas, widen footpaths, rationalise parking, plant more trees and generally smarten the area up.  As of February 2020, areas completed include Reviczky utca, \u00d6tpacsirta utca, Miksz\u00e1th K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r, the area between the Szab\u00f3 Ervin library and Calvin t\u00e9r, L\u0151rinc pap t\u00e9r, Maria utca, K\u0151farag\u00f3 utca, Gyulai P\u00e1l utca, Hor\u00e1nszky utca, much of Kr\u00fady utca, Gutenberg t\u00e9r, Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca between the M\u00fazeum k\u00f6r\u00fat and Hor\u00e1nszky utca and R\u00f6kk Szill\u00e1rd utca.

The oldest known building in the Palace District, it was rebuilt in 1945 after being destroyed in World War II - and then was damaged badly again in 1956.  The Szent R\u00f3kus K\u00f3rh\u00e1z (St Roch Hospital) next door - was opened in 1796, but in its current incarnation offers few clues to its antiquity.\n\nA major impetus for the area's development after the great flood was the construction at its western end of the magnificent neo-classical [[Hungarian National Museum]] between 1837 and 1847, designed by the Viennese-born architect [[Mih\u00e1ly Pollack]], after whom the square behind the museum is named.  Meetings of the upper house of the Hungarian parliament, established as part of the compromise which founded the dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1867, were held in the National Museum until the opening of the new [[Hungarian parliament building]] in 1904.  The rest of Hungary's original parliament was established next door to the museum at F\u0151herceg S\u00e1ndor utca (Archduke Alexander Street) (today Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca) 8.  This street was named in honour of Hungary's Habsburg Palatine, or Viceroy, during the years 1790-95, [[Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria]], in 1840. \n\nThe building, completed in 1866, was designed by one of 19th century Budapest's great architects, [[Mikl\u00f3s Ybl]], who also designed the Opera House and the Basilica, as well as five of the Palotanegyed's palaces (Festetics, P\u00e1lffy, K\u00e1rolyi (on Pollack Mih\u00e1ly t\u00e9r), B\u00f3kay and Odescalchi/Degenfeld-Schomburg).  Today the old parliament building houses the Italian Cultural Institute.\n\nBetween 1860 and the outbreak of the First World War, members of the dual monarchy's aristocratic and mercantile elite - many of whom were members of parliament - built around 36 city palaces or mansions in the same area.<ref>R\u00e1cz Attila ed, Palotanegyed Most, Jelen, J\u00f6v\u00f6, J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros \u00d6nkorm\u00e1nyzat, 2012</ref>  The K\u00e1rolyi family built four palaces in the district, Count J\u00e1nos Zichy and his family three, while the B\u00e1nffy and Wenckheim families each built two.  The district's palaces were mostly constructed in the streets surrounding the Museum (today's Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca, Pollack Mih\u00e1ly t\u00e9r, Muzeum utca, Reviczky utca and \u00d6tpacsirta utca.\nBut a number were also built further east, including on today's L\u0151rinc pap t\u00e9r, Gyulai P\u00e1l utca, Hor\u00e1nszky utca, Szentkir\u00e1lyi utca and Trefort utca.  The other residential buildings constructed in the Palace District around the same time were designed mainly for middle or upper-middle class occupants.<ref>See, for example, the descriptions of J\u00f3zsef k\u00f6r\u00fat 37-39 and Kr\u00fady Gyula utca 12 in Lajos Csord\u00e1s, Walks Along the Great Boulevard, Budapest, Vince Books, 2008, pp. 166 and 170</ref> The term 'palota' ('palace') is used more elastically in Hungary (and in much of Continental Europe) than in the English-speaking world. In the Palotanegyed it refers to everything from genuine palaces (such as the Wenckeim Palace, now Szab\u00f3 Ervin Library) for aristocratic families, to buildings with generously-proportioned apartments for the wealthy upper-middle classes (such as the Emich Palace on Hor\u00e1nszky utca).\n\nThe Palace District is also notable for one of Budapest\u2019s two surviving buildings designed by the famous Viennese architects [[Fellner & Helmer]], the Istv\u00e1n K\u00e1rolyi or K\u00e1rolyi-Csekonics palace at M\u00fazeum utca 17. (The other is the [[V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z]] on the Szent Istv\u00e1n k\u00f6r\u00fat).\n\nOne of the great classical architects of Pest, [[J\u00f3zsef Hild]], designed one of the earlier buildings in the district, the 1842 Vir\u00e1gf\u00fcz\u00e9res h\u00e1z (\u2018Garland House\u2019) at Baross utca 40.

However there are also a number of buildings in the Hungarian Secession style, championed most famously by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]], notably the Gutenberg Otthon and several buildings on Vas utca, Baross utca and Kr\u00fady utca. Lechner\u2019s Jewish student B\u00e9la Lajta\u2019s designed the 1912 Count Sz\u00e9chenyi School of Trade on Vas utca, a striking contrast to most of the Palace District\u2019s architecture, fusing modernism, art deco and folk motifs. Its rich interior decoration, remarkably, survived World War II.\n \nOne of the lesser-known architects who designed buildings in the Palotanegyed's pre-World War One boom period was another Jewish architect, Adolf Greiner (born Losoncz, now Slovakia, 1847, died Budapest 1931). He designed the \u00dajpest synagogue, built 1885-86, and a number of inner Pest apartment buildings in the 1890s, including the four-storey building at Hor\u00e1nszky utca 27, built in 1892.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jvo.hu/dokumentumok/foepitesz/36608.pdf |title=Specs |website=www.jozsefvaros.hu |format=PDF |access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://adoc.tips/varosunk-budapesti-honismereti-hirado-szaz-eve-indult-meg-bu.html|title=V\u00e1rosunk.

It also contains a synagogue<ref>Frojimovic et al, ibid., pp.202-3</ref>. Its construction was financed by the Emperor and King Franz Joseph, and was originally named after him. (He visited it a month after its opening in November 1877). After the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, the rabbinical institute was seized by the SS and turned into a prison. [[Adolf Eichmann]] used it as a base to organise the deportation of Hungarian Jews, mainly to Auschwitz.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article on the institute, an important part of its library was seized by the Nazis. \u20183000 books were dispatched to Prague, where Eichmann planned the construction of a \"Museum of an extinct race\" in the former Jewish quarter. Only in the 1980s were the books discovered in the cellar of the Jewish Museum of Prague and brought back to Budapest in 1989. \u2018The library remains a source of pride for the university.

But while buildings on the former were reconstructed more or less to their original state, on K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r many of the fine 19th century buildings on both sides of the square were demolished. More damage in both parts of the Palace District was inflicted during the 1956 uprising and the subsequent Soviet attack. \n\nThe communist regime neglected the district's buildings and committed some great acts of vandalism, especially the demolition in 1965 of the city's National Theatre, until 1908 the N\u00e9psz\u00ednh\u00e1z (People's Theatre - or Volkstheater) on Blaha Lujza t\u00e9r.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hungarytoday.hu/thursday-top-ten-lost-buildings-budapest-98926/|title=Top ten lost buildings in Budapest}}</ref> This building, much loved by Budapesters, had been constructed in 1875<ref>[[National Theatre (Budapest)]]</ref> to the designs of [[Fellner & Helmer]].  The loss of the National Theatre still seems to leave a gap on Blaha Lujza t\u00e9r.

In 1948 the regime also demolished the National Stables behind the Museum in 1948, replacing them in 1969 with a modern office block unsympathetic to its grand surroundings.\n\nAs the post-war communist regime consolidated its grip, the names of a number of streets and institutions in the Palotanegyed were changed.

The one survival, the Muz\u00e9um, though it calls itself a caf\u00e9-restaurant is today only a restaurant.\n\n== Since 1989 ==\n\nDespite the occasional acts of disdain and vandalism shown by the communist regime towards Budapest's historical fabric, the vast majority of the Palotanegyed's pre-World War II buildings survived war, revolution, Soviet occupation and the socialist decades.  At the same time, by the early post-communist period, the J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros had acquired a reputation amongst Hungarians as the poorest and most crime-ridden of the Pest districts.  This reputation reflected the dilapidation and poverty especially of the outer part of the district (i.e. east of the J\u00f3zsefk\u00f6r\u00fat) and the proportionately high population of typically poor gypsies in that area.  This reputation coloured perceptions of the whole of J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros, including, probably unfairly, the Palotanegyed. It was ironic given that historically the area had been one of the wealthiest parts of the city.\n\nOne of the early decisions of the post-1989 democratic authorities was to restore some pre-communist streetnames.  Hor\u00e1nszky utca and \u00d6tpacsirta utca reappeared although Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca, Puskin utca and Szab\u00f3 Ervin t\u00e9r remained unchanged. The 1930 statue of Count Nandor Zichy in front of what was his palace on L\u00f6rinc Pap t\u00e9r returned.\n\n[[File:Palotanegyed_planned_road-pedestrian_improvements.jpg|left|thumb|Palotanegyed map (2009) showing existing and planned road/footpath reconstruction]][[File:The elegant entrance of Br\u00f3dy House, in the Tauffer Palace, Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor u. 10.jpg|right|thumb|The elegant entrance of Br\u00f3dy House, in the Tauffer Palace, Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor u. 10]]Since the mid-1990s, the Palotanegyed's fortunes have steadily recovered.  Many of the district's palaces have been restored, and slowly but surely other buildings are following suit.  Local and international investors have seen that the area combines charm and inner-city convenience.  And the J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros local government has made much progress rebuilding the district's streets to make pedestrian-only areas, widen footpaths, rationalise parking, plant more trees and generally smarten the area up.  As of February 2020, areas completed include Reviczky utca, \u00d6tpacsirta utca, Miksz\u00e1th K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r, the area between the Szab\u00f3 Ervin library and Calvin t\u00e9r, L\u0151rinc pap t\u00e9r, Maria utca, K\u0151farag\u00f3 utca, Gyulai P\u00e1l utca, Hor\u00e1nszky utca, much of Kr\u00fady utca, Gutenberg t\u00e9r, Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca between the M\u00fazeum k\u00f6r\u00fat and Hor\u00e1nszky utca and R\u00f6kk Szill\u00e1rd utca.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jachts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most notable  of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is also important. \n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|Auxilliary diesel yacht engine]]\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of [[jib]] and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and [[trysail]] (in place of the [[mainsail]]).

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jachts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most notable  of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is also important. \n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|Auxilliary diesel yacht engine]]\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of [[jib]] and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and [[trysail]] (in place of the [[mainsail]]).
