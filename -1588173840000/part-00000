In 1992, he switched to [[FC Spartak Moscow]] but, unsettled, finished the season at neighbours [[FC Dynamo Moscow|FC Dynamo]], being eventually crowned the [[Russian Premier League|first division]]'s top scorer at 16 goals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesr/rus92.html|title=Russia 1992|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nGasimov was bought by [[Spain]]'s [[Real Betis]] in January 1993, but would appear very irregularly in his two 1/2 seasons at the [[Andalusia]] side. After just three [[La Liga]] appearances in [[1994\u201395 La Liga|his final season]], he finished his stint in the country with two clubs (and two relegations), [[Albacete Balompi\u00e9]] and [[\u00c9cija Balompi\u00e9]] (the latter in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|second division]], where he failed to score).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mitosfutbolisticos.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/velli-kasumov/|title=El \"goleador\" del Caspio: Velli Kasumov|trans-title=The \"scorer\" from the Caspian Sea: Velli Kasumov|publisher=Mitos Futbol\u00edsticos|language=Spanish|date=10 April 2010|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn summer 1997, Gasimov moved to [[Portugal]] with [[Vit\u00f3ria F.C.|Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal]].

That was the worst possible place for a fire to erupt, since it prevented Grissom from reaching a latch that would have opened a valve and vented the high-pressure atmosphere, thus slowing the flames.\"</ref> but their deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal hazards in the early Apollo Command Module design, workmanship and conditions of the test, including the highly pressurized 100% [[oxygen]] pre-launch atmosphere, many wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and the astronauts' flight suits, and a hatch which could not be quickly opened in an emergency.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollo204/find.html|title=Findings, Determinations And Recommendations|date=April 5, 1967|work=Report of Apollo 204 Review Board|publisher=NASA|quote=No single ignition source of the fire was conclusively identified.}}</ref> After the incident, these problems were fixed, and the Apollo program carried on successfully to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nWhite was buried with full [[military honors]] at [[West Point Cemetery]] while Grissom and Chaffee are both buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usma.edu/history/SiteAssets/SitePages/Cemetery/West%20Point%20Cemetery.pdf|title=West Point Cemetery|publisher=United States Military Academy West Point|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225231003/https://www.usma.edu/history/SiteAssets/SitePages/Cemetery/West%20Point%20Cemetery.pdf|archive-date=February 25, 2014|access-date=January 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, White was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]].

Accelerated by the pure oxygen, the flames climbed along the left-hand wall of the spacecraft, feeding on fabric and netting used for storage.

It operated between November 8-12, 1954 at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) with a maximum sustained power of 2.5 [[megawatts]] (MW), and generated a total of 96 MW-hours of energy<ref name=\"ornl1845\"></ref>. \n\nThe ARE was the first reactor to use circulating [[molten salt]] fuel. The hundreds of engineers and scientists working on ARE provided technical data, facilities, equipment, and experience that enabled the broader development of [[molten salt reactors]] as well as [[Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor |liquid metal cooled reactors ]]. \n\n== Background ==\nThe concept of nuclear-powered aircraft was first formally studied in May 1946 by the [[US Army Air Forces]].<ref name=\"nuclearflight\">{{cite book |last1=Gantz |first1=Kenneth |title=Nuclear flight; the United States Air Force programs for atomic jets, missiles, and rockets. |date=1960 |publisher=Duell, Sloan and Pearce |location=New York |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015001555146&view=1up&seq=16 |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> It was supposed that the unique characteristics of nuclear power could be applied to long-range supersonic flight, which was considered highly valuable in terms of military strategy. Challenges in the proposal were understood immediately, and by 1950 the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] joined with the Air Force to study the possibilities via technology development in the [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] (ANP) program.\n\nThe ORNL staff of the ANP project decided that technical information and experience needed to support the objective of nuclear-powered flight could most economically be obtained from building and operating the ARE. They considered the task of flying a supersonic airplane on nuclear energy exceedingly complex, and thought more than one experimental reactor may be necessary before sufficient information was obtained to design and construct a reactor for flight. \n\nOriginally, the ARE was conceived as a liquid [[sodium]] metal-cooled [[Beryllium oxide]] (BeO)-moderated solid-fuel reactor. The BeO moderator blocks were purchased with the solid-fuel design in mind. However, concerns regarding [[Nuclear_chain_reaction|chain reaction]] stability related to [[xenon]] in solid fuel at very high temperatures were serious enough to warrant abandoning solid fuel and replacing it with circulating fluid fuel. A fluid-fueled option with molten fluoride salt was worked into the original design.<ref name=\"bettis57\">{{cite journal |last1=Bettis |first1=E.S. |last2=Schroeder |first2=R.W. |last3=Cristy |first3=G.A. |title=The Aircraft Reactor Experiment\u2014Design and Construction |journal=Nuclear Science and Engineering |date=1957 |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=804\u2013825 |doi=10.13182/NSE57-A35495 }}</ref>\n\n== Reactor ==\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram.png|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram]]\n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment cross section.png|thumb|A cross-section of the fluid-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment, an experimental nuclear reactor that operated in 1954]]\n\nThe ARE was designed to be a prototype of a 350-megawatt, BeO-moderated, circulating-fuel aircraft reactor. It used a fuel composed of 53.09 mole % NaF, 40.73 mole % ZrF<sub>4</sub>, and 6.18 mole % UF<sub>4</sub>. The reactor was a BeO cylinder with bent tubes directing flowing fuel through the core in both directions.

The design fuel temperature was 1500\u00b0F (816\u00b0C), with a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) temperature rise across the core, though the peak temperature reached 1580\u00b0F (860\u00b0C) in steady operation and peaked at 1620\u00b0F (882\u00b0C) in transients. 46 gallons of fuel flowed through the reactor per minute at a core pressure of about 40 psig (2.76 bar). Sodium was pumped through the reactor at a rate of 150 gallons (568l) per minute with about 50 psig (3.45 bar) of pressure.<ref name=\"ornl1845\"></ref>\n\nThe fuel salt transferred heat to a [[helium]] loop, which then transferred the heat to water. Additionally, the reflector and [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] blocks were cooled with a liquid sodium metal cooling loop, which also transferred heat to helium and then water. \n\nThe reactor contained one [[Startup neutron source|neutron source]] (15 [[Curie|Curies]] of Polonium-Beryllium), 1 regulating rod, and 3 helium-cooled [[boron carbide]] shim rods. The experiment was instrumented with 2 [[fission chambers]], 2 compensated [[ionization chamber|ionization chambers]], and 800 [[thermocouples]]. \n\nThe ARE control system could automatically [[scram]] the reactor based on high [[neutron flux]], fast [[Inhour equation|reactor period]], high reactor exit fuel temperature, low heat exchanger fuel temperature, low fuel flow rate, and loss of offsite power.\n\n== Development Program ==\n[[File:Natural-convection corrosion test loops.jpg|thumb|Natural-convection corrosion test loops used during the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project to down-select workable fuel/material combinations]]\n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment full-scale mockup.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment full-scale mockup with clear tubes.

[[natural convection|Natural-convection]] [[corrosion]] test loops were operated to down-select suitable material and fuel combinations. Subsequent studies in forced-circulation test loops established means to minimize corrosion and [[mass transfer]].\n\nDevelopment of pumps, [[heat exchangers]], [[valves]], [[Pressure_sensor|pressure instrumentation]], and [[cold trap|cold traps]] spanned from late 1951 to summer 1954. Much of the work was based on extensive experience at lower temperature from [[Argonne National Laboratory]] and the [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]]. \n\nTechniques had to be developed concerning the construction, preheating, instrumentation, and insulation of reliable leak-tight high-temperature circuits made of [[Inconel]]. They found that all-welded construction was necessary. \n\nIn all, equipment development in support of high-temperature leak-tight operation lasted about 4 years. <ref name=\"components\">{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=H.W. |title=Components of the fused-salt and sodium circuits of the aircraft reactor experiment |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1958-09-18 |issue=ORNL-2348 |osti=4308571 }}</ref>\n\nThe ARE Hazard Summary Report<ref name=\"hazards\">{{cite journal |last1=Cottrell |first1=W.B. |title=AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT HAZARDS SUMMARY REPORT |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1952-11-24 |issue=ORNL-1407 |osti=4704625 }}</ref> was issued on November 24, 1952. \n\nA low-temperature critical mockup of the reactor was assembled to verify the calculation models.

It became critical with a mass of 32.8 lbs (14.9kg) [[Uranium-235]]. It was very stable as a result of its strong negative [[Fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity|fuel temperature coefficient]] (measured at -9.8e-5 dk/k/\u00b0F). \n\nThe assembly was first sufficiently assembled on August 1, 1954, at which point a three-shift operation commenced for tests. Hot sodium metal was flowed through the system beginning on September 26 to test the process equipment and instrumentation. Problems with the sodium vent and sodium purification systems required lengthy repairs. After several sodium dumps and recharges, carrier salt was introduced to the system on October 25th. Fuel was first added to the reactor on October 30, 1954. Initial [[Criticality_(status)|criticality]] was reached at 3:45 P.M. on November 3, after a painstaking and careful process of adding the [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] fuel. Much of the 4 days was spent removing plugs and repairing leaks in the enrichment line. \n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality]]\n\nA series of fuel samples were taken periodically. Most notably, they showed an increase in [[Chromium]] content at a rate of 50 ppm/day, indicating rapid corrosion of the fuel pipes. \n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment Typical Control Rod Scene.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment Control Rod Scene during operation: examining charts during rod calibration experiments]]\n\nA series of experiments were performed in the ARE supporting its mission<ref name=\"ornl1845\">{{cite journal |last1=Cottrell |first1=W.B. |title=Operation of the aircraft reactor experiment |journal=Oak Ridge National Lab. |date=1955-09-06 |issue=ORNL-1845 |osti=4237975 }}</ref>.\n\n* Critical experiment\n* Subcritical measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Power determination at 1 Watt (nominal)\n* Regulating rod calibration vs. fuel addition\n* Fuel system characteristics\n* Power determination at 10 Watts\n* Regulating rod calibration vs. reactor period\n* Calibration of shim rod vs. regulating rod\n* Effect of fuel flow on reactivity\n* Low-power measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Adjustment of chamber position\n* Approach to power: 10-kW run\n* Test of off-gas system\n* Approach to power: 100-kW to 1-MW runs\n* High-power measurement of the fuel temperature coefficient\n* High-power measurement of the reactor temperature coefficient\n* Reactor startup on temperature coefficient\n* Sodium temperature coefficient\n* Effect of a [[Dollar (reactivity)|dollar]] of reactivity\n* High-power measurement of reactor temperature coefficient\n* Moderator temperature coefficient\n* Xenon run at full power\n* Reactivity effects of sodium flow\n* Xenon buildup at one-tenth full power\n* Operation at maximum power\n\nAt 4:19 P.M. on November 8, during the ascent to high power, the reactor was shut down due to high airborne radioactivity measurements in the basement. It appeared that the gas fittings to the main fuel pump were leaking [[Nuclear_fission_product|fission-product]] gases and vapors into the pits, and the pits were leaking into the basement through defective seals in some electrical junction panels. A 2-in. pipeline was run from the pits 1000 ft. (305m) south into an uninhabited valley. Portable [[compressors]] and a jet were used to bring the pits to sub-atmospheric pressure for the rest of the experiment. The safety radiation detectors shut down the reactor a few times during restart and were withdrawn to be further away from the reactor. Eventually, the reactor started back up and reached high power. \n\nOn November 12, operation of the reactor was demonstrated to Air Force and ANP personnel who had gathered at ORNL for a quarterly information meeting. [[Load following power plant|Load following]] was demonstrated by turning the blowers on and off. With all operational objectives attained, the decision to cease operation was made. Colonel Clyde D. Gasser was visiting the lab at this time and was invited to officiate the termination of the experiment. At 8:04 P.M., he scrammed the reactor for the last time. \n\n[[File:Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.jpg|thumb|Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.

On November 13th, the fuel was transferred to the fuel dump tank. Pressurized carrier salt flushed the pipes and diluted the dump tank. Flush salt was heated to 100\u00b0F above the system temperature and pumped through the fuel channels. Operators observed the thermocouples to ensure flush salt flowed in all channels. \n\nAfter the fuel dump, the operating personnel had to evacuate the building for 1 hour after gas from the fuel purge operation which had been discharged out the stack descended and entered the ventilators on the building roof. The sodium system was drained without incident. \n\nTwo flat 6 ft. by 4 ft.

It operated between November 8-12, 1954 at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) with a maximum sustained power of 2.5 [[megawatts]] (MW), and generated a total of 96 MW-hours of energy<ref name=\"ornl1845\"></ref>. \n\nThe ARE was the first reactor to use circulating [[molten salt]] fuel.

Challenges in the proposal were understood immediately, and by 1950 the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] joined with the Air Force to study the possibilities via technology development in the [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] (ANP) program.\n\nThe ORNL staff of the ANP project decided that technical information and experience needed to support the objective of nuclear-powered flight could most economically be obtained from building and operating the ARE. They considered the task of flying a supersonic airplane on nuclear energy exceedingly complex, and thought more than one experimental reactor may be necessary before sufficient information was obtained to design and construct a reactor for flight. \n\nOriginally, the ARE was conceived as a liquid [[sodium]] metal-cooled [[Beryllium oxide]] (BeO)-moderated solid-fuel reactor. The BeO moderator blocks were purchased with the solid-fuel design in mind. However, concerns regarding [[Nuclear_chain_reaction|chain reaction]] stability related to [[xenon]] in solid fuel at very high temperatures were serious enough to warrant abandoning solid fuel and replacing it with circulating fluid fuel. A fluid-fueled option with molten fluoride salt was worked into the original design.<ref name=\"bettis57\">{{cite journal |last1=Bettis |first1=E.S. |last2=Schroeder |first2=R.W. |last3=Cristy |first3=G.A. |title=The Aircraft Reactor Experiment\u2014Design and Construction |journal=Nuclear Science and Engineering |date=1957 |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=804\u2013825 |doi=10.13182/NSE57-A35495 }}</ref>\n\n== Reactor ==\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram.png|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram]]\n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment cross section.png|thumb|A cross-section of the fluid-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment, an experimental nuclear reactor that operated in 1954]]\n\nThe ARE was designed to be a prototype of a 350-megawatt, BeO-moderated, circulating-fuel aircraft reactor.

The design fuel temperature was 1500\u00b0F (816\u00b0C), with a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) temperature rise across the core, though the peak temperature reached 1580\u00b0F (860\u00b0C) in steady operation and peaked at 1620\u00b0F (882\u00b0C) in transients. 46 gallons of fuel flowed through the reactor per minute at a core pressure of about 40 psig (2.76 bar). Sodium was pumped through the reactor at a rate of 150 gallons (568l) per minute with about 50 psig (3.45 bar) of pressure.<ref name=\"ornl1845\"></ref>\n\nThe fuel salt transferred heat to a [[helium]] loop, which then transferred the heat to water.

[[natural convection|Natural-convection]] [[corrosion]] test loops were operated to down-select suitable material and fuel combinations. Subsequent studies in forced-circulation test loops established means to minimize corrosion and [[mass transfer]].\n\nDevelopment of pumps, [[heat exchangers]], [[valves]], [[Pressure_sensor|pressure instrumentation]], and [[cold trap|cold traps]] spanned from late 1951 to summer 1954. Much of the work was based on extensive experience at lower temperature from [[Argonne National Laboratory]] and the [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]]. \n\nTechniques had to be developed concerning the construction, preheating, instrumentation, and insulation of reliable leak-tight high-temperature circuits made of [[Inconel]].

It became critical with a mass of 32.8 lbs (14.9kg) [[Uranium-235]]. It was very stable as a result of its strong negative [[Fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity|fuel temperature coefficient]] (measured at -9.8e-5 dk/k/\u00b0F). \n\nThe assembly was first sufficiently assembled on August 1, 1954, at which point a three-shift operation commenced for tests. Hot sodium metal was flowed through the system beginning on September 26 to test the process equipment and instrumentation. Problems with the sodium vent and sodium purification systems required lengthy repairs. After several sodium dumps and recharges, carrier salt was introduced to the system on October 25th. Fuel was first added to the reactor on October 30, 1954. Initial [[Criticality_(status)|criticality]] was reached at 3:45 P.M. on November 3, after a painstaking and careful process of adding the [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] fuel. Much of the 4 days was spent removing plugs and repairing leaks in the enrichment line. \n\n[[File:Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality.jpg|thumb|Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality]]\n\nA series of fuel samples were taken periodically.

It appeared that the gas fittings to the main fuel pump were leaking [[Nuclear_fission_product|fission-product]] gases and vapors into the pits, and the pits were leaking into the basement through defective seals in some electrical junction panels. A 2-in. pipeline was run from the pits 1000 ft. (305m) south into an uninhabited valley. Portable [[compressors]] and a jet were used to bring the pits to sub-atmospheric pressure for the rest of the experiment. The safety radiation detectors shut down the reactor a few times during restart and were withdrawn to be further away from the reactor. Eventually, the reactor started back up and reached high power. \n\nOn November 12, operation of the reactor was demonstrated to Air Force and ANP personnel who had gathered at ORNL for a quarterly information meeting. [[Load following power plant|Load following]] was demonstrated by turning the blowers on and off. With all operational objectives attained, the decision to cease operation was made. Colonel Clyde D. Gasser was visiting the lab at this time and was invited to officiate the termination of the experiment. At 8:04 P.M., he scrammed the reactor for the last time. \n\n[[File:Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.jpg|thumb|Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.

On November 13th, the fuel was transferred to the fuel dump tank. Pressurized carrier salt flushed the pipes and diluted the dump tank. Flush salt was heated to 100\u00b0F above the system temperature and pumped through the fuel channels. Operators observed the thermocouples to ensure flush salt flowed in all channels. \n\nAfter the fuel dump, the operating personnel had to evacuate the building for 1 hour after gas from the fuel purge operation which had been discharged out the stack descended and entered the ventilators on the building roof.

Some legal requirements come from ''[[malum in se]]'' considerations, or the desire to prevent indisputably bad phenomena, e.g. explosions or bridge collapses. Other legal requirements come from ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' considerations, or factors that are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses from a business district or residences from a residential district. An attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built, either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable (the bridge design will not cause a collapse), or that the custom is no longer needed (acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=l3D7CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=%22Construction%20law%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=%22Construction%20law%22%20-wikipedia&f=false|title=Construction Law: From Beginner to Practitioner|last=Mason|first=Jim|date=2016-04-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317391777|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Authority having jurisdiction====\n{{See also|Planning permission}}\n[[File:Mall culture jakarta57.jpg|thumb|Digging the foundation for a building construction in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]\nIn construction, the '''authority having jurisdiction''' (AHJ) is the governmental agency or sub-agency that regulates the construction process. In most cases, this is the [[municipality]] where the building is located. However, construction performed for supra-municipal authorities are usually regulated directly by the owning authority, which becomes the AHJ.\n[[File:Liberty Memorial 043.jpg|thumb|Construction on the Federal Reserve building in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]]]\nBefore the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services. This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities, which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations. During the construction of a building, the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local '''[[building code]]'''. Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed, an '''[[occupancy]] permit''' may be issued.\n\nAn operating building must remain in compliance with the '''[[Fire safety|fire code]]'''. The fire code is enforced by the local fire department or a municipal code enforcement office.\n\nChanges made to a building that affect safety, including its use, expansion, structural integrity, and [[fire protection]] items, usually require approval of the AHJ for review concerning the building code.\n\n===Design===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nIn the industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts. The design usually consists of [[drawing]]s and [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]], usually prepared by a design team including [[architect]], [[civil engineer]]s, [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical engineers]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]], [[structural engineer]]s, [[Fire protection engineering|fire protection engineers]], planning [[consultant]]s, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a [[bill of quantities]] provided by a [[quantity surveyor]]. Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.\n\nThe best modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties, especially among large firms. In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the larger firms. Presently, a firm that is nominally an \"architecture\" or \"construction management\" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees, or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may offer itself as \"one-stop shopping\" for a construction project, from beginning to end. This is designated as a \"design build\" contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=U6gvCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=%22Construction%20design%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PR13#v=onepage&q=%22Construction%20design%22%20-wikipedia&f=false|title=The Latest Methods of Construction Design|last=Dynybyl|first=Vojt\u011bch|last2=Berka|first2=Ondrej|last3=Petr|first3=Karel|last4=Lopot|first4=Franti\u0161ek|last5=Dub|first5=Martin|date=2015-12-09|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319227627|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSeveral project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including design-build, partnering and construction management. In general, each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects, interior designers, engineers and constructors throughout design and construction. In response, many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process.\n\nThe increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained in all phases of the project's life-cycle and develop an appreciation of the building as an advanced technological system requiring close integration of many sub-systems and their individual components, including sustainability. [[Architectural engineering|Building engineering]] is an emerging discipline that attempts to meet this new challenge.\n\n===Finance===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)]]\n | width     =\n | image1    = Trump International Hotel and Tower, Chicago (0837).JPG\n | width1    = 140\n | caption1  = May 23, 2006\n | image2    = 20070914 Trump International Hotel & Tower - Chicago.JPG\n | width2    = 140\n | caption2  = September 14, 2007 (3 months before completion)\n}}\n\nConstruction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems. Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project. [[Cash flow]] problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials, and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time, can arise even when the overall total is enough. [[Fraud]] is a problem in many fields, but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global construction industry faces growing threat of economic crime|url=http://pwc.blogs.com/press_room/2010/04/global-construction-industry-faces-growing-threat-of-economic-crime.html|website=pwc|publisher=pwc|accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project.\n\n[[Mortgage bank]]ers, [[accountant]]s, and [[Cost engineering|cost engineers]] are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project. The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely, even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project. Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process. Cost engineers and [[estimators]] apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation. Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/05/27/news/top_stories/22_07_545_26_07.txt|title=North County News \u2013 San Diego Union Tribune|website=www.nctimes.com}}</ref>\n\nLarge projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with a conceptual estimate performed by a [[building estimator]]. As portions of a project are completed, they may be sold, supplanting one lender or owner for another, while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and materials available for each stage of the building construction project carries forward. In many English-speaking countries, but not the United States, projects typically use quantity surveyors.\n\n===Legal aspects===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2006}}\n{{Main|Construction law}}\n[[File:401-403-410 and Construction crop.png|thumb|Construction along [[Ontario Highway 401]], widening the road from six to twelve travel lanes]]\nA construction project must fit into the legal framework governing the property. These include governmental regulations on the use of property, and obligations that are created in the process of construction.\n\nA construction project is a complex net of [[contract]]s and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.\n\nLegal advisors in the beginning of a construction project seek to identify ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structure, and to present options for preventing problems. Throughout the process of the project, they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise. In each case, the lawyer facilitates an exchange of obligations that matches the reality of the project.\n\n===Interaction of expertise===\n[[File:UnderConstruction-Apt.jpg|thumb|Apartment complex under construction in [[Daegu]], [[South Korea]]]]\nDesign, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use. The financial structure must accommodate the need for building the design provided, and must pay amounts that are legally owed. The legal structure must integrate the design into the surrounding legal framework, and enforce the financial consequences of the construction process.\n\n===Procurement===\nProcurement describes the merging of activities undertaken by the client to obtain a building. There are many different methods of construction procurement; however, the three most common types of procurement are traditional ([[design\u2013bid\u2013build]]), design-build and management contracting.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=miWPDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1&dq=%22Construction%20procurement%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=%22Construction%20procurement%22%20-wikipedia&f=false|title=Collaborative Construction Procurement and Improved Value|last=Mosey|first=David|date=2019-05-20|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119151913|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship among the principal, the contractor, and other stakeholders within a construction project. New forms include partnering such as Public-Private Partnering (PPPs) aka [[private finance initiative]]s (PFIs) and alliances such as \"pure\" or \"project\" alliances and \"impure\" or \"strategic\" alliances. The focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry.\n\n====Traditional====\n{{Main|Design\u2013bid\u2013build}}\n\nThis is the most common method of construction procurement, and it is well-established and recognized. In this arrangement, the architect or [[engineer]] acts as the project coordinator. His or her role is to design the works, prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings, administer the contract, [[Request for tender|tender]] the works, and manage the works from inception to completion. There are direct contractual links between the architect's client and the main contractor. Any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor. The procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy.\n\n====Design-build====\n{{Main|Design-build}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1    = Havelock City, Sri Lanka, 003.jpg\n | width1    = 180\n | image2    = Havelock City, Sri Lanka, 004.jpg\n | width2    = 180\n | footer  = Construction of the ''Phase-1'' (first two towers) of the<br /> [[Havelock City|Havelock City Project]], [[Sri Lanka]]\n | footer_align = center\n}}\n\nThis approach has become more common in recent years, and also involves the client contracting a single entity that both provides a design and builds it. In some cases, the design-build package can also include finding the site, arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory consents.\n\nThe owner produces a list of requirements for a project, giving an overall view of the project's goals. Several D&B contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals. The owner selects the ideas they like best and hires the appropriate contractor. Often, it is not just one contractor, but a consortium of several contractors working together. Once these have been hired, they begin building the first phase of the project. As they build phase 1, they design phase 2. This is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract, where the project is completely designed by the owner, then bid on, then completed.\n\nKent Hansen pointed out that state [[Department of transportation|departments of transportation]] usually use design build contracts as a way of progressing projects when states lack the skills-resources. In such departments, design build contracts are usually employed for very large projects.<ref name=\"Cronin\">{{cite web | last = Cronin | first = Jeff | year = 2005 | url = http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=5592 | title = S. Carolina Court to Decide Legality of Design-Build Bids | publisher = Construction Equipment Guide | accessdate = 2008-01-04 }}</ref>\n\n====Management procurement systems====\n{{Main|Construction management}}\nIn this arrangement the client plays an active role in the procurement system by entering into separate contracts with the designer (architect or [[engineer]]), the [[Construction management|construction manager]], and individual [[Tradesman|trade contractors]]. The client takes on the contractual role, while the construction or project manager provides the active role of managing the separate trade contracts, and ensuring that they complete all work smoothly and effectively together.\n\nManagement procurement systems are often used to speed up the procurement processes, allow the client greater flexibility in design variation throughout the contract, give the ability to appoint individual work contractors, separate contractual responsibility on each individual throughout the contract, and to provide greater client control.\n\nIn recent time, construction software starts to get traction\u2014as it digitizes construction industry. Among solutions, there are for example: [[Procore]], GenieBelt, [[PlanGrid]], bouw7, etc.\n\n=== Sustainability in construction ===\n{{Main|Sustainability in construction}}\nSustainability during the construction phase is one of the aspects of \u201cgreen building,\" defined by the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) as \"the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/greenbuilding/web/html/about.html|title=Basic Information {{!}} Green Building {{!}}US EPA|website=archive.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Industry scale and characteristics==\nThe output of the global construction industry was worth an estimated $10.8 trillion in 2017, and in 2018 was forecast to rise to $12.9 trillion by 2022.<ref name=\"BDC-08Oct2018\">{{cite news |title=Global construction set to rise to US$12.9 trillion by 2022, driven by Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East |url=https://www.bdcnetwork.com/global-construction-set-rise-us129-trillion-2022-driven-asia-pacific-africa-and-middle-east |accessdate=29 April 2020 |work=Building Design and Construction |date=8 October 2018}}</ref> As a sector, construction accounts for more than 10% of global GDP, with China the largest single market.<ref name=\"Reuters-03Mar2011\">{{cite news |last1=Roumeliotis |first1=Greg |title=Global construction growth to outpace GDP this decade - PwC |url=https://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-55293920110303 |accessdate=29 April 2020 |work=Reuters Economic News |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> The United States is the second largest construction market with a 2018 output of $1.581 trillion.<ref>Global Construction Perspectives & Construction Economics (2019)([https://www.acenet.co.uk/media/4193/export-strategy.pdf Future of Consultancy: Global Export Strategy for UK Consultancy and Engineering], ACE, London.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the industry in 2014 has around $960 [[Orders of magnitude (currency)#1 billion to 100 billion|billion]] in annual [[revenue]] according to statistics tracked by the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]], of which $680 billion is [[private sector|private]] (split evenly between residential and nonresidential) and the remainder is government.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/construction/c30/c30index.html Value of Construction Put in Place at a Glance].

Some legal requirements come from ''[[malum in se]]'' considerations, or the desire to prevent indisputably bad phenomena, e.g. explosions or bridge collapses. Other legal requirements come from ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' considerations, or factors that are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses from a business district or residences from a residential district. An attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built, either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable (the bridge design will not cause a collapse), or that the custom is no longer needed (acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=l3D7CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=%22Construction%20law%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=%22Construction%20law%22%20-wikipedia&f=false|title=Construction Law: From Beginner to Practitioner|last=Mason|first=Jim|date=2016-04-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317391777|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Authority having jurisdiction====\n{{See also|Planning permission}}\n[[File:Mall culture jakarta57.jpg|thumb|Digging the foundation for a building construction in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]\nIn construction, the '''authority having jurisdiction''' (AHJ) is the governmental agency or sub-agency that regulates the construction process. In most cases, this is the [[municipality]] where the building is located. However, construction performed for supra-municipal authorities are usually regulated directly by the owning authority, which becomes the AHJ.\n[[File:Liberty Memorial 043.jpg|thumb|Construction on the Federal Reserve building in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]]]\nBefore the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services. This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities, which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations. During the construction of a building, the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local '''[[building code]]'''. Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed, an '''[[occupancy]] permit''' may be issued.\n\nAn operating building must remain in compliance with the '''[[Fire safety|fire code]]'''. The fire code is enforced by the local fire department or a municipal code enforcement office.\n\nChanges made to a building that affect safety, including its use, expansion, structural integrity, and [[fire protection]] items, usually require approval of the AHJ for review concerning the building code.\n\n===Design===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nIn the industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts. The design usually consists of [[drawing]]s and [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]], usually prepared by a design team including [[architect]], [[civil engineer]]s, [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical engineers]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]], [[structural engineer]]s, [[Fire protection engineering|fire protection engineers]], planning [[consultant]]s, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a [[bill of quantities]] provided by a [[quantity surveyor]]. Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.\n\nThe best modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties, especially among large firms. In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the larger firms. Presently, a firm that is nominally an \"architecture\" or \"construction management\" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees, or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, each such firm may offer itself as \"one-stop shopping\" for a construction project, from beginning to end. This is designated as a \"design build\" contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=U6gvCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=%22Construction%20design%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PR13#v=onepage&q=%22Construction%20design%22%20-wikipedia&f=false|title=The Latest Methods of Construction Design|last=Dynybyl|first=Vojt\u011bch|last2=Berka|first2=Ondrej|last3=Petr|first3=Karel|last4=Lopot|first4=Franti\u0161ek|last5=Dub|first5=Martin|date=2015-12-09|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319227627|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSeveral project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including design-build, partnering and construction management. In general, each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects, interior designers, engineers and constructors throughout design and construction. In response, many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process.\n\nThe increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained in all phases of the project's life-cycle and develop an appreciation of the building as an advanced technological system requiring close integration of many sub-systems and their individual components, including sustainability. [[Architectural engineering|Building engineering]] is an emerging discipline that attempts to meet this new challenge.\n\n===Finance===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)]]\n | width     =\n | image1    = Trump International Hotel and Tower, Chicago (0837).JPG\n | width1    = 140\n | caption1  = May 23, 2006\n | image2    = 20070914 Trump International Hotel & Tower - Chicago.JPG\n | width2    = 140\n | caption2  = September 14, 2007 (3 months before completion)\n}}\n\nConstruction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems. Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project. [[Cash flow]] problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials, and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time, can arise even when the overall total is enough. [[Fraud]] is a problem in many fields, but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global construction industry faces growing threat of economic crime|url=http://pwc.blogs.com/press_room/2010/04/global-construction-industry-faces-growing-threat-of-economic-crime.html|website=pwc|publisher=pwc|accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project.\n\n[[Mortgage bank]]ers, [[accountant]]s, and [[Cost engineering|cost engineers]] are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project. The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely, even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project. Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process. Cost engineers and [[estimators]] apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation. Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/05/27/news/top_stories/22_07_545_26_07.txt|title=North County News \u2013 San Diego Union Tribune|website=www.nctimes.com}}</ref>\n\nLarge projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with a conceptual estimate performed by a [[building estimator]]. As portions of a project are completed, they may be sold, supplanting one lender or owner for another, while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and materials available for each stage of the building construction project carries forward. In many English-speaking countries, but not the United States, projects typically use quantity surveyors.\n\n===Legal aspects===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2006}}\n{{Main|Construction law}}\n[[File:401-403-410 and Construction crop.png|thumb|Construction along [[Ontario Highway 401]], widening the road from six to twelve travel lanes]]\nA construction project must fit into the legal framework governing the property. These include governmental regulations on the use of property, and obligations that are created in the process of construction.\n\nA construction project is a complex net of [[contract]]s and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.\n\nLegal advisors in the beginning of a construction project seek to identify ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structure, and to present options for preventing problems. Throughout the process of the project, they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise. In each case, the lawyer facilitates an exchange of obligations that matches the reality of the project.\n\n===Interaction of expertise===\n[[File:UnderConstruction-Apt.jpg|thumb|Apartment complex under construction in [[Daegu]], [[South Korea]]]]\nDesign, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must also be financially possible to build, and legal to use. The financial structure must accommodate the need for building the design provided, and must pay amounts that are legally owed. The legal structure must integrate the design into the surrounding legal framework, and enforce the financial consequences of the construction process.\n\n===Procurement===\nProcurement describes the merging of activities undertaken by the client to obtain a building. There are many different methods of construction procurement; however, the three most common types of procurement are traditional ([[design\u2013bid\u2013build]]), design-build and management contracting.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=miWPDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA1&dq=%22Construction%20procurement%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=%22Construction%20procurement%22%20-wikipedia&f=false|title=Collaborative Construction Procurement and Improved Value|last=Mosey|first=David|date=2019-05-20|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119151913|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship among the principal, the contractor, and other stakeholders within a construction project. New forms include partnering such as Public-Private Partnering (PPPs) aka [[private finance initiative]]s (PFIs) and alliances such as \"pure\" or \"project\" alliances and \"impure\" or \"strategic\" alliances. The focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry.\n\n====Traditional====\n{{Main|Design\u2013bid\u2013build}}\n\nThis is the most common method of construction procurement, and it is well-established and recognized. In this arrangement, the architect or [[engineer]] acts as the project coordinator. His or her role is to design the works, prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings, administer the contract, [[Request for tender|tender]] the works, and manage the works from inception to completion. There are direct contractual links between the architect's client and the main contractor. Any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor. The procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy.\n\n====Design-build====\n{{Main|Design-build}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1    = Havelock City, Sri Lanka, 003.jpg\n | width1    = 180\n | image2    = Havelock City, Sri Lanka, 004.jpg\n | width2    = 180\n | footer  = Construction of the ''Phase-1'' (first two towers) of the<br /> [[Havelock City|Havelock City Project]], [[Sri Lanka]]\n | footer_align = center\n}}\n\nThis approach has become more common in recent years, and also involves the client contracting a single entity that both provides a design and builds it. In some cases, the design-build package can also include finding the site, arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory consents.\n\nThe owner produces a list of requirements for a project, giving an overall view of the project's goals. Several D&B contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals. The owner selects the ideas they like best and hires the appropriate contractor. Often, it is not just one contractor, but a consortium of several contractors working together. Once these have been hired, they begin building the first phase of the project. As they build phase 1, they design phase 2. This is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract, where the project is completely designed by the owner, then bid on, then completed.\n\nKent Hansen pointed out that state [[Department of transportation|departments of transportation]] usually use design build contracts as a way of progressing projects when states lack the skills-resources. In such departments, design build contracts are usually employed for very large projects.<ref name=\"Cronin\">{{cite web | last = Cronin | first = Jeff | year = 2005 | url = http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=5592 | title = S.

The client takes on the contractual role, while the construction or project manager provides the active role of managing the separate trade contracts, and ensuring that they complete all work smoothly and effectively together.\n\nManagement procurement systems are often used to speed up the procurement processes, allow the client greater flexibility in design variation throughout the contract, give the ability to appoint individual work contractors, separate contractual responsibility on each individual throughout the contract, and to provide greater client control.\n\nIn recent time, construction software starts to get traction\u2014as it digitizes construction industry.

These professions also hold more legal responsibility. A short list of the main careers with an outline of the educational requirements are given below:\n* [[Architect]]&nbsp;\u2013 Typically holds 1, undergraduate 3-year degree in architecture + 1, post-graduate 2-year degree (DipArch or BArch) in architecture plus 24 months' experience within the industry. To use the title \"architect\" the individual must be registered on the [[Architects Registration Board]] register of Architects.\n* [[Civil engineer]]&nbsp;\u2013 Typically holds a degree in a related subject. The [[Chartered Engineer]] qualification is controlled by the [[Engineering Council]], and is often achieved through membership of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]. A new university graduate must hold a [[master's degree]] to become chartered; persons with [[bachelor's degree]]s may become an [[Engineering technologist|Incorporated Engineer]].\n* [[Building services engineering|Building services engineer]]&nbsp;\u2013 Often referred to as an \"M&E Engineer\" typically holds a degree in mechanical or electrical engineering. Chartered Engineer status is governed by the [[Engineering Council]], mainly through the [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]].\n* [[Project manager]]&nbsp;\u2013 Typically holds a 4-year or greater [[higher education]] qualification, but are often also qualified in another field such as architecture, civil engineering or quantity surveying.\n* [[Structural engineer]]&nbsp;\u2013 Typically holds a bachelor's or master's degree in structural engineering. A P.ENG is required from the Professional Engineers Ontario (Canada). New university graduates must hold a master's degree to gain chartered status from the [[Engineering Council]], mainly through the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]] (UK).\n* [[Quantity surveyor]]&nbsp;\u2013 Typically holds a bachelor's degree in quantity surveying. Chartered status is gained from the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]].\n* [[Civil estimator]]s are professionals who typically have a background in civil engineering, [[construction management|construction project management]], or construction [[supervisor|supervision]].\n\nIn 2010 a salary survey revealed the differences in remuneration between different roles, sectors and locations in the construction and built environment industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-11582-uk-website-launches-salary-comparison-tool/|title=UK website launches salary comparison tool|accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref> The results showed that areas of particularly strong growth in the construction industry, such as the [[Middle East]], yield higher average salaries than in the UK, for example.

(an acronym for ''Also Known As'')<ref name=\"Title Contenders\" /> is the eighth [[studio album]] by American entertainer [[Jennifer Lopez]]. It was released on June 13, 2014, by [[Capitol Records]].<!-- The first known release date was in Germany on June 13. The first release is the only one that should be listed. --> Lopez started working on the album in February 2013, after the end of her first worldwide tour, the [[Dance Again World Tour]]. Originally scheduled to be released in November 2013, Lopez postponed the album release to 2014. Undecided between ''Same Girl'' and ''A.K.A.'' as the album's title, Lopez eventually chose the latter as the title.\n\nInitially, ''A.K.A.'' was to be executively produced by [[RedOne]], with the producer claiming the album was going to mix many styles, having a blend of her previous musical background: [[urban pop]], [[dance-pop]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]. However, [[Cory Rooney]] and [[Benny Medina]], her longtime collaborators, later became the album's executive producers, along with herself, bringing a more [[pop music|pop]], [[electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] sound to the album.<ref name=\"idolator\">{{cite web|last=Wass|first=Mike|title=Jennifer Lopez's 'A.K.A.': Track-By-Track Album Review|url=http://www.idolator.com/7520707/jennifer-lopez-aka-album-review|website=Idolator|accessdate=June 13, 2014|date=June 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=theobserver/> In early 2014, Lopez released two urban-infused tracks as the album's promotional singles: \"[[Girls (Jennifer Lopez song)|Girls]]\" and \"[[Same Girl (Jennifer Lopez song)|Same Girl]]\". Besides frequent contributor and personal friend [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], the album also features collaborations with [[French Montana]], [[T.I.]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Nas]], Jack Mizrahi and [[Tyga]].\n\nUpon its release, ''A.K.A.'' received generally mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], who spoke unfavorably of the album's mixed styles, although some songs were singled out for praise. Commercially, ''A.K.A.'' made minor impact on the charts, peaking outside the top forty in Ireland and the United Kingdom, whilst elsewhere it became her lowest-charting studio album. ''A.K.A.'' was preceded by the release of two singles, \"[[I Luh Ya Papi]]\" and \"[[First Love (Jennifer Lopez song)|First Love]]\" as well as a third single \"[[Booty (song)|Booty]]\" which was remixed to feature Azalea. The latter would go on to become the most successful single from the album, peaking at number 18 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the release of Lopez's single \"[[Dance Again]]\" in April 2012, she stated that she was unsure whether or not it was the [[lead single]] of a [[greatest hits]] album, or a new studio album. That May, she released the track \"[[Goin' In]]\" which was featured on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Step Up Revolution]]''; she still was unsure.

Lopez is right when she says that she doesn't have anything more to prove, but her sound needs to develop alongside the rest of her professional life.\" He did however note that the abundance of powerful ballads on the album, most notably \"Let It Be Me\", could be Lopez saving grace for her flailing recording career. \"A song like 'Let It Be Me' on \"A.K.A.\" proves that, if Lopez finds the right production partners, she can serve up slower material that can measure up to the best balladeers' work. Throughout her career, Lopez's greatest strengths have been dancing and churning out dance music. However, the ballads on 'A.K.A.' hint at a sweeping musical direction that Lopez has typically relegated to the back of her albums, as a supplement to her uptempo spectacles. Perhaps it's time to move it front and center.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lipshut|first1=Jason|title=Jennifer Lopez's 'A.K.A.'

(an acronym for ''Also Known As'')<ref name=\"Title Contenders\" /> is the eighth [[studio album]] by American entertainer [[Jennifer Lopez]]. It was released on June 13, 2014, by [[Capitol Records]].<!-- The first known release date was in Germany on June 13. The first release is the only one that should be listed. --> Lopez started working on the album in February 2013, after the end of her first worldwide tour, the [[Dance Again World Tour]]. Originally scheduled to be released in November 2013, Lopez postponed the album release to 2014. Undecided between ''Same Girl'' and ''A.K.A.'' as the album's title, Lopez eventually chose the latter as the title.\n\nInitially, ''A.K.A.'' was to be executively produced by [[RedOne]], with the producer claiming the album was going to mix many styles, having a blend of her previous musical background: [[urban pop]], [[dance-pop]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]. However, [[Cory Rooney]] and [[Benny Medina]], her longtime collaborators, later became the album's executive producers, along with herself, bringing a more [[pop music|pop]], [[electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] sound to the album.<ref name=\"idolator\">{{cite web|last=Wass|first=Mike|title=Jennifer Lopez's 'A.K.A.': Track-By-Track Album Review|url=http://www.idolator.com/7520707/jennifer-lopez-aka-album-review|website=Idolator|accessdate=June 13, 2014|date=June 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=theobserver/> In early 2014, Lopez released two urban-infused tracks as the album's promotional singles: \"[[Girls (Jennifer Lopez song)|Girls]]\" and \"[[Same Girl (Jennifer Lopez song)|Same Girl]]\". Besides frequent contributor and personal friend [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], the album also features collaborations with [[French Montana]], [[T.I.]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Nas]], Jack Mizrahi and [[Tyga]].\n\nUpon its release, ''A.K.A.'' received generally mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], who spoke unfavorably of the album's mixed styles, although some songs were singled out for praise. Commercially, ''A.K.A.'' made minor impact on the charts, peaking outside the top forty in Ireland and the United Kingdom, whilst elsewhere it became her lowest-charting studio album. ''A.K.A.'' was preceded by the release of two singles, \"[[I Luh Ya Papi]]\" and \"[[First Love (Jennifer Lopez song)|First Love]]\" as well as a third single \"[[Booty (song)|Booty]]\" which was remixed to feature Azalea. The latter would go on to become the most successful single from the album, peaking at number 18 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the release of Lopez's single \"[[Dance Again]]\" in April 2012, she stated that she was unsure whether or not it was the [[lead single]] of a [[greatest hits]] album, or a new studio album. That May, she released the track \"[[Goin' In]]\" which was featured on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Step Up Revolution]]''; she still was unsure. She said that she had to release a greatest hits album to fulfill her contractual agreement with [[Epic Records]], her former label: \"I owe a greatest hits [album] to the record company...or I can go ahead and start a new album. I just haven't decided yet.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Celani|first=Andrew|title=Jennifer Lopez Talks About Her New Single \"Goin' In\"|url=http://925maxima.cbslocal.com/2012/05/28/jennifer-lopez-interview-new-single-goin-in/|work=925maxima|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=November 19, 2012|date=May 28, 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, she released her first greatest hits album ''[[Dance Again... the Hits]]'' on July 24, 2012.<ref name=\"Digital Spy July\">{{cite web|last=Corner|first=Lewis|title=Jennifer Lopez to release 'Dance Again: The Hits' next month?|url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/music/news/a388349/jennifer-lopez-to-release-dance-again-the-hits-next-month.html|work=[[Digital Spy]].

Lopez is right when she says that she doesn't have anything more to prove, but her sound needs to develop alongside the rest of her professional life.\" He did however note that the abundance of powerful ballads on the album, most notably \"Let It Be Me\", could be Lopez saving grace for her flailing recording career. \"A song like 'Let It Be Me' on \"A.K.A.\" proves that, if Lopez finds the right production partners, she can serve up slower material that can measure up to the best balladeers' work. Throughout her career, Lopez's greatest strengths have been dancing and churning out dance music. However, the ballads on 'A.K.A.' hint at a sweeping musical direction that Lopez has typically relegated to the back of her albums, as a supplement to her uptempo spectacles. Perhaps it's time to move it front and center.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lipshut|first1=Jason|title=Jennifer Lopez's 'A.K.A.'

Because of this format, material from the first five seasons did not air, outside of their original run, until 2019 when [[MeTV]] acquired the rights to these earlier seasons and began airing them.  The cast has periodically reunited for various one-off specials and short appearances, and several members of the cast went on to star in ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (1983\u20131990), a half-hour [[sitcom|situation comedy]] based on a sketch series from ''The Carol Burnett Show''.  \n\nIn 2013, ''TV Guide'' ranked ''The Carol Burnett Show'' number 17 on its list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fretts |first=Bruce |last2=Roush |first2=Matt |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time |journal=TV Guide Magazine |date= 23 December 2013 |url= https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/|accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nBy 1967, Carol Burnett had been a popular veteran of television for 12 years, having made her first appearances in 1955 on ''The Paul Winchell Show'' and the sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' starring the comedian [[Buddy Hackett]]. In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. Departing the Moore Show in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film,  Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials.  Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to \"push the button\", a phrase the programming executives used,<ref>{{cite book |last= Burnett|first= Carol|date= 2016|title=  In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox|url= |location= New York City|publisher= Crown Archetype|page= 4|isbn= 978-1101904657|author-link= }}</ref> and be put on the air in 30 one-hour variety shows, [[pay-or-play]]. After discussion with her husband [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS [[Michael Dann]] and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a \"man's genre\", offered Burnett a sitcom called ''Here's Agnes''. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Carol Burnett show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|230px|On the left, main cast members in 1967 (clockwise from the bottom): Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner, on the right, the 1977 cast: Burnett, Tim Conway, Lawrence, and Korman]]\nIn addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:\n*[[Vicki Lawrence]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] (seasons 1\u201310)\n*[[Lyle Waggoner]] (seasons 1\u20137)\n*[[Tim Conway]] (seasons 9\u201311; frequent guest performer in seasons 1\u20138)\n*[[Dick Van Dyke]] (first half of season 11)\nComedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''. When Kaye's program ended in the spring of 1967, Korman was immediately hired for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. \n\nAt this particular time, actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series [[Batman]] but was passed over in favor of [[Adam West]]. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired.  He would sometimes play the handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on [[Durward Kirby]]  of ''The Garry Moore Show'' as Waggoner also functioned as the show's announcer in addition to playing in sketches.\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and guest star [[Dinah Shore]] in the 1976 ''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' sketch]]\nVicki Lawrence, a young singer from [[The Young Americans]] wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett's kid sister in numerous \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.\n\n[[Jim Nabors]] was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.\n\nIn addition, several notable actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the first season, such as [[William Schallert]], [[Isabel Sanford]], and [[Reta Shaw]].\n\nThe popular variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names, with such sketches as \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", (a parody of ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\" (a spoof of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), \"Carol & Sis\", \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" (which led to a [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie titled ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', as well as a spin-off television series titled ''[[Mama's Family]]''), \"Nora Desmond\" (Burnett's send-up of [[Gloria Swanson]]'s character [[Norma Desmond]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), and \"Stella Toddler\". A frequent repeated segment was \"Kitchen Commercials\", in which cast members parodied TV commercials that drove a woman (Burnett) crazy. The long-running show was frequently nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for best variety series and won three times.\n\nA favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 (now [[Bob Barker]] Studio) lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it.<ref>\"The Florence Henderson Show\" RLTV, 2009</ref> Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (\"let's bump up the lights\") and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:\n\n:Young woman: \"Have you ever taken acting lessons?\"\n:Carol: \"Yes, I have.\"\n:Young woman: \"Do you think it did any good?\"\n\nThe show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (\"Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights\"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.\nAs a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as \"Conway's Capers\". Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a \"club\", Conway sang three verses of \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\" as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 \"Mama's Family\" sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of [[The Oldest Man (character)|\"The Oldest Man\"]] \u2013 an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).\n\nThe show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett's husband, with these lyrics:<ref>{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Warren| title=Have a Laugh and Sing a Song| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/bell/bell200511090809.asp| accessdate=August 19, 2011| date=November 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n:I'm so glad we had this time together\n:Just to have a laugh or sing a song\n:Seems we just get started and before you know it\n:Comes the time we have to say, \"So long.\"\n\nAt the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother's death, Burnett continued the tradition.\n\n==Broadcast==\nWhen ''The Carol Burnett Show'' made its network debut on CBS-TV in September 1967, it was scheduled on Monday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm opposite NBC\u2019s ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' and ABC\u2019s ''[[The Big Valley]]''. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969\u201370 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm, where its chief competition was NBC\u2019s ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the ABC sitcoms ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]''. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.\n\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the \"Family\" sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice's mother) were introduced and the \"Carol and Sis\" segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series' seventh), after having been with ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner's spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner's duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.\n\n[[File:Tim Conway Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|150px|From left to right: Conway, Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke in the final season]]\nIn November, 1976, the series' tenth year, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: \"[[Went with the Wind!]],\" a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976-77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett's show for an 11th season.\n\nDick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, ''Van Dyke & Company'', was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]''. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm to Sunday nights at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Ken Berry]] were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.\n\nCBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled \"[[A Special Evening with Carol Burnett]]\", ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place. Reruns were aired during the summer of 1978.\n\n==Notable characters/sketches==\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett charwoman character 1974.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as the Charwoman]]\n[[File:Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as Eunice with [[Madeline Kahn]] in \"The Family\" sketch]]\n\n*[[As the Stomach Turns]] \u2013 a [[soap opera]] parody taking place in the fictional town of Canoga Falls with Burnett as the main character Marian Clayton.\n*Carol and Sis \u2013 Burnett as Carol and Lawrence as her sister Chris with Korman as Carol's husband Roger;<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 1\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 239| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> the sketch was based on Burnett's life in New York raising her kid sister in New York with her first husband, and Lawrence was originally hired just for this sketch.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n*The Charwoman \u2013 Burnett's signature character, an unnamed [[charwoman]] (most often in a musical number),<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 2\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 240| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> whose animated image has been used in the opening credits, and also in the opening and closing credits of ''Carol Burnett and Friends''.\n*Chiquita \u2013 Burnett's parody of [[Charo]];

Many of these film parodies were written or co-written by [[Stan Hart]], [[Arnie Kogen]] and [[Larry Siegel]], all prolific contributors for [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine, with each authoring dozens of the magazine's own movie satires.\n\n==After the series==\n\n===Continuations and revivals===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\nIn the fall of 1977, while the series was still running in prime time, the comedy sketches of the show were re-edited into freestanding programs; the resulting show enjoyed success for many years in [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s (as ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', a half-hour edition of selected 1972\u201377 material).\n\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left the air, Burnett and her husband Joe Hamilton were dining in a restaurant with friends, including Tim Conway. At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced. Under the title ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'', the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as \"Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins\", \"The Family\", \"As The Stomach Turns\", and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett's series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett's show in 1977), comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on Burnett's show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]], and [[Sally Field]]. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.\n\nThe \"Family\" sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett's involvement in ''Mama's Family'' was limited due to her divorce from producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In the first year and a half of the show's run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of [[Alastair Cooke]] hosting ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'') and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.\n\n[[NBC]] aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called ''[[Carol & Company]]'' that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included [[Peter Krause]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Terry Kiser]], [[Meagen Fay]], [[Anita Barone]], and [[Richard Kind]] (and occasional guest stars, including [[Betty White]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]); each week's show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.\n\nCBS brought back ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]], [[Roger Kabler]], and [[Jessica Lundy]]. However, the times had changed and Burnett's humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.\n\nIn 1994, reruns of the syndicated ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' package aired on [[Nick at Nite]]. The show also aired on [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|The Family Channel]] in 1996 and on [[TV Land]] as part of that network's inaugural lineup from 1996 to 1997 and again from 2004 to 2005.

In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. Departing the Moore Show in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film,  Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials.  Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to \"push the button\", a phrase the programming executives used,<ref>{{cite book |last= Burnett|first= Carol|date= 2016|title=  In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox|url= |location= New York City|publisher= Crown Archetype|page= 4|isbn= 978-1101904657|author-link= }}</ref> and be put on the air in 30 one-hour variety shows, [[pay-or-play]]. After discussion with her husband [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS [[Michael Dann]] and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a \"man's genre\", offered Burnett a sitcom called ''Here's Agnes''. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Carol Burnett show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|230px|On the left, main cast members in 1967 (clockwise from the bottom): Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner, on the right, the 1977 cast: Burnett, Tim Conway, Lawrence, and Korman]]\nIn addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:\n*[[Vicki Lawrence]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] (seasons 1\u201310)\n*[[Lyle Waggoner]] (seasons 1\u20137)\n*[[Tim Conway]] (seasons 9\u201311; frequent guest performer in seasons 1\u20138)\n*[[Dick Van Dyke]] (first half of season 11)\nComedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''. When Kaye's program ended in the spring of 1967, Korman was immediately hired for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. \n\nAt this particular time, actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series [[Batman]] but was passed over in favor of [[Adam West]]. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired.  He would sometimes play the handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on [[Durward Kirby]]  of ''The Garry Moore Show'' as Waggoner also functioned as the show's announcer in addition to playing in sketches.\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and guest star [[Dinah Shore]] in the 1976 ''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' sketch]]\nVicki Lawrence, a young singer from [[The Young Americans]] wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett's kid sister in numerous \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.\n\n[[Jim Nabors]] was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.\n\nIn addition, several notable actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the first season, such as [[William Schallert]], [[Isabel Sanford]], and [[Reta Shaw]].\n\nThe popular variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names, with such sketches as \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", (a parody of ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\" (a spoof of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), \"Carol & Sis\", \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" (which led to a [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie titled ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', as well as a spin-off television series titled ''[[Mama's Family]]''), \"Nora Desmond\" (Burnett's send-up of [[Gloria Swanson]]'s character [[Norma Desmond]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), and \"Stella Toddler\". A frequent repeated segment was \"Kitchen Commercials\", in which cast members parodied TV commercials that drove a woman (Burnett) crazy. The long-running show was frequently nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for best variety series and won three times.\n\nA favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 (now [[Bob Barker]] Studio) lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it.<ref>\"The Florence Henderson Show\" RLTV, 2009</ref> Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (\"let's bump up the lights\") and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:\n\n:Young woman: \"Have you ever taken acting lessons?\"\n:Carol: \"Yes, I have.\"\n:Young woman: \"Do you think it did any good?\"\n\nThe show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (\"Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights\"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.\nAs a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as \"Conway's Capers\". Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a \"club\", Conway sang three verses of \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\" as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 \"Mama's Family\" sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of [[The Oldest Man (character)|\"The Oldest Man\"]] \u2013 an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).\n\nThe show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett's husband, with these lyrics:<ref>{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Warren| title=Have a Laugh and Sing a Song| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/bell/bell200511090809.asp| accessdate=August 19, 2011| date=November 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n:I'm so glad we had this time together\n:Just to have a laugh or sing a song\n:Seems we just get started and before you know it\n:Comes the time we have to say, \"So long.\"\n\nAt the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother's death, Burnett continued the tradition.\n\n==Broadcast==\nWhen ''The Carol Burnett Show'' made its network debut on CBS-TV in September 1967, it was scheduled on Monday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm opposite NBC\u2019s ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' and ABC\u2019s ''[[The Big Valley]]''. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969\u201370 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm, where its chief competition was NBC\u2019s ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the ABC sitcoms ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]''. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.\n\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the \"Family\" sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice's mother) were introduced and the \"Carol and Sis\" segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series' seventh), after having been with ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner's spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner's duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.\n\n[[File:Tim Conway Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|150px|From left to right: Conway, Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke in the final season]]\nIn November, 1976, the series' tenth year, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: \"[[Went with the Wind!]],\" a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976-77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett's show for an 11th season.\n\nDick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, ''Van Dyke & Company'', was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]''. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm to Sunday nights at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Ken Berry]] were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.\n\nCBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled \"[[A Special Evening with Carol Burnett]]\", ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place. Reruns were aired during the summer of 1978.\n\n==Notable characters/sketches==\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett charwoman character 1974.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as the Charwoman]]\n[[File:Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as Eunice with [[Madeline Kahn]] in \"The Family\" sketch]]\n\n*[[As the Stomach Turns]] \u2013 a [[soap opera]] parody taking place in the fictional town of Canoga Falls with Burnett as the main character Marian Clayton.\n*Carol and Sis \u2013 Burnett as Carol and Lawrence as her sister Chris with Korman as Carol's husband Roger;<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 1\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 239| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> the sketch was based on Burnett's life in New York raising her kid sister in New York with her first husband, and Lawrence was originally hired just for this sketch.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n*The Charwoman \u2013 Burnett's signature character, an unnamed [[charwoman]] (most often in a musical number),<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 2\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 240| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> whose animated image has been used in the opening credits, and also in the opening and closing credits of ''Carol Burnett and Friends''.\n*Chiquita \u2013 Burnett's parody of [[Charo]];

Many of these film parodies were written or co-written by [[Stan Hart]], [[Arnie Kogen]] and [[Larry Siegel]], all prolific contributors for [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine, with each authoring dozens of the magazine's own movie satires.\n\n==After the series==\n\n===Continuations and revivals===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\nIn the fall of 1977, while the series was still running in prime time, the comedy sketches of the show were re-edited into freestanding programs; the resulting show enjoyed success for many years in [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s (as ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', a half-hour edition of selected 1972\u201377 material).\n\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left the air, Burnett and her husband Joe Hamilton were dining in a restaurant with friends, including Tim Conway. At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced. Under the title ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'', the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as \"Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins\", \"The Family\", \"As The Stomach Turns\", and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett's series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett's show in 1977), comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. [[Ernie Flatt]], who had been the choreographer on Burnett's show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]], and [[Sally Field]]. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.\n\nThe \"Family\" sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett's involvement in ''Mama's Family'' was limited due to her divorce from producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In the first year and a half of the show's run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of [[Alastair Cooke]] hosting ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'') and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.\n\n[[NBC]] aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called ''[[Carol & Company]]'' that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included [[Peter Krause]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Terry Kiser]], [[Meagen Fay]], [[Anita Barone]], and [[Richard Kind]] (and occasional guest stars, including [[Betty White]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]); each week's show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.\n\nCBS brought back ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]], [[Roger Kabler]], and [[Jessica Lundy]]. However, the times had changed and Burnett's humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.\n\nIn 1994, reruns of the syndicated ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' package aired on [[Nick at Nite]].

The company can be traced to an establishment of the first electromagnetic [[telegraph]] service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch Colonial Government]] to connecting Batavia ([[Jakarta]]) and Buitenzorg ([[Bogor]]).<ref name=anrep09>{{cite web|url=http://www.telkom.co.id/UHI/assets/pdf/EN/09_Corporate%20Data.pdf|title=History of TELKOM|publisher=Telkom Indonesia}}</ref> In 1884, the Dutch Colonial Government founded a private company to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph services.<ref name=anrep09full>{{cite web|url=http://www.telkom.co.id/download/File/UHI/SR/TELKOM_SR2009.pdf|title=TELKOM in Brief, History of the Company|publisher=Telkom Indonesia}}</ref>\n\n===Early years===\n[[Telephony]] services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by [[Privately held company|privately owned companies]] under a 25-year government license. In 1906, all [[Mail|postal]] and [[telegraph]] services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as single, unified government agency named ''Posts Telegraafend Telefoon Diensts'' (PTT).<ref name=anrep09/><ref name=posthist>{{cite web|url=http://www.posindonesia.co.id/profile.php?id=2|title=Sejarah Pos Indonesia|accessdate=13 August 2011|language=id|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623074703/http://www.posindonesia.co.id/profile.php?id=2|archivedate=23 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In September 1945, roughly a month after [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian proclamation of independence]], the agency headquarters in [[Bandung]] were taken over by Indonesian nationalists.<ref name=posthist/> In December 1949, after years of [[Indonesian National Revolution|national revolution war]], the PTT was nationalised by Indonesian Government as part of Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalise Dutch corporate assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iias.nl/nl/36/IIAS_NL36_18.pdf|title=Dutch enterprise in independent Indonesia: cooperation and confrontation, 1949\u20131958|publisher=IIAS Newsletter #36|date=March 2005|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elib.unikom.ac.id/files/disk1/484/jbptunikompp-gdl-asepsandyn-24180-1-unikom_a-i.pdf|title=Telkom Indonesia|accessdate=13 August 2011|language=id}}</ref>\n\n===State-owned company===\nIn 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established [[state-owned company]], the Postal and Telecommunications Services company. Four year later, on 6 July 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, ''PN Pos Giro'' responsible for providing [[Mail|mail services]] and ''PN Telekomunikasi'' as [[telecommunications]] services.<ref name=\"separationpostal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.postalconsumers.org/postal_freedom_index/Indonesia_--_Pos_Indonesia.shtml|title=Indonesia \u2013 Pos Indonesia|work=Consumer Postal Council|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> The mail services ''PN Pos Giro'' developed over year, to become the [[Pos Indonesia]] in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people.<ref name=posthist/><ref name=separationpostal/>\n\nIn 1974, ''PN Telekomunikasi'' was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi ('''Perumtel''') provided \ndomestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia ('''PT INTI''') manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established [[Indosat|PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation]] ('''Indosat''').<ref name=anrep09/>\n\nIn 1991, Perumtel became a state-owned [[Limited liability company|limited liability corporation]] and renamed to what is now ''Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero)'' '''PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia''' or '''Telkom'''. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organised along twelve regional operating units known as ''Wilayah Telekomunikasi'' or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management and security.<ref name=anrep09/> In 1995, Telkom reorganised the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.<ref name=anrep09/>\n\n===Privatisation===\nOn 14 November 1995, Telkom became a privatised company when shares went on sale through an initial public offering on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the [[Surabaya Stock Exchange]] (which merged in December 2007 to become the [[Indonesia Stock Exchange]]). Telkom's shares are also listed on the [[NYSE]] and the [[London Stock Exchange|LSE]] in the form of [[American Depositary Shares]] (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalisation in Indonesia, with a market capitalisation of approximately [[Indonesian rupiah|IDR]] 190,512&nbsp;trillion as of 31 December 2009.<ref name=anrep09/><ref name=marketcaplargest>{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/1293798817/state-companies-control-26-pct-stock-market-capital|title=State companies control 26% stock market capital|work=Antara News|date=31 December 2010|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom.

Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions.<ref name=anrep09/>\n\nSince 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange (\"LSE\"), and since 16 May 2014, they cease to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (\"TSE\") in Japan.<ref>http://www.telkom.co.id/assets/uploads/2013/05/telkom_20F_2014.pdf</ref>\n\n===Telecommunication deregulation===\nIn 1999, Indonesia passed a [[Deregulation|deregulating]] telecommunication law that set in motion a sweeping array of reforms and enlivened [[Competition law|competition policy]], [[Private equity|private investment]], and long term industry direction.<ref name=intelbrief/> Among the proposed reforms was the progressive elimination of the joint ownership, by Telkom and [[Indosat]], of most of the telecommunications companies in Indonesia. This was intended to promote a more competitive market. As a result, in 2001, Telkom acquired Indosat's 35.0% stake in [[Telkomsel]], resulting in Telkom owning 77.7% of the shares of Telkomsel, while Indosat acquired Telkom's 22.5% interest in Satelindo and its 37.7% stake in Lintasarta. In 2002, Telkom sold 12.7% of Telkomsel to [[SingTel|Singapore Telecom Mobile]] Pte Ltd (SingTel Mobile), reducing Telkom's ownership of Telkomsel to 65.0%.<ref name=anrep09/>\n\nOn 1 August 2001, the Government terminated Telkom's exclusive right to provide [[Landline|fixed line]] services in Indonesia and Indosat's right to provide [[International Direct Dialling|international direct dial]] services. Subsequently, Telkom's exclusive rights to provide domestic and [[Long-distance calling|long-distance]] services were terminated in August 2002 and August 2003, respectively.<ref name=anrep09/><ref name=regtele>{{cite web|url=http://www.accg.mq.edu.au/docs/publications/past_editions/volume_2/6.young_etc-1.pdf|title=Regulatory Multiplicities in Telecommunications Reforms in Indonesia and China|work=MqJBL|year=2005|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 June 2004, Telkom began to provide their own [[International Direct Dialling|international direct dial]] fixed line services.

Its replacement, [[Telkom-3S]] successfully launched aboard an [[Ariane 5]] rocket on 14 February 2017, 21:39 UTC.\n\n==Operations==\nTelkom Indonesia is a dominant and largest provider of [[Landline|fixed line]] services due to owning most of Indonesia's copper network.<ref name=companyinfo/> Telkom also runs [[telephone exchanges]], [[Trunking|trunk network]] and [[local loop]] connections for its fixed-line telephones. Currently Telkom is responsible for approximately 8.3&nbsp;million telephone lines in Indonesia.<ref name=companyinfo/> And like most of the other state-ownership telecommunication company in the world, Telkom is obliged to provide public services such as [[Telephone booth|public call boxes]].\n\nTelkom Indonesia businesses are operated under government regulation by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information. Telkom, as government-owned company, is required to comply with additional obligations such as provide telecommunication services and not to discriminate. As well as providing service in those regulated areas, Telkom has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less government-owned-related regulation.<ref>{{cite

The company can be traced to an establishment of the first electromagnetic [[telegraph]] service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch Colonial Government]] to connecting Batavia ([[Jakarta]]) and Buitenzorg ([[Bogor]]).<ref name=anrep09>{{cite web|url=http://www.telkom.co.id/UHI/assets/pdf/EN/09_Corporate%20Data.pdf|title=History of TELKOM|publisher=Telkom Indonesia}}</ref> In 1884, the Dutch Colonial Government founded a private company to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph services.<ref name=anrep09full>{{cite web|url=http://www.telkom.co.id/download/File/UHI/SR/TELKOM_SR2009.pdf|title=TELKOM in Brief, History of the Company|publisher=Telkom Indonesia}}</ref>\n\n===Early years===\n[[Telephony]] services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by [[Privately held company|privately owned companies]] under a 25-year government license. In 1906, all [[Mail|postal]] and [[telegraph]] services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as single, unified government agency named ''Posts Telegraafend Telefoon Diensts'' (PTT).<ref name=anrep09/><ref name=posthist>{{cite web|url=http://www.posindonesia.co.id/profile.php?id=2|title=Sejarah Pos Indonesia|accessdate=13 August 2011|language=id|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623074703/http://www.posindonesia.co.id/profile.php?id=2|archivedate=23 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In September 1945, roughly a month after [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian proclamation of independence]], the agency headquarters in [[Bandung]] were taken over by Indonesian nationalists.<ref name=posthist/> In December 1949, after years of [[Indonesian National Revolution|national revolution war]], the PTT was nationalised by Indonesian Government as part of Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalise Dutch corporate assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iias.nl/nl/36/IIAS_NL36_18.pdf|title=Dutch enterprise in independent Indonesia: cooperation and confrontation, 1949\u20131958|publisher=IIAS Newsletter #36|date=March 2005|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elib.unikom.ac.id/files/disk1/484/jbptunikompp-gdl-asepsandyn-24180-1-unikom_a-i.pdf|title=Telkom Indonesia|accessdate=13 August 2011|language=id}}</ref>\n\n===State-owned company===\nIn 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established [[state-owned company]], the Postal and Telecommunications Services company. Four year later, on 6 July 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two state-owned companies, ''PN Pos Giro'' responsible for providing [[Mail|mail services]] and ''PN Telekomunikasi'' as [[telecommunications]] services.<ref name=\"separationpostal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.postalconsumers.org/postal_freedom_index/Indonesia_--_Pos_Indonesia.shtml|title=Indonesia \u2013 Pos Indonesia|work=Consumer Postal Council|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> The mail services ''PN Pos Giro'' developed over year, to become the [[Pos Indonesia]] in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia's 230 million people.<ref name=posthist/><ref name=separationpostal/>\n\nIn 1974, ''PN Telekomunikasi'' was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi ('''Perumtel''') provided \ndomestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia ('''PT INTI''') manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly established [[Indosat|PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation]] ('''Indosat''').<ref name=anrep09/>\n\nIn 1991, Perumtel became a state-owned [[Limited liability company|limited liability corporation]] and renamed to what is now ''Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero)'' '''PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia''' or '''Telkom'''. Until 1995, Telkom's operations were organised along twelve regional operating units known as ''Wilayah Telekomunikasi'' or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management and security.<ref name=anrep09/> In 1995, Telkom reorganised the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines and, at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.<ref name=anrep09/>\n\n===Privatisation===\nOn 14 November 1995, Telkom became a privatised company when shares went on sale through an initial public offering on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the [[Surabaya Stock Exchange]] (which merged in December 2007 to become the [[Indonesia Stock Exchange]]). Telkom's shares are also listed on the [[NYSE]] and the [[London Stock Exchange|LSE]] in the form of [[American Depositary Shares]] (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]]. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalisation in Indonesia, with a market capitalisation of approximately [[Indonesian rupiah|IDR]] 190,512&nbsp;trillion as of 31 December 2009.<ref name=anrep09/><ref name=marketcaplargest>{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/1293798817/state-companies-control-26-pct-stock-market-capital|title=State companies control 26% stock market capital|work=Antara News|date=31 December 2010|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom.

Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions.<ref name=anrep09/>\n\nSince 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange (\"LSE\"), and since 16 May 2014, they cease to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (\"TSE\") in Japan.<ref>http://www.telkom.co.id/assets/uploads/2013/05/telkom_20F_2014.pdf</ref>\n\n===Telecommunication deregulation===\nIn 1999, Indonesia passed a [[Deregulation|deregulating]] telecommunication law that set in motion a sweeping array of reforms and enlivened [[Competition law|competition policy]], [[Private equity|private investment]], and long term industry direction.<ref name=intelbrief/> Among the proposed reforms was the progressive elimination of the joint ownership, by Telkom and [[Indosat]], of most of the telecommunications companies in Indonesia. This was intended to promote a more competitive market. As a result, in 2001, Telkom acquired Indosat's 35.0% stake in [[Telkomsel]], resulting in Telkom owning 77.7% of the shares of Telkomsel, while Indosat acquired Telkom's 22.5% interest in Satelindo and its 37.7% stake in Lintasarta. In 2002, Telkom sold 12.7% of Telkomsel to [[SingTel|Singapore Telecom Mobile]] Pte Ltd (SingTel Mobile), reducing Telkom's ownership of Telkomsel to 65.0%.<ref name=anrep09/>\n\nOn 1 August 2001, the Government terminated Telkom's exclusive right to provide [[Landline|fixed line]] services in Indonesia and Indosat's right to provide [[International Direct Dialling|international direct dial]] services.

Telkom, as government-owned company, is required to comply with additional obligations such as provide telecommunication services and not to discriminate. As well as providing service in those regulated areas, Telkom has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less government-owned-related regulation.<ref>{{cite

NGOs in some countries are called [[Nonprofit organization|NPOs]] (a non-profit organization), and vice versa. [[Political party|Political parties]] and [[Trade union|trade unions]] are considered NGOs only in some countries. There are many different classifications of NGOs in use. The most common focus is on \"orientation\" and \"level of operation.\" An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vakil|first=Anna|date=December 1997|title=Confronting the classification problem: Toward a taxonomy of NGOs|journal=World Development|volume=25|issue=12|pages=2057\u20132070|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00098-3}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nNGO types can be understood by their orientation and their level of operation.\n\n=== By orientation ===\n* ''Charitable orientation'' often involves a top-down effort with little participation or input by beneficiaries. It includes NGOs with activities directed toward meeting the needs of the disadvantaged people/groups.\n* ''Service orientation'' includes NGOs with activities such as the provision of health, family planning, or education services. NGOs hold the program during these activities to provide service, and the people are expected to participate.\n* ''Participatory orientation'' is characterized by self-help projects where local people are involved, particularly in the implementation of a project by contributing cash, tools, land, materials, labor, etc. In the classical community development project, participation begins with the definition of need and continues to the planning and the implementation stages.\n* ''Empowering orientation'' aims to help poor people develop a clearer understanding of the social, political and economic factors affecting their lives, and to strengthen their awareness of their potential power to control their lives. There is maximum involvement of the beneficiaries, with NGOs acting as facilitators.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\">{{cite book |last=Lawry |first=Lynn |title=Guide to Nongovernmental Organizations for the Military |year=2009 |pages=29\u201330 |url=http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730130926/http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref>\n\n=== By level of operation ===\n* ''Community-based organizations'' (CBOs) arise out of people's initiatives. They can be responsible for raising the consciousness of the urban poor, helping them understand their rights in accessing required services, and providing such services.\n* ''City-wide organizations'' include organizations such as chambers of commerce and industry, coalitions of business, ethnic or educational groups, and associations of community organizations.\n*''State NGOs'' include state-level organizations, associations, and groups. Some state NGOs also work under the guidance of National and International NGOs.\n* ''National NGOs'' include national organizations such as the [[YMCA]]s/[[YWCA]]s, [[professional association]]s, and similar groups. Some have state or city branches and assist local NGOs.\n* ''International NGOs'' range from secular agencies such as [[Save the Children]] to religiously motivated groups. They can be responsible for funding local NGOs, institutions, and projects, and implementing projects.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\" />\n\nApart from the term NGO, there are alternative or overlapping terms in use, including [[Voluntary sector|third-sector]] organization (TSO), [[non-profit organization]] (NPO), voluntary organization (VO), [[civil society]] organization (CSO), [[grassroots]] organization (GO), [[social movement organization]] (SMO), private voluntary organization (PVO), [[self-help]] organization (SHO) and [[non-state actors]] (NSAs).\n\nIn Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and other [[Romance languages]], the 'mirrored' abbreviation \"ONG\" is in use, which has the same meaning as \"NGO\" (for example ''Organisation non governmental'' in French, ''Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00e3o Governmental'' in Portuguese, ''Organizaci\u00f3n no gubernamental'' in Spanish, or ''Organizzazione non governativa'' in Italian).\n\nGovernmental-related organizations / non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group. As a result, a long list of additional acronyms has developed, including:\n* BINGO: 'Business-friendly international NGO' or 'Big international NGO'\n* SBO: 'Social Benefit Organization,' a positive, goal-oriented designation as a substitute for the negative, \"Non-\" designations\n* TANGO: 'Technical assistance NGO'\n* TSO: 'third-sector organization'\n* [[GONGO]]: 'government-organized non-governmental organization' or 'government-operated NGOs' (set up by governments to look like NGOs to qualify for outside aid or promote the interests of government).\n* DONGO: 'Donor-organized NGO'\n* [[International non-governmental organization|INGO]]: 'International NGO'\n* [[QUANGO]]: 'quasi-autonomous NGO,' or [[QUANGO]] refers to NGOs set up and funded by the government. The term is particularly prevalent within the UK (where there are more than 1,200 of them), the Republic of Ireland, and the Commonwealth. \n* National NGO: A non-governmental organization that exists only in one country. This term is rare due to the globalization of non-governmental organizations, which causes an NGO to exist in more than one country.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\">{{cite web |last=Willetts |first=Peter |title=What is a Non-Governmental Organization? |url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/p.willetts/CS-NTWKS/NGO-ART.HTM |encyclopedia=UNESCO Encyclopaedia of Life Support Systems |publisher=City University London |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Civil society|CSO]]: 'Civil Society Organization'\n* [[ENGO]]: 'Environmental NGO,' such as [[Greenpeace]] and [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]].\n* NNGO: 'Northern NGO'\n* PANGO: 'Party NGO,' set up by parties and disguised as NGOs to serve their political matters.\n* SNGO: 'Southern NGO'\n* SCO: 'Social change organization'\n* TNGO: 'Transnational NGO.'

Examples include improving the state of the [[natural environment]], encouraging the observance of [[human rights]], improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corporate agenda. However, there are a vast number of such organizations, and their goals cover a broad range of political and philosophical positions, for example, private schools and athletic organizations.\n\n=== Track II diplomacy ===\n{{Main article|Track II diplomacy}}\nTrack II dialogue, or Track II diplomacy, is transnational coordination that involves non-official members of the government, including [[epistemic community|epistemic communities]] as well as former policymakers or analysts. Track II diplomacy aims to get policymakers and policy analysts to come to a common solution through discussions by unofficial means. Unlike the Track, I diplomacy where government officials, diplomats, and elected leaders gather to talk about specific issues, Track II diplomacy consists of experts, scientists, professors and other figures that are not involved in government affairs. The members of Track II diplomacy can have more freedom to exchange ideas and come up with compromises on their own.\n\n== Activities ==\nThere are numerous classifications of NGOs. The typology the [[World Bank]] uses divides them into Operational and Advocacy.<ref name=\"definition\">[http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm World Bank Criteria defining NGO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621135344/http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, NGOs act as implementers, catalysts, and partners. Firstly, NGOs act as implementers because they mobilize resources in order to provide goods and services to people who are suffering due to a human-made disaster or a natural disaster. Secondly, NGOs act as catalysts that drive change. They can \"''inspire, facilitate, or contribute to improved thinking and action to promote change''\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Lastly, NGOs often act as partners alongside other organizations to tackle problems and address human needs more effectively.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Non-Governmental Organizations and Development|last=Lewis|first=David|last2=Kanji|first2=Nazneen|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415454308|location=Oxon|pages=12\u201313|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nNGOs vary in their methods. Some act primarily as lobbyists, while others primarily conduct programs and activities. For instance, an NGO such as [[Oxfam]], concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean [[drinking water]]. In contrast, an NGO like the [[FFDA]] helps through investigation and documentation of human rights{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. Others, such as the [[Afghanistan Information Management Services]], provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations.\n\n=== Operational ===\nOperational NGOs seek to \"achieve small-scale change directly through projects.\"<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> They mobilize financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create localized programs. They hold large-scale [[fundraising]] events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. They often operate in a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure; the main headquarters are staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report and communicate with operational fieldworkers who work directly on projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Operational NGOs deal with a wide range of issues but are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. The division can further categorize operational NGOs into relief-oriented versus development-oriented organizations, according to whether they stress service delivery or participation, whether they are religious or secular, and whether they are more public- or private-oriented. Although operational NGOs can be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of operational NGOs is the implementation of projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> \n\n=== Campaigning ===\nCampaigning NGOs seek to \"''achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through the influence of the political system.''\"<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs need an active and efficient group of professional members who can keep supporters informed, and motivated. They must plan and host demonstrations and events that will keep their cause in the media. They must maintain a vast network of informed supporters who can be mobilized for events to garner media attention and influence policy changes. The defining activity of campaigning NGOs is holding demonstrations.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues relating to human rights, women's rights, and children's rights. The primary purpose of an Advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these organizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance, and knowledge by lobbying, press work, and activist events.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Both operational and campaigning ===\nIt is not uncommon for NGOs to make use of both activities. Many times, operational NGOs will use campaigning techniques if they continually face the same issues in the field that could be remedied through policy changes. At the same time, Campaigning NGOs, like human rights organizations, often have programs that assist the individual victims they are trying to help through their advocacy work.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Public relations ===\nNon-governmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. A [[Code of Ethics|code of ethics]] was established in 2002 by The World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wango.org/codeofethics.aspx|title=World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations - Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs|website=www.wango.org|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Project management ===\nThere is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in non-governmental organizations.<ref>[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CCS/pdf/int-work-paper4.pdf 100 <!-- application/pdf, 102909 bytes [[Kibibyte|KiB] --> LSE.ac.uk], Mukasa, Sarah. ''Are expatriate staff necessary in international development NGOs? A case study of an international NGO in Uganda.'' Publication of the Centre for Civil Society at the London School of Economics. 2002, p. 11-13.</ref> Generally, private, non-governmental organizations have either a communal or environmental focus. They address varieties of issues such as religion, emergency aid, or humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid. They often have strong links with community groups in developing countries, and often work in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. NGOs are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape. While NGOs influence national and multilateral policy-making, they are increasingly becoming more directly involved in local action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Corporate structure ==\n\n=== Staffing ===\nSome NGOs are highly professionalized and rely mainly on paid staff. Others are based around voluntary labor and are less formalized. Not all people working for non-governmental organizations are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.\n\nMany NGOs are associated with the use of international staff working in developing countries, but there are many NGOs around the world that rely on local employees or volunteers. There is some dispute as to whether [[expatriate]]s should be sent to developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a [[Donation|donor]] who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an [[Developed country|industrialized country]]. However, the expertise of these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by several factors: the cost of [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] is typically higher, they have no [[grassroots democracy|grass-root connections]] in the country they are sent to, and local expertise is often undervalued.<ref name=\"definition\" />\n\nThe NGO sector is an essential employer in terms of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For example, by the end of 1995, [[Concern Worldwide|CONCERN worldwide]], an international Northern NGO working against poverty, employed 174 expatriates and just over 5,000 national staff working in ten developing countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and in [[Haiti]].\n\n=== Funding ===\nNGOs are usually funded by [[Donation|donations]], but some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by [[Volunteering|volunteers]]. NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, and take different forms in different parts of the world. Some may have charitable status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for political, religious, or other interests. Since the end of [[World War II]], NGOs have had an increasing role in [[international development]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Werker|first1=Eric|last2=Ahmed|first2=Faisal Z.|year=2008|title=What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do?|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=22|issue=2|pages=74\u201375|doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref> particularly in the fields of humanitarian assistance and poverty alleviation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Werker|first1=Eric|last2=Ahmed|first2=Faisal Z.|year=2008|title=What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do?|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=22|issue=2|page=74|doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref>\n\nMajor sources of NGO funding include membership dues, the sale of [[Product (business)|goods]] and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, and private [[donation]]s. \n\nMany NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding, even though the term \"non-governmental organization\" implies [[independence]] from governments,<ref name=\"global\" /> A quarter of the US$162 million income in 1998 of the [[Famine relief|famine-relief]] organization [[Oxfam]] was donated by the British government and the EU. The Christian relief and development organization [[World Vision United States]] collected US$55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. Several EU-grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.\n\nGovernment funding of NGOs is controversial since, according to David Rieff, writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', \"the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precise that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/75421/ng-uh-o?page=0,0 |title=NG-Uh-O \u2013 The trouble with humanitarianism |author=David Rieff |date=June 10, 2010 |newspaper=The New Republic}}</ref> Some NGOs, such as [[Greenpeace]] do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations.<ref name=\"HBS\">{{cite web |author=Sarah Jane Gilbert |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5797.html |title=Harvard Business School, HBS Cases: The Value of Environmental Activists |publisher=Hbswk.hbs.edu |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"GP Annual report 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/international-annualreport-2008.pdf |title=Greenpeace Annual Report 2008 |publisher=Greenpeace.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref>\n\nSome NGOs require sizable funds to operate.

International Health cultivates collaborative relationships with NGOs, albeit at arm's length, recognizing their traditional independence, expertise, and honest broker status.

Further [[globalization]] of that process occurred after the fall of the communist system and was an important part of the [[Washington consensus]].<ref name=\"global\">Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz & Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: \"Civil Society in the Making\", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006</ref>\n\nGlobalization during the 20th century gave rise to the importance of NGOs. Many problems could not be solved within a nation. [[Treaty|International treaties]] and international organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] were centered mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises. In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian issues]], [[developmental aid]], and [[sustainable development]]. A prominent example of this is the [[World Social Forum]], which is a rival convention to the [[World Economic Forum]] held annually in January in [[Davos, Switzerland|Davos]], [[Switzerland]].

Service-delivery NGOs can serve as contractors or collaborate with democratized government agencies to reduce the cost associated with public goods.

His criticism on NGOs is found in two essays: \"Silences in NGO discourse: The role and future of NGOs in Africa\" and \"Reflections on NGOs in Tanzania: What we are, what we are not and what we ought to be\". Shivji argues that despite the good intentions of NGO leaders and activists, he is critical of the \"objective effects of actions, regardless of their intentions\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Shivji |first=Issa G. |title=Silence in NGO discourse: the role and future of NGOs in Africa |year=2007 |publisher=Fahamu |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-9545637-5-2 |page=84}}</ref> Shivji argues also that the sudden rise of NGOs is part of a [[neoliberal]] paradigm, rather than pure altruistic motivations. He is critical of the current manifestations of NGOs wanting to change the world without understanding it, and that the [[Imperialism|imperial]] relationship continues today with the rise of NGOs.\n\nJames Pfeiffer, in his case study of NGO involvement in Mozambique, speaks to the negative effects that NGOs have had on areas of health within the country. He argues that over the last decade, NGOs in Mozambique have \"fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe notes further that NGOs can be uncoordinated, creating parallel projects among different organizations, that pull health service workers away from their routine duties to serve the interests of the NGOs. This ultimately undermines local primary health care efforts and takes away the governments' ability to maintain agency over their health sector.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pfeiffer | first1 = J | year = 2003 | title = International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration | url = | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 725\u2013738 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0| pmid = 12560007 }}</ref> Pfeiffer suggested a new model of collaboration between the NGO and the DPS (the Mozambique Provincial Health Directorate).

In the beginning, as Parr indicated, there was \"a tendency among our critics to say that science is the only decision-making tool \u2026 but political and commercial interests are using science as a cover for getting their way.\"<ref name = bond323>{{citation|last = Bond|first = Michael|title = The Backlash against NGOs|work = Prospect|date = April 2000|page =323|url = https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/thebacklashagainstngos}}</ref> At the same time, NGOs can appear to not be cooperative with other groups, according to the previous policy-maker for the German branch of [[Friends of the Earth]], Jens Katjek. \"If NGOs want the best for the environment\", he says, \"they have to learn to compromise.\"<ref name = bond323/>\n\nNGOs have also been questioned as being \"too much of a good thing\".<ref name = Werker>{{cite journal | last1 = Werker | first1 = Eric | last2 = Ahmed | first2 = Faisal Z. | year = 2008 | title = What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 73\u201392 | doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref> Eric Werker and Faisal Ahmed bring up three potential critiques of the role of NGOs in developing nations: too many NGOs in a nation\u2014particularly one ruled by a warlord\u2014reduces the NGO's ability to establish a credible threat of removing humanitarian assistance since they can easily be replaced by another NGO; the frequent process of resource allocation and outsourcing to local organizations in international development projects results in high expenses for NGOs and rings into question how much of the resources and money actually goes to the intended beneficiaries at the end of the allocation process; and finally, NGO missions tend to be too paternalistic and expensive, though Werker and Ahmed propose that vouchers are a good way to overcome this obstacle.<ref name = Werker/>\n\n=== Challenges to legitimacy ===\nThe issue of the legitimacy of NGOs raises a series of important questions.

Who bestows responsibilities to NGOs or INGOs and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society is still not scrutinized thoroughly. For instance, in the article, it is stated, \"To put the point starkly: are the citizens of countries of the South and their needs represented in global civil society, or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation? And when we realize that INGOs hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent, or that they are not accountable to the people they represent, matters become even more troublesome.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chandhoke | first1 = Neera | year = 2005 | title = How Global Is Global Civil Society? | url = | journal = Journal of World-Systems Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 326\u2013327 | doi = 10.5195/JWSR.2005.388 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe origin of funding can have serious implications for the legitimacy of NGOs. NGOs have increased their numbers and range of activities to a level where they have become increasingly dependent on a limited number of donors.<ref name=\"1996HD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D. (1996) Too Close for comfort? The impact of official aid on Non-Governmental Organisations. \"World Development.\" 24(6), pp. 961\u2013973.</ref> Consequently, competition has increased for funding, as have the expectations of the donors, who may add conditions that threaten the independence of NGOs.<ref>, Ebrahim, A. (2003) Accountability in practice: Mechanisms for NGOs. \"World Development.\" 31(5), pp.813\u2013829.</ref> An over-dependence on official aid may dilute \"the willingness of NGOs to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments\".<ref name=2002aHD /> Some commentators have also argued that the changes in NGO funding sources have ultimately altered their functions.<ref name=2002aHD /><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/05/17/mckibbens-divestment-tour/ Brought to You by Wall Street], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2013.05.17</ref><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/14/350-orgs-friends-on-wall-street/ The Climate Wealth Opportunists], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.14</ref>\n\nNGOs have also been challenged on the grounds that they do not necessarily represent the needs of the developing world, through diminishing the so-called \u201cSouthern Voice\u201d. Some postulate that the [[North\u2013South divide]] exists in the arena of NGOs.<ref name=\"linden\">Lindenberg, M. and Bryant, C. (2001) Going Global: Transforming Relief and Development NGOs. Bloomfield: Kumarian Press.</ref> They question the equality of the relationships between Northern and Southern parts of the same NGOs as well as the relationships between Southern and Northern NGOs working in partnerships. This suggests a division of labor may develop, with the North taking the lead in advocacy and resource mobilization whilst the South engages in service delivery in the developing world.<ref name=linden /> The potential implications of this may mean the needs of the developing world are not addressed appropriately as Northern NGOs do not properly consult or participate in partnerships, such that they assign unrepresentative priorities.<ref>, Jenkins, R.

Instead of promoting equity and alleviating poverty, NGOs have been under scrutiny for contributing to socioeconomic inequality and dis-empowering services in the public sector of third world countries.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=Patrick-Cockburn>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/25/how-ngos-failed-afghanistan/ How NGOs Failed Afghanistan], [[Patrick Cockburn]], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.25</ref>\n\nThe scale and variety of activities in which NGOs participate have grown rapidly since 1980, particularly since 1990.<ref>Avina, J. (1993) The Evolutionary Life Cycles if Non-Governmental Development Organisations. \"Public Administration and Development.\" 13(5), pp. 453\u2013474.</ref> This has presented NGOs with a need to balance the pressures of centralization and decentralization. By centralizing NGOs, particularly those that operate at an international level, they can assign a common theme or set of goals. Conversely, it may also be advantageous to decentralize to increase the chances of an NGO responding more flexibly and effectively to localized issues by implementing projects, which are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits, and where all involved know that corruption will be punished.<ref name=Patrick-Cockburn /><ref>Anheier, H. and Themudo, N.

NGOs in some countries are called [[Nonprofit organization|NPOs]] (a non-profit organization), and vice versa. [[Political party|Political parties]] and [[Trade union|trade unions]] are considered NGOs only in some countries. There are many different classifications of NGOs in use. The most common focus is on \"orientation\" and \"level of operation.\" An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vakil|first=Anna|date=December 1997|title=Confronting the classification problem: Toward a taxonomy of NGOs|journal=World Development|volume=25|issue=12|pages=2057\u20132070|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00098-3}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nNGO types can be understood by their orientation and their level of operation.\n\n=== By orientation ===\n* ''Charitable orientation'' often involves a top-down effort with little participation or input by beneficiaries. It includes NGOs with activities directed toward meeting the needs of the disadvantaged people/groups.\n* ''Service orientation'' includes NGOs with activities such as the provision of health, family planning, or education services. NGOs hold the program during these activities to provide service, and the people are expected to participate.\n* ''Participatory orientation'' is characterized by self-help projects where local people are involved, particularly in the implementation of a project by contributing cash, tools, land, materials, labor, etc. In the classical community development project, participation begins with the definition of need and continues to the planning and the implementation stages.\n* ''Empowering orientation'' aims to help poor people develop a clearer understanding of the social, political and economic factors affecting their lives, and to strengthen their awareness of their potential power to control their lives. There is maximum involvement of the beneficiaries, with NGOs acting as facilitators.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\">{{cite book |last=Lawry |first=Lynn |title=Guide to Nongovernmental Organizations for the Military |year=2009 |pages=29\u201330 |url=http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730130926/http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref>\n\n=== By level of operation ===\n* ''Community-based organizations'' (CBOs) arise out of people's initiatives. They can be responsible for raising the consciousness of the urban poor, helping them understand their rights in accessing required services, and providing such services.\n* ''City-wide organizations'' include organizations such as chambers of commerce and industry, coalitions of business, ethnic or educational groups, and associations of community organizations.\n*''State NGOs'' include state-level organizations, associations, and groups. Some state NGOs also work under the guidance of National and International NGOs.\n* ''National NGOs'' include national organizations such as the [[YMCA]]s/[[YWCA]]s, [[professional association]]s, and similar groups. Some have state or city branches and assist local NGOs.\n* ''International NGOs'' range from secular agencies such as [[Save the Children]] to religiously motivated groups. They can be responsible for funding local NGOs, institutions, and projects, and implementing projects.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\" />\n\nApart from the term NGO, there are alternative or overlapping terms in use, including [[Voluntary sector|third-sector]] organization (TSO), [[non-profit organization]] (NPO), voluntary organization (VO), [[civil society]] organization (CSO), [[grassroots]] organization (GO), [[social movement organization]] (SMO), private voluntary organization (PVO), [[self-help]] organization (SHO) and [[non-state actors]] (NSAs).\n\nIn Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and other [[Romance languages]], the 'mirrored' abbreviation \"ONG\" is in use, which has the same meaning as \"NGO\" (for example ''Organisation non-gouvernementale'' in French, ''Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00e3o Governmental'' in Portuguese, ''Organizaci\u00f3n no gubernamental'' in Spanish, or ''Organizzazione non governativa'' in Italian).\n\nGovernmental-related organizations / non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group.

However, there are a vast number of such organizations, and their goals cover a broad range of political and philosophical positions, for example, private schools and athletic organizations.\n\n=== Track II diplomacy ===\n{{Main article|Track II diplomacy}}\nTrack II dialogue, or Track II diplomacy, is transnational coordination that involves non-official members of the government, including [[epistemic community|epistemic communities]] as well as former policymakers or analysts. Track II diplomacy aims to get policymakers and policy analysts to come to a common solution through discussions by unofficial means. Unlike the Track, I diplomacy where government officials, diplomats, and elected leaders gather to talk about specific issues, Track II diplomacy consists of experts, scientists, professors and other figures that are not involved in government affairs. The members of Track II diplomacy can have more freedom to exchange ideas and come up with compromises on their own.\n\n== Activities ==\nThere are numerous classifications of NGOs. The typology the [[World Bank]] uses divides them into Operational and Advocacy.<ref name=\"definition\">[http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm World Bank Criteria defining NGO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621135344/http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, NGOs act as implementers, catalysts, and partners. Firstly, NGOs act as implementers because they mobilize resources in order to provide goods and services to people who are suffering due to a human-made disaster or a natural disaster. Secondly, NGOs act as catalysts that drive change. They can \"''inspire, facilitate, or contribute to improved thinking and action to promote change''\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Lastly, NGOs often act as partners alongside other organizations to tackle problems and address human needs more effectively.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Non-Governmental Organizations and Development|last=Lewis|first=David|last2=Kanji|first2=Nazneen|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415454308|location=Oxon|pages=12\u201313|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nNGOs vary in their methods. Some act primarily as lobbyists, while others primarily conduct programs and activities. For instance, an NGO such as [[Oxfam]], concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean [[drinking water]]. In contrast, an NGO like the [[FFDA]] helps through investigation and documentation of human rights{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. Others, such as the [[Afghanistan Information Management Services]], provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations.\n\n=== Operational ===\nOperational NGOs seek to \"achieve small-scale change directly through projects.\"<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> They mobilize financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create localized programs. They hold large-scale [[fundraising]] events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. They often operate in a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure; the main headquarters are staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report and communicate with operational fieldworkers who work directly on projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Operational NGOs deal with a wide range of issues but are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. The division can further categorize operational NGOs into relief-oriented versus development-oriented organizations, according to whether they stress service delivery or participation, whether they are religious or secular, and whether they are more public- or private-oriented. Although operational NGOs can be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of operational NGOs is the implementation of projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> \n\n=== Campaigning ===\nCampaigning NGOs seek to \"''achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through the influence of the political system.''\"<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs need an active and efficient group of professional members who can keep supporters informed, and motivated. They must plan and host demonstrations and events that will keep their cause in the media. They must maintain a vast network of informed supporters who can be mobilized for events to garner media attention and influence policy changes. The defining activity of campaigning NGOs is holding demonstrations.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues relating to human rights, women's rights, and children's rights. The primary purpose of an Advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these organizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance, and knowledge by lobbying, press work, and activist events.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Both operational and campaigning ===\nIt is not uncommon for NGOs to make use of both activities. Many times, operational NGOs will use campaigning techniques if they continually face the same issues in the field that could be remedied through policy changes. At the same time, Campaigning NGOs, like human rights organizations, often have programs that assist the individual victims they are trying to help through their advocacy work.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Public relations ===\nNon-governmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. A [[Code of Ethics|code of ethics]] was established in 2002 by The World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wango.org/codeofethics.aspx|title=World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations - Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs|website=www.wango.org|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Project management ===\nThere is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in non-governmental organizations.<ref>[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CCS/pdf/int-work-paper4.pdf 100 <!-- application/pdf, 102909 bytes [[Kibibyte|KiB] --> LSE.ac.uk], Mukasa, Sarah. ''Are expatriate staff necessary in international development NGOs? A case study of an international NGO in Uganda.'' Publication of the Centre for Civil Society at the London School of Economics. 2002, p. 11-13.</ref> Generally, private, non-governmental organizations have either a communal or environmental focus. They address varieties of issues such as religion, emergency aid, or humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid. They often have strong links with community groups in developing countries, and often work in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. NGOs are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape. While NGOs influence national and multilateral policy-making, they are increasingly becoming more directly involved in local action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Corporate structure ==\n\n=== Staffing ===\nSome NGOs are highly professionalized and rely mainly on paid staff. Others are based around voluntary labor and are less formalized. Not all people working for non-governmental organizations are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.\n\nMany NGOs are associated with the use of international staff working in developing countries, but there are many NGOs around the world that rely on local employees or volunteers. There is some dispute as to whether [[expatriate]]s should be sent to developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a [[Donation|donor]] who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an [[Developed country|industrialized country]]. However, the expertise of these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by several factors: the cost of [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] is typically higher, they have no [[grassroots democracy|grass-root connections]] in the country they are sent to, and local expertise is often undervalued.<ref name=\"definition\" />\n\nThe NGO sector is an essential employer in terms of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For example, by the end of 1995, [[Concern Worldwide|CONCERN worldwide]], an international Northern NGO working against poverty, employed 174 expatriates and just over 5,000 national staff working in ten developing countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and in [[Haiti]].\n\n=== Funding ===\nNGOs are usually funded by [[Donation|donations]], but some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by [[Volunteering|volunteers]]. NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, and take different forms in different parts of the world. Some may have charitable status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for political, religious, or other interests. Since the end of [[World War II]], NGOs have had an increasing role in [[international development]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Werker|first1=Eric|last2=Ahmed|first2=Faisal Z.|year=2008|title=What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do?|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=22|issue=2|pages=74\u201375|doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref> particularly in the fields of humanitarian assistance and poverty alleviation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Werker|first1=Eric|last2=Ahmed|first2=Faisal Z.|year=2008|title=What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do?|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=22|issue=2|page=74|doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref>\n\nMajor sources of NGO funding include membership dues, the sale of [[Product (business)|goods]] and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, and private [[donation]]s. \n\nMany NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding, even though the term \"non-governmental organization\" implies [[independence]] from governments,<ref name=\"global\" /> A quarter of the US$162 million income in 1998 of the [[Famine relief|famine-relief]] organization [[Oxfam]] was donated by the British government and the EU. The Christian relief and development organization [[World Vision United States]] collected US$55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. Several EU-grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.\n\nGovernment funding of NGOs is controversial since, according to David Rieff, writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', \"the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precise that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/75421/ng-uh-o?page=0,0 |title=NG-Uh-O \u2013 The trouble with humanitarianism |author=David Rieff |date=June 10, 2010 |newspaper=The New Republic}}</ref> Some NGOs, such as [[Greenpeace]] do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations.<ref name=\"HBS\">{{cite web |author=Sarah Jane Gilbert |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5797.html |title=Harvard Business School, HBS Cases: The Value of Environmental Activists |publisher=Hbswk.hbs.edu |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"GP Annual report 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/international-annualreport-2008.pdf |title=Greenpeace Annual Report 2008 |publisher=Greenpeace.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref>\n\nSome NGOs require sizeable funds to operate.

There may also be associations and watchdog organizations that research and publish details on the actions of NGOs working in particular geographic or program areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nIn recent years, many large corporations have increased their [[corporate social responsibility]] departments in an attempt to preempt NGO campaigns against certain corporate practices. As the logic goes, if corporations work ''with'' NGOs, NGOs will not work ''against'' corporations.

Unlike the \"co-option\" strategy described for corporations, the OASD(HA) recognizes the neutrality of health as an essential service. International Health cultivates collaborative relationships with NGOs, albeit at arm's length, recognizing their traditional independence, expertise, and honest broker status. While the goals of DoD and NGOs may seem incongruent, the DoD's emphasis on stability and security to reduce and prevent conflict suggests, on careful analysis, important mutual interests.\n\n== History ==\nInternational non-governmental organizations have a history dating back to at least the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Thomas |title=NGOs: A New History of Transnational Civil Society |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-938753-3 |page=23 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ngos-9780199387533}}</ref><ref>Steve Charnovitz, \"Two Centuries of Participation: NGOs and International Governance, Michigan Journal of International Law, Winter 1997.</ref> It has been estimated that by 1914, there were 1083 NGOs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Subcontracting Peace \u2013 The Challenges of NGO Peacebuilding |editor1=Oliver P.

Many problems could not be solved within a nation. [[Treaty|International treaties]] and international organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] were centered mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises. In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian issues]], [[developmental aid]], and [[sustainable development]].

Service-delivery NGOs can serve as contractors or collaborate with democratized government agencies to reduce the cost associated with public goods.

Shivji]] is one of Africa's leading experts on law and development issues as an author and academic. His criticism on NGOs is found in two essays: \"Silences in NGO discourse: The role and future of NGOs in Africa\" and \"Reflections on NGOs in Tanzania: What we are, what we are not and what we ought to be\". Shivji argues that despite the good intentions of NGO leaders and activists, he is critical of the \"objective effects of actions, regardless of their intentions\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Shivji |first=Issa G. |title=Silence in NGO discourse: the role and future of NGOs in Africa |year=2007 |publisher=Fahamu |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-9545637-5-2 |page=84}}</ref> Shivji argues also that the sudden rise of NGOs is part of a [[neoliberal]] paradigm, rather than pure altruistic motivations. He is critical of the current manifestations of NGOs wanting to change the world without understanding it, and that the [[Imperialism|imperial]] relationship continues today with the rise of NGOs.\n\nJames Pfeiffer, in his case study of NGO involvement in Mozambique, speaks to the negative effects that NGOs have had on areas of health within the country. He argues that over the last decade, NGOs in Mozambique have \"fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe notes further that NGOs can be uncoordinated, creating parallel projects among different organizations, that pull health service workers away from their routine duties to serve the interests of the NGOs. This ultimately undermines local primary health care efforts and takes away the governments' ability to maintain agency over their health sector.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pfeiffer | first1 = J | year = 2003 | title = International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration | url = | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 725\u2013738 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0| pmid = 12560007 }}</ref> Pfeiffer suggested a new model of collaboration between the NGO and the DPS (the Mozambique Provincial Health Directorate).

Rather than operating through science to be rationally and effectively practical, NGOs have been accused of abusing the utilization of science to gain their own advantages.

Who bestows responsibilities to NGOs or INGOs and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society is still not scrutinized thoroughly. For instance, in the article, it is stated, \"To put the point starkly: are the citizens of countries of the South and their needs represented in global civil society, or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation?

(1996) Too Close for comfort?

Some postulate that the [[North\u2013South divide]] exists in the arena of NGOs.<ref name=\"linden\">Lindenberg, M. and Bryant, C. (2001) Going Global: Transforming Relief and Development NGOs. Bloomfield: Kumarian Press.</ref> They question the equality of the relationships between Northern and Southern parts of the same NGOs as well as the relationships between Southern and Northern NGOs working in partnerships. This suggests a division of labor may develop, with the North taking the lead in advocacy and resource mobilization whilst the South engages in service delivery in the developing world.<ref name=linden /> The potential implications of this may mean the needs of the developing world are not addressed appropriately as Northern NGOs do not properly consult or participate in partnerships, such that they assign unrepresentative priorities.<ref>, Jenkins, R.

By centralizing NGOs, particularly those that operate at an international level, they can assign a common theme or set of goals. Conversely, it may also be advantageous to decentralize to increase the chances of an NGO responding more flexibly and effectively to localized issues by implementing projects, which are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits, and where all involved know that corruption will be punished.<ref name=Patrick-Cockburn /><ref>Anheier, H. and Themudo, N.
