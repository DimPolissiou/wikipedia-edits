In fiscal terms, the throne lost the revenues needed to pay its chief officers, the emirs (nobles) and their entourages. The emperor lost authority, as the widely scattered imperial officers lost confidence in the central authorities, and made their own deals with local men of influence. The imperial army bogged down in long, futile wars against the more aggressive [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], lost its fighting spirit. Finally came a series of violent political feuds over control of the throne. After the execution of [[Farrukhsiyar|Emperor Farrukhsiyar]] in 1719, local Mughal successor states took power in region after region.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = J.F. | year = 1981 | title = Mughal State Finance and the Premodern World Economy | journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 285\u2013308 | jstor=178737 | doi=10.1017/s0010417500013311}}</ref>\n\nContemporary chroniclers bewailed the decay they witnessed, a theme picked up by the first British historians who wanted to underscore the need for a British-led rejuvenation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir William Wilson Hunter|title=Imperial gazetteer of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYlDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA107|year=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=107}}</ref>\n\n==== Modern views on the decline ====\nSince the 1970s historians have taken multiple approaches to the decline, with little consensus on which factor was dominant.

They had bam-boo rods, a rocket-body lashed to the rod, and iron points. They were directed at the target and fired by lighting the fuse, but the trajectory was rather erratic. The use of mines and counter-mines with explosive charges of gunpowder is mentioned for the times of Akbar and [[Jahangir|Jah\u0101ngir]].</blockquote>\n\nLater, the [[Mysorean rockets]] were upgraded versions of Mughal rockets used during the [[Siege of Jinji]] by the progeny of the [[Nawab of Arcot]]. [[Hyder Ali]]'s father [[Fatah Muhammad]] the constable at [[Budikote]], commanded a corps consisting of 50 rocketmen (''Cushoon'') for the Nawab of Arcot. Hyder Ali realised the importance of rockets and introduced advanced versions of metal cylinder rockets. These rockets turned fortunes in favour of the [[Sultanate of Mysore]] during the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]], particularly during the [[Battle of Pollilur]]. In turn, the Mysorean rockets were the basis for the [[Congreve rocket]]s, which Britain deployed in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] against France and the [[War of 1812]] against the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.res.in/pages/rocketsdet.htm|title=Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750\u20131850 A.D.|author=Roddam Narasimha|year=1985|website= |publisher=National Aerospace Laboratories, India|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Science ==\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n{{See also|Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|Indian astronomy}}\n\nWhile there appears to have been little concern for [[theoretical astronomy]], Mughal  [[astronomers]]  made advances in [[observational astronomy]] and produced nearly a hundred ''[[Zij]]'' treatises.

In fiscal terms, the throne lost the revenues needed to pay its chief officers, the emirs (nobles) and their entourages. The emperor lost authority, as the widely scattered imperial officers lost confidence in the central authorities, and made their own deals with local men of influence. The imperial army bogged down in long, futile wars against the more aggressive [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], lost its fighting spirit. Finally came a series of violent political feuds over control of the throne. After the execution of [[Farrukhsiyar|Emperor Farrukhsiyar]] in 1719, local Mughal successor states took power in region after region.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = J.F. | year = 1981 | title = Mughal State Finance and the Premodern World Economy | journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 285\u2013308 | jstor=178737 | doi=10.1017/s0010417500013311}}</ref>\n\nContemporary chroniclers bewailed the decay they witnessed, a theme picked up by the first British historians who wanted to underscore the need for a British-led rejuvenation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir William Wilson Hunter|title=Imperial gazetteer of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYlDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA107|year=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=107}}</ref>\n\n==== Modern views on the decline ====\nSince the 1970s historians have taken multiple approaches to the decline, with little consensus on which factor was dominant.

They had bam-boo rods, a rocket-body lashed to the rod, and iron points. They were directed at the target and fired by lighting the fuse, but the trajectory was rather erratic. The use of mines and counter-mines with explosive charges of gunpowder is mentioned for the times of Akbar and [[Jahangir|Jah\u0101ngir]].</blockquote>\n\nLater, the [[Mysorean rockets]] were upgraded versions of Mughal rockets used during the [[Siege of Jinji]] by the progeny of the [[Nawab of Arcot]]. [[Hyder Ali]]'s father [[Fatah Muhammad]] the constable at [[Budikote]], commanded a corps consisting of 50 rocketmen (''Cushoon'') for the Nawab of Arcot. Hyder Ali realised the importance of rockets and introduced advanced versions of metal cylinder rockets. These rockets turned fortunes in favour of the [[Sultanate of Mysore]] during the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]], particularly during the [[Battle of Pollilur]]. In turn, the Mysorean rockets were the basis for the [[Congreve rocket]]s, which Britain deployed in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] against France and the [[War of 1812]] against the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.res.in/pages/rocketsdet.htm|title=Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750\u20131850 A.D.|author=Roddam Narasimha|year=1985|website= |publisher=National Aerospace Laboratories, India|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Science ==\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n{{See also|Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|Indian astronomy}}\n\nWhile there appears to have been little concern for [[theoretical astronomy]], Mughal  [[astronomers]]  made advances in [[observational astronomy]] and produced nearly a hundred ''[[Zij]]'' treatises.

See Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, p. 8</ref> The document relative to the sale indicates that the site had been occupied by the mint since 'antiquity', perhaps since the first minting of a local coin, a [[French denier|Carolingian silver penny]] issued in the name of the emperor [[Louis the Pious]].<ref>The coin resembles  issues minted throughout the empire from 819-822 in appearance and weight. See Stahl, ''Zecca\u2026,'' pp. 3-4</ref> Evidence suggests a subsequent cessation of minting in the mid-twelfth century during which time the coinage of Verona seems to have been used for local transactions while [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine coins]] were used for long-distance trade.<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 8-13</ref> Local minting resumed when ducal coinage was first issued during the reign of [[Vitale II Michiel]] (1156-1172)<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, p. 13</ref> and increased significantly when the [[Venetian grosso|grosso]] was introduced.<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 16-22</ref>\n\n[[File:Reuwich-mint.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from woodcut ''Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam'' by [[Erhard Reuwich]] (1486), showing the earlier mint (shaded) in Saint Mark's Square.]]\n[[File:Zecca venise.jpg|thumb|Frontal view]]\nA new silver mint is mentioned as already present in [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]] in a resolution of the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]] in 1278.<ref>The deliberation of the Great Council, dated 8 October, obligated merchants to sell silver either at Rialto or in Saint Mark's Square at the Mint or the moneychangers' booths. See Stahl, ''Zecca\u2026,'' p. 281</ref> The location, across the Piazzetta from the [[Doge's Palace]], facilitated oversight by the appropriate magistracy, the [[Council of Forty]], and ensured greater security. It also followed a longstanding tradition in Italy that the mint as a symbol of fiscal autonomy and economic prosperity be located near the seat of the government.<ref>In their architectural treatises both [[Vitruvius]] and later [[Filarete]] recommended that the mint, or treasury, be situated near the center of government. Elsewhere in Italy, the Vatican mint was built near the entrance to the Apostolic Palace and the Florentine Mint initially opposite the Palazzo della Signoria and subsequently behind the Loggia de' Signori. See Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 168, note 4.</ref> A separate gold mint, probably adjacent to the existing silver mint, was established in 1285 following the introduction of the [[Ducat#Gold ducat of Venice|ducat]].<ref>Stalh, ''Zecca''\u2026, p. 285.</ref> It is referred to in a deliberation of the Great Council, dated that same year, as the ''Zecca'', from the Arabic noun ''sikka'', meaning \"die\". By 1290, the name was also used for the silver mint, formerly known by the term ''Moneta''.<ref>Stahl, Zecca\u2026, pp.33-34</ref>\n\nOver time, these mint facilities were expanded and floors added as demand for coinage increased.<ref>Between 1319 and 1339, both the silver and gold mints were expanded. An additional floor to the gold mint was authorized in 1343 to accommodate four additional hearths, but this was eliminated in 1352. See Stahl. ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 285-286.</ref> The Reuwich woodcut (Mainz, 1486) and the [[View of Venice|de' Barbari engraving]] (Venice, 1500) show the mint as a single, three-story building with a courtyard behind.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', pp. 182-183 and Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 282-283. Stahl mistakes the central meat market to the east as a part of the mint.</ref> The structure is delimitated on all sides: to the west by a canal, to the north by the tenth-century hospice for pilgrims, to the east by a series of hostelries and the meat market, and to the south by a row of lean-to stalls that were rented by the [[Procurators of Saint Mark|procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'']] to vendors of sausage and cheese.\n\nSafety concerns within the mint were raised when fire broke out in July 1532,<ref>Sanudo, Marin, ''Diari'', ed. G. Berchet et. al., 1902, Venezia, vol. 57, col 516, 7 July 1532</ref> and following an inspection by Doge [[Andrea Gritti]] to verify conditions, the [[Council of Ten]], the magistracy responsible for the defense of vital state interests, deliberated on 4 December 1535 that the entire mint was to be rebuilt with stone vaults so as to eliminate the use of wooden beams.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 182 and Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 39.</ref> This decision coincided with a need to add furnaces and increase production following a deliberation of the Council of Ten in 1526 that obligated the government offices dislocated in the subject cities on the mainland to accept only Venetian currency, effectively substituting local currencies for official business. In addition, it was necessary to improve security when after 1528 interest-earning private deposits began to be accepted at the mint as a means of increasing the supply of silver for minting.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 182</ref>\n\nFor the design of the new mint, three projects were reviewed, and on 28 March 1536, the Council of Ten awarded the commission to Jacopo Sansovino.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026 , p. 39 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 183.

The [[War of the League of Cambrai|third Italian war]] lasted from 1508-1516. Conflicts on the mainland began anew in 1521 with the [[Italian War of 1521\u20131526|fourth]] and [[War of the League of Cognac|fifth Italian war]]s and concluded in 1530. Famine struck in 1527-1528.</ref> It was an integral part of the ''renovatio urbis'', the vast architectural program begun under Doge [[Andrea Gritti]] to express Venice's renewed self-confidence and reaffirm its international prestige after the earlier defeat at [[Battle of Agnadello|Agnadello]] during the [[War of the League of Cambrai|War of Cambrai]] and the subsequent Peace of Bologna which sanctioned Habsburg hegemony on the Italian peninsula at the end of the [[War of the League of Cognac]]. The program, which included the [[Biblioteca Marciana|library]] (1537) and the [[Loggetta del Sansovino|loggia]] of the bell tower (1538), called for the transformation of [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark\u2019s Square]] from an antiquated medieval town center with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical forum. The intent was to evoke the memory of the ancient Roman republic and, in the aftermath of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, to present Venice as Rome\u2019s true successor.<ref>See in general Chambers, ''The Imperial Age of Venice''..., pp. 12\u201331.</ref> Sansovino's understanding of [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian principles]] and his direct knowledge of ancient Roman prototypes, garnered from his time in Rome, provided the expertise necessary to enact the program.\n\n[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto 089.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tintoretto]], ''Portrait of [[Jacopo Sansovino]]'' (before 1546), Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi.

An estimated 23,000 to 24,000 slaves existed on Cyprus. These were descendants of the earlier invaders who had later been enslaved by the Byzantines. For a discussion, see Berchet, Federico, ''Contributo alla storia dell'edificio della veneta Zecca, prima della sua destinazione a sede della Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana'', Atti del Regio Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, lxix (1909-1910), part II, pp. 339-367.</ref> Additional funds were similarly raised in 1539 and 1544. Ultimately, the construction of the mint exceeded initial cost estimates roughly six fold.<ref>By 1558, 28,879 ducats had been spent to complete Sansovino's design. Additional funds in the amount of 1,790 ducats arrived later and were used to finance the additional floor. See Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, pp. 42 and 169, note 31.</ref>\n\nSince minting operations could not be interrupted, work had to proceed piecemeal, beginning with the charcoal depository on the northern side. In 1539, it was decided to incorporate the lean-to cheese and sausage shops along the embankment into the new structure in order to give greater dignity to the mint fa\u00e7ade but also to then extend the upper floor over the shops and provide additional space for the gold mint which was located upstairs for greater security. The shops were subsequently relocated and the space annexed to the mint.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 42 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184.

See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184.</ref>\n\n'''1558 addition'''\n\nSansovino's original building had only two floors with a low attic above, lit by small rectangular windows. But the attic became unusable during the summer months due to the combined heat of the sun on the leaden roof above and the furnaces below. In 1558, the Council of Ten consequently authorized the construction of an additional floor to be paid for with the remaining funds.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, pp. 42-43 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184</ref> Although Sansovino was likely consulted for technical and structural aspects, it is improbable that he in fact designed the uppermost floor.<ref>The decision to add another floor to the mint coincided with a legal dispute between Sansovino's regular employers, the procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'', and the mint officials, the ''provveditori in Zecca'', regarding the rightful recipient of the rental income from the sausage and cheese shops that had been incorporated into the mint. In 1554, the ''Provveditori'' ordered the tenets to pay the rent to the mint rather than to the procurators as in the past. In the resulting case, the ''provveditori'' objected to Sansovino's testimony on the grounds that he was an employee of the procurators and therefore biased. In such tense circumstances, it is unlikely that they would have awarded him the contract for the new floor of the mint. See Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 42, Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184, and Tafuri, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 72, note 89.</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Diagram-Zecca.jpg|thumb|Layout of the ground floor with shaded area indicating location of sausage and cheese shops (relocated in 1588).]]\n'''Layout'''\n\nDue to the need to ensure ongoing minting operations during construction, the basic layout of the earlier mint was most likely maintained, activities being momentarily relocated as new sections were built.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 40</ref> The area on the ground floor facing the lagoon, separated from the rest of the building by a staircase and a long corridor connecting the water entry along the canal and the land entry onto the Piazzetta, was occupied by the offices of the silver officials and by the furnaces for the smelting and casting of silver. In the rear section, twenty workshops for the production of silver coins were located along the sides of a rectangular courtyard with a cistern for water.<ref>The wellhead with a statue of Apollo by [[Danese Cattaneo]] is now located in the courtyard of Ca' Pesaro.</ref> Sansovino designed these workshops as small spaces so that the closely placed walls would provide adequate support for the heavy stone vaults. Charcoal deposits were located on the far side of the courtyard. The upper floor, destined for the minting of gold coins, was similarly arranged but with larger, and hence fewer, workshops.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 183</ref>\n\n[[File:Zecca of Venice rustication.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of fa\u00e7ade showing rustication of Doric order.]]\n'''Fa\u00e7ade'''\n\nTo convey a sense of impregnability appropriate to the function of the mint, Sansovino employed for the ground floor heavy [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] which was extended over the [[Doric order]] on the floor above. In Venice, such a combination of heavy-cut [[Istrian stone|Istrian limestone]] and classical orders had already been used by [[Mauro Codussi]] for [[San Michele in Isola]] (begun 1469) and, in a more muted form, for [[Palazzo Corner Spinelli]] (1497-1500). However, it is likely that Sansovino was inspired by the ancient [[Porta Maggiore]] built under Claudius (52) and by [[Giulio Romano]]'s designs for the portal at Villa Madama (1519) as well as for his own residence at Macel de' Corvi (1523-1524) with which Sansovino would have been familiar from his second period in Rome (1516-1527).<ref>Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', p. 145 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 189</ref> Significantly, [[Sebastiano Serlio]], in his seven-volume architectural treatise ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva'', considered the solution of clean-cut capitals and bases with crude, rusticated columns to represent great strength and to be appropriate to a fortress.<ref>Serlio, Sebastiano, ''Regole generali di architetura sopra le cinque maniere de gliedifici'', 1537, Venetia, Francesco Marcolini, c. XIIIv.</ref>\n\nThe windows on the Doric level, originally protected by heavy iron grilles, are fit tightly between the [[engaged column]]s with no exposed surface, creating the impression that they are deeply recessed in a thick wall and contributing further to the sense of impregnability. The effect is enhanced by the massive, protruding lintels above. The floor that was later added employs the [[Ionic order]], and although it continues the rustication, the exposed walls around the windows and the delicate [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]s overhead contrast with the design of the original structure and diminish the overall massive feel.\n\n'''Entry'''\n\nThe heavily rusticated entry portal, flanked by two [[telamon]]s supporting a Doric entablature, was subsequently incorporated into the seventeenth arcade of the [[Biblioteca Marciana#Scamozzi\u2019s superintendence (1582\u20131588)|library]].<ref>Giulio Lorenzetti erroneously ascribes the design of the entry to Vincenzo Scamozzi, Sansovino's pupil, in ''Itinerario sansoviniano in Venezia'' (1929), but as the entry is already mentioned by Francesco Sansovino in ''Tutte le cose notabili che sono in Venetia'' (1556), prior to Scamozzi's superintendence of the library, it should be ascribed to Sansovino. See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184.</ref> In the resulting passageway, two colossal statues, carved by [[Girolamo Campagna]] and [[Tiziano Aspetti]], were placed.\n\n==Mint staff and officials==\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 256\n | gap = 20\n | header = \n | image1 = Biringuccio-De la pirotechnia-1.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n | image2 = Biringuccio-De la pirotechnia.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = Illustrations of the [[cupellation]] process used to separate silver from base metals.<br> Source: Biringuccio, Vannoccio, ''De la pirotechnia'', 1550, Vinegia, Giovan Padoano, cc. 45r and 47r.\n}}\n'''Production'''\n\n{{See also|Hammered coinage}}\n\nMinting activity fluctuated throughout the year according to the availability of bullion and the commercial needs of the merchants but was most intense in spring and early summer when, after the snow in the Alps had melted, German merchants brought silver and gold to the city and the departing merchant-galley fleets required large amounts of coinage for trade in the East.<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 369-370.</ref>\n\nThe number of employees consequently varied, but in addition to the salaried ''gastaldi'' (foremen), ''fabri'' (blacksmiths who forged dies), ''intaidori'' (die engravers), ''pexadori'' (weighers), and ''fanti'' (unskilled workers with menial tasks), the staff routinely included skilled laborers paid at a piecework rate: ''afinadori'' (refiners), ''fondadori'' (casters who cast blank flans), ''mendadori'' (emenders who controlled the prescribed weight tolerances), and ''stampadori'' (moneyers who struck coins) for both the silver mint (lower floor) and the gold mint (upper floor).<ref>See Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp.320-353 for a description of mint operations.</ref> Estimates for the medieval mint place the workforce at around 225 individuals, making the mint the second largest single employer after the [[Venetian Arsenal|Arsenal]], the government-operated shipyards.<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, p. 320</ref>\n\n* '''''Massari alla moneta e Massari all'oro e all'argento'''''\n\nThe technical operations were coordinated by the ''Massari alla moneta e Massari all'argento e all'oro'' (mintmasters, separate for silver and gold).

Initially charged with the acquiring and minting of gold and the refining of silver, the ''Provveditore'' quickly assumed responsibility for the general direction of the mint. In addition the ''Provveditore'' was responsible for dispensing government funds that were deposited in the mint to the subject cities and to the army.  In 1562, the number of members of the Magistracy was increased to two and in 1572 a third was added.

See Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, p. 8</ref> The document relative to the sale indicates that the site had been occupied by the mint since 'antiquity', perhaps since the first minting of a local coin, a [[French denier|Carolingian silver penny]] issued in the name of the emperor [[Louis the Pious]].<ref>The coin resembles  issues minted throughout the empire from 819-822 in appearance and weight. See Stahl, ''Zecca\u2026,'' pp. 3-4</ref> Evidence suggests a subsequent cessation of minting in the mid-twelfth century during which time the coinage of Verona seems to have been used for local transactions while [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine coins]] were used for long-distance trade.<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 8-13</ref> Local minting resumed when ducal coinage was first issued during the reign of [[Vitale II Michiel]] (1156-1172)<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, p. 13</ref> and increased significantly when the [[Venetian grosso|grosso]] was introduced.<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 16-22</ref>\n\n[[File:Reuwich-mint.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from woodcut ''Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam'' by [[Erhard Reuwich]] (1486), showing the earlier mint (shaded) in Saint Mark's Square.]]\n[[File:Zecca venise.jpg|thumb|Frontal view]]\nA new silver mint is mentioned as already present in [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]] in a resolution of the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]] in 1278.<ref>The deliberation of the Great Council, dated 8 October, obligated merchants to sell silver either at Rialto or in Saint Mark's Square at the Mint or the moneychangers' booths. See Stahl, ''Zecca\u2026,'' p. 281</ref> The location, across the Piazzetta from the [[Doge's Palace]], facilitated oversight by the appropriate magistracy, the [[Council of Forty]], and ensured greater security. It also followed a longstanding tradition in Italy that the mint as a symbol of fiscal autonomy and economic prosperity be located near the seat of the government.<ref>In their architectural treatises both [[Vitruvius]] and later [[Filarete]] recommended that the mint, or treasury, be situated near the center of government. Elsewhere in Italy, the Vatican mint was built near the entrance to the Apostolic Palace and the Florentine Mint initially opposite the Palazzo della Signoria and subsequently behind the Loggia de' Signori. See Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 168, note 4.</ref> A separate gold mint, probably adjacent to the existing silver mint, was established in 1285 following the introduction of the [[Ducat#Gold ducat of Venice|ducat]].<ref>Stalh, ''Zecca''\u2026, p. 285.</ref> It is referred to in a deliberation of the Great Council, dated that same year, as the ''Zecca'', from the Arabic noun ''sikka'', meaning \"die\". By 1290, the name was also used for the silver mint, formerly known by the term ''Moneta''.<ref>Stahl, Zecca\u2026, pp.33-34</ref>\n\nOver time, these mint facilities were expanded and floors added as demand for coinage increased.<ref>Between 1319 and 1339, both the silver and gold mints were expanded. An additional floor to the gold mint was authorized in 1343 to accommodate four additional hearths, but this was eliminated in 1352. See Stahl. ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 285-286.</ref> The Reuwich woodcut (Mainz, 1486) and the [[View of Venice|de' Barbari engraving]] (Venice, 1500) show the mint as a single, three-story building with a courtyard behind.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', pp. 182-183 and Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 282-283. Stahl mistakes the central meat market to the east as a part of the mint.</ref> The structure is delimitated on all sides: to the west by a canal, to the north by the tenth-century hospice for pilgrims, to the east by a series of hostelries and the meat market, and to the south by a row of lean-to stalls that were rented by the [[Procurators of Saint Mark|procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'']] to vendors of sausage and cheese.\n\nSafety concerns within the mint were raised when fire broke out in July 1532,<ref>Sanudo, Marin, ''Diari'', ed. G. Berchet et. al., 1902, Venezia, vol. 57, col 516, 7 July 1532</ref> and following an inspection by Doge [[Andrea Gritti]] to verify conditions, the [[Council of Ten]], the magistracy responsible for the defense of vital state interests, deliberated on 4 December 1535 that the entire mint was to be rebuilt with stone vaults so as to eliminate the use of wooden beams.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 182 and Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 39.</ref> This decision coincided with a need to add furnaces and increase production following a deliberation of the Council of Ten in 1526 that obligated the government offices dislocated in the subject cities on the mainland to accept only Venetian currency, effectively substituting local currencies for official business. In addition, it was necessary to improve security when after 1528 interest-earning private deposits began to be accepted at the mint as a means of increasing the supply of silver for minting.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 182</ref>\n\nFor the design of the new mint, three projects were reviewed, and on 28 March 1536, the Council of Ten awarded the commission to Jacopo Sansovino.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026 , p. 39 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 183.

The [[War of the League of Cambrai|third Italian war]] lasted from 1508-1516. Conflicts on the mainland began anew in 1521 with the [[Italian War of 1521\u20131526|fourth]] and [[War of the League of Cognac|fifth Italian war]]s and concluded in 1530. Famine struck in 1527-1528.</ref> It was an integral part of the ''renovatio urbis'', the vast architectural program begun under Doge [[Andrea Gritti]] to express Venice's renewed self-confidence and reaffirm its international prestige after the earlier defeat at [[Battle of Agnadello|Agnadello]] during the [[War of the League of Cambrai|War of Cambrai]] and the subsequent Peace of Bologna which sanctioned Habsburg hegemony on the Italian peninsula at the end of the [[War of the League of Cognac]]. The program, which included the [[Biblioteca Marciana|library]] (1537) and the [[Loggetta del Sansovino|loggia]] of the bell tower (1538), called for the transformation of [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark\u2019s Square]] from an antiquated medieval town center with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical forum. The intent was to evoke the memory of the ancient Roman republic and, in the aftermath of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, to present Venice as Rome\u2019s true successor.<ref>See in general Chambers, ''The Imperial Age of Venice''..., pp. 12\u201331.</ref> Sansovino's understanding of [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian principles]] and his direct knowledge of ancient Roman prototypes, garnered from his time in Rome, provided the expertise necessary to enact the program.\n\n[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto 089.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tintoretto]], ''Portrait of [[Jacopo Sansovino]]'' (before 1546), Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi.

See Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 169, note 13.</ref> To raise the 5,000 ducats appropriated for construction, the Council of Ten authorized the freeing of slaves on Cyprus, then a Venetian possession, at 50 ducats a head.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 39 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 183. An estimated 23,000 to 24,000 slaves existed on Cyprus. These were descendants of the earlier invaders who had later been enslaved by the Byzantines. For a discussion, see Berchet, Federico, ''Contributo alla storia dell'edificio della veneta Zecca, prima della sua destinazione a sede della Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana'', Atti del Regio Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, lxix (1909-1910), part II, pp. 339-367.</ref> Additional funds were similarly raised in 1539 and 1544. Ultimately, the construction of the mint exceeded initial cost estimates roughly six fold.<ref>By 1558, 28,879 ducats had been spent to complete Sansovino's design. Additional funds in the amount of 1,790 ducats arrived later and were used to finance the additional floor. See Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, pp. 42 and 169, note 31.</ref>\n\nSince minting operations could not be interrupted, work had to proceed piecemeal, beginning with the charcoal depository on the northern side. In 1539, it was decided to incorporate the lean-to cheese and sausage shops along the embankment into the new structure in order to give greater dignity to the mint fa\u00e7ade but also to then extend the upper floor over the shops and provide additional space for the gold mint which was located upstairs for greater security. The shops were subsequently relocated and the space annexed to the mint.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 42 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184. The senate deliberation is in the Archives in Senato Terra, f. 108, 15 Sept. 1588; PS, b. 33, proc. 67, c. 34-40t.</ref> Construction terminated in 1548.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 169, note 24 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', pp. 183-184. The document relative to the closing of the construction site is in the Archives in Provveditori di Zecca, Terminazioni, reg. 22, c. 82, 3 Jan 1547 m.v. (= 1548). Sansovino received a final payment on 17 May 1549. See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184.</ref>\n\n'''1558 addition'''\n\nSansovino's original building had only two floors with a low attic above, lit by small rectangular windows. But the attic became unusable during the summer months due to the combined heat of the sun on the leaden roof above and the furnaces below. In 1558, the Council of Ten consequently authorized the construction of an additional floor to be paid for with the remaining funds.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, pp. 42-43 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184</ref> Although Sansovino was likely consulted for technical and structural aspects, it is improbable that he in fact designed the uppermost floor.<ref>The decision to add another floor to the mint coincided with a legal dispute between Sansovino's regular employers, the procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'', and the mint officials, the ''provveditori in Zecca'', regarding the rightful recipient of the rental income from the sausage and cheese shops that had been incorporated into the mint. In 1554, the ''Provveditori'' ordered the tenets to pay the rent to the mint rather than to the procurators as in the past. In the resulting case, the ''provveditori'' objected to Sansovino's testimony on the grounds that he was an employee of the procurators and therefore biased. In such tense circumstances, it is unlikely that they would have awarded him the contract for the new floor of the mint. See Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 42, Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184, and Tafuri, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 72, note 89.</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Diagram-Zecca.jpg|thumb|Layout of the ground floor with shaded area indicating location of sausage and cheese shops (relocated in 1588).]]\n'''Layout'''\n\nDue to the need to ensure ongoing minting operations during construction, the basic layout of the earlier mint was most likely maintained, activities being momentarily relocated as new sections were built.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 40</ref> The area on the ground floor facing the lagoon, separated from the rest of the building by a staircase and a long corridor connecting the water entry along the canal and the land entry onto the Piazzetta, was occupied by the offices of the silver officials and by the furnaces for the smelting and casting of silver. In the rear section, twenty workshops for the production of silver coins were located along the sides of a rectangular courtyard with a cistern for water.<ref>The wellhead with a statue of Apollo by [[Danese Cattaneo]] is now located in the courtyard of Ca' Pesaro.</ref> Sansovino designed these workshops as small spaces so that the closely placed walls would provide adequate support for the heavy stone vaults. Charcoal deposits were located on the far side of the courtyard. The upper floor, destined for the minting of gold coins, was similarly arranged but with larger, and hence fewer, workshops.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 183</ref>\n\n[[File:Zecca of Venice rustication.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of fa\u00e7ade showing rustication of Doric order.]]\n'''Fa\u00e7ade'''\n\nTo convey a sense of impregnability appropriate to the function of the mint, Sansovino employed for the ground floor heavy [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] which was extended over the [[Doric order]] on the floor above. In Venice, such a combination of heavy-cut [[Istrian stone|Istrian limestone]] and classical orders had already been used by [[Mauro Codussi]] for [[San Michele in Isola]] (begun 1469) and, in a more muted form, for [[Palazzo Corner Spinelli]] (1497-1500). However, it is likely that Sansovino was inspired by the ancient [[Porta Maggiore]] built under Claudius (52) and by [[Giulio Romano]]'s designs for the portal at Villa Madama (1519) as well as for his own residence at Macel de' Corvi (1523-1524) with which Sansovino would have been familiar from his second period in Rome (1516-1527).<ref>Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', p. 145 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 189</ref> Significantly, [[Sebastiano Serlio]], in his seven-volume architectural treatise ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva'', considered the solution of clean-cut capitals and bases with crude, rusticated columns to represent great strength and to be appropriate to a fortress.<ref>Serlio, Sebastiano, ''Regole generali di architetura sopra le cinque maniere de gliedifici'', 1537, Venetia, Francesco Marcolini, c. XIIIv.</ref>\n\nThe windows on the Doric level, originally protected by heavy iron grilles, are fit tightly between the [[engaged column]]s with no exposed surface, creating the impression that they are deeply recessed in a thick wall and contributing further to the sense of impregnability. The effect is enhanced by the massive, protruding lintels above. The floor that was later added employs the [[Ionic order]], and although it continues the rustication, the exposed walls around the windows and the delicate [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]s overhead contrast with the design of the original structure and diminish the overall massive feel.\n\n'''Entry'''\n\nThe heavily rusticated entry portal, flanked by two [[telamon]]s supporting a Doric entablature, was subsequently incorporated into the seventeenth arcade of the [[Biblioteca Marciana#Scamozzi\u2019s superintendence (1582\u20131588)|library]].<ref>Giulio Lorenzetti erroneously ascribes the design of the entry to Vincenzo Scamozzi, Sansovino's pupil, in ''Itinerario sansoviniano in Venezia'' (1929), but as the entry is already mentioned by Francesco Sansovino in ''Tutte le cose notabili che sono in Venetia'' (1556), prior to Scamozzi's superintendence of the library, it should be ascribed to Sansovino. See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 184.</ref> In the resulting passageway, two colossal statues, carved by [[Girolamo Campagna]] and [[Tiziano Aspetti]], were placed.\n\n==Mint staff and officials==\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 256\n | gap = 20\n | header = \n | image1 = Biringuccio-De la pirotechnia-1.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n | image2 = Biringuccio-De la pirotechnia.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = Illustrations of the [[cupellation]] process used to separate silver from base metals.<br> Source: Biringuccio, Vannoccio, ''De la pirotechnia'', 1550, Vinegia, Giovan Padoano, cc. 45r and 47r.\n}}\n'''Production'''\n\n{{See also|Hammered coinage}}\n\nMinting activity fluctuated throughout the year according to the availability of bullion and the commercial needs of the merchants but was most intense in spring and early summer when, after the snow in the Alps had melted, German merchants brought silver and gold to the city and the departing merchant-galley fleets required large amounts of coinage for trade in the East.<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp. 369-370.</ref>\n\nThe number of employees consequently varied, but in addition to the salaried ''gastaldi'' (foremen), ''fabri'' (blacksmiths who forged dies), ''intaidori'' (die engravers), ''pexadori'' (weighers), and ''fanti'' (unskilled workers with menial tasks), the staff routinely included skilled laborers payed at a piecework rate: ''afinadori'' (refiners), ''fondadori'' (casters who cast blank flans), ''mendadori'' (emenders who controlled the prescribed weight tolerances), and ''stampadori'' (moneyers who struck coins) for both the silver mint (lower floor) and the gold mint (upper floor).<ref>See Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, pp.320-353 for a description of mint operations.</ref> Estimates for the medieval mint place the workforce at around 225 individuals, making the mint the second largest single employer after the [[Venetian Arsenal|Arsenal]], the government-operated shipyards.<ref>Stahl, ''Zecca''\u2026, p. 320</ref>\n\n* '''''Massari alla moneta e Massari all'oro e all'argento'''''\n\nThe technical operations were coordinated by the ''Massari alla moneta e Massari all'argento e all'oro'' (mintmasters, separate for silver and gold).

Initially charged with the acquiring and minting of gold and the refining of silver, the ''Provveditore'' quickly assumed responsibility for the general direction of the mint. In addition the ''Provveditore'' was responsible for dispensing government funds that were deposited in the mint to the subject cities and to the army.  In 1562, the number of members of the Magistracy was increased to two and in 1572 a third was added.

All products are manufactured according to highest quality standards at the company\u2019s headquarters in the Rhine valley town of Rastatt, Germany. It was founded in 1970 by Peter Lawo and is currently run by his son Philipp Lawo (CEO) and the extended management board. The company owns multiple subsidiaries with over 300 employees worldwide.\n\n<br />\n\n== About Lawo ==\nThe first developments of Peter Lawo\u2019s business were driven by the needs of composers of [[Electronic music#Elektronische%20Musik|electronic music]] like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. To Stockhausen's specifications Peter Lawo built an apparatus called \"module 69 B\" which was used to perform Stockhausen's composition [[Mantra (Stockhausen)#Structure|Mantra]]. The success of this production led to the founding of the Experimentalstudio of the Heinrich Strobel Foundation of the [[S\u00fcdwestfunk]] in 1971. Together with the first director of this studio, Hans-Peter Haller, Peter Lawo developed the Halaphon. (The name resulted from the names of the developers: HA(ller)-LA(wo)-PHON). This machine became famous when being used in all the later works of composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]].\n\nLater, Peter Lawo developed mixing consoles for Stockhausen, whose composition Oktophonie was produced in the [[Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Studio for Electronic Music]] of the German Public Broadcaster WDR ([[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]). For the production of this composition, the automatic recall of very fast fader movements was used\u2014which was made possible by Lawo's hybrid mixing console PTR (\"Programmierbare Ton Regie\" = programmable audio control).\n\nToday, after 50 years, Lawo is involved in more projects than ever before, the scale and scope of each of these projects is constantly growing, as customers recognize the potential of open-standard IP solutions and seek to leverage the freedom it affords to completely rethink their workflows.\n\nLawo\u2019s IP line-up covers the media production chain from acquisition to playout. It ranges from audio- and video-to-IP conversion edge devices, software-defined IP-routing,processing and multi-viewing platform, IP control and workflow design solution, monitoring and real-time telemetry tools to the mc\u00b2-series audio production consoles, as well as its IP-based counterparts for radio on-air production. \n\nLawo\u2019s philosophy:\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''Innovation'''. \n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''Quality'''. \n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''Reliability'''. \n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''Sustainability'''.\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''In-House Production'''.<br />\n==History==\n1970 \u2013 founded by Peter Lawo as engineer's office for electronic equipment\n*1970s \u2013 Development of electronic sound processors ([[Vocoder]], Halaphon and alike) and analog mixing consoles\n*1980s \u2013 Development of a programmable audio mixing console called PTR with digital control and analog signal processing\n*1990s \u2013 Development of the digital mc series mixing consoles\n*2007 \u2013 Introduction of DAW plugins for Windows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/audio/lawo-merges-daw-plug-ins-and-mixing-consoles|title=Lawo merges DAW plug-ins and mixing consoles|publisher=Broadcast Engineering|date=12 May 2007|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n*2008 \u2013 Lawo acquire majority shares in French digital audio company [[Innovason]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/lawo-acquires-majority-share-in-innovason|title=Lawo Acquires Majority Share in Innovason|publisher=Radioworld|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n*2010 \u2013 Introduction of the Sapphire mixing console at the IBC Exhibition in Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.live-production.tv/news/products/lawo-mixing-consoles-ibc-2010.html|title=Lawo Mixing Consoles at IBC 2010|date=20 September 2010|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n*2012 \u2013 50 Lawo consoles were used for sound mixing in the [[2012 London Olympics]].<ref name=\"psn\">{{cite web|title=Over 50 Lawo consoles mixing London 2012 Olympics|url=http://www.psneurope.com/broadcastnews-content/full/over-50-lawo-consoles-mixing-london-2012-olympics#.UOrXom-uCk4|publisher=PSN Europe|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.lawo.de/ Lawo AG Corporate Site]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturers of professional audio equipment]]\n[[Category:Music equipment manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of Germany]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:German brands]]\n[[Category:Audio mixing console manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Video equipment manufacturers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company\n| logo                = Lawo logo Web MAIN.jpg\n| industry            = Professional IP-Broadcast Equipment\n| founded             = 1970\n| founder             = Peter Lawo\n| hq_location         = Rastatt, Germany\n| key_people          = <ul>\n<li>Philipp Lawo, CEO</li>\n<li>Claudia Nowak, CFO</li>\n<li>Jamie Dunn, CCO</li>\n<li>Phil Myers, CTO</li>\n<li>Ulrich Schnabl, COO</li>\n<li>Christian Lukic, CSCO</li>\n</ul>\n| num_employees       = < 300{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Not verified in the article}}\n| website             = https://www.lawo.com/de/home.html\n}}\n\n\n'''Lawo''', based in Rastatt, Germany is an international, family-owned company, specializing in the design, development and manufacture of pioneering network, control, audio and video technology for broadcast and postproduction, as well as live performance and theatrical applications.

The company owns multiple subsidiaries with over 300 employees worldwide.\n\n<br />\n\n== About Lawo ==\nThe first developments of Peter Lawo\u2019s business were driven by the needs of composers of [[Electronic music#Elektronische%20Musik|electronic music]] like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. To Stockhausen's specifications Peter Lawo built an apparatus called \"module 69 B\" which was used to perform Stockhausen's composition [[Mantra (Stockhausen)#Structure|Mantra]]. The success of this production led to the founding of the Experimentalstudio of the Heinrich Strobel Foundation of the [[S\u00fcdwestfunk]] in 1971. Together with the first director of this studio, Hans-Peter Haller, Peter Lawo developed the Halaphon. (The name resulted from the names of the developers: HA(ller)-LA(wo)-PHON). This machine became famous when being used in all the later works of composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]].\n\nLater, Peter Lawo developed mixing consoles for Stockhausen, whose composition Oktophonie was produced in the [[Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Studio for Electronic Music]] of the German Public Broadcaster WDR ([[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]). For the production of this composition, the automatic recall of very fast fader movements was used\u2014which was made possible by Lawo's hybrid mixing console PTR (\"Programmierbare Ton Regie\" = programmable audio control).\n\nThe company is notable for supplying the audio mixing equipment for the [[2012 London Olympics]] and [[Nine Network]], and for sports events in Asia, North America and Australia.\n\nToday, after 50 years, Lawo is involved in more projects than ever before, the scale and scope of each of these projects is constantly growing, as customers recognize the potential of open-standard IP solutions and seek to leverage the freedom it affords to completely rethink their workflows.\n\nLawo\u2019s IP line-up covers the media production chain from acquisition to playout. It ranges from audio- and video-to-IP conversion edge devices, software-defined IP-routing, \n\nprocessing and multi-viewing platform, IP control and workflow design solution, monitoring and real-time telemetry tools to the mc\u00b2-series audio production consoles, as well as its IP-based counterparts for radio on-air production.\n\nLawo\u2019s philosophy:\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''Innovation'''. \n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''Quality'''. \n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''Reliability'''. \n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''Sustainability'''.\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 '''In-House Production'''.<br />\n==History==\n1970 \u2013 founded by Peter Lawo as engineer's office for electronic equipment\n*1970s \u2013 Development of electronic sound processors ([[Vocoder]], Halaphon and alike) and analog mixing consoles\n*1980s \u2013 Development of a programmable audio mixing console called PTR with digital control and analog signal processing\n*1990s \u2013 Development of the digital mc series mixing consoles\n*2007 \u2013 Introduction of DAW plugins for Windows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/audio/lawo-merges-daw-plug-ins-and-mixing-consoles|title=Lawo merges DAW plug-ins and mixing consoles|publisher=Broadcast Engineering|date=12 May 2007|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n*2008 \u2013 Lawo acquire majority shares in French digital audio company [[Innovason]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/lawo-acquires-majority-share-in-innovason|title=Lawo Acquires Majority Share in Innovason|publisher=Radioworld|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n*2010 \u2013 Introduction of the Sapphire mixing console at the IBC Exhibition in Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.live-production.tv/news/products/lawo-mixing-consoles-ibc-2010.html|title=Lawo Mixing Consoles at IBC 2010|date=20 September 2010|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n*2012 \u2013 50 Lawo consoles were used for sound mixing in the [[2012 London Olympics]].<ref name=\"psn\">{{cite web|title=Over 50 Lawo consoles mixing London 2012 Olympics|url=http://www.psneurope.com/broadcastnews-content/full/over-50-lawo-consoles-mixing-london-2012-olympics#.UOrXom-uCk4|publisher=PSN Europe|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.lawo.de/ Lawo AG Corporate Site]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturers of professional audio equipment]]\n[[Category:Music equipment manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of Germany]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:German brands]]\n[[Category:Audio mixing console manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Video equipment manufacturers]]\n", "name_user": "LawoSocial", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawo"}

It resembled a bull's voice in the noise of the water; its windings and its reaches gave rise to the story about his forming himself into a serpent and about his horns; the formation of islands at the mouth of the river requires no explanation.  His conquest by Heracles lastly refers to the embankments by which Heracles confined the river to its bed and thus gained large tracts of land for cultivation, which are expressed by the horn of plenty.<ref>[[Strabo]], x. p. 458.</ref><ref>Compare Voss, ''Mythologische Briefe'', lxxii.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Andrews, Tamra.

The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells.\"<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' VIII, 547ff.</ref>  In sixteenth-century Italy, an aspect of the revival of Antiquity was the desire to recreate Classical spaces as extensions of the revived [[villa]].  Ovid's description of the cave of Achelous provided some specific inspiration to patrons in France as well as Italy for the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] garden [[grotto]], with its cool dampness, [[tuff]] vaulting and shellwork walls. The banquet served by Ovid's Achelous offered a prototype for Italian midday feasts in the fountain-cooled shade of garden grottoes.\n\nAt the mouth of the Achelous River lie the [[Echinades]] Islands. According to Ovid's pretty myth-making in the same ''Metamorphoses'' episode, the Echinades Islands were once five nymphs. Unfortunately for them, they forgot to honor Achelous in their festivities, and the god was so angry about this slight that he turned them into the islands.\n\nIn Hellenistic and Roman contexts, the river god was often reduced to a mask and used decoratively as an emblem of water, \"his uncut hair wreathed with reeds\".<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' ix.</ref> The feature survived in Romanesque carved details and flowered during the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the Classical prototypes of the [[Green Man]].\n\n==Achelous and the River Achelous==\nHomer claims that the Achelous River was located in Lydia, near Mount Sipylos.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iliad|last=Homer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=24.616|quote=|via=}}</ref> There were at least six different rivers with the name Achelous in ancient times,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Potamikon: Sinews of Acheloios|author=Molinari and Sisci|publisher=|year=2016|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}</ref> all of which indicate that Achelous was originally not a single river, but a god of all water.\n\nThe origin of the river Achelous is described by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]:\n<blockquote>When Achelous on one occasion had lost his daughters, the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, and in his grief invoked his mother Gaea, she received him to her bosom, and on the spot where she received him, she caused the river bearing his name to gush forth.<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], ''ad Virg.

It resembled a bull's voice in the noise of the water; its windings and its reaches gave rise to the story about his forming himself into a serpent and about his horns; the formation of islands at the mouth of the river requires no explanation.  His conquest by Heracles lastly refers to the embankments by which Heracles confined the river to its bed and thus gained large tracts of land for cultivation, which are expressed by the horn of plenty.<ref>[[Strabo]], x. p. 458.</ref><ref>Compare Voss, ''Mythologische Briefe'', lxxii.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Andrews, Tamra.
