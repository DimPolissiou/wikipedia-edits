During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

They \"breathe\" [[electron donor]]s such as nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide.\n\nThere is very little energy at greater depths, and metabolism can be up to a million times slower than at the surface. Cells may live for thousands of years before dividing and there is no known limit to their age. The subsurface accounts for about 90% of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in bacteria and archaea, and 15% of the total biomass for the biosphere.

They are usually single-celled and microscopic. Life originated as [[Prokaryote|single-celled prokaryotes]] (bacteria and archaea) and later evolved into [[Eukaryote|more complex eukaryotes]]. Eukaryotes are the more developed life forms known as plants, animals, fungi and protists. The term protist came into use historically as a term of convenience for eukaryotes that cannot be strictly classified as plants, animals or fungi. They are not a part of modern cladistics, because they are [[paraphyletic]] (lacking a common ancestor). \n\n====By trophic mode====\nProtists can be broadly divided into four groups depending on whether their nutrition is plant-like, animal-like, fungal-like,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Whittaker | first1 = R.H. | last2 = Margulis | first2 = L. | year = 1978 | title = Protist classification and the kingdoms of organisms | url = | journal = Biosystems | volume = 10 | issue = 1\u20132| pages = 3\u201318 | doi = 10.1016/0303-2647(78)90023-0 | pmid = 418827 }}</ref> or a mixture of these.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Faure | first1 = E | last2 = Not | first2 = F | last3 = Benoiston | first3 = AS | last4 = Labadie | first4 = K | last5 = Bittner | first5 = L | last6 = Ayata | first6 = SD | year = 2019 | title = Mixotrophic protists display contrasted biogeographies in the global ocean | url = | journal = ISME Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 1072\u20131083 | doi = 10.1038/s41396-018-0340-5 | pmid = 30643201 | pmc = 6461780 }}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=8 |{{centre|Protists according to how they get food}}\n|-\n! colspan=2 |Type of protist\n!

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

Three \ndifferent possibilities to process the sample are using raw samples, fixation or preservation, and filtration. For microscopy and flow cytometry raw samples either are measured immediately or have to be fixed for later measurements. Since molecular methods, pigment analysis and detection of molecular tracers usually require concentrated cells, filter residues serve for phytoplankton measurements. Molecular characterization and quantification of trace molecules is performed using [[chromatography]], [[mass spectrometry]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Marine microorganisms also recycle nutrients for use in the [[marine food web]] and in the process release CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Microbial biomass and other organic matter (remnants of plants and animals) are converted to fossil fuels over millions of years. By contrast, burning of [[fossil fuel]]s liberates greenhouse gases in a small fraction of that time. As a result, the [[carbon cycle]] is out of balance, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels will continue to rise as long as fossil fuels continue to be burnt.<ref name=Cavicchioli2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Cavicchioli | first1 = R. | last2 = Ripple | first2 = W.J. | last3 = Timmis | first3 = K.N. | last4 = Azam | first4 = F. | last5 = Bakken | first5 = L.R. | last6 = Baylis | first6 = M. | last7 = Behrenfeld | first7 = M.J. | last8 = Boetius | first8 = A. | last9 = Boyd | first9 = P.W. | last10 = Classen | first10 = A.T. | last11 = Crowther | first11 = T.W. | year = 2019 | title = Scientists' warning to humanity: microorganisms and climate change | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 17 | issue = 9| pages = 569\u2013586 | doi = 10.1038/s41579-019-0222-5 | pmid = 31213707 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Marine life]]\n* [[Deep chlorophyll maximum]]\n* [[Hawaii Ocean Time-series]]\n* [[International Census of Marine Microbes]]\n* [[Marine microbial symbiosis]]\n* [[Microbial biogeography]]\n* [[Microbial communities]]\n* [[Microbial ecology]]\n* [[Microbial food web]]\n* [[Microbial loop]]\n* [[Microbial oxidation of sulfur]]\n** [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms]]\n* [[Microbially induced sedimentary structure]]\n* [[Microbiology of oxygen minimum zones]]\n* [[Oceanic carbon cycle]]\n* [[Ooid]]\n* [[Picoeukaryote]]\n* [[Roseobacter]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==General references==\n* Haq B.U. and Boersma A.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

Jam recalled, \"He said, 'Now that you've seen the film, if you'd like to do a song for it, that'd be great.'\" Segal told Jackson that she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nThe song was based on a poem Jackson had written, discarded, then rediscovered.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Jackson's original lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided that \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was a better fit and a \"summertime record.\" A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\nIn \"Doesn't Really Matter\", Jackson speaks of looking past physical appearance, choosing to love the person inside. Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

Jam recalled, \"He said, 'Now that you've seen the film, if you'd like to do a song for it, that'd be great.'\" Segal told Jackson that she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nThe song was based on a poem Jackson had written, discarded, then rediscovered.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Jackson's original lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided that \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was a better fit and a \"summertime record.\" A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\nIn \"Doesn't Really Matter\", Jackson speaks of looking past physical appearance, choosing to love the person inside. Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

During the Colts' first drive of the game, [[Adam Vinatieri]] missed a 33-yard field goal due to the heavy snow and wind. As a result, both teams would choose to attempt a fourth-down conversion rather than a field goal. The Bills broke the scoreless tie in the second quarter with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Peterman to [[Kelvin Benjamin]]. Despite the poor weather conditions, Peterman was able to post a more respectable performance, compared to his five-interception first-half performance during a week 11 matchup against the [[2017 Los Angeles Chargers season|Los Angeles Chargers]], before leaving in the third quarter with a concussion. With under two minutes to play in the fourth quarter, the Colts scored their first points of the game on a 3-yard touchdown pass from [[Jacoby Brissett]] to [[Jack Doyle (American football)|Jack Doyle]] with Vinatieri barely hooking in the extra point attempt, which had been pushed back after a successful two-point conversion was called back due to an offensive [[pass interference]] penalty. The Indianapolis defense intercepted the Bills' third-string quarterback, [[Joe Webb]], on the following drive. With only seconds left in the fourth quarter, Vinatieri missed a game-winning field goal attempt from a distance similar to the PAT he successfully made minutes earlier.\n\nThe low-scoring game went into overtime, with the teams trading punts on multiple possessions. It did not end until Webb connected with receiver [[Deonte Thompson]] for 34 yards on an improbable pass play, which set up a [[LeSean McCoy]] rushing touchdown with under two minutes to go in the extra period to seal the game for Buffalo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pro32.ap.org/article/bills-frolic-snow-after-13-7-ot-win-against-colts|title=Bills frolic in the snow after 13-7 OT win against Colts|last=Wawrow|first=John|date=2017-12-10|work=Pro32: Head to Head|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name = ESPN>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=400951560|title=Colts vs. Bills - Game Recap - December 10, 2017 - ESPN|date=2017-12-10|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref> McCoy finished with a strong performance, rushing for 156 yards on 32 carries and the aforementioned touchdown despite a lack of traction on the field.

In addition, both teams had to call timeouts simply to clear snow off the field for their placekickers to attempt field goals or extra points.<ref name = gifs>{{cite web|url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000891578/article/the-gifs-that-explain-sundays-coltsbills-blizzard-bowl|title = The GIFs that explain Sunday's Colts-Bills Blizzard Bowl|first = Dan|last = Hanzus|website = NFL.com|date = December 11, 2017}}</ref> The amount of snow on the ground did prove to be an advantage for the punters, since the ball did not bounce upon landing, making precision [[coffin corner punt]]s easier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bills-colts-snow-bowl-photos-2017-12/#players-tried-to-prepare-themselves-beforehand-for-the-cold-three-hours-to-come-1|title=The Bills and Colts' 'Snow Bowl' produced some incredible and fun images|last=Davis|first=Scott|date=2017-12-17|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=2018-05-20}}</ref> Buffalo, in a rarity for a Sunday afternoon game, wore their all-red [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] jerseys,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180112024355/http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-1/Bills-announce-teams-Family-Day-sponsored-by-Independent-Health--Fan-Appreciation-Day-/52a03b63-4ea5-479c-a77a-1ce82c44d49f Bills announce team's Family Day sponsored by Independent Health & Fan Appreciation Day], ''buffalobills.com'' (December 4, 2017).</ref> while Indianapolis wore their all-white road uniforms.\n\nWeather conditions suppressed attendance at the game; scalpers at the event noted that they had sold no tickets, a rarity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2017/12/11/tickets-were-as-plentiful-as-the-snow-on-sunday.html|first=James|last=Fink|title=Tickets were as plentiful as the snow on Sunday|work=Business First|date=December 11, 2017|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> In contrast, because the league had lifted its [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout restrictions]] two years prior, fans were free to watch the game from home on their television sets; a majority of television sets in [[Western New York]] were tuned into the game telecast on [[WIVB-TV]], the local CBS affiliate.

During the Colts' first drive of the game, [[Adam Vinatieri]] missed a 33-yard field goal due to the heavy snow and wind. As a result, both teams would choose to attempt a fourth-down conversion rather than a field goal. The Bills broke the scoreless tie in the second quarter with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Peterman to [[Kelvin Benjamin]]. Despite the poor weather conditions, Peterman was able to post a more respectable performance, compared to his five-interception first-half performance during a week 11 matchup against the [[2017 Los Angeles Chargers season|Los Angeles Chargers]], before leaving in the third quarter with a concussion. With under two minutes to play in the fourth quarter, the Colts scored their first points of the game on a 3-yard touchdown pass from [[Jacoby Brissett]] to [[Jack Doyle (American football)|Jack Doyle]] with Vinatieri barely hooking in the extra point attempt, which had been pushed back after a successful two-point conversion was called back due to an offensive [[pass interference]] penalty. The Indianapolis defense intercepted the Bills' third-string quarterback, [[Joe Webb]], on the following drive. With only seconds left in the fourth quarter, Vinatieri missed a game-winning field goal attempt from a distance similar to the PAT he successfully made minutes earlier.\n\nThe low-scoring game went into overtime, with the teams trading punts on multiple possessions. It did not end until Webb connected with receiver [[Deonte Thompson]] for 34 yards on an improbable pass play, which set up a [[LeSean McCoy]] rushing touchdown with under two minutes to go in the extra period to seal the game for Buffalo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pro32.ap.org/article/bills-frolic-snow-after-13-7-ot-win-against-colts|title=Bills frolic in the snow after 13-7 OT win against Colts|last=Wawrow|first=John|date=2017-12-10|work=Pro32: Head to Head|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name = ESPN>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=400951560|title=Colts vs. Bills - Game Recap - December 10, 2017 - ESPN|date=2017-12-10|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref> McCoy finished with a strong performance, rushing for 156 yards on 32 carries and the aforementioned touchdown despite a lack of traction on the field.
