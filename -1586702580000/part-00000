Wembley was formed a separate civil parish from 1894 and was [[Municipal Borough of Wembley|incorporated as a municipal borough]] of [[Middlesex]] in 1937. In 1965, the area merged with the [[Municipal Borough of Willesden]] to create the London Borough of Brent, and has since formed part of the Greater London region.\n\nWembley is known as the location of [[Wembley Stadium]], the home of the [[England national football team]] and the largest stadium by capacity in the UK.\n\nThe town of Wembley also includes the localities of [[Alperton]], [[North Wembley]], [[Tokyngton]], [[Wembley Park]], [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], and partly [[Preston, London|Preston]].

The name was first mentioned in the charter of 825 of Selvin. A further instance may be seen in the Plea Rolls of the Common Pleas, as Wambeleye.<ref>aalt.law.uh.edu; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/E3/CP40no357/aCP40no357mm1toEnd/IMG_7441.htm; third entry, line 3, \"apud Wambeleye\"; in 1349</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe village of Wembley grew up on the hill by the clearing with the [[Harrow Road]] south of it. Much of the surrounding area remained wooded. In 1547 there were but six houses in Wembley. Though small, it was one of the wealthiest parts of Harrow. At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1543, the manor of Wembley fell to Richard Andrews and [[Sir Leonard Chamberlain|Leonard Chamberlain]], who sold it to Richard Page, Esq., of [[Harrow on the Hill]], the same year.\n\nThe Page family continued as lords of the manor of Wembley for several centuries and eventually commissioned [[Humphry Repton]] (1752\u20131818) the landscape gardener to design what is now [[Wembley Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45423|title=Harrow on the Hill \u2013 British History Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22466|title=Harrow, including Pinner : Manors \u2013 British History Online}}</ref> Wembley Park thus derived its name from Repton's habit of referring to the areas he designed as \"parks\".\n\nThere was a mill on Wembley Hill by 1673. In 1837, the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] (now part of the [[West Coast Main Line]]) was opened from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] through Wembley to [[Hemel Hempstead railway station|Hemel Hempstead]], and completed to [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838-1966)|Birmingham Curzon Street]] the following year. The changing names of the local station demonstrated the increasing importance of the 'Wembley' name. 'Sudbury' station opened in 1845, renamed as 'Sudbury and Wembley' in 1882, renamed as 'Wembley for Sudbury' in 1910, renamed as 'Wembley Central' in 1948, at the time of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].\n\nTo modernise the service, a new [[Watford DC Line]] was built alongside the main lines and [[Bakerloo line]] trains, and electric trains to [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] started in 1917. Electric trains to London Euston began running in 1922. Since 1917, there have been six platforms at what is now Wembley Central station. In 1880, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] opened its line from [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] through the eastern side of Wembley, but only built a station, [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]], in 1894. There are now three physically separate services, the [[London to Aylesbury Line]], the [[Metropolitan line]], and the [[Jubilee line]]. Only the latter two services have platforms at Wembley Park station.\n\nIn November 1905, the [[Great Central Railway]] (now, in this section, part of the [[Chiltern Main Line]]) opened a new route for fast expresses that by-passed the congested Metropolitan Railway tracks. It ran between [[Neasden Junction]], south of Wembley, and Northolt Junction, west of London, where a new joint main line with the [[Great Western Railway]] began. Local passenger services from [[Marylebone railway station|London Marylebone]] were added from March 1906, when new stations were opened, including 'Wembley Hill', next to what later became the site of Wembley Stadium \u2013 the national stadium of English sport \u2013 which opened for the [[1923 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] of April 1923, remaining open for 77 years until it closed for reconstruction in October 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wembleystadium.com/gloriouspast/historyintroduction|title=404 - Page not found - wembleystadium.com|last=TheFA|access-date=9 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017232053/http://www.wembleystadium.com/GloriousPast/historyIntroduction|archive-date=17 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a long planning and redevelopment process dogged by a series of funding problems and construction delays, the new stadium finally opened its doors in March 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6459415.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doors finally open at new Wembley | date=17 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nWembley Hill station was renamed 'Wembley Complex' in May 1978, before getting its present name of '[[Wembley Stadium railway station|Wembley Stadium]]' in May 1987.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Mitchell |first1=Vic |last2=Smith |first2=Keith |title=Marylebone to Rickmansworth |series=Midland Main Lines |date=February 2005 |publisher=Middleton Press |location=Midhurst |isbn=1-904474-49-7 |chapter=Figure 51 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:GB British Empire Exhibition Postage Stamps.jpg|thumb|British Empire Exhibition postage stamps]]\n\nThe area around the current Wembley Stadium was the location of the [[British Empire Exhibition]]<ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/p49262227.html Photograph of exhibition site]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/p49002875.html Map of exhibition site]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/art.htm Sunday Tribune of India (newspaper)] Article on exhibition (2004)</ref> of 1924\u20131925.<ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75167 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel one</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75168 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel two</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75169 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel three</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75170 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel four</ref> Until the 2000s, remnants of the many [[reinforced concrete]] buildings, including the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]], remained, but nearly all have now been removed, to make way for redevelopment.\n\nWembley, in common with much of northwest London, had an extensive manufacturing industry, but much of it closed in the 1980s. Factories in the area included Glacier Metals (bearings), Wolf Power Tools, Sunbeam Electrical Appliances, Griffin & George (laboratory equipment) and GEC (whose research laboratories, opened in 1923, were one of the first of their type in the United Kingdom<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clayton |first1=Robert |last2=Algar |first2=Joan |title=The GEC Research Laboratories 1919\u20131984 |publisher=Peter Peregrinus | year=1989 |isbn=0-86341-146-0}}</ref>).\n\n[[File:Central Square, Wembley - geograph.org.uk - 216341.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Central Square under redevelopment in 2006]]\n[[File:High Road, Wembley (2) - geograph.org.uk - 216337.jpg|thumb|left|High Road, near the local station, looking east in 2006]]\nThe retail centre of Wembley (the High Road and north end of Ealing Road) has suffered from chronic traffic congestion and from the opening of neighbouring purpose-built shopping centres, first [[Brent Cross]] in the early 1970s and later the [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and [[Ealing Broadway]] Shopping Centres. During the 1960s, rebuilding of Wembley Central station, a block of flats, an open-plan shopping plaza, and a car park were constructed on a concrete raft over the railway.\n\nThe shopping plaza suffered slow decline and was therefore poorly maintained. Eventually in the 2000s, plans were approved to completely regenerate the place, carried out by construction company St. Modwen. The first phase, including construction of eighty-five homes, reconstruction of the plaza as a new [[public square]] and opening of new retail units including a [[TK Maxx]], was completed in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brentbrain.org.uk/brain/brainzones.nsf/nsgnews/NT00056C82 | title=Public square reopens in Wembley Central|last=Brent Resource and Information Network (BRAIN)|publisher=Brent Council|accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref><ref>https://www.stmodwen.co.uk/new-public-square-launched-at-wembley-central/</ref> The rest was completed in 2015 after nine years' time, with additional retail and housing units.<ref>https://www.mylondon.news/news/business/wembley-central-invites-you-fun-filled-8912022</ref> The local [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] store also moved to a new space in the redeveloped area. Extensive redevelopment has also occurred separately in the [[Wembley Park]] area (around the stadium), about a mile northeast from Wembley town centre.\n\nMost of the rest of Wembley's housing consists of inter-war semi-detached houses and terraces and of modern apartment blocks, with a significant minority of detached housing.\n\nThere also used to be a [[British Army]] recruitment centre off the High Road in Wembley. This centre came under attack by an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bomb in 1990 resulting in the death of a soldier and injuries to four people (see [[1990 Wembley bombing]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/257998235/|title=The Observer from London,  on June 3, 1990 \u00b7 3}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:cmglee_London_Wembley_aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Wembley and its stadium]]\nWembley formed part of the large ancient parish of [[Harrow on the Hill]] in the [[Gore (hundred)|Gore]] hundred of [[Middlesex]]. In 1894 Wembley was split from Harrow, creating a new parish and [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. It included [[Alperton]], [[Preston, London|Preston]], [[North Wembley]], [[South Kenton]], [[Tokyngton]], [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], [[Wembley Park]] and [[Northwick Park]]. The urban district included the neighbouring parish of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]] until 1901 and again from 1934.\n\nIn 1937 it was incorporated as the [[Municipal Borough of Wembley]]. The fire brigade headquarters of [[Middlesex County Council]] were located on Harrow Road and is now a fire station of the [[London Fire Brigade]]. [[Brent Town Hall|Wembley Town Hall]] on Forty Lane, built in 1938, became [[Brent Town Hall]] when the municipal boroughs of Wembley and [[Municipal Borough of Willesden|Willesden]] were amalgamated in 1965 to form the [[London Borough of Brent]] and transferred to [[Greater London]]. Since the 2010 elections, Brent Council has been controlled by the Labour Party.\n\nWembley falls within the UK Parliament constituency of [[Brent North (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent North]] and the London Assembly constituency of [[Brent and Harrow (London Assembly constituency)|Brent and Harrow]].\n\n==Geography==\nUntil the nineteenth century, Wembley was rural and the sector retains a number of green spaces. These include Barham Park (10.5 hectares) in Sudbury Town, King Edward VII Park, established in 1914 behind the High Road (10.5 hectares), and Sudbury Green.  Less managed spaces include Fryent Country Park, Barn Hill (19.87 hectares), and Vale Farm sports ground (30 hectares). Brent River Park / Tokyngton Recreation Ground (20.26 hectares) has recently been restored, returning the river to a more natural course.\n\nNearby Sudbury Golf Course backs onto the [[Grand Union Canal]], with its towpath running into central London. Sudbury Squash and Tennis Club has outdoor tennis courts, an indoor squash court, and a clubhouse. Wembley is a short distance away from the [[Brent Reservoir|Welsh Harp]] reservoir and open space, created in the early 19th century by damming the [[River Brent]] to provide water for the [[Grand Union Canal]].\n\nThe area is identified in the [[Mayor of London]]'s [[London Plan]] as one of thirty-five major centres in Greater London.<ref name=London_plan_f08>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf | author=[[Mayor of London]] | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | title=London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004) |date=February 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWembley is made up of six wards: [[Wembley Central (ward)|Wembley Central]], [[Alperton]], [[Tokyngton]], Barnhill, [[Preston, London|Preston]] and [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]].

Unlike typical British [[high street]]s however, Wembley lacks a town centre network or pedestrianised high streets, with almost all commercial high street businesses located along a 1000-yard stretch of road (High Road). In 1971 the High Road was seen as being the 11th best place to shop in London. However, it had fallen to 24th place by 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brent.gov.uk/media/387392/Wembley.pdf|title=Places in Brent Wembley and Tokyngton|last=Barres-Baker|first=M.C.|website=|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref> Ealing Road remains important as a centre of South Asian jewellery and gold shops,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2764476/Rallying-to-the-gold-standard.html|title=Rallying to the gold standard|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref> attracting people from as far afield as [[Leicester]], but otherwise the focus of shopping has shifted north and east to the more recent development of [[London Designer Outlet]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londondesigneroutlet.com/whats-on/in-wembley-park|title=Enjoy more things to do in Wembley Park / London Designer Outlet|website=www.londondesigneroutlet.com|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref> in [[Wembley Park]], which is part of the Stadium's complex and also includes a fully pedestrianised street near the Stadium.

The name was first mentioned in the charter of 825 of Selvin. A further instance may be seen in the Plea Rolls of the Common Pleas, as Wambeleye.<ref>aalt.law.uh.edu; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/E3/CP40no357/aCP40no357mm1toEnd/IMG_7441.htm; third entry, line 3, \"apud Wambeleye\"; in 1349</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe village of Wembley grew up on the hill by the clearing with the [[Harrow Road]] south of it. Much of the surrounding area remained wooded. In 1547 there were but six houses in Wembley. Though small, it was one of the wealthiest parts of Harrow. At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1543, the manor of Wembley fell to Richard Andrews and [[Sir Leonard Chamberlain|Leonard Chamberlain]], who sold it to Richard Page, Esq., of [[Harrow on the Hill]], the same year.\n\nThe Page family continued as lords of the manor of Wembley for several centuries and eventually commissioned [[Humphry Repton]] (1752\u20131818) the landscape gardener to design what is now [[Wembley Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45423|title=Harrow on the Hill \u2013 British History Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22466|title=Harrow, including Pinner : Manors \u2013 British History Online}}</ref> Wembley Park thus derived its name from Repton's habit of referring to the areas he designed as \"parks\".\n\nThere was a mill on Wembley Hill by 1673. In 1837, the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] (now part of the [[West Coast Main Line]]) was opened from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] through Wembley to [[Hemel Hempstead railway station|Hemel Hempstead]], and completed to [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838-1966)|Birmingham Curzon Street]] the following year. The changing names of the local station demonstrated the increasing importance of the 'Wembley' name. 'Sudbury' station opened in 1845, renamed as 'Sudbury and Wembley' in 1882, renamed as 'Wembley for Sudbury' in 1910, renamed as 'Wembley Central' in 1948, at the time of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].\n\nTo modernise the service, a new [[Watford DC Line]] was built alongside the main lines and [[Bakerloo line]] trains, and electric trains to [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] started in 1917. Electric trains to London Euston began running in 1922. Since 1917, there have been six platforms at what is now Wembley Central station. In 1880, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] opened its line from [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] through the eastern side of Wembley, but only built a station, [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]], in 1894. There are now three physically separate services, the [[London to Aylesbury Line]], the [[Metropolitan line]], and the [[Jubilee line]]. Only the latter two services have platforms at Wembley Park station.\n\nIn November 1905, the [[Great Central Railway]] (now, in this section, part of the [[Chiltern Main Line]]) opened a new route for fast expresses that by-passed the congested Metropolitan Railway tracks. It ran between [[Neasden Junction]], south of Wembley, and Northolt Junction, west of London, where a new joint main line with the [[Great Western Railway]] began. Local passenger services from [[Marylebone railway station|London Marylebone]] were added from March 1906, when new stations were opened, including 'Wembley Hill', next to what later became the site of Wembley Stadium \u2013 the national stadium of English sport \u2013 which opened for the [[1923 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] of April 1923, remaining open for 77 years until it closed for reconstruction in October 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wembleystadium.com/gloriouspast/historyintroduction|title=404 - Page not found - wembleystadium.com|last=TheFA|access-date=9 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017232053/http://www.wembleystadium.com/GloriousPast/historyIntroduction|archive-date=17 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a long planning and redevelopment process dogged by a series of funding problems and construction delays, the new stadium finally opened its doors in March 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6459415.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doors finally open at new Wembley | date=17 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nWembley Hill station was renamed 'Wembley Complex' in May 1978, before getting its present name of '[[Wembley Stadium railway station|Wembley Stadium]]' in May 1987.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Mitchell |first1=Vic |last2=Smith |first2=Keith |title=Marylebone to Rickmansworth |series=Midland Main Lines |date=February 2005 |publisher=Middleton Press |location=Midhurst |isbn=1-904474-49-7 |chapter=Figure 51 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:GB British Empire Exhibition Postage Stamps.jpg|thumb|British Empire Exhibition postage stamps]]\n\nThe area around the current Wembley Stadium was the location of the [[British Empire Exhibition]]<ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/p49262227.html Photograph of exhibition site]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/p49002875.html Map of exhibition site]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/art.htm Sunday Tribune of India (newspaper)] Article on exhibition (2004)</ref> of 1924\u20131925.<ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75167 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel one</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75168 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel two</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75169 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel three</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75170 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel four</ref> Until the 2000s, remnants of the many [[reinforced concrete]] buildings, including the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]], remained, but nearly all have now been removed, to make way for redevelopment.\n\nWembley, in common with much of northwest London, had an extensive manufacturing industry, but much of it closed in the 1980s.

During the 1960s, rebuilding of Wembley Central station, a block of flats, an open-plan shopping plaza, and a car park were constructed on a concrete raft over the railway.\n\nThe shopping plaza suffered slow decline and was therefore poorly maintained. Eventually in the 2000s, plans were approved to completely regenerate the place, carried out by construction company St. Modwen. The first phase, including construction of eighty-five homes, reconstruction of the plaza as a new [[public square]] and opening of new retail units including a [[TK Maxx]], was completed in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brentbrain.org.uk/brain/brainzones.nsf/nsgnews/NT00056C82 | title=Public square reopens in Wembley Central|last=Brent Resource and Information Network (BRAIN)|publisher=Brent Council|accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref><ref>https://www.stmodwen.co.uk/new-public-square-launched-at-wembley-central/</ref> The rest was completed in 2015 after nine years' time, with additional retail and housing units.<ref>https://www.mylondon.news/news/business/wembley-central-invites-you-fun-filled-8912022</ref> The local [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] store also moved to a new space in the redeveloped area. Extensive redevelopment has also occurred separately in the [[Wembley Park]] area (around the stadium), about a mile northeast from Wembley town centre.\n\nMost of the rest of Wembley's housing consists of inter-war semi-detached houses and terraces and of modern apartment blocks, with a significant minority of detached housing.\n\nThere also used to be a [[British Army]] recruitment centre off the High Road in Wembley. This centre came under attack by an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bomb in 1990 resulting in the death of a soldier and injuries to four people (see [[1990 Wembley bombing]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/257998235/|title=The Observer from London,  on June 3, 1990 \u00b7 3}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:cmglee_London_Wembley_aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Wembley and its stadium]]\nWembley formed part of the large ancient parish of [[Harrow on the Hill]] in the [[Gore (hundred)|Gore]] hundred of [[Middlesex]]. In 1894 Wembley was split from Harrow, creating a new parish and [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. It included [[Alperton]], [[Preston, London|Preston]], [[North Wembley]], [[South Kenton]], [[Tokyngton]], [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], [[Wembley Park]] and [[Northwick Park]]. The urban district included the neighbouring parish of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]] until 1901 and again from 1934.\n\nIn 1937 it was incorporated as the [[Municipal Borough of Wembley]]. The fire brigade headquarters of [[Middlesex County Council]] were located on Harrow Road and is now a fire station of the [[London Fire Brigade]]. [[Brent Town Hall|Wembley Town Hall]] on Forty Lane, built in 1938, became [[Brent Town Hall]] when the municipal boroughs of Wembley and [[Municipal Borough of Willesden|Willesden]] were amalgamated in 1965 to form the [[London Borough of Brent]] and transferred to [[Greater London]]. Since the 2010 elections, Brent Council has been controlled by the Labour Party.\n\nWembley falls within the UK Parliament constituency of [[Brent North (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent North]] and the London Assembly constituency of [[Brent and Harrow (London Assembly constituency)|Brent and Harrow]].\n\n==Geography==\nUntil the nineteenth century, Wembley was rural and the sector retains a number of green spaces. These include Barham Park (10.5 hectares) in Sudbury Town, King Edward VII Park, established in 1914 behind the High Road (10.5 hectares), and Sudbury Green.  Less managed spaces include Fryent Country Park, Barn Hill (19.87 hectares), and Vale Farm sports ground (30 hectares). Brent River Park / Tokyngton Recreation Ground (20.26 hectares) has recently been restored, returning the river to a more natural course.\n\nNearby Sudbury Golf Course backs onto the [[Grand Union Canal]], with its towpath running into central London. Sudbury Squash and Tennis Club has outdoor tennis courts, an indoor squash court, and a clubhouse. Wembley is a short distance away from the [[Brent Reservoir|Welsh Harp]] reservoir and open space, created in the early 19th century by damming the [[River Brent]] to provide water for the [[Grand Union Canal]].\n\nThe area is identified in the [[Mayor of London]]'s [[London Plan]] as one of thirty-five major centres in Greater London.<ref name=London_plan_f08>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf | author=[[Mayor of London]] | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | title=London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004) |date=February 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWembley is made up of six wards: [[Wembley Central (ward)|Wembley Central]], [[Alperton]], [[Tokyngton]], Barnhill, [[Preston, London|Preston]] and [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]].

Unlike typical British [[high street]]s however, Wembley lacks a town centre network or pedestrianised high streets, with almost all commercial high street businesses located along a 1000-yard stretch of road (High Road). In 1971 the High Road was seen as being the 11th best place to shop in London.

It is envisaged that the whole of the former British Empire Exhibition site will be redeveloped. At the same time Brent Council sought to encourage redevelopment of the neighbouring Wembley town centre area around the High Road.

Another group-based activity is [[airline alliance]]s that players can create to complete missions together with team members and to compete against other alliances.

time special events released roughly every month.\n\nSeasonal events either reflect real world events, such as Halloween, Christmas, and Easter, or fictitious, such as a [[Unidentified flying

Nevertheless, the extreme temperatures have officially ranged from {{convert|105|\u00b0F|0}}, on July 20, 1986, down to {{convert|3|\u00b0F|0}} during the [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak]].<ref name= TWC >{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0506?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared|title=Average Weather for Savannah, GA \u2013 Temperature and Precipitation|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=December 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424025443/http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0506?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared|archive-date=April 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeasonally, Savannah tends to have hot and humid summers with frequent (but brief) thunderstorms that develop in the warm and tropical air masses, which are common. Although summers in Savannah are frequently sunny, half of Savannah's annual precipitation falls during the months of June through September. Average dewpoints in summer range from {{convert|67.8|to|71.6|F|0}}. Winters in Savannah are mild and sunny with average daily high temperatures close to {{convert|60|\u00b0F|0}}. November and December are the driest months recorded at Savannah\u2013Hilton Head International Airport. Each year,  Savannah reports 24 days on average with low temperatures below freezing, though in some years fewer than 10 nights will fall below freezing. Although decades might pass between snowfall events, Savannah has experienced snow on rare occasions, most notably in December 1989, when up to 3.9 inches were recorded in one day in parts of the city.<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=chs\n|title = NowData \u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data\n|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n|accessdate = 2012-02-27\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011517/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=chs\n|archive-date = September 21, 2012\n|url-status = live\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|publisher=|access-date=July 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712002910/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMweb/|archive-date=July 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSavannah is at risk for [[hurricanes]], particularly of the [[Cape Verde hurricane|Cape Verde]] type of storms that take place during the peak of the season. Because of its location in the Georgia [[Bight (geography)|Bight]] (the arc of the Atlantic coastline in Georgia and northern Florida) as well as the tendency for hurricanes to re-curve up the coast, Savannah has a lower risk of hurricanes than some other coastal cities such as [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

In 2008, metro police achieved a 90 percent clearance rate for homicide cases, which was described as exceptional by violent crimes unit supervisors. In 2009, the department had a clearance rate of 53 percent, which police attributed to outstanding warrants and grand jury presentations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://savannahnow.com/crime/2010-01-22/area-crime-drops-2009|title=2010-01-22|website=Savannahnow.com|publisher=Savannah Morning News and Evening Press|first=Arek|last=Sarkissian|accessdate=2010-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915051411/http://savannahnow.com/crime/2010-01-22/area-crime-drops-2009|archive-date=September 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe SCMPD provide the public with up to date crime report information through an online mapping service.

Georgia's [[Ogeechee River]] flows toward the Atlantic Ocean some {{convert|16|mi|km}} south of downtown Savannah, and forms the southern city limit.\n\nSavannah is prone to flooding, due to abundant rainfall, an elevation at just above sea level, and the shape of the coastline, which poses a greater surge risk during hurricanes. The city currently uses five canals.

In the Deep South, this is characterized by long and almost tropical summers and short, mild winters. Savannah records few days of freezing temperatures each year (and has rare snowfall). Due to its proximity to the Atlantic coast, Savannah rarely experiences temperatures as extreme as those in Georgia's interior. Nevertheless, the extreme temperatures have officially ranged from {{convert|105|\u00b0F|0}}, on July 20, 1986, down to {{convert|3|\u00b0F|0}} during the [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak]].<ref name= TWC >{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0506?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared|title=Average Weather for Savannah, GA \u2013 Temperature and Precipitation|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=December 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424025443/http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0506?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared|archive-date=April 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeasonally, Savannah tends to have hot and humid summers with frequent (but brief) thunderstorms that develop in the warm and tropical air masses, which are common. Although summers in Savannah are frequently sunny, half of Savannah's annual precipitation falls during the months of June through September. Average dewpoints in summer range from {{convert|67.8|to|71.6|F|0}}. Winters in Savannah are mild and sunny with average daily high temperatures close to {{convert|60|\u00b0F|0}}. November and December are the driest months recorded at Savannah\u2013Hilton Head International Airport. Each year,  Savannah reports 24 days on average with low temperatures below freezing, though in some years fewer than 10 nights will fall below freezing. Although decades might pass between snowfall events, Savannah has experienced snow on rare occasions, most notably in December 1989, when up to 3.9 inches were recorded in one day in parts of the city.<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=chs\n|title = NowData \u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data\n|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n|accessdate = 2012-02-27\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011517/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=chs\n|archive-date = September 21, 2012\n|url-status = live\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|publisher=|access-date=July 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712002910/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMweb/|archive-date=July 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSavannah is at risk for [[hurricanes]], particularly of the [[Cape Verde hurricane|Cape Verde]] type of storms that take place during the peak of the season. Because of its location in the Georgia [[Bight (geography)|Bight]] (the arc of the Atlantic coastline in Georgia and northern Florida) as well as the tendency for hurricanes to re-curve up the coast, Savannah has a lower risk of hurricanes than some other coastal cities such as [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

The [[Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department]] was established on January 1, 2005, after the Savannah Police Department and Chatham County Police Department merged. The department has a number of specialty units, including: K-9, SWAT, Bomb Squad, Marine Patrol, Dive, Air Support and Mounted Patrol. The 9-1-1 Communications Dispatch Center handles all 9-1-1 calls for service within the county and city, including fire and EMS. The [[Savannah (Georgia) Fire Department|Savannah Fire Department]] only serves the City of Savannah and remains separate from the other municipal firefighting organizations in Chatham County.\n\nWhile some{{Who|date=January 2014}} see the police merger as a step toward city-county [[Consolidated city-county|consolidation]], Savannah is actually one of eight incorporated cities or towns in Chatham County. (The others are [[Bloomingdale, Georgia|Bloomingdale]], [[Garden City, Georgia|Garden City]], [[Pooler, Georgia|Pooler]], [[Port Wentworth, Georgia|Port Wentworth]], [[Thunderbolt, Georgia|Thunderbolt]], [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]] and [[Vernonburg, Georgia|Vernonburg]]). Although these seven smaller localities would remain independent from a consolidated government, they have long opposed any efforts to adopt a city-county merger. One fear is that consolidation would reduce county funding to areas outside of Savannah.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn February 2018, the city and county governments ended the police department merger.

Savannah's port has always been a mainstay of the city's economy. In the early years of the United States, goods produced in the [[New World]] had to pass through Atlantic ports such as Savannah's before they could be shipped to England.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1968, the [[Savannah Machine & Foundry]] Company was a shipbuilder in Savannah.<ref name=Bloome>{{cite book|last1=Bloome|first1=Kenneth J.|title=Historical Dictionary of the U.S. Maritime Industry|date=2012|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=[[Plymouth]]|page=429|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r_jTIbdFUnYC&lpg=PA429&dq=%22Savannah%20Machine%20%26%20Foundry%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PA429#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=26 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904090305/https://books.google.com/books?id=r_jTIbdFUnYC&lpg=PA429&ots=iLU9Rx5uJR&dq=%22Savannah%20Machine%20%26%20Foundry%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PA429#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=live|isbn=9780810856349}}</ref>\n\nThe Port of Savannah, manufacturing, the military, and [[tourism]] have become Savannah's four major economic drivers in the twenty-first century.  In 2006, the Savannah Area Convention & Visitors Bureau reported over 6.85 million visitors to the city during the year. By 2011, the Bureau reported that the number of visitors the city attracted increased to 12.1 million. Lodging, dining, entertainment, and visitor-related transportation account for over $2 billion in visitors' spending per year and employ over 17,000.\n\nFor years, Savannah was the home of [[Union Camp]], which housed the world's largest paper mill. The plant is now owned by [[International Paper]], and it remains one of Savannah's largest employers. Savannah is also home to the [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] company, maker of private jets, as well as various other large industrial interests. [[TitleMax]] is headquartered in Savannah. [[Morris Multimedia]], a newspaper and television company, is also based in Savannah.\n\nIn 2000, [[J. C.

The work premiered in 1949 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and was an immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot is based on [[James A. Michener]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning]] 1947 book ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'' and combines elements of several of those stories. [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] believed they could write a musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, send a strong progressive message on racism.\n\nThe plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II, who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children. A secondary romance, between a [[U.S. Marine]] lieutenant and a young [[Tonkin]]ese woman, explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart. The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical, most controversially in the lieutenant's song, \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\".  Supporting characters, including a comic [[petty officer#United States|petty officer]] and the Tonkinese girl's mother, help to tie the stories together.  Because he lacked military knowledge, Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script; the director of the original production, Logan, assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book.\n\nThe original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success, became [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|the second-longest running Broadway musical]] to that point (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind.  The piece won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1950.  Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\", \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\", \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", and \"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\", have become popular standards.\n\nThe production won ten [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Libretto, and it is the only musical production to win Tony Awards in all four acting categories. Its original cast album was the bestselling record of the 1940s, and other recordings of the show have also been popular. The show has enjoyed many successful revivals and tours, spawning a [[South Pacific (1958 film)|1958 film]] and television adaptations. The 2008 Broadway revival, a critical success, ran for 996 performances and won seven Tonys, including Best Musical Revival.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Tales of the South Pacific}}\nAlthough book editor and university instructor [[James Michener]] could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright [[Quaker]], he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1942.  He was not sent to [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|the South Pacific theater]] until April 1944, when he was assigned to write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely.  He survived a plane crash in [[New Caledonia]]; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the [[Treasury Islands]], where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by \"scrawny residents and only one pig\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 35\u201339</ref> Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales.<ref name = \"L39\" /> On a plantation on the island of [[Espiritu Santo]], he met a woman named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red [[betel nut|betel juice]].  Punctuated with profanity learned from [[G.I. (military)|GIs]], she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other [[Tonkin]]ese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated.  She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in [[French Indochina]].{{#tag:ref|Michener later reflected, \"I would often think of her&nbsp;... when American troops were fighting their fruitless battles in Vietnam, and I wondered if our leaders realized that the enemy they were fighting consisted of millions of determined people like Bloody Mary.\" See May, p. 20|group= n}} These stories, collected into ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'', won Michener the [[1948 Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction.<ref name = \"L39\">Lovensheimer, p. 39</ref>\n\n''Tales of the South Pacific'' comprises nineteen stories. Each stands independently but revolves around the preparation for an American military operation to dislodge the Japanese from a nearby island.  This operation, dubbed ''Alligator'', occurs in the penultimate story, \"The Landing at Kuralei\".  Many of the characters die in that battle, and the last story is titled \"The Cemetery at Huga Point\". The stories are thematically linked in pairs: the first and final stories are reflective, the second and eighteenth involve battle, the third and seventeenth involve preparation for battle, and so on. The tenth story, at the center, is not paired with any other.  This story, \"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", was one of only four of his many works that Michener later admitted to holding in high regard.  It was the one that attracted [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s attention for its potential to be converted into a stage work.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 39, 191</ref>\n\n\"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", set in part on the island of Bali-ha'i, focuses on the romance between a young Tonkinese woman, Liat, and one of the Americans, Marine Lieutenant Joe Cable, a [[Princeton University|Princeton]] graduate and scion of a wealthy [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]] family.  Pressed to marry Liat by her mother, Bloody Mary, Cable reluctantly declines, realizing that the Asian girl would never be accepted by his family or Philadelphia society.  He leaves for battle (where he will die) as Bloody Mary proceeds with her backup plan, to affiance Liat to a wealthy French planter on the islands. Cable struggles, during the story, with his own racism: he is able to overcome it sufficiently to love Liat, but not enough to take her home.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nAnother source of the musical is the eighth story, \"Our Heroine\", which is thematically paired with the 12th, \"A Boar's Tooth\", as both involve American encounters with local cultures.  \"Our Heroine\" tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter,  Frenchman Emile De Becque.{{#tag:ref|The \"De\" was changed to lower case for the musical.  See Maslon, p. 115.|group= n}}  After falling in love with Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story No. 4, \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that \"any person&nbsp;... who was not white or yellow was a nigger\" to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile's household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns that this woman is dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile's \"nigger children\".<ref>Michener 1967, pp. 126\u2013127</ref> Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 43\u201344, 191</ref>\n\nAdditional elements of ''South Pacific'' had their genesis in others of Michener's 19 tales. One introduces the character of Bloody Mary; another tells of a British spy hidden on the Japanese-controlled island who relays information about Japanese movements to [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] by radio.  Michener based the spy, dubbed \"the Remittance Man\", on Captain [[Martin Clemens]], a Scot, who unlike his fictional counterpart, survived the war.  The stories also tell of the seemingly endless waiting that precedes battle, and the efforts of the Americans to repel boredom, which would inspire the song \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 49\u201350; and May, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Several of the stories involve the [[Seabee]], Luther Billis, who in the musical would be used both for comic relief and to tie together episodes involving otherwise unconnected characters.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 52\u201353</ref> A 2001 article in ''Islands Magazine'' states that Michener renamed [[Ambae Island|Aoba Island]] Bali-ha'i. The author interviewed the proprietor of a resort on [[Espiritu Santo]], who claimed that Emile was modeled on his father and that the \"real Bloody Mary\" lived on Espiritu Santo for many years after the war and lived to the age of 102.<ref>Gibbs, Tony.

Logan recalled that he then pointed it out to Hammerstein, who read Michener's book and spoke to Rodgers; the two agreed to do the project so long as they had majority control, to which Hayward grudgingly agreed.<ref>Fordin, pp. 259\u2013260; and Logan, pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Michener, in his 1992 memoirs, however, wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to [[MGM]] by [[Kenneth MacKenna]], head of the studio's literary department.  MacKenna's half brother was [[Jo Mielziner]], who had designed the sets for ''Carousel'' and ''Allegro''.  Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers, pledging to create the sets if they took on the project.<ref>Lovensheimer, p. 47</ref>\n\nHayward attempted to buy the rights from Michener outright, offering $500; Michener declined.  Although playwright [[Lynn Riggs]] had received 1.5% of the box office grosses for the right to adapt ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs]]'' into ''Oklahoma!'', Michener never regretted accepting one percent of the gross receipts from ''South Pacific''.  As Rodgers and Hammerstein began their work on the adaptation, Michener worked mostly with the lyricist, but Rodgers was concerned about the implications of the setting, fearing that he would have to include ukuleles and guitars, which he disliked.  Michener assured him that the only instrument he had ever heard the natives play was an emptied barrel of gasoline, drummed upon with clubs.<ref>May, p. 80</ref>\n\n=== Composition ===\n[[File:R and H.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two men in business suits sit in theatre seats amiably discussing what they are watching|Rodgers (left) and Hammerstein]]\nSoon after their purchase of the rights, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided not to include a ballet, as in their earlier works, feeling that the realism of the setting would not support one.  Concerned that an adaptation too focused on \"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", the story of the encounter between Cable and Liat, would be too similar to ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', Hammerstein spent months studying the other stories and focused his attention on \"Our Heroine\", the tale of the romance between Nellie and Emile.  The team decided to include both romances in the musical play.  It was conventional at the time that if one love story in a musical was serious, the other would be more comedic, but in this case both were serious and focused on racial prejudice.  They decided to increase the role played by Luther Billis in the stories, merging experiences and elements of several other characters into him.  Billis's wheeling and dealing would provide comic relief.<ref>Fordin, pp. 261\u2013262</ref> They also shortened the title to ''South Pacific'' \u2013 Rodgers related that the producers tired of people making risqu\u00e9 puns on the word \"tales\".<ref>Maslon, p. 117</ref>\n\nIn early drafts of the musical, Hammerstein gave significant parts to two characters who eventually came to have only minor roles, Bill Harbison and Dinah Culbert.  Harbison is one of the major characters in ''Tales of the South Pacific''; a model officer at the start, he gradually degenerates to the point where, with battle imminent, he requests his influential father-in-law to procure for him a transfer to a post in the United States. Hammerstein conceived of him as a rival to Emile for Nellie's affections, and gave him a song, \"The Bright Young Executive of Today\".  As redrafts focused the play on the two couples, Harbison became less essential, and he was relegated to a small role as the executive officer to the commander of the island, Captain Brackett.  Dinah, a nurse and friend of Nellie, is also a major character in Michener's work, and was seen as a possible love interest for Billis, though any actual romance was limited by Navy regulations forbidding fraternization between officers (all American nurses in World War II were commissioned officers) and enlisted men. \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\" originated as a duet for Dinah and Nellie, with Dinah beginning the song and developing its theme.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 58\u201367</ref> According to Lovensheimer, Nellie's and Dinah's \"friendship became increasingly incidental to the plot as the writing continued. Hammerstein eventually realized that the decision to wash Emile out of her hair had to be Nellie's.  Only then did the scene have the dramatic potential for Nellie's emotional transition\" as she realizes her love for Emile. In the final version, Dinah retains one solo line in the song.<ref>Rodgers and Hammerstein, pp. 310\u2013313</ref>\n\nJoshua Logan, in his memoirs, stated that after months of effort in the first half of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics.  Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of knowledge of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help.  The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work.  Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director.<ref>Logan, pp. 273\u2013281; and May, pp. 98\u2013103</ref> Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum.<ref name = \"H179\">Hyland, p. 179</ref> Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960).<ref name = \"H179\"/> Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when [[South Pacific (1958 film)|''South Pacific'' was filmed in 1958]], as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director.{{#tag:ref|Jim Lovensheimer, in his book on the genesis of ''South Pacific'', questions Logan's account: \"in his autobiography, at least, Logan is the star of every show he mentions\".<ref name=\"Lovensheimer 46\"/>|group= n}}<ref>Secrest, p. 290</ref> According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, \"it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for.  Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent.  But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of ''South Pacific'' would have collapsed during that summer of 1948.\"<ref>May, p. 100</ref>\n\nRodgers composed the music once he received the lyrics from Hammerstein.  A number of stories are told of the speed with which he wrote the music for ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s numbers. \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\" was said to have been composed in about twenty minutes; when Hammerstein, who had sent the lyrics by messenger, called to check whether Rodgers had received them, his partner informed him that he had both lyrics and music. Legend has it he composed \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\" in ten minutes over coffee in Logan's apartment; what he did create in that time frame was the three-note motif which begins both song and musical.  Hammerstein's lyrics for \"Bali Ha'i\" were inspired by the stage backdrop which designer [[Jo Mielziner]] had painted.  Feeling that the island of Bali Ha'i did not appear mysterious enough, Mielziner painted some mist near the summit of its volcano. When Hammerstein saw this he immediately thought of the lyric, \"my head sticking up from a low-flying cloud\" and the rest of the song followed easily from that.<ref>Nolan, pp. 184\u2013186</ref>\n\n=== Casting and out-of-town previews ===\n[[File:Ezio Pinza SP.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Publicity portrait of a man in his mid-fifties with curly hair (Pinza)|Ezio Pinza]]\nIn May 1948, Rodgers received a telephone call from [[Edwin Lester]] of the [[Los Angeles Civic Light Opera]].  Lester had signed former [[Metropolitan Opera]] star [[Ezio Pinza]] for $25,000 to star in a new show, ''Mr. Ambassador''.  The show had not been written, and it never would be.<ref>Maslon, p. 111</ref> Lester hoped that Rodgers would take over Pinza's contract.  Pinza had become bored as the Met's leading lyric [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and having played the great opera houses, sought other worlds to conquer.  Rodgers immediately saw Pinza as perfect for the role of Emile.<ref>Nolan, p. 178</ref> Lester carefully broached the subject to Pinza and his wife/business manager and provided them with a copy of ''Tales of the South Pacific''.  When Pinza read the book, he told Lester, \"Sell me right away!\"<ref name = \"M112\">Maslon, p. 112</ref> Pinza's contract for ''South Pacific'' included a clause limiting his singing to 15 minutes per performance.<ref name = \"M112\" /> With Pinza's signing, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided to make his the lead male role, subordinating the story of the pair of young lovers.

While showering one day during rehearsals, she came up with the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage.  This gave rise to \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\".<ref>Hammerstein, p. 199</ref> Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in ''South Pacific''.<ref>Maslon, p. 93</ref> To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played \"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\" for her.  When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench.  Rodgers gazed down at her, \"That's exactly what I want.

There was no formal chorus; each of the nurses and [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]] was given a name, and, in the case of the men, $50 to equip themselves with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. [[Don Fellows]], the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots.<ref>Maslon, pp. 124\u2013125</ref> Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship.<ref name=\"Davis, p. 130\">Davis, p. 130</ref> Of the mood backstage, \"everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive.\"<ref name = \"N186\">Nolan, p. 186</ref>  He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in ''Allegro''), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless.  He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during \"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show.<ref name = \"N186\" /> One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking.<ref name = \"M121\">Maslon, p. 121</ref> As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\" with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage.  This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.<ref>Logan, p. 289</ref>\n\nThere were no major difficulties during the four weeks of rehearsal in New York; Martin later remembered that the \"gypsy run-through\" for friends and professional associates on a bare stage was met with some of the most enthusiastic applause she could remember.  One of the few people having trouble was Pinza, who had difficulty adjusting to the constant alterations in the show \u2013 he was used to the operatic world, where a role rarely changed once learned.  Pinza's mispronunciations of English exasperated Logan, and driving to [[New Haven, Connecticut]] for the first week of previews, Pinza discussed with his wife the possibility of a return to the Met, where he knew audiences would welcome him.  She told him to let ''South Pacific''<nowiki/>'s attendees decide for themselves. When the tryouts began in New Haven on March 7, the play was an immediate hit; the ''[[New Haven Register]]'' wrote, \"''South Pacific'' should make history\".<ref>Maslon, pp. 126, 129</ref>\n\nNevertheless, a number of changes were made in New Haven and in the subsequent two weeks of previews in Boston. The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright [[Emlyn Williams]], to go over the script and cut extraneous dialogue.<ref name = \"M129\">Maslon, p. 129</ref> There were wide expectations of a hit; producer [[Mike Todd]] came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York \"because it's too damned good for them\".<ref>Nolan, p. 191</ref> The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright [[George S.

The first night audience was packed with important Broadway, business, and arts leaders.  The audience repeatedly stopped the show with extended applause, which was sustained at length at the final curtain.  Rodgers and Hammerstein had preferred, in the past, not to sponsor an afterparty, but they rented the [[St. Regis Hotel]]'s roof and ordered 200 copies of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the anticipation of a hit.  ''Times'' critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] gave the show a rave review.<ref>Fordin, p. 281</ref>\n\nThree days after the opening, Pinza signed a contract with MGM to star in films once his obligation to appear in the show expired. He left the show June 1, 1950, replaced by [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]], though Pinza missed a number of shows due to illness before that.  Martin recalled that, unused to performing eight shows a week, the former opera star would sing full out early in the week, leaving himself little voice towards the end, and would have his understudy go on.<ref>Davis, p. 145</ref><ref name = \"M154\">Maslon, p. 154</ref> Nevertheless, during the year he was in the show, and although aged 58, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol; [[George Jean Nathan]] wrote that \"Pinza has taken the place of Hot Springs, Saratoga, and hormone injections for all the other old boys\".<ref name = \"M154\" />\n\nA national tour began in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in April 1950; it ran for five years and starred [[Richard Eastham]] as Emile, [[Janet Blair]] as Nellie and [[Ray Walston]] as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film.

As part of [[Melanesia]], its native inhabitants are black-skinned, and Michener repeatedly refers to the island natives as \"black\".|group= n}} Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as they play together (\"Dites-Moi\"). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a na\u00efve [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] nurse from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], has fallen in love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right (\"A Cockeyed Optimist\"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings (\"Twin Soliloquies\"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other (\"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\").  Nellie, promising to think about their relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.\n\nMeanwhile, the restless American [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]], led by crafty Luther Billis, lament the absence of available women&nbsp;\u2013 Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed \"Bloody Mary\", a sassy middle-aged [[Tonkin]]ese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter as she tries to sell them her wares (\"Bloody Mary\"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i \u2013 which is off-limits to all but officers \u2013 supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship (\"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\").\n\n[[File:Hall as Bloody Mary.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|alt=A smiling woman with a topknot and strings of shells around her neck|Juanita Hall as Bloody Mary in the original Broadway production]]\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Lieutenant#Marine rank|Lieutenant]] Cable arrives on the island from [[Guadalcanal]], having been sent to take part in a dangerous spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan.  Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\", mysteriously telling him that it is ''his'' special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go.  Cable meets with his commanding officers, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] George Brackett and [[Commander (United States)#Naval rank|Commander]] William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live on the island where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile's background, for example, his politics and why he left France. They have heard, for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.\n\nAfter thinking a bit more about Emile and deciding she has become attracted on the basis of little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him (\"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\"). But when he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings (\"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\").\n\n[[File:Pinza decides.jpg|thumb|right|alt=In a \"war room\", three military men watch a worried man in civilian dress|Emile (Pinza) decides whether to go with Cable (William Tabbert) and place his hoped-for life with Nellie at risk]]\nCable's mission is to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy officers ask Emile to be Cable's guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha'i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to her beautiful daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French.  Believing that Liat's only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted to each other and make love (\"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\").  Billis and the rest of the crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat (\"Bali Ha'i\" (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.\n\nMeanwhile, after Emile's party, Nellie and he reflect on how happy they are to be in love (Reprises of \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\", \"Twin Soliloquies\", \"Cockeyed Optimist\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\").  Emile introduces Nellie to Jerome and Ngana.  Though she finds them charming, she is shocked when Emile reveals that they are his children by his first wife, a dark-skinned Polynesian woman, now deceased.  Nellie is unable to overcome her deep-seated racial prejudices and tearfully leaves Emile, after which he reflects sadly on what might have been (\"Some Enchanted Evening\" (reprise)).\n\n===Act II {{anchor|Synopsis-Act II}}===\n[[File:Thanksgiving Follies.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=Three women and three men on stage in a chorus number|The \"Thanksgiving Follies\", from the original production.]]\nIt is [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The GIs and nurses dance in a holiday revue titled \"Thanksgiving Follies\". In the past week, an epidemic of [[malaria]] has hit the island of Bali Ha'i. Having visited Bali Ha'i often to be with Liat, Cable is also ill, but escapes from the hospital to be with Liat.  As Liat and Cable spend more time together, Bloody Mary is delighted. She encourages them to continue their carefree life on the island (\"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\") and urges them to marry. Cable, aware of his family's prejudices, says he cannot marry a Tonkinese girl. Bloody Mary furiously drags her distraught daughter away, telling Cable that Liat must now marry a much older French plantation owner instead. Cable laments his loss. (\"Younger Than Springtime\" (reprise)).\n\nFor the final number of the Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie performs a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of \"his\" sweetheart (\"Honey Bun\"). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot feel the same way about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother.  Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that \"it's not something you're born with\", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing (\"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\"). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been (\"This Nearly Was Mine\"). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.\n\n[[File:Final scene South Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|alt=Emile and Nellie grasp hands as Emile's two children look on.|The final tableau from the original production]]\nThe mission begins with plenty of air support. Offstage, Billis stows away on the plane, falls out when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire, and ends up in the ocean waiting to be rescued; the massive rescue operation inadvertently becomes a diversion that allows Emile and Cable to land on the other side of the island undetected. The two send back reports on Japanese ships' movements in the \"Slot\", a strategic strait; American aircraft intercept and destroy the Japanese ships. When the Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zeros]] strafe the Americans' position, Emile narrowly escapes, but Cable is killed.\n\nNellie learns of Cable's death and that Emile is missing. She realizes that she was foolish to reject Emile. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary explains that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work has made it possible for a major offensive, Operation ''Alligator'', to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.\n\nNellie spends time with Jerome and Ngana and soon comes to love them. While the children are teaching her to sing \"Dites-Moi\", suddenly Emile's voice joins them. Emile has returned to discover that Nellie has overcome her prejudices and has fallen in love with his children. Emile, Nellie and the children rejoice (\"Dites-Moi\" (reprise)).\n{{clear}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Principal roles and notable performers ==\n<!--this list is for stage performers only, please do not add movie cast-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"120\" | Character\n! width=\"180\" | Description\n! width=\"120\" | Original Broadway cast<ref>Rodgers & Hammerstein, p. 269 (roles and original cast only)</ref>\n! width=\"400\" | Notable subsequent performers in noteworthy productions<!-- REFERENCES FOR EACH OF THESE PERFORMERS ARE GIVEN IN THE \"Original Production\"and \"Revivals\" SECTIONS of this article -->\n|-\n| Nellie Forbush||A young U.S. Navy nurse ||[[Mary Martin]]|| [[Janet Blair]], [[Martha Wright (actress)|Martha Wright]], [[Julie Wilson]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Mindy Carson]], [[Florence Henderson]], [[Iva Withers]], [[Gemma Craven]], [[Lauren Kennedy]], [[Helena Blackman]], [[Kelli O'Hara]], [[Laura Osnes]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Carmen Cusack]], [[Samantha Womack]], [[Lisa McCune]]\n|-\n| Emile de Becque ||A middle-aged expatriate French planter ||[[Ezio Pinza]]|| [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]], [[Richard Eastham]], [[Wilbur Evans]], [[George Britton (musician)|George Britton]], [[William Chapman (baritone)|William Chapman]], [[Giorgio Tozzi]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Justino D\u00edaz]], [[Philip Quast]], [[Dave Willetts]], [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]], [[Paulo Szot]], [[Teddy Tahu Rhodes]], [[Rod Gilfry]]\n|-\n| Lt.

They are listed in the order of their one-time placement within the show:\n* \"Bright Canary Yellow\", a short song for Nellie and Emile, was placed just before \"A Cockeyed Optimist\", of which the opening line, \"When the sky is a bright canary yellow\" was intended to play off of the earlier song.<ref>Block, pp. 139\u2013140</ref>\n* \"Now Is the Time\" (Emile) was placed in the beach scene (Act I, Scene 7) just after Emile tells Nellie why he killed the man in France.  It was to be reprised after \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\", but it was felt that for Emile to remain on stage while singing of immediate action was self-contradictory.  It was replaced in Act I by a reprise of \"Some Enchanted Evening\"; in Act II it was initially replaced by  \"Will You Marry Me?\" (later repurposed for ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'') on March 24, 1949, and then by \"This Nearly Was Mine\" on March 29, just over a week before the Broadway opening on April 7.<ref>Block, pp. 140\u2013145</ref>\n* \"Loneliness of Evening\" (Emile) was cut before the Broadway opening.  It was to occur in the first backstage scene (Act II, Scene 2) prior to \"Happy Talk\" and was sung to the same melody as \"Bright Canary Yellow\". Its melody can be heard in the 1958 film as Emile reads aloud the card with the flowers he has brought backstage for Nellie to the Thanksgiving show; the second stanza was repurposed and sung by the Prince in the 1965 TV production of ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''.<ref>Block, pp. 139, 142\u2013143</ref>\n* A reprise of \"Younger Than Springtime\" that follows Cable's rejection of Liat, was added after January 1949.<ref name = \"B142\" /> It followed two separate attempts at songs for Cable. One song, designated as \"My Friend\" was a duet for Cable and Liat, included such lyrics as \"My friend, my friend, is coming around the bend\" and was rejected by Logan as one of the worst he'd ever heard.

According to professor [[Philip Beidler]], \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's attempt to use the Broadway theater to make a courageous statement against racial bigotry in general and institutional racism in the postwar United States in particular\" forms part of ''South Pacific''<nowiki/>'s legend.<ref>Beidler, p. 213</ref> Although ''Tales of the South Pacific'' treats the question of racism, it does not give it the central place that it takes in the musical. Andrea Most, writing on the \"politics of race\" in ''South Pacific'', suggests that in the late 1940s, American liberals, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, turned to the fight for racial equality as a practical means of advancing their progressive views without risking being deemed communists.<ref>Most, pp. 308\u2013309</ref> [[Trevor Nunn]], director of the 2001 West End production, notes the importance of the fact that Nellie, a southerner, ends the play about to be the mother in an interracial family: \"It's being performed in America in 1949. That's the resonance.\"<ref name = \"b8\" />\n\nFrom the early drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made the issue of racial prejudice central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront the question of the Americans' racism.<ref name = \"racial\" /> As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, \"if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up\".<ref name = \"b3\" /> In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal.  Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.<ref name = \"racial\">Lovensheimer, pp. 97\u201398</ref>\n\n[[File:Happy Talk.jpg|thumb|alt=A crouching man in military uniform watches a young woman and a middle-aged one make hand gestures to him|right|\"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\": Cable ([[William Tabbert]]) watches Liat ([[Betta St. John]]) and Bloody Mary ([[Juanita Hall|Hall]]).]]\nAt the heart of this scene is Cable's song \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism.  Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most controversial element of the show.<ref>Most, p. 307</ref> Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein.  When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, \"That's what the show is about!\"<ref>Michener 1992, pp. 294\u2013295</ref> Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less \"briskly\", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered.<ref name=\"M162\">Maslon, p. 162</ref> Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; [[Wolcott Gibbs]] wrote of \"something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing\" while [[John Mason Brown]] opined that he was \"somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 85\u201386</ref> After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\".  Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the [[Library of Congress]], the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote \"What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'&nbsp;... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough.\"<ref name=\"L104\">Lovensheimer, p. 104</ref> Nevertheless, another wrote, \"I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding\".<ref name = \"L104\" />\n\nWhen the tour of the show reached a racially segregated theatre in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], Rodgers and Hammerstein threatened to cancel the performances there unless seating was integrated, which it was.<ref name = \"M163\" /> In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\".  Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though ''South Pacific'' was a fine piece of entertainment, that song \"contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow\", and explained, \"Intermarriage produces half-breeds.  And half-breeds are not conducive to the higher type of society.&nbsp;... In the South, we have pure blood lines and we intend to keep it that way.\"  They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded that he did not think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow.<ref name =\"M163\">Maslon, p. 163</ref><ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/03/01/93397165.pdf Georgia legislators score ''South Pacific''; see Red philosophy in song against bias]\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 1, 1953, accessed March 12, 2013 (subscription required)</ref> In part because of the song, touring companies of ''South Pacific'' had difficulty getting bookings in the [[Deep South]].<ref>Hischak, p. 324</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinza with kids.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pinza, in a white suit, walks along holding a mixed-race boy, about 7 or 8 years old, while listening to a slightly older girl who walks next to him.|upright|Emile (Pinza) with his children.]]\nIn the final scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children.  In so doing, Nellie fails to live up to the American ideal that \"all men are created equal\", which Emile had earlier affirmed.<ref name = \"b8\">Butler, p. 8</ref> This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, initially unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word \"Polynesian\", responds with \"colored\".  This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production.  As [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, \"it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype&nbsp;\u2013 she's lovable&nbsp;... But how can we love a racist?\"<ref name = \"love\">Lovensheimer, pp. 90\u201392</ref> Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor&nbsp;\u2013 Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, as she puts it, \"French planters stingy bastards!\"<ref>Most, pp. 330\u2013331</ref>\n\n=== Sex and gender roles ===\nNellie Forbush, in her journey from Little Rock, Arkansas, to serving as a Navy nurse and on to the domesticity of the final scene of ''South Pacific'', parallels the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work&nbsp;\u2013 that character had a [[4-F (US Military)|4-F]] boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 108\u2013109</ref><ref>Michener 1967, p. 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Billis and Nellie laundry.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A military scene.

Other enlisted men, many bare-chested, watch.|Nellie (Martin) praises the laundry skills of Billis (McCormick) as his friends look on.]]\nThe male characters in ''South Pacific'' are intended to appear conventionally masculine.  In the aftermath of World War II, the masculinity of the American soldier was beyond public question.  Cable's virility with Liat is made evident to the audience.  Although Billis operates a laundry \u2013 Nellie particularly praises his pleats \u2013 and appears in a grass skirt in the \"Thanksgiving Follies\", these acts are consistent with his desire for money and are clearly intended to be comic.  His interest in the young women on Bali H'ai establishes his masculinity.  Lovensheimer writes that Billis is more defined by class than by sexuality, evidenced by the Seabee's assumption, on learning that Cable went to college in New Jersey, that it was [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] (the state's flagship public university), rather than [[Ivy League]] Princeton, and by his delight on learning that the rescue operation for him had cost $600,000 when his uncle had told him he would never be worth a dime.<ref>Rodgers and Hammerstein, pp. 290, 353</ref><ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 109\u2013111, 142\u2013143</ref>\n\nMeryle Secrest, in her biography of Rodgers, theorizes that ''South Pacific'' marks a transition for the pair \"between heroes and heroines who are more or less evenly matched in age and stories about powerful older men and the younger women who are attracted to them\".<ref>Secrest, p. 294</ref> Lovensheimer points out that this pattern only holds for two of their five subsequent musicals, ''The King and I'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', and in the former, the love between Anna and the King is not expressed in words.  He believes a different transition took place: that their plots, beginning with  ''South Pacific'', involve a woman needing to enter and accept her love interest's world to be successful and accepted herself.  He notes that both ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Carousel'' involve a man entering his wife's world, Curly in ''Oklahoma!'' about to become a farmer with expectations of success, whereas Billy Bigelow in ''Carousel'' fails to find work after leaving his place as a barker.  Lovensheimer deems ''Allegro'' to be a transition, where the attempts of the lead female character to alter her husband Joe's world to suit her ambition lead to the breakup of their marriage.  He argues that the nurse Emily, who goes with Joe in his return to the small town where he was happy, is a forerunner of Nellie, uprooting her life in Chicago for Joe.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\nSecrest notes that much is overlooked in the rush to have love conquer all in ''South Pacific'', \"questions of the long-term survival of a marriage between a sophisticate who read Proust at bedtime and a girl who liked Dinah Shore and did not read anything were raised by Nellie Forbush only to be brushed aside.  As for the interracial complexities of raising two Polynesian children, all such issues were subsumed in the general euphoria of true love.\"<ref>Secrest, p. 293</ref>  Lovensheimer too wonders how Nellie will fare as the second Madame de Becque, \"little Nellie Forbush from Arkansas ends up in a tropical paradise, far from her previous world, with a husband, a servant, and two children who speak a language she does not understand\".<ref>Lovensheimer, p. 115</ref>\n\n=== Cultural effect ===\n[[File:Wash man from hair.jpg|thumb|alt=Martin, wearing a swimsuit, stands in an improvised shower stall as water pours down on her.|right|[[Mary Martin]] washed her hair onstage eight times a week.]]\nA mammoth hit, ''South Pacific'' sparked huge media and public attention.  ''South Pacific'' was one of the first shows for which a variety of souvenirs were available: fans could buy ''South Pacific'' neckties, or for women, lipstick and scarves.  Fake ticket stubs could be purchased for use as status symbols.<ref name=\"M153\" /> There were ''South Pacific'' music boxes, dolls, fashion accessories, and even hairbrushes for use after washing men from hair.<ref>Hammerstein, p. 200</ref> Martin's on-stage shower prompted an immediate fashion craze for short hair that could be managed through once-a-day washing at home, rather than in a beauty salon, and for the products which would allow for such care.<ref>Beidler, pp. 116\u2013117</ref> The songs of ''South Pacific'' could be heard on the radio, and they were popular among dance bands and in piano lounges.<ref name=\"M153\" /> Mordden comments that ''South Pacific'' contained nothing but hit songs; Rodgers and Hammerstein's other successful works always included at least one song which did not become popular.<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 120</ref>\n\nThe cast album, recorded ten days after the show's opening, was an immediate hit.  Released by [[Columbia Records]], it spent 69 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard and a total of 400 weeks on the charts, becoming the best-selling record of the 1940s.<ref name=\"M153\" /> It was one of the early [[LP record]]s, with a turntable speed of 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm, and helped to popularize that technology&nbsp;\u2013 previously, show albums and operas had been issued on sets of 78&nbsp;rpm records, with high prices and much less music on a single disc.  In the years to come, the LP would become the medium of choice for the \"longhair\" music niche of show, opera and classical performances.<ref>Beidler, p. 117</ref>\n\nAn indirect effect of the success of the show was the career of James Michener.  His one percent of the show as author of the source material, plus the income from a share which the duo allowed him to buy on credit, made him financially independent and allowed him to quit his job as an editor at Macmillan and to become a full-time writer.<ref>Michener 1992, p. 294</ref><ref>May, pp. 112\u2013125</ref> Over the next five decades, his lengthy, detailed novels centering on different places would dominate the bestseller lists.<ref>May, pp. ix\u2013x</ref>\n\n== Music and recordings ==\n\n=== Musical treatment ===\nThe role of Nellie Forbush was the first time with Hammerstein that Rodgers made the leading female role a [[belt (music)|belter]], rather than a [[lyric soprano]] like Laurey in ''Oklahoma!'' and Julie in ''Carousel''.{{#tag:ref|The female lead in ''Allegro'', Jenny, is principally a dancing role; the performer playing her does not sing by herself.|group= n}} According to Mordden, \"Nellie was something new in R&H, carrying a goodly share of the score on a 'Broadway' voice\".<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 108</ref>\n\nNellie does not sing together with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin that she would not have to compete vocally with Pinza,{{#tag:ref|They do sing together at the start of the final scene of Act I, but their characters are supposed to have been drinking.|group= n}} but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music.  A [[tetrachord]], heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to \"Dites-Moi\", the show's first song.  Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as \"Twin Soliloquies\") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of \"Some Enchanted Evening\".  Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie is trying to say with her Act II line \"We're the same sort of people fundamentally&nbsp;\u2013 you and me\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 124\u2013132</ref>\n\nOriginally, \"Twin Soliloquies\" came to an end shortly after the vocal part finishes.  Logan found this unsatisfying and worked with Trude Rittmann to find a better ending to the song.  This piece of music, dubbed \"Unspoken Thoughts\", continues the music as Nellie and Emile sip brandy together, and is called by Lovensheimer \"the one truly operatic moment of the score\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> \"This Nearly Was Mine\" is a big bass solo for Emile in waltz time, deemed by Rodgers biographer William G. Hyland as \"one of his finest efforts\".<ref name =\"WGH183\">Hyland, p. 183</ref> Only five notes are used in the first four bars, a phrase which is then repeated with a slight variation in the following four bars.  The song ends an octave higher than where it began, making it perfect for Pinza's voice.<ref name = \"WGH183\" />\n\nTwo songs, \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\" and \"Honey Bun\" are intended to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s.  In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a [[big band]] arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of [[swing music|swing]].  The sections beginning \"If the man don't understand you\" and \"If you laugh at different comics\" have a [[blues]] style.  Lovensheimer deems the song \"Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 133\u2013135</ref> Mordden suggests that \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\" with its \"take no prisoners bounce\", might well be the center of the score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clich\u00e9s, many of which, such as \"corny as Kansas in August\" Hammerstein made up, and \"sure enough, over the years they have become clich\u00e9s\".<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 121</ref>\n\n=== Recordings ===\n[[File:South pacific bway 1949.jpg|thumb|Cover of original cast album]]\n[[Columbia Records]] recorded the overture and most of the songs from the original production in 1949, using members of the cast including [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]]. Drawing from the original [[Acetate disc|lacquer disc]] masters, Columbia released the album in both the new LP format and on 78-rpm discs.  Soon after Sony acquired Columbia in 1988, a CD was released from the previously unused magnetic tape recording from the same 1949 sessions in New York City.

The work premiered in 1949 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and was an immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot is based on [[James A. Michener]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning]] 1947 book ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'' and combines elements of several of those stories. [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] believed they could write a musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, send a strong progressive message on racism.\n\nThe plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II, who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children. A secondary romance, between a [[U.S. Marine]] lieutenant and a young [[Tonkin]]ese woman, explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart. The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical, most controversially in the lieutenant's song, \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\".  Supporting characters, including a comic [[petty officer#United States|petty officer]] and the Tonkinese girl's mother, help to tie the stories together.  Because he lacked military knowledge, Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script; the director of the original production, Logan, assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book.\n\nThe original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success, became [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|the second-longest running Broadway musical]] to that point (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind.  The piece won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1950.  Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\", \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\", \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", and \"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\", have become popular standards.\n\nThe production won ten [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Libretto, and it is the only musical production to win Tony Awards in all four acting categories. Its original cast album was the bestselling record of the 1940s, and other recordings of the show have also been popular. The show has enjoyed many successful revivals and tours, spawning a [[South Pacific (1958 film)|1958 film]] and television adaptations. The 2008 Broadway revival, a critical success, ran for 996 performances and won seven Tonys, including Best Musical Revival.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Tales of the South Pacific}}\nAlthough book editor and university instructor [[James Michener]] could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright [[Quaker]], he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1942.  He was not sent to [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|the South Pacific theater]] until April 1944, when he was assigned to write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely.  He survived a plane crash in [[New Caledonia]]; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the [[Treasury Islands]], where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by \"scrawny residents and only one pig\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 35\u201339</ref> Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales.<ref name = \"L39\" /> On a plantation on the island of [[Espiritu Santo]], he met a woman named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red [[betel nut|betel juice]].  Punctuated with profanity learned from [[G.I. (military)|GIs]], she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other [[Tonkin]]ese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated.  She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in [[French Indochina]].{{#tag:ref|Michener later reflected, \"I would often think of her&nbsp;... when American troops were fighting their fruitless battles in Vietnam, and I wondered if our leaders realized that the enemy they were fighting consisted of millions of determined people like Bloody Mary.\" See May, p. 20|group= n}} These stories, collected into ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'', won Michener the [[1948 Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction.<ref name = \"L39\">Lovensheimer, p. 39</ref>\n\n''Tales of the South Pacific'' comprises nineteen stories. Each stands independently but revolves around the preparation for an American military operation to dislodge the Japanese from a nearby island.  This operation, dubbed ''Alligator'', occurs in the penultimate story, \"The Landing at Kuralei\".  Many of the characters die in that battle, and the last story is titled \"The Cemetery at Huga Point\". The stories are thematically linked in pairs: the first and final stories are reflective, the second and eighteenth involve battle, the third and seventeenth involve preparation for battle, and so on. The tenth story, at the center, is not paired with any other.  This story, \"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", was one of only four of his many works that Michener later admitted to holding in high regard.  It was the one that attracted [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s attention for its potential to be converted into a stage work.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 39, 191</ref>\n\n\"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", set in part on the island of Bali-ha'i, focuses on the romance between a young Tonkinese woman, Liat, and one of the Americans, Marine Lieutenant Joe Cable, a [[Princeton University|Princeton]] graduate and scion of a wealthy [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]] family.  Pressed to marry Liat by her mother, Bloody Mary, Cable reluctantly declines, realizing that the Asian girl would never be accepted by his family or Philadelphia society.  He leaves for battle (where he will die) as Bloody Mary proceeds with her backup plan, to affiance Liat to a wealthy French planter on the islands. Cable struggles, during the story, with his own racism: he is able to overcome it sufficiently to love Liat, but not enough to take her home.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nAnother source of the musical is the eighth story, \"Our Heroine\", which is thematically paired with the 12th, \"A Boar's Tooth\", as both involve American encounters with local cultures.  \"Our Heroine\" tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter,  Frenchman Emile De Becque.{{#tag:ref|The \"De\" was changed to lower case for the musical.  See Maslon, p. 115.|group= n}}  After falling in love with Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story No. 4, \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that \"any person&nbsp;... who was not white or yellow was a nigger\" to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile's household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns that this woman is dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile's \"nigger children.\"<ref>Michener 1967, pp. 126\u2013127</ref> Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 43\u201344, 191</ref>\n\nAdditional elements of ''South Pacific'' had their genesis in others of Michener's 19 tales. One introduces the character of Bloody Mary; another tells of a British spy hidden on the Japanese-controlled island who relays information about Japanese movements to [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] by radio.  Michener based the spy, dubbed \"the Remittance Man\", on Captain [[Martin Clemens]], a Scot, who unlike his fictional counterpart, survived the war.  The stories also tell of the seemingly endless waiting that precedes battle, and the efforts of the Americans to repel boredom, which would inspire the song \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 49\u201350; and May, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Several of the stories involve the [[Seabee]], Luther Billis, who in the musical would be used both for comic relief and to tie together episodes involving otherwise unconnected characters.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 52\u201353</ref> A 2001 article in ''Islands Magazine'' states that Michener renamed [[Ambae Island|Aoba Island]] Bali-ha'i. The author interviewed the proprietor of a resort on [[Espiritu Santo]], who claimed that Emile was modeled on his father and that the \"real Bloody Mary\" lived on Espiritu Santo for many years after the war and lived to the age of 102.<ref>Gibbs, Tony.

Logan recalled that he then pointed it out to Hammerstein, who read Michener's book and spoke to Rodgers; the two agreed to do the project so long as they had majority control, to which Hayward grudgingly agreed.<ref>Fordin, pp. 259\u2013260; and Logan, pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Michener, in his 1992 memoirs, however, wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to [[MGM]] by [[Kenneth MacKenna]], head of the studio's literary department.  MacKenna's half brother was [[Jo Mielziner]], who had designed the sets for ''Carousel'' and ''Allegro''.  Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers, pledging to create the sets if they took on the project.<ref>Lovensheimer, p. 47</ref>\n\nHayward attempted to buy the rights from Michener outright, offering $500; Michener declined.  Although playwright [[Lynn Riggs]] had received 1.5% of the box office grosses for the right to adapt ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs]]'' into ''Oklahoma!'', Michener never regretted accepting one percent of the gross receipts from ''South Pacific''.  As Rodgers and Hammerstein began their work on the adaptation, Michener worked mostly with the lyricist, but Rodgers was concerned about the implications of the setting, fearing that he would have to include ukuleles and guitars, which he disliked.  Michener assured him that the only instrument he had ever heard the natives play was an emptied barrel of gasoline, drummed upon with clubs.<ref>May, p. 80</ref>\n\n=== Composition ===\n[[File:R and H.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two men in business suits sit in theatre seats amiably discussing what they are watching|Rodgers (left) and Hammerstein]]\nSoon after their purchase of the rights, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided not to include a ballet, as in their earlier works, feeling that the realism of the setting would not support one.  Concerned that an adaptation too focused on \"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", the story of the encounter between Cable and Liat, would be too similar to ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', Hammerstein spent months studying the other stories and focused his attention on \"Our Heroine\", the tale of the romance between Nellie and Emile.  The team decided to include both romances in the musical play.  It was conventional at the time that if one love story in a musical was serious, the other would be more comedic, but in this case both were serious and focused on racial prejudice.  They decided to increase the role played by Luther Billis in the stories, merging experiences and elements of several other characters into him.  Billis's wheeling and dealing would provide comic relief.<ref>Fordin, pp. 261\u2013262</ref> They also shortened the title to ''South Pacific'' \u2013 Rodgers related that the producers tired of people making risqu\u00e9 puns on the word \"tales\".<ref>Maslon, p. 117</ref>\n\nIn early drafts of the musical, Hammerstein gave significant parts to two characters who eventually came to have only minor roles, Bill Harbison and Dinah Culbert.  Harbison is one of the major characters in ''Tales of the South Pacific''; a model officer at the start, he gradually degenerates to the point where, with battle imminent, he requests his influential father-in-law to procure for him a transfer to a post in the United States. Hammerstein conceived of him as a rival to Emile for Nellie's affections, and gave him a song, \"The Bright Young Executive of Today\".  As redrafts focused the play on the two couples, Harbison became less essential, and he was relegated to a small role as the executive officer to the commander of the island, Captain Brackett.  Dinah, a nurse and friend of Nellie, is also a major character in Michener's work, and was seen as a possible love interest for Billis, though any actual romance was limited by Navy regulations forbidding fraternization between officers (all American nurses in World War II were commissioned officers) and enlisted men. \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\" originated as a duet for Dinah and Nellie, with Dinah beginning the song and developing its theme.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 58\u201367</ref> According to Lovensheimer, Nellie's and Dinah's \"friendship became increasingly incidental to the plot as the writing continued. Hammerstein eventually realized that the decision to wash Emile out of her hair had to be Nellie's.  Only then did the scene have the dramatic potential for Nellie's emotional transition\" as she realizes her love for Emile. In the final version, Dinah retains one solo line in the song.<ref>Rodgers and Hammerstein, pp. 310\u2013313</ref>\n\nJoshua Logan, in his memoirs, stated that after months of effort in the first half of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics.  Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of knowledge of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help.  The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work.  Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director.<ref>Logan, pp. 273\u2013281; and May, pp. 98\u2013103</ref> Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum.<ref name = \"H179\">Hyland, p. 179</ref> Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960).<ref name = \"H179\"/> Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when [[South Pacific (1958 film)|''South Pacific'' was filmed in 1958]], as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director.{{#tag:ref|Jim Lovensheimer, in his book on the genesis of ''South Pacific'', questions Logan's account: \"in his autobiography, at least, Logan is the star of every show he mentions\".<ref name=\"Lovensheimer 46\"/>|group= n}}<ref>Secrest, p. 290</ref> According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, \"it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for.  Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent.  But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of ''South Pacific'' would have collapsed during that summer of 1948.\"<ref>May, p. 100</ref>\n\nRodgers composed the music once he received the lyrics from Hammerstein.  A number of stories are told of the speed with which he wrote the music for ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s numbers. \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\" was said to have been composed in about twenty minutes; when Hammerstein, who had sent the lyrics by messenger, called to check whether Rodgers had received them, his partner informed him that he had both lyrics and music. Legend has it he composed \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\" in ten minutes over coffee in Logan's apartment; what he did create in that time frame was the three-note motif which begins both song and musical.  Hammerstein's lyrics for \"Bali Ha'i\" were inspired by the stage backdrop which designer [[Jo Mielziner]] had painted.  Feeling that the island of Bali Ha'i did not appear mysterious enough, Mielziner painted some mist near the summit of its volcano. When Hammerstein saw this he immediately thought of the lyric, \"my head sticking up from a low-flying cloud\" and the rest of the song followed easily from that.<ref>Nolan, pp. 184\u2013186</ref>\n\n=== Casting and out-of-town previews ===\n[[File:Ezio Pinza SP.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Publicity portrait of a man in his mid-fifties with curly hair (Pinza)|Ezio Pinza]]\nIn May 1948, Rodgers received a telephone call from [[Edwin Lester]] of the [[Los Angeles Civic Light Opera]].  Lester had signed former [[Metropolitan Opera]] star [[Ezio Pinza]] for $25,000 to star in a new show, ''Mr. Ambassador''.  The show had not been written, and it never would be.<ref>Maslon, p. 111</ref> Lester hoped that Rodgers would take over Pinza's contract.  Pinza had become bored as the Met's leading lyric [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and having played the great opera houses, sought other worlds to conquer.  Rodgers immediately saw Pinza as perfect for the role of Emile.<ref>Nolan, p. 178</ref> Lester carefully broached the subject to Pinza and his wife/business manager and provided them with a copy of ''Tales of the South Pacific''.  When Pinza read the book, he told Lester, \"Sell me right away!\"<ref name = \"M112\">Maslon, p. 112</ref> Pinza's contract for ''South Pacific'' included a clause limiting his singing to 15 minutes per performance.<ref name = \"M112\" /> With Pinza's signing, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided to make his the lead male role, subordinating the story of the pair of young lovers.  It was unusual on Broadway for the romantic lead to be an older male.<ref name = \"F262\">Fordin, p. 262</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Martin 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait of a woman in her mid-thirties, with long curly hair and wearing an old-fashioned blouse with string tie|[[Mary Martin]]]]\nFor the role of Nellie, Rodgers sought [[Mary Martin]], who had nearly been cast to originate the role of Laurey in ''Oklahoma!''<ref name = \"F262\" /> Martin was playing the title role in the touring company of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''.  After Hammerstein and Rodgers saw her play in Los Angeles in mid-1948, they asked her to consider the part.  Martin was reluctant to sing opposite Pinza's powerful voice; Rodgers assured her he would see to it the two never sang at the same time,<ref>Davis, p. 123</ref> a promise he mostly kept.<ref name = \"H180\">Hyland, p. 180</ref> Rodgers and Martin lived near each other in Connecticut, and after her tour Rodgers invited Martin and her husband, Richard Halliday, to his home to hear the three songs for the musical that he had completed, none of them for Nellie.<ref>Davis, p. 125</ref> \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\" especially struck Martin, and although disappointed the song was not for her, she agreed to do the part.<ref name = \"H180\" /> Although Nellie and Emile were already fully developed characters in Michener's stories, during the creation of ''South Pacific'', Rodgers, Hammerstein and Logan began to adapt the roles specifically to the talents of Martin and Pinza and to tailor the music for their voices.<ref>[http://www.rnh.com/show/97/South-Pacific#shows-history \"''South Pacific'': History], Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, accessed August 29, 2012</ref>\n\nMartin influenced several of her songs.  While showering one day during rehearsals, she came up with the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage.  This gave rise to \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\".<ref>Hammerstein, p. 199</ref> Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in ''South Pacific''.<ref>Maslon, p. 93</ref> To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played \"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\" for her.  When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench.  Rodgers gazed down at her, \"That's exactly what I want.  Never do it differently.  We must feel you couldn't squeeze out another sound.\"<ref>Nolan, p. 185</ref>\n\nThe producers held extensive auditions to fill the other roles.<ref name = \"F267\">Fordin, p. 267</ref> [[Myron McCormick]] was cast as Billis; according to Logan, no one else was seriously considered. The two roles which gave the most trouble were those of Cable and Bloody Mary.<ref name = \"L283\" /> They tried to get Harold Keel for the role of Cable (he had played Curly in the West End production of ''Oklahoma!'') only to find that he had signed a contract with MGM under the name [[Howard Keel]].<ref name = \"N182\">Nolan, p. 182</ref> [[William Tabbert]] was eventually cast as Cable, though Logan instructed him to lose {{convert|20|lb}}.

Both are formally dressed and look upwards and to the left with their mouths open, as if singing together. |Playbill cover]]\nRehearsals began at Broadway's [[Belasco Theatre]] on February 2, 1949.  There was no formal chorus; each of the nurses and [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]] was given a name, and, in the case of the men, $50 to equip themselves with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. [[Don Fellows]], the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots.<ref>Maslon, pp. 124\u2013125</ref> Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship.<ref name=\"Davis, p. 130\">Davis, p. 130</ref> Of the mood backstage, \"everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive.\"<ref name = \"N186\">Nolan, p. 186</ref>  He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in ''Allegro''), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless.  He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during \"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show.<ref name = \"N186\" /> One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking.<ref name = \"M121\">Maslon, p. 121</ref> As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\" with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage.  This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.<ref>Logan, p. 289</ref>\n\nThere were no major difficulties during the four weeks of rehearsal in New York; Martin later remembered that the \"gypsy run-through\" for friends and professional associates on a bare stage was met with some of the most enthusiastic applause she could remember.  One of the few people having trouble was Pinza, who had difficulty adjusting to the constant alterations in the show \u2013 he was used to the operatic world, where a role rarely changed once learned.  Pinza's mispronunciations of English exasperated Logan, and driving to [[New Haven, Connecticut]] for the first week of previews, Pinza discussed with his wife the possibility of a return to the Met, where he knew audiences would welcome him.  She told him to let ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s attendees decide for themselves. When the tryouts began in New Haven on March 7, the play was an immediate hit; the ''[[New Haven Register]]'' wrote, \"''South Pacific'' should make history\".<ref>Maslon, pp. 126, 129</ref>\n\nNevertheless, a number of changes were made in New Haven and in the subsequent two weeks of previews in Boston. The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright [[Emlyn Williams]], to go over the script and cut extraneous dialogue.<ref name = \"M129\">Maslon, p. 129</ref> There were wide expectations of a hit; producer [[Mike Todd]] came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York \"because it's too damned good for them\".<ref>Nolan, p. 191</ref> The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright [[George S. Kaufman]] joked that people lining up there at the [[Shubert Theatre (Boston)|Shubert Theatre]] \"don't actually want anything&nbsp;... They just want to push money under the doors.\"<ref name=Nolan190>Nolan, pp. 190\u2013195</ref>\n\n[[File:South Pacific rehearsal.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Four middle-aged men are gathered around to listen to a woman sing from a book|From left: Logan, Rodgers, Hammerstein, Martin and Michener]]\n''South Pacific'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 7, 1949, at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]].<ref>Hischak, p. 261</ref> The advance sale was $400,000, and an additional $700,000 in sales was made soon after the opening. The first night audience was packed with important Broadway, business, and arts leaders.  The audience repeatedly stopped the show with extended applause, which was sustained at length at the final curtain.  Rodgers and Hammerstein had preferred, in the past, not to sponsor an afterparty, but they rented the [[St. Regis Hotel]]'s roof and ordered 200 copies of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the anticipation of a hit.  ''Times'' critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] gave the show a rave review.<ref>Fordin, p. 281</ref>\n\nThree days after the opening, Pinza signed a contract with MGM to star in films once his obligation to appear in the show expired. He left the show June 1, 1950, replaced by [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]], though Pinza missed a number of shows due to illness before that.  Martin recalled that, unused to performing eight shows a week, the former opera star would sing full out early in the week, leaving himself little voice towards the end, and would have his understudy go on.<ref>Davis, p. 145</ref><ref name = \"M154\">Maslon, p. 154</ref> Nevertheless, during the year he was in the show, and although aged 58, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol; [[George Jean Nathan]] wrote that \"Pinza has taken the place of Hot Springs, Saratoga, and hormone injections for all the other old boys\".<ref name = \"M154\" />\n\nA national tour began in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in April 1950; it ran for five years and starred [[Richard Eastham]] as Emile, [[Janet Blair]] as Nellie and [[Ray Walston]] as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them.<ref>Maslon, pp. 153\u2013154</ref> [[Jeanne Bal]] and [[Iva Withers]] were later Nellies on this tour.<ref>Green, p. 399</ref> A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.<ref name = \"M154\" />\n\nMartin left the Broadway production in 1951 to appear in the original London [[West End theatre|West End]] production; [[Martha Wright (actress)|Martha Wright]] replaced her.

As part of [[Melanesia]], its native inhabitants are black-skinned, and Michener repeatedly refers to the island natives as \"black\".|group= n}} Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as they play together (\"Dites-Moi\"). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a na\u00efve [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] nurse from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], has fallen in love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right (\"A Cockeyed Optimist\"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings (\"Twin Soliloquies\"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other (\"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\").  Nellie, promising to think about their relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.\n\nMeanwhile, the restless American [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]], led by crafty Luther Billis, lament the absence of available women&nbsp;\u2013 Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed \"Bloody Mary\", a sassy middle-aged [[Tonkin]]ese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter as she tries to sell them her wares (\"Bloody Mary\"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i \u2013 which is off-limits to all but officers \u2013 supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship (\"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\").\n\n[[File:Hall as Bloody Mary.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|alt=A smiling woman with a topknot and strings of shells around her neck|Juanita Hall as Bloody Mary in the original Broadway production]]\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Lieutenant#Marine rank|Lieutenant]] Cable arrives on the island from [[Guadalcanal]], having been sent to take part in a dangerous spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan.  Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\", mysteriously telling him that it is ''his'' special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go.  Cable meets with his commanding officers, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] George Brackett and [[Commander (United States)#Naval rank|Commander]] William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live on the island where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile's background, for example, his politics and why he left France. They have heard, for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.\n\nAfter thinking a bit more about Emile and deciding she has become attracted on the basis of little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him (\"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\"). But when he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings (\"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\").\n\n[[File:Pinza decides.jpg|thumb|right|alt=In a \"war room\", three military men watch a worried man in civilian dress|Emile (Pinza) decides whether to go with Cable (William Tabbert) and place his hoped-for life with Nellie at risk]]\nCable's mission is to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy officers ask Emile to be Cable's guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha'i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to her beautiful daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French.  Believing that Liat's only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted to each other and make love (\"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\").  Billis and the rest of the crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat (\"Bali Ha'i\" (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.\n\nMeanwhile, after Emile's party, Nellie and he reflect on how happy they are to be in love (Reprises of \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\", \"Twin Soliloquies\", \"Cockeyed Optimist\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\").  Emile introduces Nellie to Jerome and Ngana.  Though she finds them charming, she is shocked when Emile reveals that they are his children by his first wife, a dark-skinned Polynesian woman, now deceased.  Nellie is unable to overcome her deep-seated racial prejudices and tearfully leaves Emile, after which he reflects sadly on what might have been (\"Some Enchanted Evening\" (reprise)).\n\n===Act II {{anchor|Synopsis-Act II}}===\n[[File:Thanksgiving Follies.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=Three women and three men on stage in a chorus number|The \"Thanksgiving Follies\", from the original production.]]\nIt is [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The GIs and nurses dance in a holiday revue titled \"Thanksgiving Follies\". In the past week, an epidemic of [[malaria]] has hit the island of Bali Ha'i. Having visited Bali Ha'i often to be with Liat, Cable is also ill, but escapes from the hospital to be with Liat.  As Liat and Cable spend more time together, Bloody Mary is delighted. She encourages them to continue their carefree life on the island (\"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\") and urges them to marry. Cable, aware of his family's prejudices, says he cannot marry a Tonkinese girl. Bloody Mary furiously drags her distraught daughter away, telling Cable that Liat must now marry a much older French plantation owner instead. Cable laments his loss. (\"Younger Than Springtime\" (reprise)).\n\nFor the final number of the Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie performs a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of \"his\" sweetheart (\"Honey Bun\"). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot feel the same way about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother.  Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that \"it's not something you're born with\", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing (\"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\"). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been (\"This Nearly Was Mine\"). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.\n\n[[File:Final scene South Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|alt=Emile and Nellie grasp hands as Emile's two children look on.|The final tableau from the original production]]\nThe mission begins with plenty of air support. Offstage, Billis stows away on the plane, falls out when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire, and ends up in the ocean waiting to be rescued; the massive rescue operation inadvertently becomes a diversion that allows Emile and Cable to land on the other side of the island undetected. The two send back reports on Japanese ships' movements in the \"Slot\", a strategic strait; American aircraft intercept and destroy the Japanese ships. When the Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zeros]] strafe the Americans' position, Emile narrowly escapes, but Cable is killed.\n\nNellie learns of Cable's death and that Emile is missing. She realizes that she was foolish to reject Emile. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary explains that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work has made it possible for a major offensive, Operation ''Alligator'', to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.\n\nNellie spends time with Jerome and Ngana and soon comes to love them. While the children are teaching her to sing \"Dites-Moi,\" suddenly Emile's voice joins them. Emile has returned to discover that Nellie has overcome her prejudices and has fallen in love with his children.

They are seated on a divan or loveseat|right|[[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]] and [[Mary Martin]] as Emile and Nellie in the original production (1950)]]\nA number of songs were extensively modified or omitted in the weeks leading up to the initial Broadway opening.  They are listed in the order of their one-time placement within the show:\n* \"Bright Canary Yellow\", a short song for Nellie and Emile, was placed just before \"A Cockeyed Optimist\", of which the opening line, \"When the sky is a bright canary yellow\" was intended to play off of the earlier song.<ref>Block, pp. 139\u2013140</ref>\n* \"Now Is the Time\" (Emile) was placed in the beach scene (Act I, Scene 7) just after Emile tells Nellie why he killed the man in France.  It was to be reprised after \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\", but it was felt that for Emile to remain on stage while singing of immediate action was self-contradictory.  It was replaced in Act I by a reprise of \"Some Enchanted Evening\"; in Act II it was initially replaced by  \"Will You Marry Me?\" (later repurposed for ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'') on March 24, 1949, and then by \"This Nearly Was Mine\" on March 29, just over a week before the Broadway opening on April 7.<ref>Block, pp. 140\u2013145</ref>\n* \"Loneliness of Evening\" (Emile) was cut before the Broadway opening.  It was to occur in the first backstage scene (Act II, Scene 2) prior to \"Happy Talk\" and was sung to the same melody as \"Bright Canary Yellow\". Its melody can be heard in the 1958 film as Emile reads aloud the card with the flowers he has brought backstage for Nellie to the Thanksgiving show; the second stanza was repurposed and sung by the Prince in the 1965 TV production of ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''.<ref>Block, pp. 139, 142\u2013143</ref>\n* A reprise of \"Younger Than Springtime\" that follows Cable's rejection of Liat, was added after January 1949.<ref name = \"B142\" /> It followed two separate attempts at songs for Cable. One song, designated as \"My Friend\" was a duet for Cable and Liat, included such lyrics as \"My friend, my friend, is coming around the bend\" and was rejected by Logan as one of the worst he'd ever heard.  Rodgers and Hammerstein's second attempt to place a song there, \"Suddenly Lovely\", was considered by Logan too lightweight and was later repurposed for ''[[The King and I]]'' as \"[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]\".<ref>Block, pp. 142, 145\u2013146</ref> The melody for \"Younger than Springtime\" was from a song, \"My Wife\", intended for ''Allegro'' but not used.<ref>Nolan, p. 190</ref>\n* \"Honey Bun\" was not included in the January 1949 libretto (a note marks that the lyrics will be supplied later).<ref name = \"B142\">Block, p. 142</ref>\n* \"My Girl Back Home\" (Cable) preceded \"You've Got to be Carefully Taught\" in the original score but was cut before the first Broadway production. It appears in the movie version as a duet for Nellie and Cable. It was reinstated for the 2002 London revival, for Cable.<ref name = \"B142146\" />\n* \"You've Got to be Carefully Taught\" originally had several singing lines for Emile following the conclusion of the lyrics for Cable.<ref name =\"B142146\">Block, pp. 142, 146</ref>\n\n==Subsequent productions==\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Florence Henderson 1967.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A woman in her thirties with short, parted hair in a black-and-white portrait shot.

It is likely to establish a new trend in musicals.\" The review continued: \"Every number is so outstanding that it is difficult to decide which will be the most popular.\"<ref name=Suskin/> The review in ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' found the show to be \"the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak.\"<ref name=Suskin/> [[Brooks Atkinson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' especially praised Pinza's performance: \"Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most beautiful that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two.

People were so eager to obtain tickets that the press wrote about the lengths people had gone to in getting them.  Because \"house seats\" were being sold by [[ticket resale|scalpers]] for $200 or more, the attorney general's office threatened to close the show. The parties who provided the scalpers with the tickets were never identified, and the show ran without interference. The production had a $50,600 weekly gross, and ran for 1,925 performances. The national tour began in 1950 and grossed $3,000,000 in the first year, making $1,500,000 in profit.

According to professor [[Philip Beidler]], \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's attempt to use the Broadway theater to make a courageous statement against racial bigotry in general and institutional racism in the postwar United States in particular\" forms part of ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s legend.<ref>Beidler, p. 213</ref> Although ''Tales of the South Pacific'' treats the question of racism, it does not give it the central place that it takes in the musical. Andrea Most, writing on the \"politics of race\" in ''South Pacific'', suggests that in the late 1940s, American liberals, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, turned to the fight for racial equality as a practical means of advancing their progressive views without risking being deemed communists.<ref>Most, pp. 308\u2013309</ref> [[Trevor Nunn]], director of the 2001 West End production, notes the importance of the fact that Nellie, a southerner, ends the play about to be the mother in an interracial family: \"It's being performed in America in 1949. That's the resonance.\"<ref name = \"b8\" />\n\nFrom the early drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made the issue of racial prejudice central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront the question of the Americans' racism.<ref name = \"racial\" /> As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, \"if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up\".<ref name = \"b3\" /> In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal.  Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.<ref name = \"racial\">Lovensheimer, pp. 97\u201398</ref>\n\n[[File:Happy Talk.jpg|thumb|alt=A crouching man in military uniform watches a young woman and a middle-aged one make hand gestures to him|right|\"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\": Cable ([[William Tabbert]]) watches Liat ([[Betta St. John]]) and Bloody Mary ([[Juanita Hall|Hall]]).]]\nAt the heart of this scene is Cable's song \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism.  Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most controversial element of the show.<ref>Most, p. 307</ref> Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein.  When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, \"That's what the show is about!\"<ref>Michener 1992, pp. 294\u2013295</ref> Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less \"briskly\", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered.<ref name=\"M162\">Maslon, p. 162</ref> Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; [[Wolcott Gibbs]] wrote of \"something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing\" while [[John Mason Brown]] opined that he was \"somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 85\u201386</ref> After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\".  Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the [[Library of Congress]], the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote \"What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'&nbsp;... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough.\"<ref name=\"L104\">Lovensheimer, p. 104</ref> Nevertheless, another wrote, \"I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding\".<ref name = \"L104\" />\n\nWhen the tour of the show reached a racially segregated theatre in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], Rodgers and Hammerstein threatened to cancel the performances there unless seating was integrated, which it was.<ref name = \"M163\" /> In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\".  Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though ''South Pacific'' was a fine piece of entertainment, that song \"contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow\", and explained, \"Intermarriage produces half-breeds.  And half-breeds are not conducive to the higher type of society.&nbsp;... In the South, we have pure blood lines and we intend to keep it that way.\"  They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded that he did not think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow.<ref name =\"M163\">Maslon, p. 163</ref><ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/03/01/93397165.pdf Georgia legislators score ''South Pacific''; see Red philosophy in song against bias]\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 1, 1953, accessed March 12, 2013 (subscription required)</ref> In part because of the song, touring companies of ''South Pacific'' had difficulty getting bookings in the Deep South.<ref>Hischak, p. 324</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinza with kids.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pinza, in a white suit, walks along holding a mixed-race boy, about 7 or 8 years old, while listening to a slightly older girl who walks next to him.|upright|Emile (Pinza) with his children.]]\nIn the final scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children.  In so doing, Nellie fails to live up to the American ideal that \"all men are created equal\", which Emile had earlier affirmed.<ref name = \"b8\">Butler, p. 8</ref> This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, initially unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word \"Polynesian\", responds with \"colored\".  This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production.  As [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, \"it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype&nbsp;\u2013 she's lovable&nbsp;... But how can we love a racist?\"<ref name = \"love\">Lovensheimer, pp. 90\u201392</ref> Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor&nbsp;\u2013 Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, as she puts it, \"French planters stingy bastards!\"<ref>Most, pp. 330\u2013331</ref>\n\n=== Sex and gender roles ===\nNellie Forbush, in her journey from Little Rock, Arkansas, to serving as a Navy nurse and on to the domesticity of the final scene of ''South Pacific'', parallels the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work&nbsp;\u2013 that character had a [[4-F (US Military)|4-F]] boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 108\u2013109</ref><ref>Michener 1967, p. 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Billis and Nellie laundry.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A military scene.

Other enlisted men, many bare-chested, watch.|Nellie (Martin) praises the laundry skills of Billis (McCormick) as his friends look on.]]\nThe male characters in ''South Pacific'' are intended to appear conventionally masculine.  In the aftermath of World War II, the masculinity of the American soldier was beyond public question.  Cable's virility with Liat is made evident to the audience.  Although Billis operates a laundry \u2013 Nellie particularly praises his pleats \u2013 and appears in a grass skirt in the \"Thanksgiving Follies\", these acts are consistent with his desire for money and are clearly intended to be comic.  His interest in the young women on Bali H'ai establishes his masculinity.  Lovensheimer writes that Billis is more defined by class than by sexuality, evidenced by the Seabee's assumption, on learning that Cable went to college in New Jersey, that it was [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] (the state's flagship public university), rather than [[Ivy League]] Princeton, and by his delight on learning that the rescue operation for him had cost $600,000 when his uncle had told him he would never be worth a dime.<ref>Rodgers and Hammerstein, pp. 290, 353</ref><ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 109\u2013111, 142\u2013143</ref>\n\nMeryle Secrest, in her biography of Rodgers, theorizes that ''South Pacific'' marks a transition for the pair \"between heroes and heroines who are more or less evenly matched in age and stories about powerful older men and the younger women who are attracted to them\".<ref>Secrest, p. 294</ref> Lovensheimer points out that this pattern only holds for two of their five subsequent musicals, ''The King and I'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', and in the former, the love between Anna and the King is not expressed in words.  He believes a different transition took place: that their plots, beginning with  ''South Pacific'', involve a woman needing to enter and accept her love interest's world to be successful and accepted herself.  He notes that both ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Carousel'' involve a man entering his wife's world, Curly in ''Oklahoma!'' about to become a farmer with expectations of success, whereas Billy Bigelow in ''Carousel'' fails to find work after leaving his place as a barker.  Lovensheimer deems ''Allegro'' to be a transition, where the attempts of the lead female character to alter her husband Joe's world to suit her ambition lead to the breakup of their marriage.  He argues that the nurse Emily, who goes with Joe in his return to the small town where he was happy, is a forerunner of Nellie, uprooting her life in Chicago for Joe.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\nSecrest notes that much is overlooked in the rush to have love conquer all in ''South Pacific'', \"questions of the long-term survival of a marriage between a sophisticate who read Proust at bedtime and a girl who liked Dinah Shore and did not read anything were raised by Nellie Forbush only to be brushed aside.  As for the interracial complexities of raising two Polynesian children, all such issues were subsumed in the general euphoria of true love.\"<ref>Secrest, p. 293</ref>  Lovensheimer too wonders how Nellie will fare as the second Madame de Becque, \"little Nellie Forbush from Arkansas ends up in a tropical paradise, far from her previous world, with a husband, a servant, and two children who speak a language she does not understand\".<ref>Lovensheimer, p. 115</ref>\n\n=== Cultural effect ===\n[[File:Wash man from hair.jpg|thumb|alt=Martin, wearing a swimsuit, stands in an improvised shower stall as water pours down on her.|right|[[Mary Martin]] washed her hair onstage eight times a week.]]\nA mammoth hit, ''South Pacific'' sparked huge media and public attention.  ''South Pacific'' was one of the first shows for which a variety of souvenirs were available: fans could buy ''South Pacific'' neckties, or for women, lipstick and scarves.  Fake ticket stubs could be purchased for use as status symbols.<ref name=\"M153\" /> There were ''South Pacific'' music boxes, dolls, fashion accessories, and even hairbrushes for use after washing men from hair.<ref>Hammerstein, p. 200</ref> Martin's on-stage shower prompted an immediate fashion craze for short hair that could be managed through once-a-day washing at home, rather than in a beauty salon, and for the products which would allow for such care.<ref>Beidler, pp. 116\u2013117</ref> The songs of ''South Pacific'' could be heard on the radio, and they were popular among dance bands and in piano lounges.<ref name=\"M153\" /> Mordden comments that ''South Pacific'' contained nothing but hit songs; Rodgers and Hammerstein's other successful works always included at least one song which did not become popular.<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 120</ref>\n\nThe cast album, recorded ten days after the show's opening, was an immediate hit.  Released by [[Columbia Records]], it spent 69 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard and a total of 400 weeks on the charts, becoming the best-selling record of the 1940s.<ref name=\"M153\" /> It was one of the early [[LP record]]s, with a turntable speed of 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm, and helped to popularize that technology&nbsp;\u2013 previously, show albums and operas had been issued on sets of 78&nbsp;rpm records, with high prices and much less music on a single disc.  In the years to come, the LP would become the medium of choice for the \"longhair\" music niche of show, opera and classical performances.<ref>Beidler, p. 117</ref>\n\nAn indirect effect of the success of the show was the career of James Michener.  His one percent of the show as author of the source material, plus the income from a share which the duo allowed him to buy on credit, made him financially independent and allowed him to quit his job as an editor at Macmillan and to become a full-time writer.<ref>Michener 1992, p. 294</ref><ref>May, pp. 112\u2013125</ref> Over the next five decades, his lengthy, detailed novels centering on different places would dominate the bestseller lists.<ref>May, pp. ix\u2013x</ref>\n\n== Music and recordings ==\n\n=== Musical treatment ===\nThe role of Nellie Forbush was the first time with Hammerstein that Rodgers made the leading female role a [[belt (music)|belter]], rather than a [[lyric soprano]] like Laurey in ''Oklahoma!'' and Julie in ''Carousel''.{{#tag:ref|The female lead in ''Allegro'', Jenny, is principally a dancing role; the performer playing her does not sing by herself.|group= n}} According to Mordden, \"Nellie was something new in R&H, carrying a goodly share of the score on a 'Broadway' voice\".<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 108</ref>\n\nNellie does not sing together with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin that she would not have to compete vocally with Pinza,{{#tag:ref|They do sing together at the start of the final scene of Act I, but their characters are supposed to have been drinking.|group= n}} but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music.  A [[tetrachord]], heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to \"''Dites-Moi''&nbsp;\", the show's first song.  Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as \"Twin Soliloquies\") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of \"Some Enchanted Evening\".  Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie is trying to say with her Act II line \"We're the same sort of people fundamentally&nbsp;\u2013 you and me\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 124\u2013132</ref>\n\nOriginally, \"Twin Soliloquies\" came to an end shortly after the vocal part finishes.  Logan found this unsatisfying and worked with Trude Rittmann to find a better ending to the song.  This piece of music, dubbed \"Unspoken Thoughts\", continues the music as Nellie and Emile sip brandy together, and is called by Lovensheimer \"the one truly operatic moment of the score\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> \"This Nearly Was Mine\" is a big bass solo for Emile in waltz time, deemed by Rodgers biographer William G. Hyland as \"one of his finest efforts\".<ref name =\"WGH183\">Hyland, p. 183</ref> Only five notes are used in the first four bars, a phrase which is then repeated with a slight variation in the following four bars.  The song ends an octave higher than where it began, making it perfect for Pinza's voice.<ref name = \"WGH183\" />\n\nTwo songs, \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\" and \"Honey Bun\" are intended to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s.  In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a [[big band]] arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of [[swing music|swing]].  The sections beginning \"If the man don't understand you\" and \"If you laugh at different comics\" have a [[blues]] style.  Lovensheimer deems the song \"Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 133\u2013135</ref> Mordden suggests that \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\" with its \"take no prisoners bounce\", might well be the center of the score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clich\u00e9s, many of which, such as \"corny as Kansas in August\" Hammerstein made up, and \"sure enough, over the years they have become clich\u00e9s\".<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 121</ref>\n\n=== Recordings ===\n[[File:South pacific bway 1949.jpg|thumb|Cover of original cast album]]\n[[Columbia Records]] recorded the overture and most of the songs from the original production in 1949, using members of the cast including [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]]. Drawing from the original [[Acetate disc|lacquer disc]] masters, Columbia released the album in both the new LP format and on 78-rpm discs.  Soon after Sony acquired Columbia in 1988, a CD was released from the previously unused magnetic tape recording from the same 1949 sessions in New York City. The CD includes the bonus tracks \"Loneliness of Evening\" (recorded in 1949 by Mary Martin), \"My Girl Back Home\" (Martin), \"Bali Ha'i\" (Pinza) and Symphonic Scenario for Concert Orchestra (original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett).

[[Joshua Logan]] directed the film, which starred [[Rossano Brazzi]], [[Mitzi Gaynor]], [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]], [[Ray Walston]] and [[Juanita Hall]]; all of their singing voices except Gaynor's and Walston's were dubbed. [[Thurl Ravenscroft]], later television's [[Tony the Tiger]], sang the [[basso profundo]] notes in \"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\". The film opened with Cable's flight to the island in a [[PBY]], followed by the Seabees' beach scene, and added Billis' rescue and scenes from the mission to spy on the Japanese.  The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound]]. It was also nominated for the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Scoring of a Musical Picture]] (Alfred Newman and Ken Darby), and the 65&nbsp;mm [[Todd-AO]] cinematography by [[Leon Shamroy]] was also nominated.<!-- The film has its own article, so we don't need to include more production details about it here. --> The film was widely criticized for its use of color to indicate mood, with actors changing color as they began to sing. The film includes the song \"My Girl Back Home\", sung by Cable, which was cut from the stage musical.  The movie was the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. of the 1950s; its UK revenues were the highest ever, a record it kept until ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' in 1963.<ref name = \"HFilms\">Hischak, pp. 264\u2013265, 339</ref><ref>Maslon, pp. 170, 173</ref> Although reviewers have criticized the film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] stated that it was \"almost impossible to make a bad movie out of it&nbsp;\u2013 but the moviemakers appear to have tried\"&nbsp;\u2013 it has added success on television, videotape and DVD to its box office laurels.<ref name = \"HFilms\" />\n\nA [[South Pacific (2001 film)|made-for-television film]], directed by [[Richard Pearce (director)|Richard Pearce]], was produced and televised in 2001, starring [[Glenn Close]] as Nellie, [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] as Cable and [[Rade Sherbedgia]] as Emile. This version changed the order of the musical's songs (the film opens with \"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\") and omits \"Happy Talk\".  \"My Girl Back Home\" was filmed but not included in the broadcast due to time constraints; it was restored for the DVD, issued in 2001.
