The first proven inhabitants were the peaceful [[Arawak people|Arawak]]s, believed to have come from northern [[South America]] around 200-400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of the Arawaks' well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that these first inhabitants called the island ''Iouanalao'', which meant 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=\"AllAbout\">[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>\n\nThe more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=\"AllAbout\"/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Io\u00fcanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").<ref name=\"Harmsen\">{{cite book|last1=Harmsen|first1=Jolien|last2=Ellis|first2=Guy|last3=Devaux|first3=Robert|title=A History of St Lucia|date=2014|publisher=Lighthouse Road|location=Vieux Fort|isbn=9789769534001|page=10}}</ref>  This is the origin of the name of the [[Hewanorra International Airport]] in [[Vieux Fort]].  The Caribs had a complex society, with hereditary kings and [[shamans]].  Their war canoes could hold more than 100 men and were fast enough to catch a sailing ship.  They were later feared by the invading [[Europe]]ans for their ferocity in battle.\n\n==16th century==\n[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his [[Christopher Columbus#Fourth voyage|fourth voyage]] in 1502, since he made landfall on Martinique, yet he does not mention the island in his log.  [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it ''El Falcon'', and another island to the south ''Las Agujas''.  A Spanish [[Cedula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a [[globe]] in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] made in 1520, shows the island as ''Sancta Lucia''.   A 1529 Spanish map shows ''S.

By 26 Sept. 1605, only 19 survived, after continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so they fled the island.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|16\u201321}}\n\nEnglish documents claim colonists from Bermuda settled the island in 1635, while a French letter of patent claims settlement on 8 March 1635 by a Monsieur [[Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc]], who was succeeded by his nephew Monsieur du Parquet.  [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Thomas Warner]] sent Capt. Judlee with 300-400 Englishmen to establish a settlement at Praslin Bay but they were attacked over three weeks by Caribs, until the few remaining fled on 12 Oct. 1640.  King [[Louis XIII of France]] ceded the island to the [[French West India Company]] in 1642.  In 1650, Capt. du Parquet and Monsieur Houel bought the island, sending de Rousselan and 40 Frenchmen to establish a fort on the La Toc or Tapion headland.  The French drove off an attempted English invasion in 1659, but allowed the Dutch to build a redoubt near Vieux Fort Bay in 1654.  On 6 April 1663, the Caribs sold St. Lucia to [[Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham]], English governor of the Caribbean.  He invaded the island with 1100 Englishmen and 600 Amerindians in 5 ships-of-war and 17 [[pirogue]]s forcing the 14 French defenders to flee.\nHowever, the English colony succumbed to disease.  The French took over again, but the English came back in June 1664 and retained possession until 20 Oct. 1665 when diplomacy gave the island back to the French.  The English invaded again in 1665, but disease, famine and the Caribs forced their fleeing in Jan. 1666.  The [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]] gave control of the island back to the French.  The English raided the island in 1686, but relinquished all claims in a 1687 treaty and the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]].<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|22\u201327}}<ref name=\"Statesmen\">[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" align=\"right\"\n|+Political control from 1674 to 1814<ref name=\"Statesmen\"/>\n|-\n!

He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)}}</ref>\n\nThe 1730 census showed 463 occupants of the island, which included just 125 whites, 37 Caribs, 175 slaves, and the rest free blacks or mixed race.  The French took control of the island in 1744, and by 1745, the island had a population of 3455, including 2573 slaves.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|31,36}}\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]] Britain occupied Saint Lucia in 1762, but gave the island back at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] on 10 February 1763.  Britain occupied the island again in 1778 after the [[Battle of St. Lucia|Grand Battle of Cul de Sac]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  British Admiral [[George Rodney]] then built [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Fort Rodney]] from 1779 to 1782.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|36,47\u201350}}\n\nBy 1779, the island's population had increased to 19,230, which included 16,003 slaves working 44 sugar plantations.  Yet, the [[Great Hurricane of 1780]]  killed about 800.  By the time the island was restored to French rule in 1784, as a consequence of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]], 300 plantations had been abandoned and some thousand [[maroon (people)|maroons]] lived in the interior.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|40,49\u201350}}\n \n[[File:1758 Bellin Map of Saint Lucia (Sainte Lucie), West Indies - Geographicus - SaintLucia-bellin-1758.jpg|thumb|left|A 1758 map of Saint Lucia]]\n\nIn Jan. 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''Commissaries'' to St. Lucia to spread the revolution philosophy.   By August, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In Dec. 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the poor whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''.  On 1 Feb. 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]]  took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 Feb. 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''.  Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Francaise dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the '''First Brigand War'''.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|60\u201365}}\n\nA short time later, the British invaded in response to the concerns of the wealthy plantation owners, who wanted to keep sugar production going. On 21 February 1795, a group of rebels, led by [[Victor Hugues]], defeated a battalion of British troops. For the next four months, a group of recently freed slaves known as the Brigands forced out not only the British army, but every white slave-owner from the island (coloured slave owners were left alone, as in [[Haiti]]).  The English were eventually defeated on June 19, and fled from the island. The Royalist planters fled with them, leaving the remaining Saint Lucians to enjoy \u201cl\u2019Ann\u00e9e de la Libert\u00e9\u201d, \u201ca year of freedom from slavery\u2026\u201d. Gaspard Goyrand, a Frenchman who was Saint Lucia's Commissary later became Governor of Saint Lucia, and proclaimed the abolition of slavery. Goyrand brought the aristocratic planters to trial. Several lost their heads on the guillotine, which had been brought to Saint Lucia with the troops. He then proceeded to re-organize the island.<ref name=\"soufrierefoundation.org\">http://soufrierefoundation.org/about-soufriere/history</ref>\n\nThe British continued to harbor hopes of recapturing the island and in April 1796 Sir Ralph Abercrombie and his troops attempted to do so.  [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict, and after approximately one month of bitter fighting the French surrendered at Morne Fortune on 25 May. General Moore was elevated to the position of Governor of Saint Lucia by Abercrombie and was left with 5,000 troops to complete the task of subduing the entire island.<ref name=\"soufrierefoundation.org\"/>\n\nBritish Brig. Gen. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John Moore]] was appointed Military Governor on 25 May 1796, and engaged in the '''Second Brigand War'''.  Some ''Brigands'' began to surrender in 1797, when promised they would not be returned to slavery.  Final freedom and the end to hostilities came with [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Emancipation in 1838]].<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|74\u201386}}<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>\n\n==19th century==\nThe 1802 [[Treaty of Amiens]] restored the island to French control, and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] reinstated slavery.  The British regained the island in June 1803, when Commodore [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]] defeated French Governor Brig. Gen. [[Antoine Nogu\u00e8s]].  The island was officially ceded to Britain in 1814.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|113}}\n\nAlso in 1838, Saint Lucia was incorporated into the British [[Windward Islands]] administration, headquartered in Barbados. This lasted until 1885, when the capital was moved to [[Grenada]].\n\n==20th century to 21st century==\n[[File:Timbre SteLucie E2 couronnement 1953.jpg|thumb|140px|1953 stamp with portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]\nDuring the [[Battle of the Caribbean]], a German [[U-boat]] attacked and sank two British ships in [[Castries]] harbor on 9 March 1942.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|275}}<ref name=\"Hubbard\">{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=A History of St. Kitts|date=2002|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=9780333747605|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/117 117]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/117}}</ref>\n\nIncreasing self-government has marked St Lucia's 20th-century history. A 1924 constitution gave the island its first form of representative government, with a minority of elected members in the previously all-nominated legislative council. Universal adult [[suffrage]] was introduced in 1951, and elected members became a majority of the council. Ministerial government was introduced in 1956, and in 1958 St. Lucia joined the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]], a semi-autonomous dependency of the United Kingdom. <!-- St. Lucia served as head of the newly formed federation for the next eighteen years. --> When the federation collapsed in 1962, following [[Jamaica]]'s withdrawal, a smaller federation was briefly attempted. After the second failure, the United Kingdom and the six windward and leeward islands\u2014Grenada, [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], [[Dominica]], [[Antigua]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and [[Anguilla]], and St. Lucia\u2014developed a novel form of cooperation called associated statehood.\n\nBy 1957, bananas exceed sugar as the major export crop.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|303}}\n\nAs an associated state of the United Kingdom from 1967 to 1979, St. Lucia had full responsibility for internal self-government but left its external affairs and defense responsibilities to the United Kingdom. This interim arrangement ended on February 22, 1979, when St. Lucia achieved full independence. St. Lucia continues to recognize Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as titular head of state and is an active member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The island continues to cooperate with its neighbors through the Caribbean community and common market ([[CARICOM]]), the East Caribbean Common Market (ECCM), and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of colonial governors of Saint Lucia]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia]]\n*[[Politics of Saint Lucia]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book | author=Philpott, Don | title=St Lucia | location=Derbyshire | publisher=Landmark Publishing Ltd | year=1999 | isbn=1-901522-28-8 }}\n* {{cite book | author=Higgins, Chris | title=St. Lucia | location=Montreal | publisher=Ulysses Travel Guides| year=2001 | isbn=2-89464-396-9}}\n* {{cite web | title=History of Saint Lucia | url=http://www.un.int/stlucia/consularservices/history.htm | accessdate=September 23, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050802084319/http://www.un.int/stlucia/consularservices/history.htm | archive-date=August 2, 2005 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |publisher = At the presses of S.

He then proceeded to re-organize the island.<ref name=\"soufrierefoundation.org\">http://soufrierefoundation.org/about-soufriere/history</ref>\n\nThe British continued to harbor hopes of recapturing the island and in April 1796 Sir Ralph Abercrombie and his troops attempted to do so.  [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict, and after approximately one month of bitter fighting the French surrendered at Morne Fortune on 25 May. General Moore was elevated to the position of Governor of Saint Lucia by Abercrombie and was left with 5,000 troops to complete the task of subduing the entire island.<ref name=\"soufrierefoundation.org\"/>\n\nBritish Brig. Gen. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John Moore]] was appointed Military Governor on 25 May 1796, and engaged in the '''Second Brigand War'''.  Some ''Brigands'' began to surrender in 1797, when promised they would not be returned to slavery.

A 1924 constitution gave the island its first form of representative government, with a minority of elected members in the previously all-nominated legislative council. Universal adult [[suffrage]] was introduced in 1951, and elected members became a majority of the council. Ministerial government was introduced in 1956, and in 1958 St. Lucia joined the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]], a semi-autonomous dependency of the United Kingdom. <!-- St. Lucia served as head of the newly formed federation for the next eighteen years. --> When the federation collapsed in 1962, following [[Jamaica]]'s withdrawal, a smaller federation was briefly attempted. After the second failure, the United Kingdom and the six windward and leeward islands\u2014Grenada, [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], [[Dominica]], [[Antigua]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and [[Anguilla]], and St. Lucia\u2014developed a novel form of cooperation called associated statehood.\n\nBy 1957, bananas exceed sugar as the major export crop.<ref name=\"Harmsen\"/>{{rp|303}}\n\nAs an associated state of the United Kingdom from 1967 to 1979, St. Lucia had full responsibility for internal self-government but left its external affairs and defense responsibilities to the United Kingdom. This interim arrangement ended on February 22, 1979, when St. Lucia achieved full independence. St. Lucia continues to recognize Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as titular head of state and is an active member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The island continues to cooperate with its neighbors through the Caribbean community and common market ([[CARICOM]]), the East Caribbean Common Market (ECCM), and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of colonial governors of Saint Lucia]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia]]\n*[[Politics of Saint Lucia]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book | author=Philpott, Don | title=St Lucia | location=Derbyshire | publisher=Landmark Publishing Ltd | year=1999 | isbn=1-901522-28-8 }}\n* {{cite book | author=Higgins, Chris | title=St. Lucia | location=Montreal | publisher=Ulysses Travel Guides| year=2001 | isbn=2-89464-396-9}}\n* {{cite web | title=History of Saint Lucia | url=http://www.un.int/stlucia/consularservices/history.htm | accessdate=September 23, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050802084319/http://www.un.int/stlucia/consularservices/history.htm | archive-date=August 2, 2005 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |publisher = At the presses of S.

{"title_page": "History of St. Louis", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{History of St. Louis}}\nThe '''history of St. Louis, Missouri''' began with the settlement of the [[St. Louis]] area by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Mound builder (people)|mound builders]] who lived as part of the [[Mississippian culture]] from the 9th century to the 15th century, followed by other migrating tribal groups. Starting in the late 17th century, French explorers arrived. Spain took over in 1763 and a trading company led by [[Pierre Laclede]] and [[Auguste Chouteau]] established the settlement of St. Louis in February 1764. It attracted French settlers leaving Illinois when Britain took control east of the Mississippi. The city grew in population due to its location as a [[trading post]] on the [[Mississippi River]], as the western fur trade was lucrative. The city played a small role in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and became part of the U.S. through the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803.\n\nWith its connection through the Ohio River to the east, the Mississippi to the south and north, and the Missouri to the west, St. Louis was ideally located to become the main base of interregional trade. In the 1840s, it became a destination for massive immigration by Irish and Germans. Some native-born Americans reacted with fear to the newcomers, adopting [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] sentiments. Missouri was a slave state, but the city's proximity to [[Slave and free states|free state]]s caused it to become a center for the filing of [[freedom suits]]. Many slaves gained freedom through such suits in the antebellum years. But, by the 1850s and the [[Dred Scott case]], interpretations had changed and the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled against him. It also ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, contributing to the tensions causing the [[origins of the American Civil War|American Civil War]]. During the War, St. Louis had a small skirmish on its outskirts, but was held under [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] control.\n\nAfter the war, the city expanded its railroad connections and industrial activity. It suffered a corresponding rise in [[pollution]] of the river and waterfront. During the early 1870s, the [[Eads Bridge]] was constructed over the Mississippi River, and the city established several large parks, including [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]]. Due to local political and economic disputes, the city separated from [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] in 1876 and became an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]]. Its limited geographic area has inhibited its success in the 20th and 21st centuries because of the small tax base. During the late 19th century, St. Louis became home to two [[Major League Baseball]] teams. [[Ragtime]] and [[blues]] music flourished in the city, with African Americans making major contributions also in [[jazz]].\n\nThe city hosted the [[1904 World's Fair]] and the [[1904 Summer Olympics]], attracting millions of visitors. Part of the infrastructure for the fair was the basis for major city institutions in Forest Park. In the early part of the century, many African Americans migrated from the South to the city for industrial jobs, as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. St. Louis did not escape the [[Great Depression]] and its high unemployment. During World War II the city hosted war industries that employed thousands of workers.\n\nAfter the war, federal highway subsidies and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this [[suburbanization]] significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made efforts to create new attractions, such as the [[Gateway Arch]], which construction became a focus of the [[civil rights movement]] to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new [[public housing]] projects such as [[Pruitt&ndash;Igoe]]. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and [[gentrification]] have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly [[downtown St. Louis|downtown]]. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the [[2010 U.S. Census]].\n\n==Exploration and Louisiana before 1762==\n{{main article|History of St. Louis, Missouri before 1762}}\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the British and French settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]] (1754 to 1763)]]\nThe earliest settlements in the middle [[Mississippi Valley]] were built in the 10th century by the people of the [[Mississippian culture]], who constructed more than two dozen [[platform mounds]] within the area of the future European-American city.<ref name=\"primm lion 1\">Primm (1998), 1.</ref><ref name=\"peregrine guide xx\">Peregrine (1996), xx.</ref> These were related to the center of the culture at the very large complex of [[Cahokia Mounds]], on the east side of the Mississippi River.

However, inequality remained rampant in St. Louis schools.<ref name=\"primm lion 319\">Primm (1998), 317-19.</ref>\n\nRadical historians in the 1960s, steeped in the anti-bureaucratic ethos of the New Left, deplored the emergence of bureaucratic school systems. They argue its purpose was to suppress the upward aspirations of the working class.<ref>Diane Ravitch, ''The Revisionists Revised: A Critique of the Radical Attack on the Schools'' (1978)  pp 32-41</ref>   However, other historians have emphasized the necessity of building non-politicized standardized systems. The reforms in St. Louis, according to historian Selwyn Troen, were. \"born of necessity as educators first confronted the problems of managing a rapidly expanding and increasingly complex institutions.\" Troen found that the bureaucratic solution remove schools from the bitterness and spite of ward politics.  Troen argues:\n: In the space of only a generation, public education had left behind a highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had replaced it with a largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society. In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a doubling of the period of schooling, and a broader concern for the welfare of urban youth.<ref>Selwyn K. Troen,  ''The Public and the Schools: Shaping the St. Louis System 1838\u20131920'' (1975) pp 151, 224-26, quoted in Ravitch, ''The Revisionists Revised'', pp 55-56</ref>\n\n===Separation from St. Louis County===\n[[File:St Louis Map 1885.jpg|thumb|Map of St Louis in 1885]]\nWhen Missouri became a state in 1821, St. Louis County was created from the boundaries of the former St. Louis subdistrict of the Missouri Territory; St. Louis city existed within the county but was not coterminous with it. Starting in the 1850s, rural county voters began to exert political influence over questions of taxation in the St. Louis County court.<ref name=\"primm lion 297\"/> In 1867, the county court was given power to assess and collect property tax revenue from St. Louis city property, providing a financial boon to the county government while depriving city government of revenues. After this power transfer, St. Louisans in the city began to favor one of three options: greater representation on the county court via [[charter]] changes, [[Consolidated city&ndash;county|city&ndash;county consolidation]], or [[urban secession]] to form an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]].<ref name=\"primm lion 299\">Primm (1998), 299.</ref>\n\nAt a Missouri state constitutional convention in 1875, delegates from the region agreed on a separation plan.<ref name=\"primm lion 300\">Primm (1998), 300.</ref> A Board of [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]]ers from St. Louis county and city reorganized boundaries and proposed a final plan of separation in mid-1876.<ref name=\"primm lion 305\">Primm (1998), 305.</ref> The new city charter also tripled the size of the city to include the new rural parks (such as Forest Park) and the useful riverfront from the Missouri&ndash;Mississippi confluence to the mouth of the [[River Des Peres]].<ref name=\"arenson heart 210\">Arenson (2011), 210.</ref> After a fraudulent election initially showed a rejection of the plan, a recount in December 1876 showed voters had approved the separation.<ref name=\"arenson heart 212\">Arenson (2011), 212.</ref>\n\n===Industrial and commercial growth===\nIn 1880, the leading industries of St. Louis included [[brewing]], [[flour mill]]ing, [[slaughterhouse|slaughtering]], [[paper making]], machining, and [[tobacco]] processing.<ref name=\"hurley nui 148\">Hurley (1997), 148.</ref> Other industries including the manufacture of paint, bricks, and iron.<ref name=\"hurley nui 148\"/> During the 1880s, the city grew in population by 29 percent, from 350,518 to 451,770, making it the country's fourth largest city; it also ranked fourth as measured by value of its manufactured products, and more than 6,148 factories existed in 1890. However, during the 1890s, manufacturing growth slowed dramatically.<ref name=\"primm lion 327\">Primm (1998), 327.</ref> The [[Panic of 1893]] and subsequent depression and the overproduction of [[grain]] made St. Louis mills considerably less productive and valuable.

With  the breakup of the ring in May 1875, more than 100 conspirators were charged with fraud, including Grant's private secretary, [[Orville E. Babcock]].

using data reported to the FBI in 2009.<ref name=\"cqpress\">CQ Press (2010).</ref> Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved.<ref name=\"usmayors\">U.S. Conference of Mayors (November 21, 2010).</ref> The FBI cautioned against using this data as a form of ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime.<ref name=\"fbicaution\">FBI (2009).</ref> From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].<ref name=\"cdc\">CDC (May 13, 2011).</ref> The rate of [[firearm death]]s for the [[metropolitan statistical area]] was one-fifth of the city rate.<ref name=\"cdc\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catholic Church in French Louisiana]]\n* [[St. Louis tornado history]]\n*

Starting in the late 17th century, French explorers arrived. Spain took over in 1763 and a trading company led by [[Pierre Laclede]] and [[Auguste Chouteau]] established the settlement of St. Louis in February 1764. It attracted French settlers leaving Illinois when Britain took control east of the Mississippi. The city grew in population due to its location as a [[trading post]] on the [[Mississippi River]], as the western fur trade was lucrative. The city played a small role in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and became part of the U.S. through the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803.\n\nWith its connection through the Ohio River to the east, the Mississippi to the south and north, and the Missouri to the west, St. Louis was ideally located to become the main base of interregional trade. In the 1840s, it became a destination for massive immigration by Irish and Germans. Some native-born Americans reacted with fear to the newcomers, adopting [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] sentiments. Missouri was a slave state, but the city's proximity to [[Slave and free states|free state]]s caused it to become a center for the filing of [[freedom suits]]. Many slaves gained freedom through such suits in the antebellum years. But, by the 1850s and the [[Dred Scott case]], interpretations had changed and the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled against him. It also ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, contributing to the tensions causing the [[origins of the American Civil War|American Civil War]]. During the War, St. Louis had a small skirmish on its outskirts, but was held under [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] control.\n\nAfter the war, the city expanded its railroad connections and industrial activity. It suffered a corresponding rise in [[pollution]] of the river and waterfront. During the early 1870s, the [[Eads Bridge]] was constructed over the Mississippi River, and the city established several large parks, including [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]]. Due to local political and economic disputes, the city separated from [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] in 1876 and became an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]]. Its limited geographic area has inhibited its success in the 20th and 21st centuries because of the small tax base. During the late 19th century, St. Louis became home to two [[Major League Baseball]] teams. [[Ragtime]] and [[blues]] music flourished in the city, with African Americans making major contributions also in [[jazz]].\n\nThe city hosted the [[1904 World's Fair]] and the [[1904 Summer Olympics]], attracting millions of visitors. Part of the infrastructure for the fair was the basis for major city institutions in Forest Park. In the early part of the century, many African Americans migrated from the South to the city for industrial jobs, as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. St. Louis did not escape the [[Great Depression]] and its high unemployment. During World War II the city hosted war industries that employed thousands of workers.\n\nAfter the war, federal highway subsidies and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this [[suburbanization]] significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made efforts to create new attractions, such as the [[Gateway Arch]], which construction became a focus of the [[civil rights movement]] to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new [[public housing]] projects such as [[Pruitt&ndash;Igoe]]. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and [[gentrification]] have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly [[downtown St. Louis|downtown]]. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the [[2010 U.S. Census]].\n\n==Exploration and Louisiana before 1762==\n{{main article|History of St. Louis, Missouri before 1762}}\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the British and French settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]] (1754 to 1763)]]\nThe earliest settlements in the middle [[Mississippi Valley]] were built in the 10th century by the people of the [[Mississippian culture]], who constructed more than two dozen [[platform mounds]] within the area of the future European-American city.<ref name=\"primm lion 1\">Primm (1998), 1.</ref><ref name=\"peregrine guide xx\">Peregrine (1996), xx.</ref> These were related to the center of the culture at the very large complex of [[Cahokia Mounds]], on the east side of the Mississippi River.

Troen argues:\n: In the space of only a generation, public education had left behind a highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had replaced it with a largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society. In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a doubling of the period of schooling, and a broader concern for the welfare of urban youth.<ref>Selwyn K.

After this power transfer, St. Louisans in the city began to favor one of three options: greater representation on the county court via [[charter]] changes, [[Consolidated city&ndash;county|city&ndash;county consolidation]], or [[urban secession]] to form an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]].<ref name=\"primm lion 299\">Primm (1998), 299.</ref>\n\nAt a Missouri state constitutional convention in 1875, delegates from the region agreed on a separation plan.<ref name=\"primm lion 300\">Primm (1998), 300.</ref> A Board of [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]]ers from St. Louis county and city reorganized boundaries and proposed a final plan of separation in mid-1876.<ref name=\"primm lion 305\">Primm (1998), 305.</ref> The new city charter also tripled the size of the city to include the new rural parks (such as Forest Park) and the useful riverfront from the Missouri&ndash;Mississippi confluence to the mouth of the [[River Des Peres]].<ref name=\"arenson heart 210\">Arenson (2011), 210.</ref> After a fraudulent election initially showed a rejection of the plan, a recount in December 1876 showed voters had approved the separation.<ref name=\"arenson heart 212\">Arenson (2011), 212.</ref>\n\n===Industrial and commercial growth===\nIn 1880, the leading industries of St. Louis included [[brewing]], [[flour mill]]ing, [[slaughterhouse|slaughtering]], [[paper making]], machining, and [[tobacco]] processing.<ref name=\"hurley nui 148\">Hurley (1997), 148.</ref> Other industries including the manufacture of paint, bricks, and iron.<ref name=\"hurley nui 148\"/> During the 1880s, the city grew in population by 29 percent, from 350,518 to 451,770, making it the country's fourth largest city; it also ranked fourth as measured by value of its manufactured products, and more than 6,148 factories existed in 1890.

This Illugi was tall, strong and good at any game, and he often played with Prince Sigurd. The two boys became close friends and swore to avenge one another. However, the king had an incompetent advisor named Bj\u00f6rn who was treacherous and cunning, but skilled in [[Sei\u00f0r|seid]] (witchcraft) and a great warrior who ably defended Denmark for the king. Bj\u00f6rn was jealous that Sigurd loved Illugi so much, so he slandered Illugi in front of the king and the prince, but Sigurd refused to believe him.\n\nOne summer, Sigurd, Bj\u00f6rn and Illugi went a Viking expedition to [[Scotland]] and [[Orkney]]. The pillaging was good, and in the autumn they steered home to Denmark. However, a great storm arose and they were driven away to large bay called Gandvik (usually identified as the White Sea). It was cold and Bj\u00f6rn asked Illugi to cross a [[fjord]] to fetch firewood. If he succeeded it would prove him a better advisor and he would get Bj\u00f6rn's ring. Illugi, however, declined and said that he would go for wood anyway.\n\nWhen he had crossed the fjord, he found a cave and soon encountered its inhabitant. It was a [[troll]] woman named Grid. She could not be called beautiful, in fact she was hideous. When Illugi said that he came searching for fire, she replied that he would get none unless he said three truthful words fast, and slept with her daughter. The daughter was stunning and Illugi immediately fell in love with her. The truthful words he chose to say were that Grid was hideous, the hall was beautiful and so was the daughter. Grid said that since he preferred the daughter to her, he could go to bed with the girl. Illugi was surprised that she was not enjoying the act, and soon he found out why because Grid grabbed him by the hair, put a knife to his throat and said that she would kill him for seducing the girl. However, when Illugi showed no signs of fear, she asked him to go back to bed remarking that she had never met anyone less afraid of dying. She had killed sixteen men with the knife and they had all been afraid. Grid said that he would have the girl whose name was Hildr, and then she told him her story.\n\nShe said that there was a king \u00c1li in [[Alfheim]] (modern [[Bohusl\u00e4n]]) whose queen was Alfrun. Their daughter's name was [[Signy]] and she was a very able girl. She was married to a king named Eric who died during an expedition in the west, leaving her with a very beautiful daughter named Hildr. Signy then returned to her father, but the mother soon died and the father remarried with a woman named [[Grimhild]]. This Grimhild was just as evil as she was beautiful, and so were her seven daughters that she had before marrying King \u00c1li. Rumours began to spread in the kingdom and when a man disappeared mysteriously this was attributed to Grimhild. Grimhild murdered the old king by poison, became the ruler and soon her tyranny had laid the whole kingdom waste. She banished Signy and her daughter Hildr from the kingdom, putting a curse on them so they had to live alone in a cave. All the men who saw Hildr would fall in love with her, but Signy would murder them, and every night seven sisters would maim and mutilate her. They would live in this condition until she found a man who was not afraid of dying. When Signy heard this she was speechless of sorrow, but Hildr cursed Grimhild. She said that a fire would burn between her legs, and she would be burning on one side and freezing on the other until their own curse had passed, then Grimhild would fall into the fire and die.\n\nGrid said that she was Signy and as Illugi had delivered them from the spell after eleven years, he would marry her daughter. Then the seven daughters of Grimhild arrived with short swords and attacked Grid, wounding her in the body and in her heart. Illugi threw himself into the fight to defend Grid, killed all seven of them and burned them in the fire. Grid gave Illugi gold and he returned to the ships with fire. The other men were glad to see him, but Bj\u00f6rn slandered Hildr and said that she was an evil troll. Sigurd told Bj\u00f6rn to keep quiet. Later at night Bj\u00f6rn disappeared and in the morning they found him dead hanging from the mast of the ship. This was how Grid punished him for calling her daughter a troll.\n\nSigurd then sailed to [[Finnmark]] and then back to [[Denmark]] with the ships laden with booty. Later, king Hringr died by illness and Sigurd inherited Denmark and [[Sk\u00e5ne]]. Signy came to Denmark to join them and was well received by Illugi and Hildr. Illugi told Sigurd everything about Signy and Sigurd decided to marry her. They had many children and lived long. But Illugi lived longest even though he and Hildr never had any children.

LaTour had a fortified settlement at the mouth of the Saint John River while d'Aulnay's headquarters was at Port Royal some 45 miles across the Bay of Fundy. In adjoining New England, the people supported LaTour's claim since he allowed them to fish and lumber in and along the Bay of Fundy without let or hindrance while d'Aulnay aggressively sought payment for that right. Word came to LaTour that d'Aulnay was concentrating men and materials for an attack on LaTour's fort and fur trading operation at the mouth of the Saint John River. LaTour went to Boston to ask John Winthrop, the governor of Massachusetts Bay colony, for help. Winthrop arranged for several merchants to advance loans unofficially to LaTour for his purchase of men and material to defend the Saint John River fort from d'Aulnay's attack.\nFor five months, the Governor of Acadia d'Aulnay who was stationed at Port Royal created a blockade of the river to defeat La Tour at his fort.{{sfnp|Dunn|2004|p=19}}  On 14 July 1643, La Tour arrived from Boston with four ships and a complement of 270 men to repossess Fort Sainte-Marie.

After a five-day battle, on 18 April, d' Aulnay offered quarter to all if Francoise-Marie were to surrender the fort. On that basis, knowing she was badly outnumbered, she capitulated and d\u2019Aulnay had captured La Tour's Fort Stainte-Marie. d'Aulnay then reneged on his pledge of safety for the defenders and treacherously hanged the La Tour garrison while Madame de la Tour was forced to watch with a rope around her neck. Three weeks later, while still in d'Aulnay's hands, she died.{{sfnp|Dunn|2004|p=20}}  With the death of his wife and the loss of his fort, La Tour did not return to Acadia for the next four years, until d'Aulnay had died (1650).{{sfnp|Griffiths|2005|p=61}} And when he did return, he married d\u2019Aulnay's widow to end the rivalry.

[[Irish diaspora|These immigrants]] changed the character of the city and surrounding region so that in addition to its Loyalist-Protestant heritage, there was a new Irish-Catholic culture as well.  Between 1845 and 1847, approximately 30,000 Irish arrived in Saint John, more than doubling the population of the city. During this period, Saint John was second only to [[Grosse Isle, Quebec]] as the busiest port of entry to Canada for Irish immigrants. The Roman Catholic population was largely impoverished and uneducated.\n\n[[Image:Partridge Island New Brunswick Canada.jpg|thumb|200px|Celtic Cross of Partridge Island]]\n\n[[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] has often been called \"Canada's Irish City\". In the years between 1815, when vast industrial changes began to disrupt the old life-styles in Europe, and Canadian Confederation in 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland flooded into Saint John. Those who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845\u20131852, huge waves of Famine refugees flooded these shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"Black 47,\" one of the worst years of the Famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]], the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour. However, thousands of Irish were living in New Brunswick prior to these events, mainly in Saint John.\n\nAfter the partitioning of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1784 New Brunswick was originally named New Ireland with the capital to be in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lib.unb.ca/winslow/partition.html|work=Winslow Papers |title=The Partition of Nova Scotia|publisher=University of New Brunswick|date=21 June 2005}}</ref>\n\nBy 1850, the Irish Catholic community constituted Saint John's largest ethnic group. In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 55 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born fathers. However, the city was split with tensions between Irish Catholics and Unionist Protestants. From the 1840s onward, Sectarian riots were rampant in the city with many poor, Irish-speaking immigrants clustered at York Point.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|last1=Winder|first1=Gordon M.|title=Trouble in the North End: The Geography of Social Violence in Saint John 1840-1860|journal=[[Acadiensis]]|date=Spring 2000|volume= XXIX|issue= 2 |page=27|jstor=30303222 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/download/10782/11552}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, at Reed's Point at the foot of Prince William Street, St. Patrick's Square was created to honour citizens of Irish heritage.

By 1850 working class solidarity was strong among the longshoremen who handled the booming lumber trade. Labour organizations vied with merchants for control of the waterfront casual labor market. However, work-bred feelings of mutualism were often undermined by Protestant-Catholic conflicts. With the introduction of steamers, fast turnaround became even more important and the merchants could not afford job actions, so they compromised. In the World War, the longshoremen  succeeded in imposing favourable new work rules and exerting partial control over hiring practices. But by 1919\u201320 the shipping industry regained its old authority, and hard-pressed longshoremen subsequently abandoned their class-based effort in favor of regional political activism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |title=Saint John Longshoremen During the Rise of Canada's Winter Port, 1895\u20131922 |journal=[[Labour/Le Travail]] |date=Spring 1990 |volume=25 |pages=15\u201346|jstor=25143339|doi=10.2307/25143339|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/LLT/article/download/4755/5628}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1914, the [[1914 Saint John street railway strike|street railway strike]] and riot occurred.

The ferry terminal for the service to [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]], [[Nova Scotia]] was also relocated from Long Wharf to a new facility on the lower West Side (see [[Bay Ferries Limited]]) as the CBD was expanded with new office buildings and downtown retail areas while historic industrial buildings were turned into shops and museums.

However, the plan fell through in favour of concentrating industrial development on the inner harbour along the mouth of the Saint John River&nbsp;\u2013 the very area where the waterfront redevelopment is being proposed (see [http://www.sjwaterfront.com/ Saint John Waterfront Development Partnership]). Often cited in the media and by politicians as part of Saint John's redevelopment strategy, [[Saint John, New Brunswick harbour cleanup|Harbour cleanup]] refers to the infrastructure project that will bring an end to the practice of discharging raw sewage into local waterways.\n\nIn 1982, a 20 block area of the Uptown area (see [http://www.trinityroyal.com/ Trinity Royal]) was designated for historic preservation. A related development in recent years has been waterfront redevelopment for tourist and residential use.

LaTour had a fortified settlement at the mouth of the Saint John River while d'Aulnay's headquarters was at Port Royal some 45 miles across the Bay of Fundy. In adjoining New England, the people supported LaTour's claim since he allowed them to fish and lumber in and along the Bay of Fundy without let or hindrance while d'Aulnay aggressively sought payment for that right. Word came to LaTour that d'Aulnay was concentrating men and materials for an attack on LaTour's fort and fur trading operation at the mouth of the Saint John River. LaTour went to Boston to ask John Winthrop, the governor of Massachusetts Bay colony, for help. Winthrop arranged for several merchants to advance loans unofficially to LaTour for his purchase of men and material to defend the Saint John River fort from d'Aulnay's attack.\nFor five months, the Governor of Acadia d'Aulnay who was stationed at Port Royal created a blockade of the river to defeat La Tour at his fort.{{sfnp|Dunn|2004|p=19}}  On 14 July 1643, La Tour arrived from Boston with four ships and a complement of 270 men to repossess Fort Sainte-Marie.

[[Irish diaspora|These immigrants]] changed the character of the city and surrounding region so that in addition to its Loyalist-Protestant heritage, there was a new Irish-Catholic culture as well.  Between 1845 and 1847, approximately 30,000 Irish arrived in Saint John, more than doubling the population of the city. During this period, Saint John was second only to [[Grosse Isle, Quebec]] as the busiest port of entry to Canada for Irish immigrants. The Roman Catholic population was largely impoverished and uneducated.\n\n[[Image:Partridge Island New Brunswick Canada.jpg|thumb|200px|Celtic Cross of Partridge Island]]\n\n[[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] has often been called \"Canada's Irish City\". In the years between 1815, when vast industrial changes began to disrupt the old life-styles in Europe, and Canadian Confederation in 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland flooded into Saint John. Those who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845-1852, huge waves of Famine refugees flooded these shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"Black 47,\" one of the worst years of the Famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick|Partridge Island]], the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour. However, thousands of Irish were living in New Brunswick prior to these events, mainly in Saint John.\n\nAfter the partitioning of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1784 New Brunswick was originally named New Ireland with the capital to be in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lib.unb.ca/winslow/partition.html|work=Winslow Papers |title=The Partition of Nova Scotia|publisher=University of New Brunswick|date=21 June 2005}}</ref>\n\nBy 1850, the Irish Catholic community constituted Saint John's largest ethnic group. In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 55 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born fathers. However, the city was split with tensions between Irish Catholics and Unionist Protestants. From the 1840s onward, Sectarian riots were rampant in the city with many poor, Irish-speaking immigrants clustered at York Point.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|last1=Winder|first1=Gordon M.|title=Trouble in the North End: The Geography of Social Violence in Saint John 1840-1860|journal=[[Acadiensis]]|date=Spring 2000|volume= XXIX|issue= 2 |page=27|jstor=30303222 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/download/10782/11552}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, at Reed's Point at the foot of Prince William Street, St. Patrick's Square was created to honour citizens of Irish heritage.

Then in 1997 the park was refurbished by the city with a memorial marked by the city's St. Patrick's Society and Famine 150 which was unveiled by Hon. Mary Robinson, president of Ireland.

By 1850 working class solidarity was strong among the longshoremen who handled the booming lumber trade. Labour organizations vied with merchants for control of the waterfront casual labor market. However, work-bred feelings of mutualism were often undermined by Protestant-Catholic conflicts. With the introduction of steamers, fast turnaround became even more important and the merchants could not afford job actions, so they compromised. In the World War, the longshoremen  succeeded in imposing favourable new work rules and exerting partial control over hiring practices. But by 1919\u201320 the shipping industry regained its old authority, and hard-pressed longshoremen subsequently abandoned their class-based effort in favor of regional political activism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |title=Saint John Longshoremen During the Rise of Canada's Winter Port, 1895\u20131922 |journal=[[Labour/Le Travail]] |date=Spring 1990 |volume=25 |pages=15\u201346|jstor=25143339|doi=10.2307/25143339|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/LLT/article/download/4755/5628}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1914, the [[1914 Saint John street railway strike|street railway strike]] and riot occurred.

The ferry terminal for the service to [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]], [[Nova Scotia]] was also relocated from Long Wharf to a new facility on the lower West Side (see [[Bay Ferries Limited]]) as the CBD was expanded with new office buildings and downtown retail areas while historic industrial buildings were turned into shops and museums. The skyline in the city boasts office towers and historic properties.\n\nIn the 1970s redevelopment of the city and port, most of the port's industrial areas were scheduled to be relocated at a major new deepwater port being considered for the western part of the outer harbour at Lorneville in a major partnership between the Irving conglomerate, [[NB Power]], CPR and the three levels of government. However, the plan fell through in favour of concentrating industrial development on the inner harbour along the mouth of the Saint John River&nbsp;\u2013 the very area where the waterfront redevelopment is being proposed (see [http://www.sjwaterfront.com/ Saint John Waterfront Development Partnership]). Often cited in the media and by politicians as part of Saint John's redevelopment strategy, [[Saint John, New Brunswick harbour cleanup|Harbour cleanup]] refers to the infrastructure project that will bring an end to the practice of discharging raw sewage into local waterways.\n\nIn 1982, a 20 block area of the Uptown area (see [http://www.trinityroyal.com/ Trinity Royal]) was designated for historic preservation.

In the same decade (1992), APL, along with [[Johns Hopkins University]], developed an algorithm that allowed for automatic mammogram analysis.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n=== Pershing ===\nIn 1965, the US Army contracted with APL to develop and implement a test and evaluation program for the [[Pershing missile]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mentzer, Jr.|first=William R.|title=Test and Evaluation of Land-Mobile Missile Systems|journal=Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|date=1998|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/TD/td1904/mentzer.pdf}}</ref> APL developed the Pershing Operational Test Program (OTP), provided technical support to the [[Pershing Operational Test Unit]] (POTU), identified problem areas and improved the performance and survivability of the Pershing systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lyman|first=Donald R.|title=POTU: Testing Pershing in Europe and CONUS|journal=Field Artillery Journal|pages=15\u201317|date=May\u2013June 1977|url=http://sill-www.army.mil/firesbulletin/archives/1977/MAY_JUN_1977/MAY_JUN_1977_PAGES_15_17.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\nThe modern Applied Physics Laboratory is located in [[Laurel, Maryland]], and spans 453 acres with more than 30 buildings on site. Additional auxiliary campuses exist in the surrounding areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/About|title=About:JHU{{!}}APL}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nAPL is also home to a Johns Hopkins graduate program in engineering and applied sciences, called Engineering for Professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/education/edcenter/|title=JHU Graduate Program in Engineering and Applied Sciences|website=JHU APL|accessdate=March 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420062006/http://www.jhuapl.edu/education/edcenter/|archive-date=April 20, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Courses are taught at seven locations in the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]], including the APL Education Center.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Research==\nAs of APL's 70th anniversary in 2012, there were over 600 projects in progress, spanning from those in APL's more traditional areas of work, including air defense, undersea warfare precision engagement and strategic systems to newer types of projects, including those in homeland security and cyber operations.<ref name=\":0\"/> Due to the nature of the APL's work, many of its projects' details are kept confidential.\n\n=== Defense ===\nThe [[U.S. Navy]] continues to be APL's primary long-term sponsor. The Laboratory performs work for the [[Missile Defense Agency]], the [[Department of Homeland Security]], intelligence agencies, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]), and others. The Laboratory supports NASA through space science, [[spacecraft]] design and fabrication, and mission operations. APL has made significant contributions in the areas of air defense, strike and power projection, [[submarine]] security, antisubmarine warfare, strategic systems evaluation, command and control, distributed information and display systems, sensors, information processing, and space systems.\n\n=== Space ===\n[[File:Alan Stern and New Horizons Team Celebrate Pluto Flyby.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Alan Stern]] celebrating the successful flyby of the [[Pluto]] system by [[New Horizons]] in 2015 in the APL Mission Operations Center.]]\nAPL has built and operated many spacecraft, including [[Transit (satellite)|the TRANSIT navigation system]], [[NEAR Shoemaker|NEAR]], [[Geosat]], [[Advanced Composition Explorer|ACE]], [[TIMED]], [[CONTOUR]], [[MESSENGER]], [[Van Allen Probes]],<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/newscenter/pressreleases/spacemission/spmissions.asp|title=Space Press Releases |last=|first=|date= |website=JHU APL|publisher=|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> the [[New Horizons]] mission to [[Pluto]], the [[Parker Solar Probe]] mission to the outer corona of the Sun,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu|title=Parker Solar Probe: A Nasa Mission to Touch the Sun|last=|first=|date=March 18, 2014|website=JHU APL|publisher=|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}</ref> and [[STEREO]].<ref name=\":1\"/> In 2019, the APL proposed [[Dragonfly (spacecraft)|Dragonfly]] mission was selected as the fourth NASA [[New Frontiers program#Fourth mission|New Frontiers mission]].<ref name='Foust 2019'>[https://spacenews.com/nasa-selects-titan-drone-for-next-new-frontiers-mission/ NASA selects Titan drone for next New Frontiers mission].
