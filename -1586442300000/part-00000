In addition, sandstone beds associated with the Gillespie Lake Member seem similar to [[microbially induced sedimentary structure]]s (MISS) found on Earth, according to one study.<ref name=\"ASB-20150214\">{{cite journal |last=Nora |first=Noffke |title=Ancient Sedimentary Structures in the <3.7 Ga Gillespie Lake Member, Mars, That Resemble Macroscopic Morphology, Spatial Associations, and Temporal Succession in Terrestrial Microbialites |date=February 14, 2015 |journal=[[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |doi=10.1089/ast.2014.1218 |pmid=25495393 |bibcode=2015AsBio..15..169N |pages=169\u2013192}}</ref>\n\nIt was from the Sheepbed layer that ''Curiosity'' took two drilling samples from the [[mudstone]] [[sedimentary]] rock.

The CheMin XRD, Mastcam, Chemcam, alpha particle x-ray spectrometer (APXS), and the [[Mars Hand Lens Imager]] (MAHLI) were all used to obtain the most complete picture possible of the [[chemistry]] and [[mineralogy]] of the two samples, which were used to describe the region as a whole.<ref name=Vaniman />\n\nA large amount of [[phyllosilicates]], clay minerals such as [[smectite]], were found to be major constituents in the two samples.<ref name=Ming /> Clay minerals are hydrous aluminum [[phyllosillicates]] and form only in the presence of water, further supporting the claim that an ancient crater lake once existed in this region. Other [[silicates]] were detected as well, such as the Magnesium-rich end-member of [[olivine]] called [[forsterite]], [[pigeonite]], [[plagioclase]], [[augite]], [[clinopyroxene]], and [[orthopyroxene]]. These detected minerals are all indicative of a potential [[mafic]] source for the origin of the deposition.<ref name=Vaniman /><ref name=Ming />\n\n==After Yellowknife Bay==\nWith the [[Mars Science Laboratory]]'s primary goal of establishing whether a habitable paleo-environment could have existed on Mars accomplished while within Yellowknife Bay, the team of [[NASA]] scientists then directed ''Curiosity'' out of the Yellowknife bay formation and toward the original destination of [[Mount Sharp]], which rises {{convert|3.4|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} from the base of [[Gale Crater]].<ref name = \"Kolawole\">{{cite web | url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/curiositys-life-on-mars-a-timeline-of-the-mars-science-laboratory-mission/46/ | title=Curiosity's life on Mars: A timeline of the Mars Science Laboratory Mission | work=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=2 April 2014 | author=Kolawole, E.}}</ref> On July 4, 2013, ''Curiosity'' drove away from the Glenelg member and began its {{convert|5|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} journey to [[Mount Sharp]].

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:<ref name=\"fordham1\" />\n\n{{quote|Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure.\n\nFor confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.|Nuruddin Salim Jahangir|Letter to James I.}}\n\n== Expansion ==\nThe company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese [[Estado da \u00cdndia]], which had established bases in [[Goa]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Bombay]] - Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, [[indigo dye]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [[Straits of Malacca]] by ousting the Portuguese in 1640\u20131641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWithin the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000&nbsp;employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200&nbsp;ships.

When the East India Company Act 1697 (9 Will. c. 44) was passed in 1697, a new \"parallel\" East India Company (officially titled the ''English Company Trading to the East Indies'') was floated under a state-backed indemnity of \u00a32&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Boggart\">{{cite journal |last1=Boggart |first1=Dan |editor1-last=Lamoreaux |editor1-first=Naomi R. |editor2-last=Wallis |editor2-first=John Joseph |title=East Indian Monopoly and Limited Access in England |journal=Organizations, Civil Society, and the Roots of Development |date=2017 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago}}</ref> The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of \u00a3315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\" />\n\nWith the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market.

Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000.

Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991).

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

The company had at various stages extended its influence to China, the Philippines, and [[Java island|Java]]. It had solved its critical lack of cash needed to buy tea by exporting Indian-grown opium to China. China's efforts to end the trade led to the First Opium War (1839\u20131842).\n\n==== English Education Act 1835 ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|English Education Act 1835}}\n[[File:Charles D'Oyly00.jpg|thumb|View of the Calcutta port in 1848]]\nThe English Education Act by the Council of India in 1835 reallocated funds from the East India Company to spend on education and literature in India.\n\n==== Government of India Act 1853 ====\nThis Act (16 & 17 Vict. c. 95) provided that British India would remain under the administration of the company in trust for the Crown until Parliament should decide otherwise.

This Act provided for the formal dissolution of the company on 1 June 1874, after a final dividend payment and the commutation or redemption of its stock.<ref>East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict. 17) s. 36: \"On the First day of June One thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, and on payment by the East India Company of all unclaimed dividends on East India Stock to such accounts as are herein-before mentioned in pursuance of the directions herein-before contained, the powers of the East India Company shall cease, and the said Company shall be dissolved.\" Where possible, the stock was redeemed through commutation (i.e. exchanging the stock for other securities or money) on terms agreed with the stockholders (ss. 5\u20138), but stockholders who did not agree to commute their holdings had their stock compulsorily redeemed on 30 April 1874 by payment of \u00a3200 for every \u00a3100 of stock held (s. 13).</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' commented on 8 April 1873:<ref>{{cite news |title=Not many days ago the House of Commons passed |newspaper=Times |location=London |date=8 April 1873 |page=9}}</ref>\n{{quote|text=It accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other trading Company ever attempted, and such as none, surely, is likely to attempt in the years to come.}}\n\nIn the 1980s, a group of investors purchased the rights to the moribund corporate brand and founded a clothing company, which lasted until the 1990s.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a \"Sign of Four\" atop a heart within which was a [[saltire]] between the lower arms of which were the initials \"EIC\". This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage<ref>East India Company coin 1791, half pice, as illustrated.</ref> and forms the central emblem displayed on the [[Scinde Dawk]] postage stamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html|title=Scinde District Dawks|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Ships ==\n{{See also|East Indiaman|List of ports of call of the British East India Company}}\n[[File:Ships in Bombay Harbour, 1731.jpg|thumb|right|Ships in [[Bombay Harbour]], c. 1731]]\nShips of the East India Company were called [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] or simply \"Indiamen\".<ref>Sutton, Jean (1981) ''Lords of the East: The East India Company and Its Ships''. London: Conway Maritime</ref>\n\n[[File:Indiaman Royal George.jpg|thumb|right|{{ship||Royal George|East Indiaman|2}} was one of the five East Indiamen the Spanish fleet captured in 1780]]\n\nDuring the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], the East India Company arranged for [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]] for its vessels such as the ''Lord Nelson''. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''. Other examples include:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}\n* {{HMS|Glatton|1795|6}}\n* {{HMS|Hindostan|1795|6}} (1795)\n* {{HMS|Hindostan|1804|6}} (1804)\n* {{HMS|Malabar|1804|6}}\n* {{HMS|Buffalo|1813|6}}\n{{div col end}}\n\nTheir design as merchant vessels meant that their performance in the warship role was underwhelming and the Navy converted them to transports.\n\n== Records ==\n{{Main|India Office Records}}\nUnlike all other British Government records, the records from the East India Company (and its successor the [[India Office]]) are not in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] at [[Kew]], London, but are held by the [[British Library]] in London as part of the [[Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections, British Library|Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections]].

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million.

Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely [[sepoy|Indian troops]] and trained them along European lines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerald Bryant |year=1978 |title=Officers of the East India Company's army in the days of Clive and Hastings |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203\u2013227 |doi=10.1080/03086537808582508}}</ref> The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed into a private corporate armed force used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion instead of its original purpose as a guard force. Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The growth of tensions between the EIC and the local religious and cultural groups grew in the 19th century as the Protestant revival grew in Great Britain.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342).

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service.

In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India.

In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired.

A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.<ref name=\"auto\"/> To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with [[bat]]s and sonar, which reduce the sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers.<ref name=\"Au\">\n{{cite book| last=Au| first=Whitlow| year=1993| title=The Sonar of Dolphins| location=New York| publisher=Springer-Verlag| isbn=978-3-540-97835-0}}</ref> Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an \"echoic image\" or sound picture of their targets.<ref name=\"Pack 1995\">\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Pack AA, Herman LM |title=Sensory integration in the bottlenosed dolphin: immediate recognition of complex shapes across the senses of echolocation and vision |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=98 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=722\u201333 |year=1995|pmid=7642811 |doi=10.1121/1.413566|bibcode = 1995ASAJ...98..722P }}</ref>\n\nDolphins have sharp eyesight.

The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|isbn=978-0-8050-1950-6\n|author1=Connor Richard C. \n|author2=Peterson, Dawn M.\n|year=1994\n|title=The Lives of Whales and Dolphins\n|publisher=Henry Holt and Company\n|location=New York.\n|url=https://archive.org/details/livesofwhalesd00conn\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[breeding season]], males compete for access to females.

Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.\n\nHowever, dolphins in these areas can also coexist with humans. For example, in the town of [[Laguna, Brazil|Laguna]] in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans.  These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them.  The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen.  One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here,<ref name=\":0\" /> and a detailed description of the signal's characteristics is available here<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUZhmJ0JSQ|title=Cooperative Dolphins of Laguna: Data on Nature of Signal (video and detailed description)|last=Dr. Moti Nissani|date=2008|website=|access-date=}}</ref>).  In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sim\u00f5es-Lopes|first=Paulo C.|date=1998|title=Dolphin interactions with the mullet artisanal fishing on southern Brazil: a qualitative and quantitative approach|url=|journal=Revista Brasileira de Zoologia|volume=15|pages=709\u2013726|issue=3|doi=10.1590/s0101-81751998000300016|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847.

A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.<ref name=\"auto\"/> To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with [[bat]]s and sonar, which reduce the sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers.<ref name=\"Au\">\n{{cite book| last=Au| first=Whitlow| year=1993| title=The Sonar of Dolphins| location=New York| publisher=Springer-Verlag| isbn=978-3-540-97835-0}}</ref> Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an \"echoic image\" or sound picture of their targets.<ref name=\"Pack 1995\">\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Pack AA, Herman LM |title=Sensory integration in the bottlenosed dolphin: immediate recognition of complex shapes across the senses of echolocation and vision |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=98 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=722\u201333 |year=1995|pmid=7642811 |doi=10.1121/1.413566|bibcode = 1995ASAJ...98..722P }}</ref>\n\nDolphins have sharp eyesight.

In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.<ref name=\"BBC Adelaide\">{{cite news|last=Black|first=Richard|year=2008|title=Wild dolphins tail-walk on water|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7570097.stm|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=March 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA study conducted by the [[University of Chicago]] showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they'd lived with after 20 years of separation.

Self-decoration by wearing grass appears to be an attention-getting device rather than purely play and varies from a single blade to large clusters of grass. John's Pass dolphins self-decorate with grass primarily when they form new social groups or engage in procreative activities. Grass-wearing behavior among these dolphins is a local behavioral tradition that could constitute a cultural difference from other communities.<ref>Weaver, A., & Kuczaj, S. (2016).

The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|isbn=978-0-8050-1950-6\n|author1=Connor Richard C. \n|author2=Peterson, Dawn M.\n|year=1994\n|title=The Lives of Whales and Dolphins\n|publisher=Henry Holt and Company\n|location=New York.\n|url=https://archive.org/details/livesofwhalesd00conn\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[breeding season]], males compete for access to females.

Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.\n\nHowever, dolphins in these areas can also coexist with humans. For example, in the town of [[Laguna, Brazil|Laguna]] in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans.  These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them.  The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen.  One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here,<ref name=\":0\" /> and a detailed description of the signal's characteristics is available here<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUZhmJ0JSQ|title=Cooperative Dolphins of Laguna: Data on Nature of Signal (video and detailed description)|last=Dr. Moti Nissani|date=2008|website=|access-date=}}</ref>).  In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sim\u00f5es-Lopes|first=Paulo C.|date=1998|title=Dolphin interactions with the mullet artisanal fishing on southern Brazil: a qualitative and quantitative approach|url=|journal=Revista Brasileira de Zoologia|volume=15|pages=709\u2013726|issue=3|doi=10.1590/s0101-81751998000300016|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed. Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] insisted his credit be removed when, like the film itself, his score was heavily edited by the studio.\n\nEven in the released version, ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' is often regarded as among [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], a distinction it shares with Welles' first film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/momentsindx.html |title=100 Greatest Films |publisher=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Tim|last=Dirks|url=http://www.filmsite.org/magn.html |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) review |website=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref> The film was nominated for four [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and it was added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1991.\n\n==Plot==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-7.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joseph Cotten, [[Anne Baxter]], and [[Tim Holt]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-2.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Dolores Costello, Agnes Moorehead, Anne Baxter, Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-5.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Richard Bennett, Agnes Moorehead, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n}}\n[[File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.0|[[:File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|''The Magnificent Ambersons'' trailer]]]]\n\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe Ambersons are by far the wealthiest family in the midwestern city of [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], at the beginning of the 20th century. Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

The set for the Amberson mansion was constructed like a real house, but it had walls that could be rolled back, raised, or lowered to allow the camera to appear to pass through them in a continuous take.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> RKO later used many of the film's sets for its low-budget films, including a series of horror films produced by [[Val Lewton]].\n\nLocation shooting took place at various places around the Los Angeles area, including [[Big Bear Lake]], the [[San Bernardino National Forest]], and [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]].

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that, Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

It's a tremendous preparation for the boardinghouse ... and the terrible walk of George Minafer when he gets his comeuppance. And without that, there wasn't any plot.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The only credits shown onscreen are the RKO logo, \"A Mercury Production by Orson Welles\", and the film's title, shown at the beginning of the picture. At the end of the film, Welles's voice announces all the main credits. Each actor in the film is shown as Welles announces his or her name. As he speaks each technical credit, a machine is shown performing that function.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> Welles reads his own credit \u2014 \"My name is Orson Welles\" \u2014 over top of an image of a microphone which then recedes into the distance.<ref>The footage of the microphone is taken from the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] in which Welles similarly narrated the key acting credits for the film.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-magnificent-ambersons/ |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)  |publisher=[[Art of the Title]] |accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n\"I got a lot of hell because of that,\" Welles later said of his verbal sign-off. \"People think it's egotistic. The truth is, I was just speaking to a public who knew me from [[The Mercury Theatre on the Air|the radio]] in a way they were used to hearing on our shows.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed. Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] insisted his credit be removed when, like the film itself, his score was heavily edited by the studio.\n\nEven in the released version, ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' is often regarded as among [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], a distinction it shares with Welles' first film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/momentsindx.html |title=100 Greatest Films |publisher=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Tim|last=Dirks|url=http://www.filmsite.org/magn.html |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) review |website=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref> The film was nominated for four [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and it was added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1991.\n\n==Plot==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-7.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joseph Cotten, [[Anne Baxter]], and [[Tim Holt]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-2.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Dolores Costello, Agnes Moorehead, Anne Baxter, Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-5.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Richard Bennett, Agnes Moorehead, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n}}\n[[File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.0|[[:File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|''The Magnificent Ambersons'' trailer]]]]\n\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe Ambersons are by far the wealthiest family in the midwestern city of [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], at the beginning of the 20th century. Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|Diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States, since information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review|date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it\u2019s incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China.\"<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn August 31, 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16.\nInvestigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine\u2019s gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine\u2019s liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn June 19th, 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying ChinaSat-9A ended in partial failure.\nOfficials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on July 7th, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\". The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|Diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market. During its maiden flight on 14 February 1996 carrying the [[Intelsat 708]] satellite, the rocket suffered a guidance failure two seconds into the flight and destroyed a nearby town, killing at least six people,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/coxreport/body/ch6bod.html |title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral |accessdate=23 May 2012 |author=Select Committee of the United States House of Representatives |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=3 January 1999|work=U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China}}</ref> but outside estimates suggest that anywhere between 200 and 500 people might have been killed.<ref name=ChenLan>{{cite web|last=Lan|first=Chen|title=Mist around the CZ-3B disaster|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2323/1|work=The Space Review|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> However, the author of the report<ref name=\"ChenLan\"/> later ruled out large casualties, because evidence suggest that the crash site was evacuated before the launch.<ref name=ChenLan2>{{cite web|last=Lan|first=Chen|title=Mist around the CZ-3B disaster (part 2)|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2326/1|work=The Space Review|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Long March 3B and 3B/E rockets conducted ten successful launches between 1997 and 2008.<ref name=\"cgwic.com\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the [[Agila 2]] satellite was forced to use onboard propellant to reach its correct orbit because of poor injection accuracy on the part of its Long March 3B launch vehicle.<ref>''International reference guide to space launch systems''.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States, since information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review|date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it\u2019s incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China.\"<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn August 31, 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16.\nInvestigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine\u2019s gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine\u2019s liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn June 19th, 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying ChinaSat-9A ended in partial failure.\nOfficials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on July 7th, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\". The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own power.<ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_satellite_Zhongxing_9A_enters_preset_orbit_999.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight|China}}\n*[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/report/1999/3b.htm LM-3B User's Manual] at GlobalSecurity.org\n*[http://www.calt.com/english/ps/index.html Long March-3B (LM-3B)] at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology\n\n{{Long March rockets}}\n{{Expendable launch systems}}\n{{CLEP}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long March 3b}}\n[[Category:Long March (rocket family)]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1996]]\n", "name_user": "Appable", "label": "safe", "comment": "... and fix number, sorry.
