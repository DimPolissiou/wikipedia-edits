The series was originally titled ''Gurbani'', which means the composition of the [[Sikh]] gurus.

Soham, who lives in Bani's village, is smitten with her, but he is rejected by Desho since he is not an NRI. Amreek and Parmeet are NRI bachelors. Rajji's marriage is arranged with Amreek and Bani's with Parmeet. On the day of the double wedding, there is a great deal of confusion. First, it seems that Parmeet, who works in [[Canada]], will not turn up for the wedding. So Desho begs Soham to marry Bani and he joyfully agrees. But Parmeet does turn up at the last moment. Then, Amreek leaves in a huff because of a misunderstanding between him and Rajji. Now, because of a communication gap, the brides' relatives get the impression that Soham has agreed to marry Rajji. Thus, Bani marries Parmeet, as planned, while Soham unknowingly marries Rajji instead of his true love.\n\nBani accompanies Parmeet to her in-laws' home. Parmeet leaves alone for Canada the next morning, promising to return soon. In the meantime, Sohum and his family members realize that the bride they have brought home is Rajji and not Bani. They are very upset, but Sohum's brother Angad suggest that they should give Rajji a chance. At first, Parmeet is quite regular in making phone calls to Bani. Then, it is revealed that Parmeet had only married Bani so that he could legally claim some ancestral property and sell it in order to make money. After getting what he wants, he stops calling Bani.\n\nEventually, Bani realizes that her husband has abandoned her, but she is determined to get her rights as a wife. She decides to search for him and bring him back. Soham offers to accompany her as an escort. But Rajji, who has been trying hard to make her marriage work, begs Bani not to take Sohum along. So, Bani refuses to let Sohum accompany her and sets out alone for [[Delhi]], from where she plans to go to Canada. In Delhi, she falls into the trap of some criminals who want to use her in the flesh trade. But, luckily, she is rescued in time by a social worker, a lady named Anuradha, whose home becomes a refuge for Bani. Anuradha's daughter is about to marry an NRI named Meet. On the wedding day, Bani discovers that Meet is actually her husband Parmeet, who plans to marry Anuradha's daughter for money. Parmeet flees from the wedding when his truth is exposed. Anuradha said that they will arrest Parmeet but Bani disagrees. The reason was that Bani wanted to punish Parmeet. Bani went back to Parmeet but Parmeet throws Bani out of the House. Rajji gets pregnant and Sohum is taking care of Rajji, soon they are in love but can't say that to each other. When Bani's in-laws plans a picnic Parmeet plans to get Bani killed. They are having a picnic while Parmeet takes Bani to a boat, with the number 13 on it. Parmeet starts the motor and leaves Bani all alone in the boat. The boat moves and slowly sinks into the water. Bani is declared dead and the whole family is heartbroken. Rajji is depressed. However, soon after it is revealed that Bani is alive and is getting treatment in a hospital. She vows to make Parmeet pay. She meets Anuradha again who is later revealed to be Parmeet's real mother. However, Bani is unaware of this. Anuradha invites Bani to stay at her home and Bani tells her everything about Parmeet. Anuradha helps Bani in her plan unaware that Parmeet is her son. Rajji finds out Bani is indeed alive but Bani tells her everything about Parmeet was the cause of the boat incident. Rajji helps Bani and Anuradha. They help Bani disguise herself as a party girl, Maya. In a party, Parmeet spots Bani/Maya and is shocked. He thinks it's Bani and grabs her. But Bani/Maya slaps him and pretends to not know him. She calls herself Maya which confuses Parmeet but he is still not convinced. Bani, Rajji and Anuradha further their plan and are successful in making Parmeet believe that it is indeed Maya. As time passes by, Parmeet falls in love with Maya/Bani but this infuriates Bani as she only wants him to get hurt and not fall in love with her. However, Bani's plans are sometimes foiled by some of the family members who don't believe Bani, but Bani saves herself each time. Soon, Bani and Rajji expose Parmeet and he is thrown out of the house. Bani humiliates him and reveals everything about how she is Bani and transformed herself into Maya. As time passes by Bani falls in love with Parmeet as he really loves her and wins her back. He is thwarted each time but is successful with Rajji's help as she learns how sorry Parmeet really is. Parmeet and Anuradha also reunite after many problems. After a few months everyone is happy as Soham and Parmeet are business partners along with Bani and Rajji. The show ends with a happy note.\n<!--NOTE: As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia provides a plot SUMMARY or overview and NOT every detail. This summary has reached the maximum recommended length.

{"title_page": "Urdd Peace and Goodwill Message", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=October 2019}}\n{{External links|date=October 2019}}\n}}\nThe '''Urdd Peace and Goodwill Message''' has been relayed each year without fail since [[28 June]] [[1922]]. It is a message of peace and goodwill from the young people of\n[[Wales]] has been sent to the children and young people of the world on Goodwill Day, which is May 18. The message theme, authorship and broadcast is organised by [[Urdd Gobaith Cymru]] (lit. \"Wales's League of Hope\", commonly translated to the Welsh League of Youth) which is a Welsh language youth organisation also established in 1922.\n\nNo other country in the world has achieved this, overcoming wars and major changes in methods of communication, from Morse Code to radio and the postal service, to the digital Networks of today. To this day the message is developed as a response to current events, and over the years numerous responses have been received from other countries. The process of writing and sending the message on behalf of the young people of Wales to young people around the world has inspired humanitarian and international activity. In 1955 Urdd Gobaith Cymru assumed responsibility for ensuring the message is written and distributed every year.<ref name=\":0\">'The Story of the Urdd' (1922-1972), page 212-213</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the message was launched the other side of Offa\u2019s Dyke for the first time ever, taking young people from Wales on a visit to an academy working with young people from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds in London \u2013 the Eastside Young Leaders Academy.\n\nIn 2020 the message theme has been changed from Empowering Girls to Stop the Clock and Start Again \"2020 THEME CHANGE In order to properly reflect the feelings of the young people of Wales, the Message theme this year has been changed as they try and make sense of the world during the Covid-19 virus pandemic. It will be a letter to the world, and especially to leaders, calling on us not to return to the old destructive ways of living\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.urdd.cymru/en/peace-and-goodwill/|title=Urdd Gobaith Cymru Peace Message current web page|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe message is written by young people for young people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_9480000/newsid_9489200/9489207.stm|title=Un neges heddwch mewn 30 iaith|last=|first=|date=2011-05-18|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe idea of sending a \u201cMessage of Goodwill\u201d was first suggested by the Rev. Gwilym Davies MA at the 'Adolescent Conference of the Welsh School of Social Service' which was held in [[Llandrindod Wells]] at [[Whitsun]] 1922. Davies was an Honorary Director of the League of Nations in Wales and he suggested that the message should be created by school pupils \u201cin all 13 counties of Wales and Monmouthshire\u201d (there was ambiguity at the time whether [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] was a constitutional part of Wales), it is said that \u201cthe suggestions was adopted with enthusiasm\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.casgliadywerin.cymru/items/502465|title=The message of goodwill of the children of Wales, 1925|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  The work of receiving suggestions from schools began and Davies was to organise the broadcast.\nThe Peace and Goodwill Message is shared on the 18th of May, the date of the first peace conference at the Hague in 1899. The first Peace and Goodwill Message was sent in [[Morse Code]] via the Post Office on June 28, 1922 by the Rev Gwilym Davies, Cwm Rhymni ([[Rhymney Valley]])<ref name=\":0\" />  It has been sent without fail since that date. In 1922, the director of the radio station on the Eiffel Tower in Paris responded by sending it on from the [[Eiffel Tower]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Story of the Urdd (1922-1972)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}</ref> in Morse Code. In 1924, a response was received from the Archbishop of [[Uppsala]] in [[Sweden]] and also from the education minister in Poland. The message was broadcast on the BBC World Service for the first time in 1924,<ref name=\":0\" /> and it is now translated into over 40 languages and is distributed via the web.\n\n===Early Responses===\nThe first responses to the Goodwill Message were received in 1924, including one from the [[Archbishop of Uppsala]] in Sweden, Poland\u2019s Education Minister, Millaszewski [sic.]. A request was made once again in 1925 for responses to the Message be sent to the Rev. D.M.Davies at the offices of the League of Nations in Wales, 10 Richmond Terr, Park Place, [[Cardiff]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Responses were received from, amongst others [[L\u00e9on Bourgeois]] (a French leader and a left-leaning thinker), [[Paul Hymans]] (a Belgian liberal politician and the second General Secretary for the League of Nations) and [[Sir Eric Drummond]], General Secretary for the Union of Nations and the Education Ministers in Czechoslovakia and Finland. Perhaps unexpectedly a response was also received from \u201cSignior [[Mussolini]]\u201d, the [[fascist]] leader of Italy. In 1925 the first response was received from the USA to the Message, which came from Public School 6, [[Manhattan]], New York and an article about the initiative was printed in the December 1925 edition of the children\u2019s American magazine, Everyland.<ref name=\":2\" />  736 responses to the Peace and Goodwill Message in 1938. 124 came from the [[United States]], and 304 from Romania.\n\nThe responsibility for publishing the annual message was transferred to Urdd Gobaith Cymru in the 1950s.

It is a message of peace and goodwill from the young people of\n[[Wales]] has been sent to the children and young people of the world on Goodwill Day, which is May 18. The message theme, authorship and broadcast is organised by [[Urdd Gobaith Cymru]] (lit. \"Wales's League of Hope\", commonly translated to the Welsh League of Youth) which is a Welsh language youth organisation also established in 1922.\n\nNo other country in the world has achieved this, overcoming wars and major changes in methods of communication, from Morse Code to radio and the postal service, to the digital Networks of today. To this day the message is developed as a response to current events, and over the years numerous responses have been received from other countries. The process of writing and sending the message on behalf of the young people of Wales to young people around the world has inspired humanitarian and international activity. In 1955 Urdd Gobaith Cymru assumed responsibility for ensuring the message is written and distributed every year.<ref name=\":0\">'The Story of the Urdd' (1922-1972), page 212-213</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the message was launched the other side of Offa\u2019s Dyke for the first time ever, taking young people from Wales on a visit to an academy working with young people from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds in London \u2013 the Eastside Young Leaders Academy.\n\nIn 202 the message theme has been changed from Empowering Girls to Stop the Clock and Start Again \"2020 THEME CHANGE In order to properly reflect the feelings of the young people of Wales, the Message theme this year has been changed as they try and make sense of the world during the Covid-19 virus pandemic.

Davies was an Honorary Director of the League of Nations in Wales and he suggested that the message should be created by school pupils \u201cin all 13 counties of Wales and Monmouthshire\u201d (there was ambiguity at the time whether [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] was a constitutional part of Wales), it is said that \u201cthe suggestions was adopted with enthusiasm\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.casgliadywerin.cymru/items/502465|title=The message of goodwill of the children of Wales, 1925|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  The work of receiving suggestions from schools began and Davies was to organise the broadcast.\nThe Peace and Goodwill Message is shared on the 18th of May, the date of the first peace conference at the Hague in 1899. The first Peace and Goodwill Message was sent in [[Morse Code]] via the Post Office on June 28, 1922 by the Rev Gwilym Davies, Cwm Rhymni ([[Rhymney Valley]])<ref name=\":0\" />  It has been sent without fail since that date. In 1922, the director of the radio station on the Eiffel Tower in Paris responded by sending it on from the [[Eiffel Tower]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Story of the Urdd (1922-1972)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}</ref> in Morse Code. In 1924, a response was received from the Archbishop of [[Uppsala]] in [[Sweden]] and also from the education minister in Poland. The message was broadcast on the BBC World Service for the first time in 1924,<ref name=\":0\" /> and it is now translated into over 40 languages and is distributed via the web.\n\n===Early Responses===\nThe first responses to the Goodwill Message were received in 1924, including one from the [[Archbishop of Uppsala]] in Sweden, Poland\u2019s Education Minister, Millaszewski [sic.]. A request was made once again in 1925 for responses to the Message be sent to the Rev. D.M.Davies at the offices of the League of Nations in Wales, 10 Richmond Terr, Park Place, [[Cardiff]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Responses were received from, amongst others [[L\u00e9on Bourgeois]] (a French leader and a left-leaning thinker), [[Paul Hymans]] (a Belgian liberal politician and the second General Secretary for the League of Nations) and [[Sir Eric Drummond]], General Secretary for the Union of Nations and the Education Ministers in Czechoslovakia and Finland. Perhaps unexpectedly a response was also received from \u201cSignior [[Mussolini]]\u201d, the [[fascist]] leader of Italy. In 1925 the first response was received from the USA to the Message, which came from Public School 6, [[Manhattan]], New York and an article about the initiative was printed in the December 1925 edition of the children\u2019s American magazine, Everyland.<ref name=\":2\" />  736 responses to the Peace and Goodwill Message in 1938. 124 came from the [[United States]], and 304 from Romania.\n\nThe responsibility for publishing the annual message was transferred to Urdd Gobaith Cymru in the 1950s.

The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]), on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, including the cities of [[Manisa]], [[Bal\u0131kesir]], [[Ayd\u0131n]], [[K\u00fctahya]], [[Bursa]] and [[Eski\u015fehir]]. Their advance was checked by Turkish forces at the [[Battle of Sakarya]] in 1921. The Greek front collapsed with the [[Great Offensive|Turkish counter-attack]] in August 1922, and the war effectively ended with the [[Turkish capture of Smyrna|recapture of Smyrna]] by Turkish forces and the [[great fire of Smyrna]].\n\nAs a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish National Movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving [[East Thrace]] and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Asia Minor, [[Istanbul]], and Eastern [[Thrace]]. The Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|a population exchange]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Geopolitical context===\n{{Main|Partition of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Further|Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne}}\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|left|158px|Map of [[Megali idea|Megali Idea]]]]\nThe geopolitical context of this conflict is linked to the partitioning of the [[Ottoman Empire]] which was a direct consequence of [[World War I]] and involvement of the Ottomans in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]]. The Greeks received an order to land in [[Izmir|Smyrna]] by the [[Triple Entente]] as part of the partition. During this war, the Ottoman government collapsed completely and the Ottoman Empire was divided amongst the victorious Entente powers with the signing of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] on August 10, 1920.\n\nThere were a number of secret agreements regarding the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I.

Before the occupation the Italian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, angry about the possibility of the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia, left the conference and did not return to Paris until May 5. The absence of the Italian delegation from the Conference ended up facilitating Lloyd George's efforts to persuade France and the United States to support Greece and prevent Italian operations in Western Anatolia.\n\nAccording to some historians, it was the Greek occupation of Smyrna that created the Turkish National movement. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] argues: \"The war between Turkey and Greece which burst out at this time was a defensive war for safeguarding of the Turkish homelands in Anatolia.

Greeks had lived in Asia Minor since antiquity, and before the outbreak of World War I, up to 2.5 million Greeks lived in the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Turkey Page 79\">Roberts, Thomas Duval. ''Area Handbook for the Republic of Turkey''. p. 79</ref> The suggestion that the Greeks constituted the majority of the population in the lands claimed by Greece has been contested by a number of historians. Cedric James Lowe and Michael L. Dockrill also argued that Greek claims about Smyrna were at best debatable, since Greeks constituted perhaps a bare majority, more likely a large minority in the [[Smyrna Vilayet]], \"which lay in an overwhelmingly Turkish Anatolia.\"{{Sfn | Lowe | Dockrill | 2002 | p = 367}} Precise demographics are further obscured by the Ottoman policy of dividing the population according to religion rather than descent, language, or self-identification. On the other hand, contemporaneous British and American statistics (1919) support the point that the Greek element was the most numerous in the region of Smyrna, counting 375,000, while Muslims were 325,000.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Zamir|first= Meir| title= Population Statistics of the Ottoman Empire in 1914 and 1919 | journal = Middle Eastern Studies|year=1981|volume=7|issue=1|pages= 85\u2013106|jstor= 4282818| doi=10.1080/00263208108700459}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Montgomery |first= AE |title= The Making of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres of 10 August 1920|journal = The Historical Journal | year=1972|volume=15|issue= 4|page=775|doi= 10.1017/S0018246X0000354X}}</ref>\n\nGreek Prime Minister Venizelos stated to a British newspaper that \"Greece is not making war against Islam, but against the anachronistic Ottoman Government, and its corrupt, ignominious, and bloody administration, with a view to expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of Greeks.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = Not War Against Islam \u2013 Statement by Greek Prime Minister | newspaper = [[The Scotsman]] | date = June 29, 1920 | page = 5}}.</ref>\n\nTo an extent, the above danger may have been overstated by Venizelos as a negotiating card on the table of S\u00e8vres, in order to gain the support of the Allied governments. For example, the [[Young Turks]] were not in power at the time of the war, which makes such a justification less straightforward. Most of the leaders of that regime had fled the country at the end of World War I and the Ottoman government in [[Constantinople]] was already under British control. Furthermore, Venizelos had already revealed his desires for annexation of territories from the Ottoman Empire in the early stages of World War I, before these massacres had taken place. In a letter sent to Greek [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]] in January 1915, he wrote that: \"I have the impression that the concessions to Greece in Asia Minor&nbsp;... would be so extensive that another equally large and not less rich Greece will be added to the doubled Greece which emerged from the victorious Balkan wars.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 35}}\n\nThrough its failure, the Greek invasion may have instead exacerbated the atrocities that it was supposed to prevent. Arnold J. Toynbee blamed the policies pursued by Great Britain and Greece, and the decisions of the Paris Peace conference as factors leading to the atrocities committed by both sides during and after the war: \"The Greeks of 'Pontus' and the Turks of the Greek occupied territories, were in some degree victims of Mr. Venizelos's and Mr. Lloyd George's original miscalculations at Paris.\"{{Sfn | Toynbee | 1922 | pp = 312\u201313}}\n\n===Greek irredentism===\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n[[File:Hellenism in the Near East 1918.jpg|thumb|right|195px|The Greek Kingdom and the Greek diaspora in the Balkans and western Asia Minor, according to a 1919 Greek map submitted to the Paris Peace Conference]]\nOne of the main motivations for initiating the war was to realize the Megali (Great) Idea, a core concept of Greek nationalism. The Megali Idea was an [[irredentist]] vision of a restoration of a Greater Greece on both sides of the Aegean that would incorporate territories with Greek populations outside the borders of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]], which was initially very small \u2014 roughly half the size of the present-day [[Republic of Greece]]. From the time of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, the Megali Idea had played a major role in Greek politics. Greek politicians, since the independence of the Greek state, had made several speeches on the issue of the \"historic inevitability of the expansion of the Greek Kingdom.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 3}} For instance, Greek politician Ioannis Kolettis voiced this conviction in the assembly in 1844: \"There are two great centres of Hellenism. Athens is the capital of the Kingdom. Constantinople is the great capital, the City, the dream and hope of all Greeks.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Great Idea was not merely the product of 19th century nationalism. It was, in one of its aspects, deeply rooted in many Greeks' religious consciousnesses. This aspect was the recovery of Constantinople for Christendom and the reestablishment of the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] which had fallen in 1453. \"Ever since this time the recovery of [[Hagia Sophia|St. Sophia]] and the City had been handed down from generation to generation as the destiny and aspiration of the Greek Orthodox.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 3}} The Megali Idea, besides Constantinople, included most traditional lands of the Greeks including [[Crete]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Cyprus]], the coastlands of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] on the [[Black Sea]]. Asia Minor was an essential part of the Greek world and an area of enduring Greek cultural dominance. In antiquity, from late [[Bronze Age]] up to the [[Roman empire|Roman conquest]], Greek city-states had even exercised political control of most of the region, except the period ca. 550\u2013470 BC when it was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaimenid Persian Empire]]. Later, during Middle Ages, the region had belonged to the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century, when the first [[Seljuk Turk]] raids reached it.\n\n===The National Schism in Greece===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n{{See also|National Schism}}\nThe National Schism in Greece was the deep split of Greek politics and society between two factions, the one led by Eleftherios Venizelos and the other by King Constantine, that predated World War I but escalated significantly over the decision on which side Greece should support during the war.\n\nThe United Kingdom had hoped that strategic considerations might persuade Constantine to join the cause of the Allies, but the King and his supporters insisted on strict neutrality, especially whilst the outcome of the conflict was hard to predict. In addition, family ties and emotional attachments made it difficult for Constantine to decide which side to support during World War I. The King's dilemma was further increased when the [[Ottomans]] and the [[Bulgarians]], both having grievances and aspirations against the Greek Kingdom, joined the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThough Constantine did remain decidedly neutral, [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|Prime Minister of Greece]] Eleftherios Venizelos had from an early point decided that Greece's interests would be best served by joining the Entente and started diplomatic efforts with the Allies to prepare the ground for concessions following an eventual victory. The disagreement and the subsequent dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two, which spilled over into their followers and the wider Greek society. Greece became divided into two radically opposed political camps, as Venizelos set up a separate state in Northern Greece, and eventually, with Allied support, forced the King to abdicate. In May 1917, after the exile of Constantine, Veniz\u00e9los returned to [[Athens]] and allied with the Entente. Greek military forces (though divided between supporters of the monarchy and supporters of \"[[Venizelism]]\") began to take part in military operations against the [[Military of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Army]] on the border.\n\nThe act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post\u2013World War I Greece. The country's foremost political formations, the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalists, already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre-war politics, reached a state of outright hatred towards each other. Both parties viewed the other's actions during the First World War as politically illegitimate and treasonous. This enmity inevitably spread throughout Greek society, creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the failed [[Asia Minor]] campaign and resulted in much social unrest in the inter war years.\n\n==Greek expansion==\n[[File:Greco Turkish War 1919-1922.svg|right|thumb|240px|Map of the military developments until August 1922]]\nThe military aspect of the war began with the [[Armistice of Mudros]]. The military operations of the Greco-Turkish war can be roughly divided into three main phases: the first phase, spanning the period from May 1919 to October 1920, encompassed the Greek Landings in Asia Minor and their consolidation along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] Coast. The second phase lasted from October 1920 to August 1921, and was characterised by Greek offensive operations. The third and final phase lasted until August 1922, when the strategic initiative was held by the Turkish Army.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Landing at Smyrna (May 1919)===\n{{Main|Greek landing at Smyrna}}\n[[File:Greek occupation troops landing on Smyrna.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Arrival of Crown Prince [[George II of Greece|George]] in Smyrna, 1919]]\n[[File:Izmir15Mayis1919.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] soldiers taking their posts in Smyrna ({{lang-tr|Izmir}}) amidst the jubilant ethnic Greek population of the city, 15 May 1919]]\nOn May 15, 1919, twenty thousand{{Sfn |Kinross|1960|p= 154}} Greek soldiers landed in Smyrna and took control of the city and its surroundings under cover of the Greek, French, and British navies.

The overall strategic objective of these operations, which were met by increasingly stiff Turkish resistance, was to provide strategic depth to the defence of Izmir (Smyrna). To that end, the Greek zone of occupation was extended over all of Western and most of North-Western Anatolia.\n\n===Treaty of S\u00e8vres (August 1920)===\n{{Main|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|left|270px|thumb|Partition of the [[Ottoman Empire]] according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]]]\nIn return for the contribution of the Greek army on the side of the Allies, the Allies supported the assignment of eastern Thrace and the millet of Smyrna to Greece. This treaty ended the First World War in Asia Minor and, at the same time, sealed the fate of the Ottoman Empire. Henceforth, the Ottoman Empire would no longer be a European power.\n\nOn August 10, 1920, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of S\u00e8vres ceding to Greece Thrace, up to the [[\u00c7atalca#Modern period|Chatalja lines]]. More importantly, Turkey renounced to Greece all rights over Imbros and Tenedos, retaining the small territories of Constantinople, the islands of Marmara, and \"a tiny strip of European territory\". The Straits of Bosporus were placed under an International Commission, as they were now open to all.\n\nTurkey was furthermore forced to transfer to Greece \"the exercise of her rights of sovereignty\" over Smyrna in addition to \"a considerable Hinterland, merely retaining a 'flag over an outer fort'.\" Though Greece administered the Smyrna enclave, its sovereignty remained, nominally, with the Sultan. According to the provisions of the Treaty, Smyrna was to maintain a local parliament and, if within five years time she asked to be incorporated within the Kingdom of Greece, the provision was made that the League of Nations would hold a plebiscite to decide on such matters.\n\nThe treaty was never ratified by the Ottoman Empire<ref name=\"Sunga\">{{cite book| last = Sunga| first = Lyal S.| title = Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations| date = 1992-01-01| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff| isbn = 978-0-7923-1453-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bernhardsson\">{{cite book|last = Bernhardsson |first=Magnus |title=Reclaiming a Plundered Past: Archaeology and Nation Building in Modern Iraq | date =2005-12-20 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-70947-8}}</ref> nor Greece.<ref name=\"www2.mfa.gr\">{{Citation|place=[[Kingdom of Greece|GR]] |url=http://www2.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/3E053BC1-EB11-404A-BA3E-A4B861C647EC/0/1923_lausanne_treaty.doc |title=Treaty of Lausanne |date=24 July 1923 |publisher=MFA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629163221/http://www2.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/3E053BC1-EB11-404A-BA3E-A4B861C647EC/0/1923_lausanne_treaty.doc |archivedate=29 June 2007 }}.</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Greek advance (October 1920)===\nIn October 1920, the Greek army advanced further east into Anatolia, with the encouragement of Lloyd George, who intended to increase pressure on the Turkish and Ottoman governments to sign the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. This advance began under the Liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, but soon after the offensive began, Venizelos fell from power and was replaced by [[Dimitrios Gounaris]]. The strategic objective of these operations was to defeat the Turkish Nationalists and force [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] into peace negotiations. The advancing Greeks, still holding superiority in numbers and modern equipment at this point, had hoped for an early battle in which they were confident of breaking up ill-equipped Turkish forces. Yet they met with little resistance, as the Turks managed to retreat in an orderly fashion and avoid encirclement.

The anti-Venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government, which, due to the war, had stayed in power without elections since 1915. At the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in Asia Minor, without though presenting a clear plan as to how this would happen. On the contrary, Venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not seem to go anywhere. The majority of the Greek people were both war-weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the Venizelists, so opted for change. To the surprise of many, Venizelos won only 118 out of the total 369 seats. The crushing defeat obliged Venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country. To this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned.\n\nThe new government under Dimitrios Gounaris prepared for a plebiscite on the return of [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]]. Noting the King's hostile stance during World War I, the Allies warned the Greek government that if he should be returned to the throne they would cut off all financial and military aid to Greece .{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nA month later a plebiscite called for the return of King Constantine. Soon after his return, the King replaced many of the World War I Venizelist officers and appointed inexperienced monarchist officers to senior positions. The leadership of the campaign was given to [[Anastasios Papoulas]], while King Constantine himself assumed nominally the overall command. The High Commissioner in Smyrna, [[Aristeidis Stergiadis]], however was not removed. In addition, many of the remaining Venizelist officers resigned, appalled by the regime change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nA group of officers, headed by [[Georgios Kondylis]], formed in Constantinople a \"National Defence\" organization, which reinforced with Venizelist deserters, soon started to criticize the royalist government of Athens.\n\nThe Greek Army which had secured Smyrna and the Asia Minor coast was purged of most of Venizelos's supporters, while it marched on Ankara. However, tension inside the Army between the two factions remained.\n\n===Battles of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc (December 1920&nbsp;\u2013 March 1921)===\n{{Main|First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc|Second Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc}}\n[[File:Fronts during the Turkish War of Independence.jpg|260px|left|thumb|Map showing the advance of the Greek army on the western front]]\nBy December 1920, the Greeks had advanced on two fronts, approaching Eski\u015fehir from the North West and from Smyrna, and had consolidated their occupation zone. In early 1921 they resumed their advance with small scale reconnaissance incursions that met stiff resistance from entrenched Turkish Nationalists, who were increasingly better prepared and equipped as a regular army.\n\nThe Greek advance was halted for the first time at the [[First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] on January 11, 1921. Even though this was a minor confrontation involving only one Greek division, it held political significance for the fledgling Turkish revolutionaries. This development led to Allied proposals to amend the Treaty of S\u00e8vres at a [[Conference of London|conference in London]] where both the Turkish Revolutionary and Ottoman governments were represented.\n\nAlthough some agreements were reached with Italy, France and Britain, the decisions were not agreed to by the Greek government, who believed that they still retained the strategic advantage and could yet negotiate from a stronger position. The Greeks initiated another attack on March 27, the [[Second Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]], where the Turkish troops fiercely resisted and finally defeated the Greeks on March 30. The British favoured a Greek territorial expansion but refused to offer any military assistance in order to avoid provoking the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Turkish forces received arms assistance from [[Soviet Russia]].<ref>Stone, David R., \"Soviet Arms Exports in the 1920s,\" 'Journal of Contemporary History,' 2013, Vol.48(1), pp.57-77</ref>\n\n===Shift of support towards Turkish Revolutionaries===\n{{Main|Conference of London (1920)}}\n{{See also|Treaty of Alexandropol|Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Moscow (1921)}}\nBy this time all other fronts had been settled in favour of the Turks,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} freeing more resources for the main threat of the Greek Army.

The plan of the Greeks was to cut Anatolia in two, as the above towns were on the main rail-lines connecting the hinterland with the coast. Eventually, after breaking the stiff Turkish defences, they occupied these strategically important centres. Instead of pursuing and decisively crippling the nationalists' military capacity, the Greek Army halted. In consequence, and despite their defeat, the Turks managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on the east of the [[Sakarya River]], where they organised their last line of defence.\n\nThis was the major decision that sealed the fate of the Greek campaign in Anatolia. The state and Army leadership, including King Constantine, Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, and General [[Anastasios Papoulas]], met at K\u00fctahya where they debated the future of the campaign. The Greeks, with their faltering morale rejuvenated, failed to appraise the strategic situation that favoured the defending side; instead, pressed for a 'final solution', the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue the Turks and attack their last line of defence close to Ankara. The military leadership was cautious and requested for more reinforcements and time to prepare, but did not go against the politicians. Only a few voices supported a defensive stance, including [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. Constantine by this time had little actual power and did not argue either way. After a delay of almost a month that gave time to the Turks to organise their defence, seven of the Greek divisions crossed east of the Sakarya River.\n\n===Battle of Sakarya (August and September 1921)===\n{{Main|Battle of Sakarya}}\n[[File:Battle of Sangarios 1921.png|thumb|240px|Greek lithograph depicting the Battle of Sakarya]]\nFollowing the retreat of the Turkish troops under Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc in the battle of K\u00fctahya-Eski\u015fehir the Greek Army advanced afresh to the Sakarya River (Sangarios in Greek), less than {{convert|100|km|mi}} west of [[Ankara]]. Constantine's battle cry was \"to Angira\" and the British officers were invited, in anticipation, to a victory dinner in the city of Kemal.{{Sfn |Kinross|1960|p=275}} It was envisaged that the Turkish Revolutionaries, who had consistently avoided encirclement would be drawn into battle in defence of their capital and destroyed in a battle of attrition.\n\nDespite the Soviet help, supplies were short as the Turkish army prepared to meet the Greeks. Owners of private rifles, guns and ammunition had to surrender them to the army and every household was required to provide a pair of underclothing and sandals.{{Sfn |Shaw|Shaw|1977|p=360}} Meanwhile, the Turkish parliament, not happy with the performance of Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc as the Commander of the Western Front, wanted Mustafa Kemal and Chief of General Staff [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]] to take control.\n\n[[File:Turkish prisoners at work in a POW camp Aug 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Turkish prisoners at work in a POW camp, August 1921]]\n\nGreek forces marched {{convert|200|km|mi}} for a week through the desert to reach attack positions, so the Turks could see them coming. Food supplies were 40 tons of bread and salt, sugar and tea, the rest to be found on the way.<ref>Greek Army General Staff, The Minor Asia Campagne, volume 5th, The Angora Campagne, Athens, 1986</ref>\n\nThe advance of the Greek Army faced fierce resistance which culminated in the 21-day [[Battle of Sakarya]] (August 23 \u2013 September 13, 1921). The Turkish defense positions were centred on series of heights, and the Greeks had to storm and occupy them. The Turks held certain hilltops and lost others, while some were lost and recaptured several times over. Yet the Turks had to conserve men, for the Greeks held the numerical advantage.{{Sfn | Kinross | 1960|p=277}} The crucial moment came when the Greek army tried to take [[Haymana, Ankara|Haymana]], {{convert|40|km|mi}} south of Ankara, but the Turks held out. Greek advances into Anatolia had lengthened their lines of supply and communication and they were running out of ammunition. The ferocity of the battle exhausted both sides but the Greeks were the first to withdraw to their previous lines. The thunder of cannon was plainly heard in Ankara throughout the battle.\n\nThat was the furthest in Anatolia the Greeks would advance, and within a few weeks they withdrew in an orderly manner back to the lines that they had held in June. The Turkish Parliament awarded both Mustafa Kemal and [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]] with the title of [[Field Marshal]] for their service in this battle. To this day no other person has received this five-star general title from the [[Turkish Republic]].\n\n===Stalemate (September 1921&nbsp;\u2013 August 1922)===\n{{Main|Conference of London#Second stage}}\n[[File:Western Front 31 March 1922.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Mustafa Kemal's visit to [[\u00c7ay]].

In accordance with this decision, under successive treaties, the Italian and French troops evacuated their positions, leaving the Greeks exposed.\n\nIn March 1922, the Allies proposed an armistice. Feeling that he now held the strategic advantage, Mustafa Kemal declined any settlement while the Greeks remained in Anatolia and intensified his efforts to re-organise the Turkish military for the final offensive against the Greeks. At the same time, the Greeks strengthened their defensive positions, but were increasingly demoralised by the inactivity of remaining on the defensive and the prolongation of the war. The Greek government was desperate to get some military support by the British or at least secure a loan, so it developed an ill-thought plan to force the British diplomatically, by threatening their positions in Constantinople, but this never materialised. The occupation of Constantinople would have been an easy task at this time because the Allied troops garrisoned there were much fewer than the Greek forces in Thrace (two divisions). The end result though was instead to weaken the Greek defences in Smyrna by withdrawing troops. The Turkish forces, on the other hand, were recipients of significant assistance from Soviet Russia. On 29 April, the Soviet authorities supplied the Turkish consul critical quantities of arms and ammunition, sufficient for three Turkish divisions. On 3 May, the Soviet government handed over 33,500,000 gold rubles to Turkey\u2014the balance of the credit of 10,000,000 gold rubles.<ref name=\"Kapur\">Kapur, H. ''Soviet Russia and Asia, 1917\u20131927, p. 114''.</ref>\n\nVoices in Greece increasingly called for withdrawal, and demoralizing propaganda spread among the troops. Some of the removed Venizelist officers organised a movement of \"National Defense\" and planned a coup to secede from Athens, but never gained Venizelos's endorsement and all their actions remained fruitless.\n\nHistorian [[Malcolm Yapp]] wrote that:<ref name=\"M.E.

The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]), on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, including the cities of [[Manisa]], [[Bal\u0131kesir]], [[Ayd\u0131n]], [[K\u00fctahya]], [[Bursa]] and [[Eski\u015fehir]]. Their advance was checked by Turkish forces at the [[Battle of Sakarya]] in 1921. The Greek front collapsed with the [[Great Offensive|Turkish counter-attack]] in August 1922, and the war effectively ended with the [[Turkish capture of Smyrna|recapture of Smyrna]] by Turkish forces and the [[great fire of Smyrna]].\n\nAs a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish National Movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving [[East Thrace]] and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Asia Minor, [[Istanbul]], and Eastern [[Thrace]]. The Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|a population exchange]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Geopolitical context===\n{{Main|Partition of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Further|Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne}}\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|left|158px|Map of [[Megali idea|Megali Idea]]]]\nThe geopolitical context of this conflict is linked to the partitioning of the [[Ottoman Empire]] which was a direct consequence of [[World War I]] and involvement of the Ottomans in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]]. The Greeks received an order to land in [[Izmir|Smyrna]] by the [[Triple Entente]] as part of the partition. During this war, the Ottoman government collapsed completely and the Ottoman Empire was divided amongst the victorious Entente powers with the signing of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] on August 10, 1920.\n\nThere were a number of secret agreements regarding the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. The Triple Entente had made contradictory promises about post-war arrangements concerning Greek hopes in [[Asia Minor]].<ref name = \"Steven W.

Before the occupation the Italian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, angry about the possibility of the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia, left the conference and did not return to Paris until May 5. The absence of the Italian delegation from the Conference ended up facilitating Lloyd George's efforts to persuade France and the United States to support Greece and prevent Italian operations in Western Anatolia.\n\nAccording to some historians, it was the Greek occupation of Smyrna that created the Turkish National movement. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] argues: \"The war between Turkey and Greece which burst out at this time was a defensive war for safeguarding of the Turkish homelands in Anatolia. It was a result of the Allied policy of imperialism operating in a foreign state, the military resources and powers of which were seriously under-estimated; it was provoked by the unwarranted invasion of a Greek army of occupation.\"<ref name=\"Arnold J 1926, p. 94\">{{Citation | first1 = Arnold J | last1 = Toynbee | author1-link = Arnold J.

Greeks had lived in Asia Minor since antiquity, and before the outbreak of World War I, up to 2.5 million Greeks lived in the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Turkey Page 79\">Roberts, Thomas Duval. ''Area Handbook for the Republic of Turkey''. p. 79</ref> The suggestion that the Greeks constituted the majority of the population in the lands claimed by Greece has been contested by a number of historians. Cedric James Lowe and Michael L. Dockrill also argued that Greek claims about Smyrna were at best debatable, since Greeks constituted perhaps a bare majority, more likely a large minority in the [[Smyrna Vilayet]], \"which lay in an overwhelmingly Turkish Anatolia.\"{{Sfn | Lowe | Dockrill | 2002 | p = 367}} Precise demographics are further obscured by the Ottoman policy of dividing the population according to religion rather than descent, language, or self-identification. On the other hand, contemporaneous British and American statistics (1919) support the point that the Greek element was the most numerous in the region of Smyrna, counting 375,000, while Muslims were 325,000.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Zamir|first= Meir| title= Population Statistics of the Ottoman Empire in 1914 and 1919 | journal = Middle Eastern Studies|year=1981|volume=7|issue=1|pages= 85\u2013106|jstor= 4282818| doi=10.1080/00263208108700459}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Montgomery |first= AE |title= The Making of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres of 10 August 1920|journal = The Historical Journal | year=1972|volume=15|issue= 4|page=775|doi= 10.1017/S0018246X0000354X}}</ref>\n\nGreek Prime Minister Venizelos stated to a British newspaper that \"Greece is not making war against Islam, but against the anachronistic Ottoman Government, and its corrupt, ignominious, and bloody administration, with a view to expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of Greeks.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = Not War Against Islam \u2013 Statement by Greek Prime Minister | newspaper = [[The Scotsman]] | date = June 29, 1920 | page = 5}}.</ref>\n\nTo an extent, the above danger may have been overstated by Venizelos as a negotiating card on the table of S\u00e8vres, in order to gain the support of the Allied governments. For example, the [[Young Turks]] were not in power at the time of the war, which makes such a justification less straightforward. Most of the leaders of that regime had fled the country at the end of World War I and the Ottoman government in [[Constantinople]] was already under British control. Furthermore, Venizelos had already revealed his desires for annexation of territories from the Ottoman Empire in the early stages of World War I, before these massacres had taken place. In a letter sent to Greek [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]] in January 1915, he wrote that: \"I have the impression that the concessions to Greece in Asia Minor&nbsp;... would be so extensive that another equally large and not less rich Greece will be added to the doubled Greece which emerged from the victorious Balkan wars.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 35}}\n\nThrough its failure, the Greek invasion may have instead exacerbated the atrocities that it was supposed to prevent. Arnold J. Toynbee blamed the policies pursued by Great Britain and Greece, and the decisions of the Paris Peace conference as factors leading to the atrocities committed by both sides during and after the war: \"The Greeks of 'Pontus' and the Turks of the Greek occupied territories, were in some degree victims of Mr. Venizelos's and Mr. Lloyd George's original miscalculations at Paris.\"{{Sfn | Toynbee | 1922 | pp = 312\u201313}}\n\n===Greek irredentism===\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n[[File:Hellenism in the Near East 1918.jpg|thumb|right|195px|The Greek Kingdom and the Greek diaspora in the Balkans and western Asia Minor, according to a 1919 Greek map submitted to the Paris Peace Conference]]\nOne of the main motivations for initiating the war was to realize the Megali (Great) Idea, a core concept of Greek nationalism. The Megali Idea was an [[irredentist]] vision of a restoration of a Greater Greece on both sides of the Aegean that would incorporate territories with Greek populations outside the borders of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]], which was initially very small \u2014 roughly half the size of the present-day [[Republic of Greece]]. From the time of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, the Megali Idea had played a major role in Greek politics. Greek politicians, since the independence of the Greek state, had made several speeches on the issue of the \"historic inevitability of the expansion of the Greek Kingdom.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 3}} For instance, Greek politician Ioannis Kolettis voiced this conviction in the assembly in 1844: \"There are two great centres of Hellenism. Athens is the capital of the Kingdom. Constantinople is the great capital, the City, the dream and hope of all Greeks.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Great Idea was not merely the product of 19th century nationalism. It was, in one of its aspects, deeply rooted in many Greeks' religious consciousnesses. This aspect was the recovery of Constantinople for Christendom and the reestablishment of the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] which had fallen in 1453. \"Ever since this time the recovery of [[Hagia Sophia|St. Sophia]] and the City had been handed down from generation to generation as the destiny and aspiration of the Greek Orthodox.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 3}} The Megali Idea, besides Constantinople, included most traditional lands of the Greeks including [[Crete]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Cyprus]], the coastlands of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] on the [[Black Sea]]. Asia Minor was an essential part of the Greek world and an area of enduring Greek cultural dominance. In antiquity, from late [[Bronze Age]] up to the [[Roman empire|Roman conquest]], Greek city-states had even exercised political control of most of the region, except the period ca. 550\u2013470 BC when it was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaimenid Persian Empire]]. Later, during Middle Ages, the region had belonged to the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century, when the first [[Seljuk Turk]] raids reached it.\n\n===The National Schism in Greece===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n{{See also|National Schism}}\nThe National Schism in Greece was the deep split of Greek politics and society between two factions, the one led by Eleftherios Venizelos and the other by King Constantine, that predated World War I but escalated significantly over the decision on which side Greece should support during the war.\n\nThe United Kingdom had hoped that strategic considerations might persuade Constantine to join the cause of the Allies, but the King and his supporters insisted on strict neutrality, especially whilst the outcome of the conflict was hard to predict. In addition, family ties and emotional attachments made it difficult for Constantine to decide which side to support during World War I. The King's dilemma was further increased when the [[Ottomans]] and the [[Bulgarians]], both having grievances and aspirations against the Greek Kingdom, joined the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThough Constantine did remain decidedly neutral, [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|Prime Minister of Greece]] Eleftherios Venizelos had from an early point decided that Greece's interests would be best served by joining the Entente and started diplomatic efforts with the Allies to prepare the ground for concessions following an eventual victory. The disagreement and the subsequent dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two, which spilled over into their followers and the wider Greek society. Greece became divided into two radically opposed political camps, as Venizelos set up a separate state in Northern Greece, and eventually, with Allied support, forced the King to abdicate. In May 1917, after the exile of Constantine, Veniz\u00e9los returned to [[Athens]] and allied with the Entente. Greek military forces (though divided between supporters of the monarchy and supporters of \"[[Venizelism]]\") began to take part in military operations against the [[Military of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Army]] on the border.\n\nThe act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post\u2013World War I Greece. The country's foremost political formations, the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalists, already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre-war politics, reached a state of outright hatred towards each other. Both parties viewed the other's actions during the First World War as politically illegitimate and treasonous. This enmity inevitably spread throughout Greek society, creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the failed [[Asia Minor]] campaign and resulted in much social unrest in the inter war years.\n\n==Greek expansion==\n[[File:Greco Turkish War 1919-1922.svg|right|thumb|240px|Map of the military developments until August 1922]]\nThe military aspect of the war began with the [[Armistice of Mudros]]. The military operations of the Greco-Turkish war can be roughly divided into three main phases: the first phase, spanning the period from May 1919 to October 1920, encompassed the Greek Landings in Asia Minor and their consolidation along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] Coast. The second phase lasted from October 1920 to August 1921, and was characterised by Greek offensive operations. The third and final phase lasted until August 1922, when the strategic initiative was held by the Turkish Army.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Landing at Smyrna (May 1919)===\n{{Main|Greek landing at Smyrna}}\n[[File:Greek occupation troops landing on Smyrna.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Arrival of Crown Prince [[George II of Greece|George]] in Smyrna, 1919]]\n[[File:Izmir15Mayis1919.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] soldiers taking their posts in Smyrna ({{lang-tr|Izmir}}) amidst the jubilant ethnic Greek population of the city, 15 May 1919]]\nOn May 15, 1919, twenty thousand{{Sfn |Kinross|1960|p= 154}} Greek soldiers landed in Smyrna and took control of the city and its surroundings under cover of the Greek, French, and British navies.

The overall strategic objective of these operations, which were met by increasingly stiff Turkish resistance, was to provide strategic depth to the defence of Izmir (Smyrna). To that end, the Greek zone of occupation was extended over all of Western and most of North-Western Anatolia.\n\n===Treaty of S\u00e8vres (August 1920)===\n{{Main|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|left|270px|thumb|Partition of the [[Ottoman Empire]] according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]]]\nIn return for the contribution of the Greek army on the side of the Allies, the Allies supported the assignment of eastern Thrace and the millet of Smyrna to Greece. This treaty ended the First World War in Asia Minor and, at the same time, sealed the fate of the Ottoman Empire. Henceforth, the Ottoman Empire would no longer be a European power.\n\nOn August 10, 1920, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of S\u00e8vres ceding to Greece Thrace, up to the [[\u00c7atalca#Modern period|Chatalja lines]]. More importantly, Turkey renounced to Greece all rights over Imbros and Tenedos, retaining the small territories of Constantinople, the islands of Marmara, and \"a tiny strip of European territory\". The Straits of Bosporus were placed under an International Commission, as they were now open to all.\n\nTurkey was furthermore forced to transfer to Greece \"the exercise of her rights of sovereignty\" over Smyrna in addition to \"a considerable Hinterland, merely retaining a 'flag over an outer fort'.\" Though Greece administered the Smyrna enclave, its sovereignty remained, nominally, with the Sultan. According to the provisions of the Treaty, Smyrna was to maintain a local parliament and, if within five years time she asked to be incorporated within the Kingdom of Greece, the provision was made that the League of Nations would hold a plebiscite to decide on such matters.\n\nThe treaty was never ratified by the Ottoman Empire<ref name=\"Sunga\">{{cite book| last = Sunga| first = Lyal S.| title = Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations| date = 1992-01-01| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff| isbn = 978-0-7923-1453-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bernhardsson\">{{cite book|last = Bernhardsson |first=Magnus |title=Reclaiming a Plundered Past: Archaeology and Nation Building in Modern Iraq | date =2005-12-20 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-70947-8}}</ref> nor Greece.<ref name=\"www2.mfa.gr\">{{Citation|place=[[Kingdom of Greece|GR]] |url=http://www2.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/3E053BC1-EB11-404A-BA3E-A4B861C647EC/0/1923_lausanne_treaty.doc |title=Treaty of Lausanne |date=24 July 1923 |publisher=MFA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629163221/http://www2.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/3E053BC1-EB11-404A-BA3E-A4B861C647EC/0/1923_lausanne_treaty.doc |archivedate=29 June 2007 }}.</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Greek advance (October 1920)===\nIn October 1920, the Greek army advanced further east into Anatolia, with the encouragement of Lloyd George, who intended to increase pressure on the Turkish and Ottoman governments to sign the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. This advance began under the Liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, but soon after the offensive began, Venizelos fell from power and was replaced by [[Dimitrios Gounaris]]. The strategic objective of these operations was to defeat the Turkish Nationalists and force [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] into peace negotiations. The advancing Greeks, still holding superiority in numbers and modern equipment at this point, had hoped for an early battle in which they were confident of breaking up ill-equipped Turkish forces. Yet they met with little resistance, as the Turks managed to retreat in an orderly fashion and avoid encirclement. Churchill said: \"The Greek columns trailed along the country roads passing safely through many ugly [[Defile (geography)|defiles]], and at their approach the Turks, under strong and sagacious leadership, vanished into the recesses of Anatolia.\"{{Sfn | Kinross|1960| p = 233}}\n\n===Change in Greek government (November 1920)===\n[[File:Papoulas Anastasios.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Anastasios Papoulas]], commander-in-chief of the Greek [[Army of Asia Minor]]]]\nDuring October 1920, [[Alexander of Greece|King Alexander]], who had been installed on the Greek throne on 11 June 1917 when his father Constantine was pushed into exile by the Venizelists, was bitten by a monkey kept at the Royal Gardens and died within days from [[sepsis]].<ref name= \"ahistoryofgreece.com\">{{cite web| url = http://www.ahistoryofgreece.com/venizelos.htm | work = A history of Greece | title = Venizelos and the Asia Minor Catastrophe |accessdate = 2008-09-03}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2008}}</ref> After King Alexander died without heirs, the general elections scheduled to be held on November 1, 1920, suddenly became the focus of a new conflict between the supporters of Venizelos and the Royalists. The anti-Venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government, which, due to the war, had stayed in power without elections since 1915. At the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in Asia Minor, without though presenting a clear plan as to how this would happen. On the contrary, Venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not seem to go anywhere. The majority of the Greek people were both war-weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the Venizelists, so opted for change. To the surprise of many, Venizelos won only 118 out of the total 369 seats. The crushing defeat obliged Venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country. To this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned.\n\nThe new government under Dimitrios Gounaris prepared for a plebiscite on the return of [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]]. Noting the King's hostile stance during World War I, the Allies warned the Greek government that if he should be returned to the throne they would cut off all financial and military aid to Greece .{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nA month later a plebiscite called for the return of King Constantine. Soon after his return, the King replaced many of the World War I Venizelist officers and appointed inexperienced monarchist officers to senior positions. The leadership of the campaign was given to [[Anastasios Papoulas]], while King Constantine himself assumed nominally the overall command. The High Commissioner in Smyrna, [[Aristeidis Stergiadis]], however was not removed. In addition, many of the remaining Venizelist officers resigned, appalled by the regime change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nA group of officers, headed by [[Georgios Kondylis]], formed in Constantinople a \"National Defence\" organization, which reinforced with Venizelist deserters, soon started to criticize the royalist government of Athens.\n\nThe Greek Army which had secured Smyrna and the Asia Minor coast was purged of most of Venizelos's supporters, while it marched on Ankara. However, tension inside the Army between the two factions remained.\n\n===Battles of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc (December 1920&nbsp;\u2013 March 1921)===\n{{Main|First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc|Second Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc}}\n[[File:Fronts during the Turkish War of Independence.jpg|260px|left|thumb|Map showing the advance of the Greek army on the western front]]\nBy December 1920, the Greeks had advanced on two fronts, approaching Eski\u015fehir from the North West and from Smyrna, and had consolidated their occupation zone. In early 1921 they resumed their advance with small scale reconnaissance incursions that met stiff resistance from entrenched Turkish Nationalists, who were increasingly better prepared and equipped as a regular army.\n\nThe Greek advance was halted for the first time at the [[First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] on January 11, 1921. Even though this was a minor confrontation involving only one Greek division, it held political significance for the fledgling Turkish revolutionaries. This development led to Allied proposals to amend the Treaty of S\u00e8vres at a [[Conference of London|conference in London]] where both the Turkish Revolutionary and Ottoman governments were represented.\n\nAlthough some agreements were reached with Italy, France and Britain, the decisions were not agreed to by the Greek government, who believed that they still retained the strategic advantage and could yet negotiate from a stronger position. The Greeks initiated another attack on March 27, the [[Second Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]], where the Turkish troops fiercely resisted and finally defeated the Greeks on March 30. The British favoured a Greek territorial expansion but refused to offer any military assistance in order to avoid provoking the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Turkish forces received arms assistance from [[Soviet Russia]].<ref>Stone, David R., \"Soviet Arms Exports in the 1920s,\" 'Journal of Contemporary History,' 2013, Vol.48(1), pp.57-77</ref>\n\n===Shift of support towards Turkish Revolutionaries===\n{{Main|Conference of London (1920)}}\n{{See also|Treaty of Alexandropol|Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Moscow (1921)}}\nBy this time all other fronts had been settled in favour of the Turks,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} freeing more resources for the main threat of the Greek Army.

The plan of the Greeks was to cut Anatolia in two, as the above towns were on the main rail-lines connecting the hinterland with the coast. Eventually, after breaking the stiff Turkish defences, they occupied these strategically important centres. Instead of pursuing and decisively crippling the nationalists' military capacity, the Greek Army halted. In consequence, and despite their defeat, the Turks managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on the east of the [[Sakarya River]], where they organised their last line of defence.\n\nThis was the major decision that sealed the fate of the Greek campaign in Anatolia. The state and Army leadership, including King Constantine, Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, and General [[Anastasios Papoulas]], met at K\u00fctahya where they debated the future of the campaign. The Greeks, with their faltering morale rejuvenated, failed to appraise the strategic situation that favoured the defending side; instead, pressed for a 'final solution', the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue the Turks and attack their last line of defence close to Ankara. The military leadership was cautious and requested for more reinforcements and time to prepare, but did not go against the politicians. Only a few voices supported a defensive stance, including [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. Constantine by this time had little actual power and did not argue either way. After a delay of almost a month that gave time to the Turks to organise their defence, seven of the Greek divisions crossed east of the Sakarya River.\n\n===Battle of Sakarya (August and September 1921)===\n{{Main|Battle of Sakarya}}\n[[File:Battle of Sangarios 1921.png|thumb|240px|Greek lithograph depicting the Battle of Sakarya]]\nFollowing the retreat of the Turkish troops under Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc in the battle of K\u00fctahya-Eski\u015fehir the Greek Army advanced afresh to the Sakarya River (Sangarios in Greek), less than {{convert|100|km|mi}} west of [[Ankara]]. Constantine's battle cry was \"to Angira\" and the British officers were invited, in anticipation, to a victory dinner in the city of Kemal.{{Sfn |Kinross|1960|p=275}} It was envisaged that the Turkish Revolutionaries, who had consistently avoided encirclement would be drawn into battle in defence of their capital and destroyed in a battle of attrition.\n\nDespite the Soviet help, supplies were short as the Turkish army prepared to meet the Greeks. Owners of private rifles, guns and ammunition had to surrender them to the army and every household was required to provide a pair of underclothing and sandals.{{Sfn |Shaw|Shaw|1977|p=360}} Meanwhile, the Turkish parliament, not happy with the performance of Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc as the Commander of the Western Front, wanted Mustafa Kemal and Chief of General Staff [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]] to take control.\n\n[[File:Turkish prisoners at work in a POW camp Aug 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Turkish prisoners at work in a POW camp, August 1921]]\n\nGreek forces marched {{convert|200|km|mi}} for a week through the desert to reach attack positions, so the Turks could see them coming. Food supplies were 40 tons of bread and salt, sugar and tea, the rest to be found on the way.<ref>Greek Army General Staff, The Minor Asia Campagne, volume 5th, The Angora Campagne, Athens, 1986</ref>\n\nThe advance of the Greek Army faced fierce resistance which culminated in the 21-day [[Battle of Sakarya]] (August 23 \u2013 September 13, 1921). The Turkish defense positions were centred on series of heights, and the Greeks had to storm and occupy them. The Turks held certain hilltops and lost others, while some were lost and recaptured several times over. Yet the Turks had to conserve men, for the Greeks held the numerical advantage.{{Sfn | Kinross | 1960|p=277}} The crucial moment came when the Greek army tried to take [[Haymana, Ankara|Haymana]], {{convert|40|km|mi}} south of Ankara, but the Turks held out. Greek advances into Anatolia had lengthened their lines of supply and communication and they were running out of ammunition. The ferocity of the battle exhausted both sides but the Greeks were the first to withdraw to their previous lines. The thunder of cannon was plainly heard in Ankara throughout the battle.\n\nThat was the furthest in Anatolia the Greeks would advance, and within a few weeks they withdrew in an orderly manner back to the lines that they had held in June. The Turkish Parliament awarded both Mustafa Kemal and [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]] with the title of [[Field Marshal]] for their service in this battle. To this day no other person has received this five-star general title from the [[Turkish Republic]].\n\n===Stalemate (September 1921&nbsp;\u2013 August 1922)===\n{{Main|Conference of London#Second stage}}\n[[File:Western Front 31 March 1922.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Mustafa Kemal's visit to [[\u00c7ay]].

In accordance with this decision, under successive treaties, the Italian and French troops evacuated their positions, leaving the Greeks exposed.\n\nIn March 1922, the Allies proposed an armistice. Feeling that he now held the strategic advantage, Mustafa Kemal declined any settlement while the Greeks remained in Anatolia and intensified his efforts to re-organise the Turkish military for the final offensive against the Greeks. At the same time, the Greeks strengthened their defensive positions, but were increasingly demoralised by the inactivity of remaining on the defensive and the prolongation of the war. The Greek government was desperate to get some military support by the British or at least secure a loan, so it developed an ill-thought plan to force the British diplomatically, by threatening their positions in Constantinople, but this never materialised. The occupation of Constantinople would have been an easy task at this time because the Allied troops garrisoned there were much fewer than the Greek forces in Thrace (two divisions). The end result though was instead to weaken the Greek defences in Smyrna by withdrawing troops. The Turkish forces, on the other hand, were recipients of significant assistance from Soviet Russia. On 29 April, the Soviet authorities supplied the Turkish consul critical quantities of arms and ammunition, sufficient for three Turkish divisions. On 3 May, the Soviet government handed over 33,500,000 gold rubles to Turkey\u2014the balance of the credit of 10,000,000 gold rubles.<ref name=\"Kapur\">Kapur, H. ''Soviet Russia and Asia, 1917\u20131927, p. 114''.</ref>\n\nVoices in Greece increasingly called for withdrawal, and demoralizing propaganda spread among the troops. Some of the removed Venizelist officers organised a movement of \"National Defense\" and planned a coup to secede from Athens, but never gained Venizelos's endorsement and all their actions remained fruitless.\n\nHistorian [[Malcolm Yapp]] wrote that:<ref name=\"M.E.

The Greek fleet left Constantinople upon his request. The British finally decided to force the Greeks to withdraw behind the [[Maritsa]] in Thrace.
