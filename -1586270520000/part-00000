Such a government could come into existence either through violent and compulsory [[world domination]] or through peaceful and voluntary [[supranational union]].\n\nThere has never been an [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], [[military]], or [[constitution]] with global jurisdiction. The [[United Nations]], beyond the [[United Nations Security Council]] (which has the ability to issue mandatory resolutions), is limited to a mostly advisory role, and its stated purpose is to foster cooperation between existing [[nation]]al governments rather than exert authority over them.\n\nNumerous fictional depictions exist however, such as the World State mentioned above and the \"Dictatorship of the Air\" in H. G. Wells ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]''.\n\n==History==\n===Origins of the idea===\nThe idea and aspiration of world government has been known since the dawn of history. [[Bronze Age]] Egyptian Kings aimed to rule \"All That the Sun Encircles\", Mesopotamian Kings \"All from the Sunrise to the Sunset\", and ancient Chinese and Japanese Emperors \"All under Heaven\". These four civilizations developed impressive cultures of [[Great Unity]], or Da Yitong as the Chinese put it.

O human race! what tempests must need toss thee, what treasure be thrown into the sea, what shipwrecks must be endured, so long as thou, like a beast of many heads, strivest after diverse ends! Thou art sick in either intellect, and sick likewise in thy affection. Thou healest not thy high understanding by argument irrefutable, nor thy lower by the countenance of experience. Nor dost thou heal thy affection by the sweetness of divine persuasion, when the voice of the Holy Spirit breathes upon thee, \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!\"\" (''[[De Monarchia]]'', 16:1)\n\n===Francisco de Vitoria===\n{{Main|Francisco de Vitoria}}\n\nEarly father of international law, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (c. 1483\u20131546) is considered the \"founder of global political philosophy\". De Vitoria conceived of the ''res publica totius orbis'', or the \"republic of the whole world\".

In his essay, Kant describes three basic requirements for organizing human affairs to permanently abolish the threat of present and future war, and, thereby, help establish a new era of [[Perpetual peace|lasting peace]] throughout the world. Specifically, Kant described his proposed peace program as containing two steps.\n\nThe \"Preliminary Articles\" described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:\n\n# \"No Secret Treaty of Peace Shall Be Held Valid in Which There Is Tacitly Reserved Matter for a Future War\"\n# \"No Independent States, Large or Small, Shall Come under the Dominion of Another State by Inheritance, Exchange, Purchase, or Donation\"\n# \"[[Standing army|Standing Armies]] Shall in Time Be Totally Abolished\"\n# \"National Debts Shall Not Be Contracted with a View to the External Friction of States\"\n# \"No State Shall by Force Interfere with the Constitution or Government of Another State,\n# \"No State Shall, during War, Permit Such Acts of Hostility Which Would Make Mutual Confidence in the Subsequent Peace Impossible: Such Are the Employment of Assassins (percussores), Poisoners (venefici), Breach of Capitulation, and Incitement to Treason (perduellio) in the Opposing State\"\n\nThree Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace.\n\n# \"The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican\"\n# \"The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States\"\n# \"The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality\"\n\n===Johann Gottlieb Fichte===\nThe year of the battle at Jena (1806), when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] in ''[[Characteristics of the Present Age]]'' described what he perceived to be a very deep and dominant historical trend:\n\n{{quote|\nThere is necessary tendency in every cultivated State to extend itself generally...

Whether clearly or not\u2014it may be obscurely\u2014yet has this tendency lain at the root of the undertakings of many States in Modern Times...

On March 11, 1844, Smith organized a [[Council of Fifty]], who were to work under the direction of the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] authorities of his church, along with a [[Council of Friends]].

The increase in international trade at the turn of the 20th century accelerated the formation of international organizations, and, by the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, there were approximately 450 of them. Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during that period as well. The [[Institute of International Law]] was formed in 1873 by the Belgian Jurist [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss [[Johaan Bluntschli]] in 1866.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1883, [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] published \"The Institutes of the Law of Nations\" in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law. The first embryonic world [[parliament]], called the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], was organized in 1886 by Cremer and Passy, composed of legislators from many countries. In 1904 the Union formally proposed \"an international congress which should meet periodically to discuss international questions\".\n\n===H. G. Wells===\n[[H. G.

It will be \"a new social Hercules that will strangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle\".

At its largest size from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the [[Human rights|Rights of Man]], such as the rights of non-whites, women, and soldiers; [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing war through [[collective security]], settling disputes between countries through negotiation, [[diplomacy]], and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions and economic sanctions and provide an army, when needed. However, these powers proved reluctant to do so. Lacking many of the key elements necessary to maintain world peace, the League failed to prevent World War II. Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe. The rest of the Axis powers soon followed him. Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart. The League of Nations consisted of the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. Below these were many agencies. The Assembly was where delegates from all member states conferred. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.\n\n===World Communism===\nAccording to [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]], the capitalist epoch depends on the expansion of competing geopolitical markets across the planet, atomizing the global proletariat and thus sustaining economic disparity and rivalry between markets. Eventually, this will be succeeded by a Socialist epoch in which the working class throughout the world will unite to render national distinctiveness meaningless.\n\nAlthough [[world Communism]]'s long-term goal is a worldwide [[Communist society]] that is stateless, which would entail an absence of any government, many [[anti-Communism|anti-Communists]] (especially during the [[Cold War]]) have considered it naive to think that the [[world revolution]] advocated by international Communists would lead to [[world domination]] by a single government or an alliance of several, yielding a [[de facto]] world government of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.\n\nThe heyday of international Communism was the period from the end of World War I (the [[revolutions of 1917\u201323]]) through the 1950s, before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].\n\n===Halford Mackinder===\nAnticipating environmental movements for world unity, like [[Global Scenario Group]], and such concepts as the [[Planetary phase of civilization]] and [[Spaceship Earth]], British Geographer [[Sir Halford Mackinder]] wrote in 1931:\n{{quote| \nGradually as the arts of life improved, the forests were cleared and the marshes were drained, and the lesser natural regions were fused into greater. It may perhaps be thought that with the continuance of this process all mankind will be in the end unified \u2026 Unless I mistake, it is the message of geography that international cooperation in any future that we need consider must be based on the federal idea. If our civilization is not to go down in blind internecine conflict, there must be a development of world planning out of regional planning, just as regional planning has come from town planning.<ref>\"The Human Habitat,\" ''Scottish Geographical Magazine'', 47, (1931): p 333, also 335.</ref>}}\n\n===Lionel George Curtis===\n[[Lionel George Curtis]] was a British official and author.

He fought in the [[Second Boer War]] with the [[City Imperial Volunteers]] and served as secretary to [[Lord Milner]] (a position that had also been held by adventure-novelist [[John Buchan]]), during which time he dedicated himself to working for a united self-governing South Africa. His experience of World War One and the rise of Hitler led him to conceptualize his version of a [[Federal World Government]], which became his life work.\n\n===World War II===\n{{Further|New Order (Nazism)|Lebensraum|Atlantic Charter}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party]] of Germany envisaged the establishment of a world government under the complete [[hegemony]] of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Weinberg\">Weinberg, Gerhard L.

When this control would be achieved, this power could then set up for itself a world police and assure itself \"the necessary living space.... The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly\".<ref name=\"Weinberg\"/>\n\nDuring its imperial period (1868\u20131947), the Japanese elaborated a worldview, \"''[[Hakk\u014d ichiu]]''\", translated as \"eight corners of the world under one roof\". This was the idea behind the attempt to establish a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] and behind the struggle for world domination.[[File:Atlanticcharter2.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Winston Churchill]]'s edited copy of the final draft of the [[Atlantic Charter]] ]]\n\nThe [[Atlantic Charter]] was a published statement agreed between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after [[World War II]], and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II. It first started with the United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter. Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants. The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title. However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name. In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain. The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.\n\nU.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] commented: \"We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court\". -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the [[Memorial Park (Omaha)|War Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=1647|title=Public Papers Harry S.

[[Wendell Willkie]]'s book ''[[One World (book)|One World]]'', first published in 1943, sold over 2 million copies. In another, [[Emery Reves]]' book ''[[The Anatomy of Peace]]'' (1945) laid out the arguments for replacing the UN with a federal world government and quickly became the \"bible\" of world federalists. The grassroots world federalist movement in the US, led by people such as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]], organized itself into increasingly larger structures, finally forming, in 1947, the [[United World Federalists]] (later renamed to World Federalist Association, then [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]), claiming membership of 47,000 in 1949.\n\nSimilar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, leading to the formation, at a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, of a global coalition, now called [[World Federalist Movement]]. By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.\n\n===United Nations===\n{{Further|United Nations|United Nations Parliamentary Assembly|Garry Davis}}[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|150px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]] ]]\n\n[[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as [[crimes against humanity]] itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between [[sovereignty|sovereign]] governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II. Almost every internationally recognized country is in the U.N.; as it contains 193 member states out of the 196 total nations of the world. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world. There are six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations. The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the populated continents.[[File:Uno unpalogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|Emblem of the [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] ]]\n\nA [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, [[direct election]] of [[United Nations]] (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

But until force and the threat of force in international relations are brought under social control by the world community, by and for the world society, they remain the instruments of social anarchy and not the sanctions of world law. The creation in clear-cut terms of the corpus of world law cries for the doing. If world law, however, is to be realized at all, there will have to be minimum of general agreement as to the nature of the physical and ideational world and the relation of men in society to it. An important and valuable next step will be found in deep-cutting analysis of the major law systems of the contemporary world in order to lay bare their basic postulates \u2013 postulates that are too generally hidden; postulates felt, perhaps, by those who live by them, but so much taken for granted that they are rarely expressed or exposed for examination. When this is done \u2013 and it will take the efforts of many keen intellects steeped in the law of at least a dozen lands and also aware of the social nexus of the law \u2013 then mankind will be able to see clearly for the first time and clearly where the common consensus of the great living social and law systems lies. Here will be found the common postulates and values upon which the world community can build. At the same time the truly basic points of conflict that will have to be worked upon for resolution will be revealed. Law is inherently purposive\".\n\n===End of the Cold War (1992)===\nWhile enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the [[European Union]], the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131992) eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. The movement quickly shrank in size to a much smaller core of activists, and the world government idea all but disappeared from wide public discourse.\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1992, interest in a federal world government and, more generally, in the global protection of human rights, was renewed. The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the [[Rome Statute]] of 1998, which led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002. In [[Europe]], progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people led, in 1992, to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the [[European Union]] (EU) is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007, 2013) to encompass, in 2013, over half a billion people in 28 member states. Following the EU's example, the [[African Union]] was founded in 2002 and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008.\n\n===  Alexander Wendt ===\nWendt defines a world state as an \u201corganization possessing a monopoly on the legitimate use of organized violence within a society.\"<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\">{{Cite journal|last=Wendt|first=Alexander|date=December 2003|title=Why a World State is Inevitable|journal=European Journal of International Relations|volume=9|issue=4|pages=491\u2013542|doi=10.1177/135406610394001|issn=1354-0661}}</ref> According to Wendt, a world state would need to fulfill the following requirements:\n\n# Monopoly on organized violence - states have exclusive use of legitimate force within their territory.\n# Legitimacy - perceived as right by their populations, and possibly the global community.\n# Sovereign - possessing common power and legitimacy.\n# Corporate action -\u00a0 a collection of individuals who act together in a systematic way.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/>\n\nA world government would not require a centrally controlled army or\u00a0a central decision-making body, as long as the four conditions are fulfilled.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\" /> In order to develop a world state, three changes must occur in the world system:\n\n# Universal security community - a peaceful system of binding dispute resolution without threat of interstate violence.\n# Universal collective security - unified response to crimes and threats.\n# Supranational authority - binding decisions are made that apply to each and every state.\n\nThe development of a world state is conceptualized as a process through 5 stages:\n\n# System of states;\n# Society of states;\n# World society;\n# Collective security;\n# World state.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/>\n\nWendt argues that a struggle among sovereign individuals results in the formation of a collective identity and eventually a state. The same forces are present within the international system and could possibly, and potentially inevitably lead to the development of a world state through this 5 stage process. When the world state would emerge, the traditional expression of states would become localized expressions of the world state. This process occurs within the default state of anarchy present in the world system.\n\nKant conceptualized the state as sovereign individuals formed out of conflict.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/> Part of the traditional philosophical objections to a world state (Kant, Hegel)<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\" /> are overcome by modern technological innovations. Wendt argues that new methods of communication and coordination can overcome these challenges.\n\n==Current global governance system==\n[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[United Nations]]]]\n[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[World Health Organization]]]]\n{{As of|2020}}, there is no functioning global international [[military]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], or [[constitution]] with jurisdiction over the entire planet.\n\nThe world is divided geographically and demographically into mutually exclusive territories and political structures called [[Sovereign state|states]] which are [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in most cases. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of [[authority]], but, except in cases where a nation is under military occupation by another, ''all'' such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Countries that violate or do not enforce international laws may be subject to penalty or coercion often in the form of economic limitations such as [[embargo]] by cooperating countries, even if the violating country is not part of the United Nations. In this way a country's cooperation in international affairs is voluntary, but non-cooperation still has [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] consequences.\n\nAmong the voluntary organizations and international arrangements are:\n* [[International law]]: Encompassing international treaties, customs and globally accepted legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.\n* [[United Nations]] (UN): The primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with a truly universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[International Telecommunications Union]].<ref>[https://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html UN.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113054148/http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html |date=2012-01-13 }}, Chart</ref> Of particular interest politically are the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].<br/>Militarily, the UN deploys [[peacekeeping]] forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ''[[ad hoc]]'' coalitions (for example, the [[multinational force in Iraq]]) or regional [[military alliance]]s (for example, [[NATO]]) are used.\n* [[Interpol|International Criminal Police Organization]] (Interpol): The international body for coordination and collaboration between national police agencies. Also operates the global [[Interpol notice]] system which includes the Interpol Red Notice, the \"closest instrument to an international [[arrest warrant]] in use today\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |title=Interpol Red Notices |website=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=1 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206195827/http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |archive-date=2013-12-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC): A relatively recent development in international law, the ICC (or ICCt) is the first permanent international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes ([[war crime]]s, [[genocide]], other [[crimes against humanity]], etc.) do not go unpunished. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] establishing the ICC and its jurisdiction was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it by October 2005.\n* [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF): [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Formed together]] in July 1944 at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]] to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. These institutions have been criticized as simply oligarchic hegemonies of the Great Powers, most notably the United States, which maintains the only veto, for instance, in the International Monetary Fund.\n* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO): Sets the rules of international trade. It has a semi-legislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.\n* [[G7]]: A group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The leaders of the G7 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies in confronting [[global issue]]s, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change.\n* [[G20]]: An association of twenty developing and established nations and entities, including the European Union.\n\nIn addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. In particular, international trade in goods, services and currencies (the \"[[global market]]\") has a tremendous impact on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency amongst nations (see [[globalization]]). Trans-national (or multi-national) [[corporations]], some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., [[Internet]], [[satellite television]]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws.\n\n==Existing regional unions of nations==\n{{Main|Regional organization|Supranational union}}\n\nThe only union generally recognized as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"Baub\u00f6ck-2007\">{{cite journal|last=Baub\u00f6ck|first=Rainer|date=2007|title=Why European Citizenship?

A multitude of [[trade bloc|regional associations]], aggregating most nations of the world, are at different stages of development towards a growing extent of economic, and sometimes political, integration. The European Union consists of twenty-seven European states. It has developed a \"single market\" which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without the need for customs declarations at border security. This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading. The European Union is said to have 26% of the world's money. Not all EU member states use the Euro; Poland for example, retains the [[Zloty]]. Where the Euro is in place, it allows easy access for the free circulation of trade goods.

CARICOM's main purpose is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME); and handling regional trade disputes.\n\nSince the establishment of CARICOM by the mainly English Creole-speaking parts of the Caribbean region CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of Dutch speaking [[Suriname]] on 4 July 1995 (although the lingua franca in Suriname is Sranan Tongo, which is an English-based Creole like the languages spoken in much of the rest of CARICOM) and [[Haiti]], where French and Haitian Creole are spoken, on 2 July 2002. In 2001, the heads of government signed a Revised [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], clearing the way for the transformation of the idea for a [[Common Market]] aspect of CARICOM into instead a Caribbean Single Market and Economy.

Such a government could come into existence either through violent and compulsory [[world domination]] or through peaceful and voluntary [[supranational union]].\n\nThere has never been an [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], [[military]], or [[constitution]] with global jurisdiction. The [[United Nations]], beyond the [[United Nations Security Council]] (which has the ability to issue mandatory resolutions), is limited to a mostly advisory role, and its stated purpose is to foster cooperation between existing [[nation]]al governments rather than exert authority over them.\n\nNumerous fictional depictions exist however, such as the World State mentioned above and the \"Dictatorship of the Air\" in H. G. Wells ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]''.\n\n==History==\n===Origins of the idea===\nThe idea and aspiration of world government has been known since the dawn of history. [[Bronze Age]] Egyptian Kings aimed to rule \"All That the Sun Encircles\", Mesopotamian Kings \"All from the Sunrise to the Sunset\", and ancient Chinese and Japanese Emperors \"All under Heaven\".

O human race! what tempests must need toss thee, what treasure be thrown into the sea, what shipwrecks must be endured, so long as thou, like a beast of many heads, strivest after diverse ends! Thou art sick in either intellect, and sick likewise in thy affection. Thou healest not thy high understanding by argument irrefutable, nor thy lower by the countenance of experience. Nor dost thou heal thy affection by the sweetness of divine persuasion, when the voice of the Holy Spirit breathes upon thee, \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!\"\" (''[[De Monarchia]]'', 16:1)\n\n===Francisco de Vitoria===\n{{Main|Francisco de Vitoria}}\n\nEarly father of international law, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (c. 1483\u20131546) is considered the \"founder of global political philosophy\".

In his essay, Kant describes three basic requirements for organizing human affairs to permanently abolish the threat of present and future war, and, thereby, help establish a new era of [[Perpetual peace|lasting peace]] throughout the world. Specifically, Kant described his proposed peace program as containing two steps.\n\nThe \"Preliminary Articles\" described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:\n\n# \"No Secret Treaty of Peace Shall Be Held Valid in Which There Is Tacitly Reserved Matter for a Future War\"\n# \"No Independent States, Large or Small, Shall Come under the Dominion of Another State by Inheritance, Exchange, Purchase, or Donation\"\n# \"[[Standing army|Standing Armies]] Shall in Time Be Totally Abolished\"\n# \"National Debts Shall Not Be Contracted with a View to the External Friction of States\"\n# \"No State Shall by Force Interfere with the Constitution or Government of Another State,\n# \"No State Shall, during War, Permit Such Acts of Hostility Which Would Make Mutual Confidence in the Subsequent Peace Impossible: Such Are the Employment of Assassins (percussores), Poisoners (venefici), Breach of Capitulation, and Incitement to Treason (perduellio) in the Opposing State\"\n\nThree Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace.\n\n# \"The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican\"\n# \"The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States\"\n# \"The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality\"\n\n===Johann Gottlieb Fichte===\nThe year of the battle at Jena (1806), when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] in ''[[Characteristics of the Present Age]]'' described what he perceived to be a very deep and dominant historical trend:\n\n{{quote|\nThere is necessary tendency in every cultivated State to extend itself generally...

The increase in international trade at the turn of the 20th century accelerated the formation of international organizations, and, by the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, there were approximately 450 of them. Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during that period as well. The [[Institute of International Law]] was formed in 1873 by the Belgian Jurist [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss [[Johaan Bluntschli]] in 1866.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1883, [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] published \"The Institutes of the Law of Nations\" in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law. The first embryonic world [[parliament]], called the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], was organized in 1886 by Cremer and Passy, composed of legislators from many countries. In 1904 the Union formally proposed \"an international congress which should meet periodically to discuss international questions\".\n\n===H. G. Wells===\n[[H. G.

It will be \"a new social Hercules that will strangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle\".

At its largest size from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the [[Human rights|Rights of Man]], such as the rights of non-whites, women, and soldiers; [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing war through [[collective security]], settling disputes between countries through negotiation, [[diplomacy]], and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions and economic sanctions and provide an army, when needed. However, these powers proved reluctant to do so. Lacking many of the key elements necessary to maintain world peace, the League failed to prevent World War II. Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe. The rest of the Axis powers soon followed him. Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart. The League of Nations consisted of the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat. Below these were many agencies. The Assembly was where delegates from all member states conferred. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.\n\n===World Communism===\nAccording to [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[historical materialism]], the capitalist epoch depends on the expansion of competing geopolitical markets across the planet, atomizing the global proletariat and thus sustaining economic disparity and rivalry between markets. Eventually, this will be succeeded by a Socialist epoch in which the working class throughout the world will unite to render national distinctiveness meaningless.\n\nAlthough [[world Communism]]'s long-term goal is a worldwide [[Communist society]] that is stateless, which would entail an absence of any government, many [[anti-Communism|anti-Communists]] (especially during the [[Cold War]]) have considered it naive to think that the [[world revolution]] advocated by international Communists would lead to [[world domination]] by a single government or an alliance of several, yielding a [[de facto]] world government of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.\n\nThe heyday of international Communism was the period from the end of World War I (the [[revolutions of 1917\u201323]]) through the 1950s, before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].\n\n===Halford Mackinder===\nAnticipating environmental movements for world unity, like [[Global Scenario Group]], and such concepts as the [[Planetary phase of civilization]] and [[Spaceship Earth]], British Geographer [[Sir Halford Mackinder]] wrote in 1931:\n{{quote| \nGradually as the arts of life improved, the forests were cleared and the marshes were drained, and the lesser natural regions were fused into greater. It may perhaps be thought that with the continuance of this process all mankind will be in the end unified \u2026 Unless I mistake, it is the message of geography that international cooperation in any future that we need consider must be based on the federal idea. If our civilization is not to go down in blind internecine conflict, there must be a development of world planning out of regional planning, just as regional planning has come from town planning.<ref>\"The Human Habitat,\" ''Scottish Geographical Magazine'', 47, (1931): p 333, also 335.</ref>}}\n\n===Lionel George Curtis===\n[[Lionel George Curtis]] was a British official and author.

He fought in the [[Second Boer War]] with the [[City Imperial Volunteers]] and served as secretary to [[Lord Milner]] (a position that had also been held by adventure-novelist [[John Buchan]]), during which time he dedicated himself to working for a united self-governing South Africa. His experience of World War One and the rise of Hitler led him to conceptualize his version of a [[Federal World Government]], which became his life work.\n\n===World War II===\n{{Further|New Order (Nazism)|Lebensraum|Atlantic Charter}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party]] of Germany envisaged the establishment of a world government under the complete [[hegemony]] of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Weinberg\">Weinberg, Gerhard L.

When this control would be achieved, this power could then set up for itself a world police and assure itself \"the necessary living space.... The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly\".<ref name=\"Weinberg\"/>\n\nDuring its imperial period (1868\u20131947), the Japanese elaborated a worldview, \"''[[Hakk\u014d ichiu]]''\", translated as \"eight corners of the world under one roof\". This was the idea behind the attempt to establish a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] and behind the struggle for world domination.[[File:Atlanticcharter2.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Winston Churchill]]'s edited copy of the final draft of the [[Atlantic Charter]] ]]\n\nThe [[Atlantic Charter]] was a published statement agreed between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after [[World War II]], and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II. It first started with the United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter. Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants. The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title. However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name. In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain. The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.\n\nU.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] commented: \"We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court\". -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the [[Memorial Park (Omaha)|War Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=1647|title=Public Papers Harry S.

[[Wendell Willkie]]'s book ''[[One World (book)|One World]]'', first published in 1943, sold over 2 million copies. In another, [[Emery Reves]]' book ''[[The Anatomy of Peace]]'' (1945) laid out the arguments for replacing the UN with a federal world government and quickly became the \"bible\" of world federalists. The grassroots world federalist movement in the US, led by people such as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]], organized itself into increasingly larger structures, finally forming, in 1947, the [[United World Federalists]] (later renamed to World Federalist Association, then [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]), claiming membership of 47,000 in 1949.\n\nSimilar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, leading to the formation, at a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, of a global coalition, now called [[World Federalist Movement]]. By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.\n\n===United Nations===\n{{Further|United Nations|United Nations Parliamentary Assembly|Garry Davis}}[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|150px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]] ]]\n\n[[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as [[crimes against humanity]] itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between [[sovereignty|sovereign]] governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II. Almost every internationally recognized country is in the U.N.; as it contains 193 member states out of the 196 total nations of the world. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world. There are six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations. The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the populated continents.[[File:Uno unpalogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|Emblem of the [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] ]]\n\nA [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, [[direct election]] of [[United Nations]] (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide. The idea of a world parliament was raised at the founding of the [[League of Nations]] in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the [[Cold War]].<ref>See a detailed history in: Jo Leinen/Andreas Bummel, [https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/world-parliament-book/ A World Parliament: Governance and Democracy in the 21st Century], Democracy Without Borders, 2018</ref> In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of global trade and the power of world organizations that govern it led to calls for a [[International parliament|parliamentary assembly]] to scrutinize their activity.

Adamson Hoebel}}\n\nLegal anthropologist [[E. Adamson Hoebel]] concluded his treatise on broadening the legal realist tradition to include non-Western nations:<ref>''The Law of Primitive Man'' (1954:331\u2013333)</ref> \"Whatever the idealist may desire, force and the threat of force are the ultimate power in the determination of international behavior, as in the law within the nation or tribe. But until force and the threat of force in international relations are brought under social control by the world community, by and for the world society, they remain the instruments of social anarchy and not the sanctions of world law. The creation in clear-cut terms of the corpus of world law cries for the doing. If world law, however, is to be realized at all, there will have to be minimum of general agreement as to the nature of the physical and ideational world and the relation of men in society to it. An important and valuable next step will be found in deep-cutting analysis of the major law systems of the contemporary world in order to lay bare their basic postulates \u2013 postulates that are too generally hidden; postulates felt, perhaps, by those who live by them, but so much taken for granted that they are rarely expressed or exposed for examination. When this is done \u2013 and it will take the efforts of many keen intellects steeped in the law of at least a dozen lands and also aware of the social nexus of the law \u2013 then mankind will be able to see clearly for the first time and clearly where the common consensus of the great living social and law systems lies. Here will be found the common postulates and values upon which the world community can build. At the same time the truly basic points of conflict that will have to be worked upon for resolution will be revealed. Law is inherently purposive\".\n\n===End of the Cold War (1992)===\nWhile enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the [[European Union]], the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131992) eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. The movement quickly shrank in size to a much smaller core of activists, and the world government idea all but disappeared from wide public discourse.\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1992, interest in a federal world government and, more generally, in the global protection of human rights, was renewed. The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the [[Rome Statute]] of 1998, which led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002. In [[Europe]], progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people led, in 1992, to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the [[European Union]] (EU) is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007, 2013) to encompass, in 2013, over half a billion people in 28 member states. Following the EU's example, the [[African Union]] was founded in 2002 and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008.\n\n===  Alexander Wendt ===\nWendt defines a world state as an \u201corganization possessing a monopoly on the legitimate use of organized violence within a society.\"<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\">{{Cite journal|last=Wendt|first=Alexander|date=December 2003|title=Why a World State is Inevitable|journal=European Journal of International Relations|volume=9|issue=4|pages=491\u2013542|doi=10.1177/135406610394001|issn=1354-0661}}</ref> According to Wendt, a world state would need to fulfill the following requirements:\n\n# Monopoly on organized violence - states have exclusive use of legitimate force within their territory.\n# Legitimacy - perceived as right by their populations, and possibly the global community.\n# Sovereign - possessing common power and legitimacy.\n# Corporate action -\u00a0 a collection of individuals who act together in a systematic way.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/>\n\nA world government would not require a centrally controlled army or\u00a0a central decision-making body, as long as the four conditions are fulfilled.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\" /> In order to develop a world state, three changes must occur in the world system:\n\n# Universal security community - a peaceful system of binding dispute resolution without threat of interstate violence.\n# Universal collective security - unified response to crimes and threats.\n# Supranational authority - binding decisions are made that apply to each and every state.\n\nThe development of a world state is conceptualized as a process through 5 stages:\n\n# System of states;\n# Society of states;\n# World society;\n# Collective security;\n# World state.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/>\n\nWendt argues that a struggle among sovereign individuals results in the formation of a collective identity and eventually a state. The same forces are present within the international system and could possibly, and potentially inevitably lead to the development of a world state through this 5 stage process. When the world state would emerge, the traditional expression of states would become localized expressions of the world state. This process occurs within the default state of anarchy present in the world system.\n\nKant conceptualized the state as sovereign individuals formed out of conflict.<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\"/> Part of the traditional philosophical objections to a world state (Kant, Hegel)<ref name=\"Wendt 491\u2013542\" /> are overcome by modern technological innovations. Wendt argues that new methods of communication and coordination can overcome these challenges.\n\n==Current global governance system==\n[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[United Nations]]]]\n[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|250px|right|Flag of the [[World Health Organization]]]]\n{{As of|2020}}, there is no functioning global international [[military]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], or [[constitution]] with jurisdiction over the entire planet.\n\nThe world is divided geographically and demographically into mutually exclusive territories and political structures called [[Sovereign state|states]] which are [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in most cases. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of [[authority]], but, except in cases where a nation is under military occupation by another, ''all'' such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Countries that violate or do not enforce international laws may be subject to penalty or coercion often in the form of economic limitations such as [[embargo]] by cooperating countries, even if the violating country is not part of the United Nations. In this way a country's cooperation in international affairs is voluntary, but non-cooperation still has [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] consequences.\n\nAmong the voluntary organizations and international arrangements are:\n* [[International law]]: Encompassing international treaties, customs and globally accepted legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.\n* [[United Nations]] (UN): The primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with a truly universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[International Telecommunications Union]].<ref>[https://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html UN.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113054148/http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html |date=2012-01-13 }}, Chart</ref> Of particular interest politically are the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].<br/>Militarily, the UN deploys [[peacekeeping]] forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ''[[ad hoc]]'' coalitions (for example, the [[multinational force in Iraq]]) or regional [[military alliance]]s (for example, [[NATO]]) are used.\n* [[Interpol|International Criminal Police Organization]] (Interpol): The international body for coordination and collaboration between national police agencies. Also operates the global [[Interpol notice]] system which includes the Interpol Red Notice, the \"closest instrument to an international [[arrest warrant]] in use today\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |title=Interpol Red Notices |website=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=1 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206195827/http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |archive-date=2013-12-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC): A relatively recent development in international law, the ICC (or ICCt) is the first permanent international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes ([[war crime]]s, [[genocide]], other [[crimes against humanity]], etc.) do not go unpunished. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] establishing the ICC and its jurisdiction was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it by October 2005.\n* [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF): [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Formed together]] in July 1944 at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]] to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. These institutions have been criticized as simply oligarchic hegemonies of the Great Powers, most notably the United States, which maintains the only veto, for instance, in the International Monetary Fund.\n* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO): Sets the rules of international trade. It has a semi-legislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.\n* [[G7]]: A group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The leaders of the G7 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies in confronting [[global issue]]s, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change.\n* [[G20]]: An association of twenty developing and established nations and entities, including the European Union.\n\nIn addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. In particular, international trade in goods, services and currencies (the \"[[global market]]\") has a tremendous impact on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency amongst nations (see [[globalization]]). Trans-national (or multi-national) [[corporations]], some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., [[Internet]], [[satellite television]]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws.\n\n==Existing regional unions of nations==\n{{Main|Regional organization|Supranational union}}\n\nThe only union generally recognized as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"Baub\u00f6ck-2007\">{{cite journal|last=Baub\u00f6ck|first=Rainer|date=2007|title=Why European Citizenship?

A multitude of [[trade bloc|regional associations]], aggregating most nations of the world, are at different stages of development towards a growing extent of economic, and sometimes political, integration. The European Union consists of twenty-seven European states. It has developed a \"single market\" which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without the need for customs declarations at border security. This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading. The European Union is said to have 26% of the world's money. Not all EU member states use the Euro; Poland for example, retains the [[Zloty]]. Where the Euro is in place, it allows easy access for the free circulation of trade goods. Tariffs are also the same for each country allowing no unfair practices within the union.\n\n===NATO===\n[[File:North Atlantic Treaty Organization (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|150px|right|Map of [[NATO]] nations]]\n\nThe [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) is an [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] [[military alliance]] based on the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] which was signed on 4&nbsp;April 1949.

CARICOM's main purpose is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME); and handling regional trade disputes.\n\nSince the establishment of CARICOM by the mainly English Creole-speaking parts of the Caribbean region CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of Dutch speaking [[Suriname]] on 4 July 1995 (although the lingua franca in Suriname is Sranan Tongo, which is an English-based Creole like the languages spoken in much of the rest of CARICOM) and [[Haiti]], where French and Haitian Creole are spoken, on 2 July 2002. In 2001, the heads of government signed a Revised [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], clearing the way for the transformation of the idea for a [[Common Market]] aspect of CARICOM into instead a Caribbean Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty among member states includes the establishment and implementation of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ).\n\n===African Union===\n[[File:African Union (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|150px|Map of [[African Union]] nations]]\n\nThe [[African Union]] (AU) is an organisation consisting of all the 55 [[Africa]]n states of the continent and African waters.
