Employees at Macy's department stores have the option of marching in the parade.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\nIn 1924, store employees marched to [[Macy's Herald Square]], the flagship store on [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], dressed in vibrant costumes.  There were floats, professional bands and live animals borrowed from the [[Central Park Zoo]].  At the end of that first parade, [[Santa Claus]] was welcomed into [[Herald Square]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14902256/|title=Macy Christmas Parade Big Thanksgiving Day Feature|work=The Central New Jersey Home News|date=November 26, 1924|access-date=November 28, 2019|page=9|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7614926/|title=Santa Claus Will Formally Enter New York in Macy's Parade|work=The Courier-News|location=Bridgewater, NJ|date=November 26, 1924|access-date=November 28, 2019|page=2|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref><ref name=\"Klein 2014\">{{cite web | last=Klein | first=Christopher | title=The First Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade | website=HISTORY | date=November 26, 2014 | url=https://www.history.com/news/the-first-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade | access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> At this first parade, Santa was enthroned on the Macy's balcony at the [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] store entrance, where he was then crowned \"King of the Kiddies\".  With an audience of over 250,000 people, the parade was such a success that Macy's declared it would become an annual event, despite media reports only barely covering the first parade.<ref name=\"Klein 2014\"/> By 1928, inflatable balloons were introduced, replacing the live zoo animals\n\nThe Macy's parade was enough of a success to push Ragamuffin Day, the typical children's Thanksgiving Day activity from 1870 into the 1920s, into obscurity. Ragamuffin Day featured children going around and performing a primitive version of [[trick-or-treating]], a practice that by the 1920s had come to annoy most adults. The public backlash against such begging in the 1930s (at a time when most Americans were themselves struggling in the midst of the Great Depression) led to promotion of alternatives, including Macy's parade. While [[ragamuffin parade]]s that competed with Macy's would continue into the 1930s, the competition from Macy's would overwhelm the practice, and the last ragamuffin parade in New York City would take place in 1956.<ref name=\"NYPL\">{{cite news|last=Nigro|first=Carmen|title=Thanksgiving Ragamuffin Parade|publisher=New York Public Library|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/11/23/thanksgiving-ragamuffin-parade|date=November 23, 2010|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Tony Sarg|Anthony \"Tony\" Frederick Sarg]] loved to work with marionettes from an early age.

For 2006, a special variant of the logo was used.  Every year since then (commensurate with Macy's rebranding of the former [[The May Department Stores Company|May]] stores nationwide to Macy's), a new logo has been used for each parade. However, the logos are only seen on television before and after commercial breaks, and in the bottom corner of the screen during the broadcast.\n\nFollowing an incident in 2005 where a balloon knocked over a street light and injured spectators (see {{Section link||Injuries}}), new safety measures were incorporated in 2006 to prevent accidents and balloon-related injuries.  One measure taken was the installation of wind measurement devices to alert parade organizers to any unsafe conditions that could cause the balloons to behave erratically.  In addition, parade officials implemented a measure to keep the balloons closer to the ground during windy conditions. New York City law prohibits Macy's from flying the full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed {{convert|20|knots|mph}} or wind gusts exceed {{convert|30|knots|mph}}; New York's tall buildings and regular grid plan can amplify wind velocity on city streets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/bundle-up-biting-winds-to-grip-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-in-nyc/70006658|title=Frigid winds to whip through NYC for Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade|date=November 19, 2018|website=AccuWeather|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> This law, imposed in 1997, has never been activated, despite several close calls; the only time the parade balloons have ever been grounded was 1971. Each balloon has its own risk profile to determine handling in windy conditions; taller, upright balloons are rotated so that they appear horizontal and facing downward in such situations (as was the case in 2019, when a grounding was narrowly averted). In the event the balloons are grounded, the remaining floats and performances would continue as scheduled.<ref name=\"wcbs2019\">{{cite news|url=https://wcbs880.radio.com/articles/news/new-yorkers-warned-of-severe-wind-on-thanksgiving-day|title=New Yorkers warned of severe wind on Thanksgiving Day|date=November 27, 2019|work=[[WCBS (AM)|WCBS 880]]|access-date=November 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 parade was the coldest to date with the temperature at 19&nbsp;\u00b0F (-7.2&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/nyregion/cold-weather-thanksgiving-parade.html|title=Paradegoers Brave Coldest Thanksgiving in New York Since 1901|access-date=November 22, 2018|language=en}}</ref> The warmest was in 1933 at 69&nbsp;\u00b0F (20.5&nbsp;\u00b0C).

The rerouting of the parade that was implemented for the 2012 event ([[#Parade route|see below]]) moved the parade out of the view of CBS's cameras and thus made it significantly more difficult for the network to cover the parade (though the route now passes along the west side of the network's [[CBS Building|Black Rock]] headquarters building along [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], and the hosts are stationed on a temporary tower platform at the Sixth/[[53rd Street (Manhattan)|W. 53rd St.]] corner of the building); CBS nevertheless continues to cover the parade to the same extent as in previous years.\n\nSince 2003, the parade has been broadcast simultaneously in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] on the sister network of [[NBCUniversal]] ([[Telemundo]]) hosted by [[Mar\u00eda Celeste Arrar\u00e1s]] from 2003-2006. The parade won nine [[Emmy Awards]] for outstanding achievements in special event coverage since 1979.\n\nAt first, the telecasts were only an hour long. In 1961, the telecast expanded to two hours,<ref>\"Television\", ''The New York Times'', November 23, 1961, p. 71.</ref> and was then reduced to 90 minutes in 1962, before reverting to a two-hour telecast in 1965; all three hours of the parade were televised by 1969.<ref>\"Television\", ''The New York Times'', November 27, 1969, p. 75.</ref> The event began to be broadcast in color in 1960.<ref>\"Television\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1960, p. 67.</ref> NBC airs the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade live in the Eastern Time Zone as well as [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] as they use feeds from that time zone, but [[broadcast delay|tape delays]] the telecast elsewhere in the continental U.S. and territories from the [[Central Time Zone]] westward to allow the program to air in the same 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot across its [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] and [[network affiliate|affiliated]] stations; since the morning program's expansion to three hours in 2000 and eventually to four hours, NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' only airs for two hours Thanksgiving morning as a result, pre-empting the latter two talk-focused hours of the show for the day. NBC began airing a same-day afternoon rebroadcast of the parade in 2009 (replacing the annual broadcast of ''Miracle on 34th Street'', which NBC had lost the broadcast television rights to that year). CBS's unauthorized coverage airs live in most time zones, allowing viewers to see the parade as many as two hours before the official NBC coverage airs in their area; CBS still broadcasts the parade on delay on the West Coast, immediately after the [[Detroit Lions]] [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving game]] in even-numbered years when CBS carries it, or at 9 a.m. local time in odd-numbered years when they carry the [[Dallas Cowboys]] Thanksgiving game.<ref name=\"cbs08\" />\n\nFrom 1962 to 1972, NBC's coverage was hosted by [[Lorne Greene]] (who was then appearing on NBC's ''[[Bonanza]]'') and [[Betty White]]. [[Ed McMahon]] hosted the parade in 1974, then hosted until 1981. Since 1982, NBC has appointed at least one of the hosts of ''Today'' to emcee the television broadcast, starting with [[Bryant Gumbel]], who hosted the parade until 1984. From 1987 to 1997, NBC's coverage was hosted by longtime ''Today'' weather anchor [[Willard Scott]]. During that period, their co-hosts included [[Mary Hart (TV personality)|Mary Hart]], [[Sandy Duncan]], and ''Today'' colleagues [[Deborah Norville]] and [[Katie Couric]]. In recent years, NBC's coverage has been hosted by ''Today'' anchors [[Matt Lauer]] (from 1998 to 2017), [[Meredith Vieira]] (from 2006 to 2010), [[Ann Curry]] (2011), [[Savannah Guthrie]] (since 2012) and [[Hoda Kotb]] (since 2018) as well as ''Today'' weather anchor [[Al Roker]] who usually joins the producers of the parade and special guests in the ribbon cutting ceremony.\n\nFrom the early 1980s until circa 1994, the television broadcast was produced and directed by [[Dick Schneider]]; since circa 1994, it has been executive produced by Brad Lachman (who has otherwise been known for producing [[reality television]] series), produced by Bill Bracken and directed by veteran sitcom director [[Gary Halvorson]]. Announcements during the telecast were first provided by [[Don Pardo]], followed by [[Lynda Lopez]], the telecast's only female announcer, who served during the decade wherein Willard Scott was the parade's host; from circa 1994 to 2010, announcer duties were helmed by [[Joel Godard]] (who also served as the announcer for ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' for much of that period), and then were assumed by ''Today'' announcer Les Marshak with the 2011 telecast. The musical director for the television coverage is veteran composer/arranger [[Milton DeLugg]].\n\nCBS's coverage was originally part of the \"All-American Thanksgiving Day Parade,\" a broadcast that included footage from multiple parades across [[North America]], including parades at [[America's Thanksgiving Parade|Detroit]], [[6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade|Philadelphia]] and [[Disneyland]] (the latter was later replaced by [[Opryland USA]] in 1997 and after that [[Miami Beach]]), and taped footage of the [[Toronto Santa Claus Parade]] (taped usually the second or third weekend of November) and the Aloha Floral Parade in [[Honolulu]] (which usually took place in September). Beginning in 2004, however, CBS has focused exclusively on the Macy's parade, but avoids using the Macy's name due to the lack of an official license. To compensate for the fact that the Broadway and music performances can only appear on NBC, CBS adds their own pre-recorded performances (also including Broadway shows, although different from the ones that are part of the official parade and recorded off-site) to fill out the special.<ref>Gioia, Michael (November 26, 2015).

The parade proceeded south on Amsterdam Avenue to 106th Street and turned east. At Columbus Avenue, the balloons had to be lowered to go under the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|Ninth Avenue El]]. Past the El tracks, the parade proceeded east on 106th Street to Central Park West and turned south to terminate at Macy's flagship.\n\nA new route was established for the 2009 parade. From 77th Street and Central Park West, the route went south along [[Central Park]] to [[Columbus Circle]], then east along Central Park South. The parade would then make a right turn at 7th Avenue and go south to [[Times Square]]. At 42nd Street, the parade turned left and went east, then at 6th Avenue turned right again at [[Bryant Park]]. Heading south on 6th Avenue, the parade turned right at 34th Street (at Herald Square) and proceeded west to the terminating point at 7th Avenue where the floats are taken down.<ref>{{cite news|title=City to Change Route of Thanksgiving Day Parade |url=http://www.ny1.com/Default.aspx?ArID=97183 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120911131049/http://www.ny1.com/Default.aspx?ArID=97183 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |publisher=NY1 News |date=April 10, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2009 }}</ref> The 2009 route change eliminated [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] completely, where the parade has traveled down for decades.

The nation's oldest Thanksgiving parade (the Gimbels parade, which has had many sponsors over the years, and is now known as the [[6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade]]) was first held in [[Philadelphia]] in 1920.  Other cities with parades on the holiday include the [[McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and parades in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; [[Houston]], [[Texas]]; [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]; and [[Fountain Hills, Arizona|Fountain Hills]], [[Arizona]]. There is also a second Thanksgiving balloon parade within the [[New York metropolitan area]], the [[UBS]] balloon parade in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], Connecticut, located {{convert|30|mi|km}} away; that parade is held the Sunday before Thanksgiving, so as not to compete with the parade in New York City.  It usually does not duplicate any balloon characters. The [[Celebrate the Season Parade]], held the last Saturday in November in [[Pittsburgh]], was sponsored by Macy's from 2006 to 2013 after Macy's bought the [[Kaufmann's]] store chain that had sponsored that parade prior to 2006.\n\n=== Universal's Holiday Parade Featuring Macy's ===\nSince 2001, Macy's Studios has partnered with the [[Universal Orlando Resort]] (owned by NBC parent [[NBCUniversal]]) to bring balloons and floats from New York City to the theme park in [[Florida]] every holiday season in an event known as the Macy's Holiday Parade. The parade is performed daily and includes the iconic Santa Claus float. Performers from the Orlando area are cast as various clowns, and the park used to invite guests to be \"balloon handlers\" for the parade.<ref>[http://www.universalorlando.com/holidays/index.html Universal Studios, Orlando: Theme Parks, Attractions, Accommodations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217092105/http://www.universalorlando.com/holidays/index.html|date=December 17, 2006}}</ref> In 2017, the Macy's Holiday Parade was renamed to Universal's Holiday Parade Featuring Macy's.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* The 1947 film ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', begins with the parade, as do most of its remakes. The film portrays the real [[Santa Claus]] being hired to work at Macy's after its own Santa impersonator gets drunk during the parade. NBC, in its telecasts, often showed the original 1947 film on Thanksgiving afternoon, following its coverage of the parade and the [[National Dog Show]].\n* In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode \"[[The Mom and Pop Store]]\", Elaine wins a spot on the parade route for her boss, Mr. Pitt, to hold the [[Woody Woodpecker]] balloon.\n* The parade is featured in the children's book ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (book)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]'' and its [[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|animated film adaption]] which where Rex mistakenly befriends a dinosaur balloon.\n* The first Thanksgiving-themed episode of ''[[Friends]]'' centered on the accidental release of the (unused at the time) \"[[Underdog (character)|Underdog]]\" balloon.\n* \"Macy's Day Parade\" is a song by [[Green Day]].\n* In 2008, a [[Coca-Cola]] [[computer animated|CGI]] ad aired in the United States during [[Super Bowl XLII]]. The commercial's plot centered around Underdog and fictional [[Stewie Griffin]] balloons chasing a Coke bottle-shaped balloon through New York City.

The commercial was also referenced in [[Thanksgiving (Family Guy)|an episode]] of ''[[Family Guy]].''

Ragamuffin Day featured children going around and performing a primitive version of [[trick-or-treating]], a practice that by the 1920s had come to annoy most adults. The public backlash against such begging in the 1930s (at a time when most Americans were themselves struggling in the midst of the Great Depression) led to promotion of alternatives, including Macy's parade. While [[ragamuffin parade]]s that competed with Macy's would continue into the 1930s, the competition from Macy's would overwhelm the practice, and the last ragamuffin parade in New York City would take place in 1956.<ref name=\"NYPL\">{{cite news|last=Nigro|first=Carmen|title=Thanksgiving Ragamuffin Parade|publisher=New York Public Library|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/11/23/thanksgiving-ragamuffin-parade|date=November 23, 2010|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Tony Sarg|Anthony \"Tony\" Frederick Sarg]] loved to work with marionettes from an early age.

For 2006, a special variant of the logo was used.  Every year since then (commensurate with Macy's rebranding of the former [[The May Department Stores Company|May]] stores nationwide to Macy's), a new logo has been used for each parade. However, the logos are only seen on television before and after commercial breaks, and in the bottom corner of the screen during the broadcast.\n\nFollowing an incident in 2005 where a balloon knocked over a street light and injured spectators (see {{Section link||Injuries}}), new safety measures were incorporated in 2006 to prevent accidents and balloon-related injuries.  One measure taken was the installation of wind measurement devices to alert parade organizers to any unsafe conditions that could cause the balloons to behave erratically.  In addition, parade officials implemented a measure to keep the balloons closer to the ground during windy conditions. New York City law prohibits Macy's from flying the full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed {{convert|20|knots|mph}} or wind gusts exceed {{convert|30|knots|mph}}; New York's tall buildings and regular grid plan can amplify wind velocity on city streets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/bundle-up-biting-winds-to-grip-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-in-nyc/70006658|title=Frigid winds to whip through NYC for Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade|date=November 19, 2018|website=AccuWeather|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> This law, imposed in 1997, has never been activated, despite several close calls; the only time the parade balloons have ever been grounded was 1971. Each balloon has its own risk profile to determine handling in windy conditions; taller, upright balloons are rotated so that they appear horizontal and facing downward in such situations (as was the case in 2019, when a grounding was narrowly averted). In the event the balloons are grounded, the remaining floats and performances would continue as scheduled.<ref name=\"wcbs2019\">{{cite news|url=https://wcbs880.radio.com/articles/news/new-yorkers-warned-of-severe-wind-on-thanksgiving-day|title=New Yorkers warned of severe wind on Thanksgiving Day|date=November 27, 2019|work=[[WCBS (AM)|WCBS 880]]|access-date=November 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 parade was the coldest to date with the temperature at 19&nbsp;\u00b0F (-7.2&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/nyregion/cold-weather-thanksgiving-parade.html|title=Paradegoers Brave Coldest Thanksgiving in New York Since 1901|access-date=November 22, 2018|language=en}}</ref> The warmest was in 1933 at 69&nbsp;\u00b0F (20.5&nbsp;\u00b0C).

CBS press release (November 13, 2008). Retrieved 2010-06-21.</ref> Since the parade takes place in public, the parade committee can endorse an official broadcaster, but they cannot award exclusive rights as other events (such as sporting events, which take place inside restricted-access stadiums) have the authority to do. The rerouting of the parade that was implemented for the 2012 event ([[#Parade route|see below]]) moved the parade out of the view of CBS's cameras and thus made it significantly more difficult for the network to cover the parade (though the route now passes along the west side of the network's [[CBS Building|Black Rock]] headquarters building along [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], and the hosts are stationed on a temporary tower platform at the Sixth/[[53rd Street (Manhattan)|W. 53rd St.]] corner of the building); CBS nevertheless continues to cover the parade to the same extent as in previous years.\n\nSince 2003, the parade has been broadcast simultaneously in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] on the sister network of [[NBCUniversal]] ([[Telemundo]]) hosted by [[Mar\u00eda Celeste Arrar\u00e1s]] from 2003-2006. The parade won nine [[Emmy Awards]] for outstanding achievements in special event coverage since 1979.\n\nAt first, the telecasts were only an hour long.

NBC began airing a same-day afternoon rebroadcast of the parade in 2009 (replacing the annual broadcast of ''Miracle on 34th Street'', which NBC had lost the broadcast television rights to that year). CBS's unauthorized coverage airs live in most time zones, allowing viewers to see the parade as many as two hours before the official NBC coverage airs in their area; CBS still broadcasts the parade on delay on the West Coast, immediately after the [[Detroit Lions]] [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving game]] in even-numbered years when CBS carries it, or at 9 a.m. local time in odd-numbered years when they carry the [[Dallas Cowboys]] Thanksgiving game.<ref name=\"cbs08\" />\n\nFrom 1962 to 1972, NBC's coverage was hosted by [[Lorne Greene]] (who was then appearing on NBC's ''[[Bonanza]]'') and [[Betty White]]. [[Ed McMahon]] hosted the parade in 1974, then hosted until 1981. Since 1982, NBC has appointed at least one of the hosts of ''Today'' to emcee the television broadcast, starting with [[Bryant Gumbel]], who hosted the parade until 1984. From 1987 to 1997, NBC's coverage was hosted by longtime ''Today'' weather anchor [[Willard Scott]]. During that period, their co-hosts included [[Mary Hart (TV personality)|Mary Hart]], [[Sandy Duncan]], and ''Today'' colleagues [[Deborah Norville]] and [[Katie Couric]]. In recent years, NBC's coverage has been hosted by ''Today'' anchors [[Matt Lauer]] (from 1998 to 2017), [[Meredith Vieira]] (from 2006 to 2010), [[Ann Curry]] (2011), [[Savannah Guthrie]] (since 2012) and [[Hoda Kotb]] (since 2018) as well as ''Today'' weather anchor [[Al Roker]] who usually joins the producers of the parade and special guests in the ribbon cutting ceremony.\n\nFrom the early 1980s until circa 1994, the television broadcast was produced and directed by [[Dick Schneider]]; since circa 1994, it has been executive produced by Brad Lachman (who has otherwise been known for producing [[reality television]] series), produced by Bill Bracken and directed by veteran sitcom director [[Gary Halvorson]]. Announcements during the telecast were first provided by [[Don Pardo]], followed by [[Lynda Lopez]], the telecast's only female announcer, who served during the decade wherein Willard Scott was the parade's host; from circa 1994 to 2010, announcer duties were helmed by [[Joel Godard]] (who also served as the announcer for ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' for much of that period), and then were assumed by ''Today'' announcer Les Marshak with the 2011 telecast. The musical director for the television coverage is veteran composer/arranger [[Milton DeLugg]].\n\nCBS's coverage was originally part of the \"All-American Thanksgiving Day Parade,\" a broadcast that included footage from multiple parades across [[North America]], including parades at [[America's Thanksgiving Parade|Detroit]], [[6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade|Philadelphia]] and [[Disneyland]] (the latter was later replaced by [[Opryland USA]] in 1997 and after that [[Miami Beach]]), and taped footage of the [[Toronto Santa Claus Parade]] (taped usually the second or third weekend of November) and the Aloha Floral Parade in [[Honolulu]] (which usually took place in September). Beginning in 2004, however, CBS has focused exclusively on the Macy's parade, but avoids using the Macy's name due to the lack of an official license. To compensate for the fact that the Broadway and music performances can only appear on NBC, CBS adds their own pre-recorded performances (also including Broadway shows, although different from the ones that are part of the official parade and recorded off-site) to fill out the special.<ref>Gioia, Michael (November 26, 2015).

The parade originally started from [[145th Street (Manhattan)|145th Street]] in [[Harlem]] and ended at [[Macy's Herald Square|Macy's flagship]] in [[Herald Square]] (at the intersection of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[Sixth Avenue]], and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]]), making a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} route.<ref name=\"Klein 2014\" />\n\nIn the 1930s, the balloons were inflated around 110th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, near the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]]. The parade proceeded south on Amsterdam Avenue to 106th Street and turned east. At Columbus Avenue, the balloons had to be lowered to go under the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|Ninth Avenue El]]. Past the El tracks, the parade proceeded east on 106th Street to Central Park West and turned south to terminate at Macy's flagship.\n\nA new route was established for the 2009 parade. From 77th Street and Central Park West, the route went south along [[Central Park]] to [[Columbus Circle]], then east along Central Park South. The parade would then make a right turn at 7th Avenue and go south to [[Times Square]]. At 42nd Street, the parade turned left and went east, then at 6th Avenue turned right again at [[Bryant Park]]. Heading south on 6th Avenue, the parade turned right at 34th Street (at Herald Square) and proceeded west to the terminating point at 7th Avenue where the floats are taken down.<ref>{{cite news|title=City to Change Route of Thanksgiving Day Parade |url=http://www.ny1.com/Default.aspx?ArID=97183 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120911131049/http://www.ny1.com/Default.aspx?ArID=97183 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |publisher=NY1 News |date=April 10, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2009 }}</ref> The 2009 route change eliminated [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] completely, where the parade has traveled down for decades.

The nation's oldest Thanksgiving parade (the Gimbels parade, which has had many sponsors over the years, and is now known as the [[6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade]]) was first held in [[Philadelphia]] in 1920.  Other cities with parades on the holiday include the [[McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and parades in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; [[Houston]], [[Texas]]; [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]; and [[Fountain Hills, Arizona|Fountain Hills]], [[Arizona]]. There is also a second Thanksgiving balloon parade within the [[New York metropolitan area]], the [[UBS]] balloon parade in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], Connecticut, located {{convert|30|mi|km}} away; that parade is held the Sunday before Thanksgiving, so as not to compete with the parade in New York City.  It usually does not duplicate any balloon characters. The [[Celebrate the Season Parade]], held the last Saturday in November in [[Pittsburgh]], was sponsored by Macy's from 2006 to 2013 after Macy's bought the [[Kaufmann's]] store chain that had sponsored that parade prior to 2006.\n\n=== Universal's Holiday Parade Featuring Macy's ===\nSince 2001, Macy's Studios has partnered with the [[Universal Orlando Resort]] (owned by NBC parent [[NBCUniversal]]) to bring balloons and floats from New York City to the theme park in [[Florida]] every holiday season in an event known as the Macy's Holiday Parade. The parade is performed daily and includes the iconic Santa Claus float. Performers from the Orlando area are cast as various clowns, and the park used to invite guests to be \"balloon handlers\" for the parade.<ref>[http://www.universalorlando.com/holidays/index.html Universal Studios, Orlando: Theme Parks, Attractions, Accommodations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217092105/http://www.universalorlando.com/holidays/index.html|date=December 17, 2006}}</ref> In 2017, the Macy's Holiday Parade was renamed to Universal's Holiday Parade Featuring Macy's.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* The 1947 film ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', begins with the parade, as do most of its remakes. The film portrays the real [[Santa Claus]] being hired to work at Macy's after its own Santa impersonator gets drunk during the parade. NBC, in its telecasts, often showed the original 1947 film on Thanksgiving afternoon, following its coverage of the parade and the [[National Dog Show]].\n* In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode \"[[The Mom and Pop Store]]\", Elaine wins a spot on the parade route for her boss, Mr. Pitt, to hold the [[Woody Woodpecker]] balloon.\n* The parade is featured in the children's book ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (book)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]'' and its [[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|animated film adaption]] which where Rex mistakenly befriends a dinosaur balloon.\n* The first Thanksgiving-themed episode of ''[[Friends]]'' centered on the accidental release of the (unused at the time) \"[[Underdog (character)|Underdog]]\" balloon.\n* \"Macy's Day Parade\" is a song by [[Green Day]].\n* In 2008, a [[Coca-Cola]] [[computer animated|CGI]] ad aired in the United States during [[Super Bowl XLII]]. The commercial's plot centered around Underdog and fictional [[Stewie Griffin]] balloons chasing a Coke bottle-shaped balloon through New York City. The spot ended with a [[Charlie Brown]] balloon holding the Coke balloon.<!--The wording has been changed as both Underdog and Charlie Brown have appeared in the parade in the past, and Stewie Griffin was merely a ficticious balloon that was used for the ad, and Macy's has no plans for one.--> The advertisement won a Silver Lion Award at the annual Lions International Advertising Festival in [[Cannes, France|Cannes]], France that year, and the clip of the commercial with the Griffin balloon was featured in a Macy's commercial in October 2008 (along with clips from ''Miracle on 34th Street'', ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and other media where Macy's was mentioned). The commercial was also referenced in [[Thanksgiving (Family Guy)|an episode]] of ''[[Family Guy]].'' Stewie, one of its main characters, is seen watching the parade only to see the balloon of himself in the parade.\n* In [[Ghostbusters (2016)|the 2016 reboot of ''Ghostbusters'']], the new team of Ghostbusters fights a haunted balloon parade including several Macy's balloons from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n*{{cite book|first=William L.|last=Bird, Jr.|title=Holidays on Display|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of American History in Association with Princeton Architectural Press|year=2007}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons and category|Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade}}\n* {{Official website|1=http://www.macys.com/parade}}\n\n{{Federated}}\n{{Thanksgiving}}\n\n[[Category:1924 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Parades in New York City|Thanksgiving]]\n[[Category:Thanksgiving parades]]\n[[Category:Macy's]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1924]]\n[[Category:1932 radio programme debuts]]\n[[Category:1948 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1940s American television series]]\n[[Category:1950s American television series]]\n[[Category:1960s American television series]]\n[[Category:1970s American television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American television series]]\n[[Category:American annual television specials]]\n[[Category:CBS original programming]]\n[[Category:NBC original programming]]\n[[Category:November events]]\n[[Category:Festivals established in 1924]]\n[[Category:Thanksgiving (United States)]]\n[[Category:Parades in the United States]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Cnwilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:George Montgomery,Mr. Smith,John Schneider,Allison Smith,John James", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy%27s_Thanksgiving_Day_Parade"}

In 1724, [[Norridgewock]], an enemy [[fortification|stronghold]] on the [[Kennebec River]], was destroyed by a [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] [[militia]]. Subsequently, the region became less dangerous, and Sanford was first settled in 1739. Incorporated a town in 1768, it was named after Peleg Sanford.
