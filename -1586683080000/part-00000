They are [[Colonial organism|colonial]] and non-motile.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCurrently, there are 74 taxonomically accepted species of ''Scenedesmus''.<ref>M.D. Guiry in Guiry, M.D. & Guiry, G.M. 2015. AlgaeBase. World-wide electronic publication, National University of Ireland, Galway. http://www.algaebase.org; searched on 16 April 2015.</ref> Additionally, several subgenera have been identified, but vary according to the source. Hegewald denotes ''Acutodesmus'', ''Desmodesmus'', and ''Scenedesmus'' as the three major categories. Acutodesmus is characterized as having acute cell poles, while ''Desmodesmus'' and ''Scenedesmus'' have obtuse/truncated cell poles (differentiated by the presence or absence of spines respectively). Fossil records date ''Scenedesmus'' from 70 to 100 million years ago with Desmodesmus suspected to be the youngest of these three groups.<ref>Hegewald, Eberhard H. \"Taxonomy and Phylogeny of Scenedesmus.\" The Korean Journal of Phycology 12.4 (1997): 235-46.</ref>\n\n==Basic biology==\n''Scenedesmus'' is one of the most common freshwater algae genera; however, the extremely diverse morphologies found within species make identification difficult.<ref name=Lurling>L\u00fcrling, Miquel. The Smell of Water: Grazer-Induced Colony Formation in Scenedesmus. Thesis. Agricultural University of Wageningen, 1999.</ref> While most species are found across the world, certain species exist only in local populations such as S. intermedius and S. serratus which are found in New Zealand.<ref name=Lurling/>\n\n===Coenobia and cell growth===\n''Scenedesmus'' can exist as unicells; they are also frequently found in [[Coenobium (morphology)|coenobia]] of four or eight cells<ref name=Lurling/> inside a parental mother wall. Various coenobial architectures have been described, including linear, costulatoid, irregular, alternating, or dactylococcoid patterns (Figure 1).<ref name=Lurling/> The formation of coenobia is dependent on a number of factors. A higher proportion of unicellular organisms was found at high light intensities and high temperatures, suggesting that at higher growth rates the organisms prefer to be non-colonized.<ref name=Lurling/> \nSuccessful growth and division for algae relies on a balance between maintaining buoyancy in the euphotic zone (containing ideal light and nutritional conditions) and avoidance of grazing predators.<ref name=Lurling/> Larger colonies have a smaller surface-to-volume ratio, which limits nutrient uptake and light harvesting, and the large mass promotes sinking. However, in the presence of grazers, such as ''[[Daphnia]]'', that threaten to consume unicellular algae, the larger colonies provide significant security.<ref name=Lurling/> This threat can be so significant that the cells will coalesce into these 8-cell colonies even in severely limiting growth conditions in order to reduce grazing vulnerability or while in nutrient-deplete conditions.<ref name=Lurling/><ref name=Lurling2000>{{cite journal | author = L\u00fcrling Miquel | author2 = Van Donk Ellen | year = 2000 | title = Grazer-Induced Colony Formation in Scenedesmus: Are There Costs to Being Colonial? | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 88 | issue = 1| pages = 111\u2013118 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880113.x}}</ref>\n\n===Defense mechanisms===\nThe cells have other mechanisms of self-defense in addition to colonizing. ''Scenedesmus'' can be divided into two subgenera, the non-spiny ''Scenedesmus'' and the spiny ''Desmodesmus''. Although spineless, the ''Scenedesmus'' subgenera cells have thick cells walls and mucilage, which may make them digestion-resistant. Some chemical compounds in ''Scenedesmus'' could even be toxic to certain organisms upon consumption. Bristles of up to 100&nbsp;um may form a net in both spiny and non-spiny varieties to discourage predation even further.<ref name=Lurling/> Cells defensively form these bristles when [[kairomones]] are detected, an infochemical released by ''[[Daphnia]]'' that ''Scenedesmus'' has evolved to recognize as a warning signal.<ref name=Lurling/><ref name=Lurling2000/>\n\n===Reproduction and colony formation===\nDuring replication, the mother cell enlarges and becomes [[multinucleate]] after multiple divisions. The cytoplasm then is cleaved into [[uninucleate]] daughter cells, usually developing as non-motile [[autospore]]s. These daughter cells typically link up with other daughter cells to form a colony within the parental cell wall to be later released.<ref name=Pickett-Heaps>{{cite journal | author = Pickett-Heaps Jeremy D. | author2 = Staehelin L.

Staehelin ''et al.'' characterized two species in detail: S. pannonicus and S. longus. S. pannonicus assembles a tight-fitting \"warty\" layer compared to the loose \"reticulate\" layer found on S. longus.<ref name=Staehelin>{{cite journal | author = Staehelin L.

The last major category of ornamentation is rosettes that are common to many ''Scenedesmus'' species.<ref name=Staehelin/> Rosettes are ring-shaped structures enclosing small mounds on the cell surface and are usually sitting upon a thicker layer of cell wall than the surrounding areas.<ref name=Staehelin/> No potential function for these structures has been suggested. While S. longus was not observed with the comb-like structures of ''S. pannonicus'', it did have two variations of spikelets forming between the TLS and reticulate layer to keep the two apart.<ref name=Staehelin/>\n\n==Mitochondrial DNA==\n''[[Scenedesmus obliquus]]'' is notable for the non-standard coding of its [[mitochondrial DNA]] which may represent an intermediate form in the evolution of green algal mitochondrial DNA.<ref>{{Cite journal|work=Genome Research|date=June 2000|volume=10|issue=6|pages=819\u201331|title=The complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of Scenedesmus obliquus reflects an intermediate stage in the evolution of the green algal mitochondrial genome|author=A.

Scenedesmus conducts a pyruvate/glyeraldehyde 3-phosphate non-mevalonate pathway to synthesize isoprenoids. However, isoprenoid yields were too low (1.5~15&nbsp;mg per 10 liter of Scenedesmus culture when cells reached 0.5-0.6 g L<sup>\u22121</sup>) to be considered viable for future drop-in fuel production.<ref>Schwender, J., et al. \"Biosynthesis of isoprenoids (carotenoids, sterols, prenyl side-chains of chlorophylls and plastoquinone) via a novel pyruvate/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate non-mevalonate pathway in the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus.\" Biochemical Journal 316.Pt 1 (1996): 73.</ref>\n\n==Wastewater management==\nIn a study comparing the efficiency of ammonia and phosphorus removal from an [[agroindustrial]] [[wastewater]] by Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus dimorphus, Scenedesmus exhibited better efficiency of removing [[ammonia]] in cylindrical bioreactor while both algae removed [[phosphorus]] from the wastewater to the same extent.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gonz\u00e1lez , Estela Luz, Olivia Ca\u00f1izares Rosa, Baena Sandra | year = 1997 | title = Efficiency of ammonia and phosphorus removal from a Colombian agroindustrial wastewater by the microalgae'' Chlorella vulgaris'' and'' Scenedesmus dimorphus'' | url = | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 259\u2013262 | doi=10.1016/s0960-8524(97)00029-1}}</ref> [[Algal Turf Scrubber]] (ATS) is one of many technologies that utilize algae for treating variety of wastes and industrially polluted waters.<ref>http://www.algalturfscrubber.com/</ref> An algal turf scrubber in Florida, for example, removed phosphorus at a cost of $24 per kg whereas engineered wetland processes removed phosphorus at a cost of $77 per kg.

They are [[Colonial organism|colonial]] and non-motile.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCurrently, there are 74 taxonomically accepted species of ''Scenedesmus''.<ref>M.D. Guiry in Guiry, M.D. & Guiry, G.M. 2015. AlgaeBase. World-wide electronic publication, National University of Ireland, Galway. http://www.algaebase.org; searched on 16 April 2015.</ref> Additionally, several subgenera have been identified, but vary according to the source. Hegewald denotes ''Acutodesmus'', ''Desmodesmus'', and ''Scenedesmus'' as the three major categories. Acutodesmus is characterized as having acute cell poles, while ''Desmodesmus'' and ''Scenedesmus'' have obtuse/truncated cell poles (differentiated by the presence or absence of spines respectively). Fossil records date ''Scenedesmus'' from 70 to 100 million years ago with Desmodesmus suspected to be the youngest of these three groups.<ref>Hegewald, Eberhard H. \"Taxonomy and Phylogeny of Scenedesmus.\" The Korean Journal of Phycology 12.4 (1997): 235-46.</ref>\n\n==Basic biology==\n''Scenedesmus'' is one of the most common freshwater algae genera; however, the extremely diverse morphologies found within species make identification difficult.<ref name=Lurling>L\u00fcrling, Miquel. The Smell of Water: Grazer-Induced Colony Formation in Scenedesmus. Thesis. Agricultural University of Wageningen, 1999.</ref> While most species are found across the world, certain species exist only in local populations such as S. intermedius and S. serratus which are found in New Zealand.<ref name=Lurling/>\n\n===Coenobia and cell growth===\n''Scenedesmus'' can exist as unicells; they are also frequently found in [[Coenobium (morphology)|coenobia]] of four or eight cells<ref name=Lurling/> inside a parental mother wall. Various coenobial architectures have been described, including linear, costulatoid, irregular, alternating, or dactylococcoid patterns (Figure 1).<ref name=Lurling/> The formation of coenobia is dependent on a number of factors. A higher proportion of unicellular organisms was found at high light intensities and high temperatures, suggesting that at higher growth rates the organisms prefer to be non-colonized.<ref name=Lurling/> \nSuccessful growth and division for algae relies on a balance between maintaining buoyancy in the euphotic zone (containing ideal light and nutritional conditions) and avoidance of grazing predators.<ref name=Lurling/> Larger colonies have a smaller surface-to-volume ratio, which limits nutrient uptake and light harvesting, and the large mass promotes sinking. However, in the presence of grazers, such as ''[[Daphnia]]'', that threaten to consume unicellular algae, the larger colonies provide significant security.<ref name=Lurling/> This threat can be so significant that the cells will coalesce into these 8-cell colonies even in severely limiting growth conditions in order to reduce grazing vulnerability or while in nutrient-deplete conditions.<ref name=Lurling/><ref name=Lurling2000>{{cite journal | author = L\u00fcrling Miquel | author2 = Van Donk Ellen | year = 2000 | title = Grazer-Induced Colony Formation in Scenedesmus: Are There Costs to Being Colonial? | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 88 | issue = 1| pages = 111\u2013118 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880113.x}}</ref>\n\n===Defense mechanisms===\nThe cells have other mechanisms of self-defense in addition to colonizing. ''Scenedesmus'' can be divided into two subgenera, the non-spiny ''Scenedesmus'' and the spiny ''Desmodesmus''. Although spineless, the ''Scenedesmus'' subgenera cells have thick cells walls and mucilage, which may make them digestion-resistant. Some chemical compounds in ''Scenedesmus'' could even be toxic to certain organisms upon consumption. Bristles of up to 100&nbsp;um may form a net in both spiny and non-spiny varieties to discourage predation even further.<ref name=Lurling/> Cells defensively form these bristles when [[kairomones]] are detected, an infochemical released by ''[[Daphnia]]'' that ''Scenedesmus'' has evolved to recognize as a warning signal.<ref name=Lurling/><ref name=Lurling2000/>\n\n===Reproduction and colony formation===\nDuring replication, the mother cell enlarges and becomes [[multinucleate]] after multiple divisions. The cytoplasm then is cleaved into [[uninucleate]] daughter cells, usually developing as non-motile [[autospore]]s. These daughter cells typically link up with other daughter cells to form a colony within the parental cell wall to be later released.<ref name=Pickett-Heaps>{{cite journal | author = Pickett-Heaps Jeremy D. | author2 = Staehelin L.

Staehelin ''et al.'' characterized two species in detail: S. pannonicus and S. longus. S. pannonicus assembles a tight-fitting \"warty\" layer compared to the loose \"reticulate\" layer found on S. longus.<ref name=Staehelin>{{cite journal | author = Staehelin L.

The last major category of ornamentation is rosettes that are common to many ''Scenedesmus'' species.<ref name=Staehelin/> Rosettes are ring-shaped structures enclosing small mounds on the cell surface and are usually sitting upon a thicker layer of cell wall than the surrounding areas.<ref name=Staehelin/> No potential function for these structures has been suggested. While S. longus was not observed with the comb-like structures of ''S. pannonicus'', it did have two variations of spikelets forming between the TLS and reticulate layer to keep the two apart.<ref name=Staehelin/>\n\n==Mitochondrial DNA==\n''[[Scenedesmus obliquus]]'' is notable for the non-standard coding of its [[mitochondrial DNA]] which may represent an intermediate form in the evolution of green algal mitochondrial DNA.<ref>{{Cite journal|work=Genome Research|date=June 2000|volume=10|issue=6|pages=819\u201331|title=The complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of Scenedesmus obliquus reflects an intermediate stage in the evolution of the green algal mitochondrial genome|author=A.

The very first, possibly from the whole parish, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Given that [[Czech Americans|American Czechs]] were a significant minority, most of his children married people of [[Germanic peoples|German]] descent. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of Mysl\u00edv's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nDuban was followed by the Tichacek family.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole parish, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Given that [[Czech Americans|American Czechs]] were a significant minority, most of his children married people of [[Germanic peoples|German]] descent. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of Mysl\u00edv's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nDuban was followed by the Tichacek family. The Tichacek's temporarily lived in Mysl\u00edv where one of their sons Alois was born in 1857. Shortly afterwards, they also moved to St. Louis. Immigration slowed for a time in the 1860's because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]].\n\nMany of those who settled in Baltimore were participants of the [[St. Wenceslaus Church, Baltimore|St. Wenceslaus Church]].

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession.
