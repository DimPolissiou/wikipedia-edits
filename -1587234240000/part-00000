After the fall of Kush, the [[Nubians]] formed the three Christian kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], with the latter two lasting until around 1500. Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by [[Bedouin|Arab nomads]]. From the 16th\u201319th centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the [[Sultanate of Sennar|Funj sultanate]], while [[Sultanate of Darfur|Darfur]] ruled the west and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] the far north. This period saw extensive [[Islamisation]] and [[Arabisation]].\n\nFrom 1820 to 1874 the entirety of Sudan was conquered by the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the harsh Egyptian reign was eventually met with a successful [[Mahdist War|revolt]] led by the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]], resulting in the establishment of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Caliphate of Omdurman]]. This state was eventually destroyed in 1898 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], who would then [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|govern Sudan together with Egypt]].\n\nThe 20th century saw the growth of Sudanese nationalism and in 1953 Britain granted Sudan self-government. Independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1956. Since independence, Sudan has been ruled by a series of unstable parliamentary governments and military regimes. Under [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], Sudan instituted [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in 1983.<ref name=\"sudan.gov.sd\">{{cite web |url=http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902160838/http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |archive-date=2 September 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This exacerbated the rift between the Islamic north, the seat of the government and the Animists and Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]].

Pharaoh [[Piye]] attempted to expand the empire into the Near East but was thwarted by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush is mentioned in the Bible as having saved the Israelites from the wrath of the Assyrians, although disease among the besiegers was the main reason for the failure to take the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roux, Georges |title=Ancient Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC|date= 1992|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193825-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}\nThe war that took place between Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] and the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] was a decisive event in western history, with the Nubians being defeated in their attempts to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]] by Assyria. Sennacherib's successor [[Esarhaddon]] went further and invaded Egypt itself to secure his control of the Levant. This succeeded, as he managed to expel Taharqa from Lower Egypt. Taharqa fled back to Upper Egypt and Nubia, where he died two years later. Lower Egypt came under Assyrian vassalage but proved unruly, unsuccessfully rebelling against the Assyrians. Then, the king [[Tantamani]], a successor of Taharqa, made a final determined attempt to regain Lower Egypt from the newly re-instated Assyrian vassal [[Necho I]]. He managed to retake [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] killing Necho in the process and besieged cities in the Nile Delta. [[Ashurbanipal]], who had succeeded Esarhaddon,  sent a large army in Egypt to regain control. He routed Tantamani near Memphis and, pursuing him, [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]]. Although the Assyrians immediately departed Upper Egypt after these events, weakened, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] less than a decade later. This ended all hopes of a revival of the Nubian Empire, which rather continued in the form of a smaller kingdom centered on [[Napata]]. The city was raided by the Egyptian c. 590 BC and the Kushite resettled in [[Mero\u00eb]].\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the Nubian capital was still at Mero\u00eb. In [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Ethiopia]] (a term also used earlier by the Assyrians when encountering the Nubians). The civilization of Kush was among the first in the world to use iron smelting technology. The Nubian kingdom at Mero\u00eb persisted until the mid-fourth century AD.\n\n===Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350\u20131500)===\n{{main|Nobatia|Makuria|Alodia|Daju kingdom}} \n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The three Christian Nubian kingdoms.

Muhammad Ahmad died on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum. After a power struggle amongst his deputies, [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], with the help primarily of the [[Baggara]] of western Sudan, overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of ''Khalifa'' (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (who were usually [[Baggara]]) as emirs over each of the several provinces.\n\n[[File:Battle of Omdurman-1.JPG|thumb|250px|The flight of the Khalifa after his defeat at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].]]\n\nRegional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa's brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country.

In March 1889, king [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia marched on [[Metemma]]; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the Ethiopian forces withdrew. Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi, the Khalifa's general, attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889, but British-led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah. The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar's invincibility. The [[Belgium|Belgians]] prevented the Mahdi's men from conquering [[Equatoria]], and in 1893, the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at [[Agordat]] (in [[Eritrea]]) and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia.\n\nIn the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as a British colony. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the [[Nile]] headwaters. Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at [[Aswan]].

The British Imperial General Staff prepared for military defence of the region, which was thin on the ground.<ref>Sir Miles Lampson quoted in a diary, 29 September 1938; Morewood, p.117</ref> The British ambassador blocked Italian attempts to secure a Non-Aggression Treaty with Egypt-Sudan. But Mahmoud was a supporter of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]; the region was caught between the Empire's efforts to save the Jews, and moderate Arab calls to halt migration.<ref>Morewood, p.164-5</ref>\n\nThe Sudanese Government was directly involved militarily in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Formed in 1925, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] played an active part in responding to incursions early in World War Two.  Italian troops occupied [[Kassala]] and other border areas from [[Italian East Africa|Italian Somaliland]] during 1940.  In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the Italian colony by British and Commonwealth forces.  The last British [[governor-general]] was [[Robert George Howe]].\n\nThe [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] finally heralded the beginning of the march towards Sudanese independence. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt's new leaders, [[Mohammed Naguib]], whose mother was Sudanese, and later [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt to officially abandon its claims of sovereignty. In addition Nasser knew it would be difficult for Egypt to govern an impoverished Sudan after its independence. The British on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdist successor, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]], whom it was believed would resist Egyptian pressure for Sudanese independence.  Rahman was capable of this, but his regime was plagued by political ineptitude, which garnered a colossal loss of support in northern and central Sudan. Both Egypt and Britain sensed a great instability fomenting, and thus opted to allow both Sudanese regions, north and south to have a free vote on whether they wished independence or a British withdrawal.\n\n===Independence (1956\u2013present)===\n{{Main|History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|History of Sudan (1969\u201385)|History of Sudan (1986\u2013present)}}\n{{Missing information|section|the history of Sudan between 1956 and 1969 and between 1977 and 1989|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Sudan independence 2.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Sudan's flag raised at independence ceremony on 1 January 1956 by the Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari and in presence of opposition leader Mohamed Ahmed Almahjoub]] \nA polling process was carried out resulting in composition of a democratic parliament and [[Ismail al-Azhari]] was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035130/http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archivedate=20 November 2008 |title=Brief History of the Sudan |publisher=Sudan Embassy in London |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister [[Ismail al-Azhari]].\n\nDissatisfaction culminated in a second [[1969 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 25 May 1969. The coup leader, Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], became prime minister, and the new regime abolished parliament and outlawed all political parties. Disputes between [[Marxist]] and non-Marxist elements within the ruling military coalition resulted in [[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|a briefly successful coup in July 1971]], led by the [[Sudanese Communist Party]]. Several days later, anti-communist military elements restored Nimeiry to power.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north\u2013south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to ten years hiatus in the civil war but an end to American investment in the [[Jonglei Canal]] project.  This had been considered absolutely essential to irrigate the Upper Nile region and to prevent an environmental catastrophe and wide-scale famine among the local tribes, most especially the Dinka. In the civil war that followed their homeland was raided, looted, pillaged and burned.  Many of the tribe were murdered in a bloody civil war that raged for over 20 years.\n\n[[File:Hashem al Atta, 1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat.jpg|thumb|[[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat]]]]\nUntil the early 1970s, Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government. This further promoted the mechanised export agriculture sector. This caused great hardship for the pastoralists of Sudan (see [[Nuba peoples#Effect of private agriculture schemes|Nuba peoples]]). In 1976, the Ansars had mounted a bloody but unsuccessful coup attempt. But in July 1977, President Nimeiry met with Ansar leader [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], opening the way for a possible reconciliation. Hundreds of political prisoners were released, and in August a general amnesty was announced for all oppositionists.\n\n===Bashir government (1989\u20132019)===\n[[File:Omar al-Bashir (2017-11-23) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Omar al-Bashir in 2017]]\n{{further|1989 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nOn 30 June 1989, Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]] led a bloodless [[1989 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]].<ref name=reuters-factbox>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL1435274220080714 |title=Factbox \u2013 Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 January 2011 |date=14 July 2008}}</ref> The new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level.<ref name=\"Bekele\">{{cite news |last=Bekele |first=Yilma |title=Chickens Are Coming Home To Roost! |url=http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2929 |work=[[Ethiopian Review]] |location=Addis Ababa |date=12 July 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> Later al-Bashir carried out purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.<ref name=\"Kepel, Jihad 2002, p.181\">{{cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01090-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0/page/181 181]}}</ref> On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir appointed himself \"[[President of Sudan|President]]\" and disbanded the Revolutionary Command Council.

Two popular divisions of Sufism, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist parties, respectively. Only the Darfur region has traditionally been bereft of the Sufi brotherhoods common in the rest of the country.<ref>Hamid Eltgani Ali, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4BNUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=warsh+quran&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=warsh&f=false Darfur's Political Economy: A Quest for Development], pg. 9.

The [[Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church]] also has membership.{{fix|text=along with which others within current borders?}}\n\nReligious identity plays a role in the country's political divisions. Northern and western Muslims have dominated the country's political and economic system since independence. The NCP draws much of its support from [[Islamists]], [[Salafis]]/[[Wahhabis]] and other conservative Arab Muslims in the north. The [[Ummah|Umma]] Party has traditionally attracted Arab followers of the Ansar sect of Sufism as well as non-Arab Muslims from Darfur and Kordofan. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes both Arab and non-Arab Muslims in the north and east, especially those in the Khatmia Sufi sect.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Further|Music of Sudan|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan|List of Sudanese writers}}\nSudanese culture melds the behaviors, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in 145 different languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest. Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarising and contested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|title=Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J.

Beginning with the imposition of strict [[Salafi]] interpretation of ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Z\u0101r]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipes]], were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]. Northern Sudan listens to different music than the rest of Sudan. A type of music called Aldlayib uses a musical instrument called the Tambur. The Tambur has five strings and is made from wood and makes music accompanied by the voices of human applause and singing artists. This music has a perfect blend that gives the area of the Northern State a special character.\n\n=== Cinema and photography===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan}}\nThe [[cinema of Sudan]] began with [[cinematography]] by the [[History of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|British colonial presence]] in the early 20th century. After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the [[Islamism|Islamist]] government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards. Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\nThe use of [[Photography of Sudan|photography in Sudan]] goes back to the 1880s and the [[Turkish Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian rule]]. As in other countries, the growing importance of photography for [[mass media]] like newspapers, as well as for amateur photographers led to a wider photographic [[documentation]] and [[Photojournalism#Golden age|use of photographs]] in Sudan during the 20th century and beyond. In the 21st century, photography in Sudan has undergone important changes, mainly due to [[digital photography]] and distribution through [[social media]] and the [[internet]].\n\n===Sport===\nThe most popular sports in Sudan are athletics ([[track and field]]) and [[Association football|football]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Though not as successful as football, [[basketball]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[volleyball]] are also popular in Sudan. In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Sudan national basketball team|national basketball team]] finished among the continent's top teams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Nowadays, it is only a minor force.\n\nSudanese football has a long history. Sudan was one of the four African nations \u2013 the others being Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa \u2013 which formed African football. Sudan hosted the first [[African Cup of Nations]] in 1956, and has won the African Cup of Nations once, in 1970. Two years later, the Sudan's National Football Team participated in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]]. The [[Khartoum|nation's capital]] is home to the Khartoum League, which is considered to be the oldest football league in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSudanese football teams such as [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal]], [[Al-Merrikh SC|Al-Merrikh]], and Abdelgadir Osman FC are among the nation's strongest teams. Other teams like Khartoum, El-Neel, [[Al-Nidal El-Nahud]] and [[Hay-Al Arab]], are also starting to grow in popularity.\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|Bejia men wearing galabiyas]]\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the [[jalabiya|galabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]]. The galabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\nThe most common dress for Sudanese women is the ''thobe'' or ''[[thawb]]'', pronounced ''tobe'' in Sudanese dialect. The thobe is a white or colorful long, one piece cloth that women wrap around their inner garments, usually covering their head and hair. \n\nDue to a 1991 penal code (''Public Order Law''), women were not allowed to wear trousers in public, because it was interpreted as an \"obscene outfit.\" The punishment for wearing trousers could be up to 40 lashes, but after being found guilty in 2009, one woman was fined the equivalent of 200 U.S. dollars instead.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?_r=0| work=The New York Times | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Gettleman | first2=Waleed | last2=Arafat | title=Sudan Court Fines Woman for Wearing Trousers | date=8 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Sudan}}\n[[File:Faculty of Science (University of Khartoum) 002.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Khartoum University]] established in 1902]]\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40% of children are not going to schools due to the economic situation.

After the fall of Kush, the [[Nubians]] formed the three Christian kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], with the latter two lasting until around 1500. Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by [[Bedouin|Arab nomads]]. From the 16th\u201319th centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the [[Sultanate of Sennar|Funj sultanate]], while [[Sultanate of Darfur|Darfur]] ruled the west and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] the far north. This period saw extensive [[Islamisation]] and [[Arabisation]].\n\nFrom 1820 to 1874 the entirety of Sudan was conquered by the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the harsh Egyptian reign was eventually met with a successful [[Mahdist War|revolt]] led by the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]], resulting in the establishment of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Caliphate of Omdurman]]. This state was eventually destroyed in 1898 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], who would then [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|govern Sudan together with Egypt]].\n\nThe 20th century saw the growth of Sudanese nationalism and in 1953 Britain granted Sudan self-government. Independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1956. Since independence, Sudan has been ruled by a series of unstable parliamentary governments and military regimes. Under [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], Sudan instituted [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in 1983.<ref name=\"sudan.gov.sd\">{{cite web |url=http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902160838/http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |archive-date=2 September 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This exacerbated the rift between the Islamic north, the seat of the government and the Animists and Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]].

Pharaoh [[Piye]] attempted to expand the empire into the Near East but was thwarted by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush is mentioned in the Bible as having saved the Israelites from the wrath of the Assyrians, although disease among the besiegers was the main reason for the failure to take the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roux, Georges |title=Ancient Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC|date= 1992|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193825-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}\nThe war that took place between Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] and the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] was a decisive event in western history, with the Nubians being defeated in their attempts to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]] by Assyria. Sennacherib's successor [[Esarhaddon]] went further and invaded Egypt itself to secure his control of the Levant. This succeeded, as he managed to expel Taharqa from Lower Egypt. Taharqa fled back to Upper Egypt and Nubia, where he died two years later. Lower Egypt came under Assyrian vassalage but proved unruly, unsuccessfully rebelling against the Assyrians. Then, the king [[Tantamani]], a successor of Taharqa, made a final determined attempt to regain Lower Egypt from the newly re-instated Assyrian vassal [[Necho I]]. He managed to retake [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] killing Necho in the process and besieged cities in the Nile Delta. [[Ashurbanipal]], who had succeeded Esarhaddon,  sent a large army in Egypt to regain control. He routed Tantamani near Memphis and, pursuing him, [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]]. Although the Assyrians immediately departed Upper Egypt after these events, weakened, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] less than a decade later. This ended all hopes of a revival of the Nubian Empire, which rather continued in the form of a smaller kingdom centered on [[Napata]]. The city was raided by the Egyptian c. 590 BC and the Kushite resettled in [[Mero\u00eb]].\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the Nubian capital was still at Mero\u00eb. In [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Ethiopia]] (a term also used earlier by the Assyrians when encountering the Nubians). The civilization of Kush was among the first in the world to use iron smelting technology. The Nubian kingdom at Mero\u00eb persisted until the mid-fourth century AD.\n\n===Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350\u20131500)===\n{{main|Nobatia|Makuria|Alodia|Daju kingdom}} \n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The three Christian Nubian kingdoms.

Muhammad Ahmad died on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum. After a power struggle amongst his deputies, [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], with the help primarily of the [[Baggara]] of western Sudan, overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of ''Khalifa'' (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (who were usually [[Baggara]]) as emirs over each of the several provinces.\n\n[[File:Battle of Omdurman-1.JPG|thumb|250px|The flight of the Khalifa after his defeat at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].]]\n\nRegional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa's brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country.

In March 1889, king [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia marched on [[Metemma]]; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the Ethiopian forces withdrew. Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi, the Khalifa's general, attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889, but British-led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah. The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar's invincibility. The [[Belgium|Belgians]] prevented the Mahdi's men from conquering [[Equatoria]], and in 1893, the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at [[Agordat]] (in [[Eritrea]]) and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia.\n\nIn the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as a British colony. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the [[Nile]] headwaters. Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at [[Aswan]].

The British Imperial General Staff prepared for military defence of the region, which was thin on the ground.<ref>Sir Miles Lampson quoted in a diary, 29 September 1938; Morewood, p.117</ref> The British ambassador blocked Italian attempts to secure a Non-Aggression Treaty with Egypt-Sudan. But Mahmoud was a supporter of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]; the region was caught between the Empire's efforts to save the Jews, and moderate Arab calls to halt migration.<ref>Morewood, p.164-5</ref>\n\nThe Sudanese Government was directly involved militarily in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Formed in 1925, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] played an active part in responding to incursions early in World War Two.  Italian troops occupied [[Kassala]] and other border areas from [[Italian East Africa|Italian Somaliland]] during 1940.  In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the Italian colony by British and Commonwealth forces.  The last British [[governor-general]] was [[Robert George Howe]].\n\nThe [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] finally heralded the beginning of the march towards Sudanese independence. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt's new leaders, [[Mohammed Naguib]], whose mother was Sudanese, and later [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt to officially abandon its claims of sovereignty. In addition Nasser knew it would be difficult for Egypt to govern an impoverished Sudan after its independence. The British on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdist successor, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]], whom it was believed would resist Egyptian pressure for Sudanese independence.  Rahman was capable of this, but his regime was plagued by political ineptitude, which garnered a colossal loss of support in northern and central Sudan. Both Egypt and Britain sensed a great instability fomenting, and thus opted to allow both Sudanese regions, north and south to have a free vote on whether they wished independence or a British withdrawal.\n\n===Independence (1956\u2013present)===\n{{Main|History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|History of Sudan (1969\u201385)|History of Sudan (1986\u2013present)}}\n{{Missing information|section|the history of Sudan between 1956 and 1969 and between 1977 and 1989|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Sudan independence 2.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Sudan's flag raised at independence ceremony on 1 January 1956 by the Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari and in presence of opposition leader Mohamed Ahmed Almahjoub]] \nA polling process was carried out resulting in composition of a democratic parliament and [[Ismail al-Azhari]] was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035130/http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archivedate=20 November 2008 |title=Brief History of the Sudan |publisher=Sudan Embassy in London |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister [[Ismail al-Azhari]].\n\nDissatisfaction culminated in a second [[1969 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 25 May 1969. The coup leader, Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], became prime minister, and the new regime abolished parliament and outlawed all political parties. Disputes between [[Marxist]] and non-Marxist elements within the ruling military coalition resulted in [[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|a briefly successful coup in July 1971]], led by the [[Sudanese Communist Party]]. Several days later, anti-communist military elements restored Nimeiry to power.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north\u2013south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to ten years hiatus in the civil war but an end to American investment in the [[Jonglei Canal]] project.  This had been considered absolutely essential to irrigate the Upper Nile region and to prevent an environmental catastrophe and wide-scale famine among the local tribes, most especially the Dinka. In the civil war that followed their homeland was raided, looted, pillaged and burned.  Many of the tribe were murdered in a bloody civil war that raged for over 20 years.\n\n[[File:Hashem al Atta, 1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat.jpg|thumb|[[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat]]]]\nUntil the early 1970s, Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government. This further promoted the mechanised export agriculture sector. This caused great hardship for the pastoralists of Sudan (see [[Nuba peoples#Effect of private agriculture schemes|Nuba peoples]]). In 1976, the Ansars had mounted a bloody but unsuccessful coup attempt. But in July 1977, President Nimeiry met with Ansar leader [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], opening the way for a possible reconciliation. Hundreds of political prisoners were released, and in August a general amnesty was announced for all oppositionists.\n\n===Bashir government (1989\u20132019)===\n[[File:Omar al-Bashir (2017-11-23) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Omar al-Bashir in 2017]]\n{{further|1989 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nOn 30 June 1989, Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]] led a bloodless [[1989 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]].<ref name=reuters-factbox>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL1435274220080714 |title=Factbox \u2013 Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 January 2011 |date=14 July 2008}}</ref> The new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level.<ref name=\"Bekele\">{{cite news |last=Bekele |first=Yilma |title=Chickens Are Coming Home To Roost! |url=http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2929 |work=[[Ethiopian Review]] |location=Addis Ababa |date=12 July 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> Later al-Bashir carried out purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.<ref name=\"Kepel, Jihad 2002, p.181\">{{cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01090-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0/page/181 181]}}</ref> On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir appointed himself \"[[President of Sudan|President]]\" and disbanded the Revolutionary Command Council.

Two popular divisions of Sufism, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist parties, respectively. Only the Darfur region has traditionally been bereft of the Sufi brotherhoods common in the rest of the country.<ref>Hamid Eltgani Ali, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4BNUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=warsh+quran&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=warsh&f=false Darfur's Political Economy: A Quest for Development], pg. 9.

The [[Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church]] also has membership.{{fix|text=along with which others within current borders?}}\n\nReligious identity plays a role in the country's political divisions. Northern and western Muslims have dominated the country's political and economic system since independence. The NCP draws much of its support from [[Islamists]], [[Salafis]]/[[Wahhabis]] and other conservative Arab Muslims in the north. The [[Ummah|Umma]] Party has traditionally attracted Arab followers of the Ansar sect of Sufism as well as non-Arab Muslims from Darfur and Kordofan. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes both Arab and non-Arab Muslims in the north and east, especially those in the Khatmia Sufi sect.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Further|Music of Sudan|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan|List of Sudanese writers}}\nSudanese culture melds the behaviors, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in 145 different languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest. Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarising and contested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|title=Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J.

Beginning with the imposition of strict [[Salafi]] interpretation of ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Z\u0101r]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipes]], were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]. Northern Sudan listens to different music than the rest of Sudan. A type of music called Aldlayib uses a musical instrument called the Tambur. The Tambur has five strings and is made from wood and makes music accompanied by the voices of human applause and singing artists. This music has a perfect blend that gives the area of the Northern State a special character.\n\n=== Cinema and photography===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan}}\nThe [[cinema of Sudan]] began with [[cinematography]] by the [[History of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|British colonial presence]] in the early 20th century. After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the [[Islamism|Islamist]] government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards. Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\nThe use of [[Photography of Sudan|photography in Sudan]] goes back to the 1880s and the [[Turkish Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian rule]]. As in other countries, the growing importance of photography for [[mass media]] like newspapers, as well as for amateur photographers led to a wider photographic [[documentation]] and [[Photojournalism#Golden age|use of photographs]] in Sudan during the 20th century and beyond. In the 21st century, photography in Sudan has undergone important changes, mainly due to [[digital photography]] and distribution through [[social media]] and the [[internet]].\n\n===Sport===\nThe most popular sports in Sudan are athletics ([[track and field]]) and [[Association football|football]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Though not as successful as football, [[basketball]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[volleyball]] are also popular in Sudan. In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Sudan national basketball team|national basketball team]] finished among the continent's top teams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Nowadays, it is only a minor force.\n\nSudanese football has a long history. Sudan was one of the four African nations \u2013 the others being Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa \u2013 which formed African football. Sudan hosted the first [[African Cup of Nations]] in 1956, and has won the African Cup of Nations once, in 1970. Two years later, the Sudan's National Football Team participated in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]]. The [[Khartoum|nation's capital]] is home to the Khartoum League, which is considered to be the oldest football league in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSudanese football teams such as [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal]], [[Al-Merrikh SC|Al-Merrikh]], and Abdelgadir Osman FC are among the nation's strongest teams. Other teams like Khartoum, El-Neel, [[Al-Nidal El-Nahud]] and [[Hay-Al Arab]], are also starting to grow in popularity.\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|Bejia men wearing galabiyas]]\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the [[jalabiya|galabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]]. The galabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\nThe most common dress for Sudanese women is the ''thobe'' or ''[[thawb]]'', pronounced ''tobe'' in Sudanese dialect. The thobe is a white or colorful long, one piece cloth that women wrap around their inner garments, usually covering their head and hair. \n\nDue to a 1991 penal code (''Public Order Law''), women were not allowed to wear trousers in public, because it was interpreted as an \"obscene outfit.\" The punishment for wearing trousers could be up to 40 lashes, but after being found guilty in 2009, one woman was fined the equivalent of 200 U.S. dollars instead.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?_r=0| work=The New York Times | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Gettleman | first2=Waleed | last2=Arafat | title=Sudan Court Fines Woman for Wearing Trousers | date=8 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Sudan}}\n[[File:Faculty of Science (University of Khartoum) 002.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Khartoum University]] established in 1902]]\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40% of children are not going to schools due to the economic situation.

Dennis McIntyre came to America in the 1850s and was a railroad car inspector for the West Point and Alabama Railroad. He settled first in Georgia, where he met his wife, and the family had moved to Alabama by 1860, when they are listed in census records. Dennis is listed on the roster of the Montgomery County Home Guard, CSA, in 1864. His wife Mary was originally from Crossmolina, County Mayo, where many Gaughans reside. She moved to Georgia in the 1850s to join her brother, Patrick Gaughan. Patrick later moved to Camden, Arkansas. He enlisted in the 33rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA, in 1863.   The surname [[McIntyre]] is a Scottish Highland name (also spelled MacIntyre) that means \"son of the carpenter\" or wright. The Gaelic original is ''Mac an-T Saoir''. McIntyres were originally to be found in Lorne where they possessed the lands of Glenoe from the 13th century until the early 19th century. According to family tradition, the MacIntyres/McIntyres came originally from the Hebrides. In the 13th century, they sailed from their ancestral home carrying a white cow, and settled on the mainland at Glen Noe by Ben Cruachan. On the mainland the MacIntyres/McIntyres were hereditary foresters  to the lords of Lorne. For many years, they paid the Campbells of Glenorchy a symbolic rent of a white calf and a snowball for their Glen Noe lands. During the 18th century, the rent was commuted to cash, then progressively raised. Donald, the 4th MacIntyre chief, could not pay so he emigrated to Canada. His brother and successor Captain Donald MacIntyre the fifth chief, tried but failed to make ends meet and the Glen Noe lands were lost two hundred years ago, in 1808. The present Clan Chief is Donald MacIntyre of Glenoe.\n\nFrank McIntyre was a grandson of James and Norah McIntyre of The Brockey, Killybegs, County Donegal, Ireland. His grandmother was Norah Cannon, the daughter of Dennis and Jane Cannon (n\u00e9e McBraerty) of Killybegs, County Donegal. Her sister Mary Cannon married Thomas Murrin of Croaghlin (1804\u20131882) Banagh barony, Killybegs, County Donegal, their daughter Jane Murrin (1829\u20131903) married Charles Dawson Lea (1819\u20131883) in 1851. Their son John Edward Dawson Lea (1859\u20131929) married Hannora McIntyre his cousin, who died on 10 October 1938.  John and Hannorah lived at Rathmines, Dublin, and Aileach House, Killybegs, County Donegal, where his cousin and sister-in-law Agnes McIntyre also lived and where she died on 5 February 1990, aged 92. Agnes and Hannorah McIntyre were first cousins of General Frank McIntyre and Judge Patrick McIntyre. On the distaff side their first cousin was S\u00e9amus Hegarty, D.D. an Irish Roman Catholic prelate, who served as Bishop of Raphoe from 1982 to 1994, then as Bishop of Derry from 1994 to 2011. Agnes and Hannorah were the daughters of John and Mary McIntyre n\u00e9e Carr, and like Frank the grandchildren of James and Nora McIntyre, Nora being a Cannon.\n\nThe Cannons are descended from two of Ireland's most renowned Kings: Conn of the Hundred Battles and Niall of the Nine Hostages. The O'Cannons have been described as \"Ancient Princes of Tir Connaill\" and \"Valiant Chiefs\". However their 350-year dynasty in Tir Connaill ended in 1250. Their ancient territory would seem to have been Tir Aeda (now the barony of Tirhigh) after the deaths of Rory O' Canannain and his son Niall O'Canannain in 1250, the sept declined greatly in power. Brian O'Neill died ten years later in 1260, he had supported an O'Canannain claimant to Tir Conaill i.e. to the Kingdom of Tir Conaill (Tirconnell).  The personal name Canannain is a diminutive of Cano meaning 'wolf cub'. Canannain was fifth in descent from Flaithbertach mac Loingsig (died 765), high-king of Ireland; they were the descendants of Neill of the Nine Hostages (Irish: Niall Noigiallach) who died c. 405 by his son, Conall Gulban who gave his name to Tir Conaill, the Land of Conall, now County Donegal.\n\nUi Canannain was the ancestral name of the Cannons and Tir Connaill (all of [[County Donegal]] and part of [[County Londonderry]]) was the \"Land of the Cannons\". By the early 17th century the name Ui Canannain had been anglicised to O'Cannon. Further anglicisation took place during the Penal laws in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the name in County Donegal became Cannon. In the early 1880s, there were just 200 families bearing the Cannon surname living in County Donegal, who were mainly tenant farmers. The Cannons/O'Canannains, were of the ancient sept of  Cenell Conaill, a branch of the northern Ui Neill and descend from Ruaidri ua Canannain (died 30 November 950) King of Cenel Conaill, and grandson of Canannain, who flourished in the second half of the 9th century.  One of Neill's most famous descendants was George Washington, the first President of the United States of America. The site of the ancient seat of the O'Canannains was near Letterkenny the largest town of County  Donegal, which is said on good authority to represent the hillside of the O'Cannons (English translation).\n\n==Education ==\nFrank McIntyre was educated in public and private schools in Montgomery and at The University of Alabama from 1880 to 1882. While a student in Tuscaloosa, his professors noted his talents and recommended him for his home district's vacancy to West Point. McIntyre successfully passed a competitive examination and was enrolled at the United States Military Academy in the Fall of 1882. The son of Irish immigrants never forgot his roots. In a 1938 letter to his classmates at West Point, McIntyre reflected \"I can never forget the unsolicited kindness of these professors at the University [of Alabama] to a young boy without influence and with not the slightest obligation on their part. Their action reflects one phase of the spirit of Alabama. How could I forget it?\" McIntyre graduated from West Point in 1886, ranked tenth in his class. A classmate and roommate of McIntyre was General John J.

He saw duty at different posts, chiefly on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border, until the [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with Spain]], in which he participated in the [[Puerto Rico Campaign]] in 1898. McIntyre served in the Philippines from 1899 to 1902, after which he served with the general staff.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n[[File:PHI-68c-Philippine Islands-Treasury Certificate-1 Peso (1924) Design proof.jpg|thumb|Design proof for a [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#American Period|1924 Philippine one peso note]], approved by McIntyre.]]\nMcIntyre was attached to the Bureau of Insular Affairs in 1905 and became its Chief in 1912, relieving General [[Clarence Ransom Edwards]].  During the [[World War I|War in Europe]], he was assistant chief of staff with the rank of [[Major General|major-general]]. McIntyre served as long-time Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs and played a significant role in the governance of the Philippines and Puerto Rico throughout this period. With respect to Puerto Rico, McIntyre wavered on the wisdom of granting [[United States citizenship]] to Puerto Ricans but ultimately supported the [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act]] of 1917. At times, McIntyre had strained relations with other officials in Puerto Rico, such as U.S. District Judge and fellow Alabama native[[Peter J. Hamilton]] during the 1910s and Governor [[E. Mont Reily]] during the 1920s. In his 2007 book ''Planting the American Flag: Twelve Men Who Expanded the United States Overseas'', author Peter C. Stuart devoted an entire chapter to the career of Gen. McIntyre and his leadership of the Bureau of Insular Affairs. With respect to McIntyre's administration of the Philippines  and Puerto Rico, Stuart noted \" While others more assertive or egoistic imprinted on the protectorates their personal marks, McIntyre left no memorial....yet he wielded perhaps greater sway upon the United States' little empire than all his more visible imperial colleagues.\" Stuart credits Gen. McIntyre's stewardship over the Bureau of Insular Affairs as having been critical to its survival, and noting that within a decade following his retirement the Bureau was turned over to the Department of the Interior and disbanded in 1939. Reflecting upon the Bureau's demise, Stuart noted \"An era of American imperial administration--in many ways the McIntyre era--had ended.\"\n\nMcIntyre retired from the Army in 1929.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==In retirement ==\nFollowing retirement Gen. McIntyre served for several years as the Philippine trade commissioner in Washington and lived on Massachusetts Avenue. In this role he lobbied on behalf of the islands' interests.  He later purchased and maintained a home in Montgomery, Alabama on South Hull Street, from which he helped oversee the large plantation, cotton business, and real estate interests of his older brothers Jim and John McIntyre, who established McIntyre Brothers in 1878. The main plantation, named Killybegs after the ancestral hometown, is located in Ramer, Montgomery County, Alabama. Formerly 7600 acres, over 1500 acres remain in the McIntyre family as of 2019.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was married in 1892 in [[Dallas]] to the former Marie Dennett, a native of [[New Orleans]] who grew up primarily in Texas. Marie Dennett was the daughter of James Wilson Dennett (1831-1888) a native of [[Huntsville, Alabama]] and Marie Dufilho Dennett, who was from an old New Orleans Creole family. James Dennett was an assistant quartermaster for the Confederacy in New Orleans prior to the Federals taking the city in 1862. Marie's great grandfather Christoval Toledano (1790-1869) was a sugar merchant and the son of Don Manuel Toledano y Valenzuela (1763-1806), a Spanish military official who arrived in New Orleans in the 1790s. Christoval served in Plauche's Battalion in the War of 1812 and fought at the Battle of New Orleans. The McIntyres were the parents of six children, who grew up primarily in Washington, DC: Frank Jr. James, Edward, Margaret, Marie, and Nora.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|page=259}}</ref> James continued the military tradition established by his father and retired as a major general in the United States Air Force. He served as the legislative liaison for the Air Force to Congress in the late 1940s, and is credited with helping establish the Air Force as an independent branch of the military through his efforts to help pass the National Security Act of 1947.

He saw duty at different posts, chiefly on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border, until the [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with Spain]], in which he participated in the [[Puerto Rico Campaign]] in 1898. McIntyre served in the Philippines from 1899 to 1902, after which he served with the general staff.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n[[File:PHI-68c-Philippine Islands-Treasury Certificate-1 Peso (1924) Design proof.jpg|thumb|Design proof for a [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#American Period|1924 Philippine one peso note]], approved by McIntyre.]]\nMcIntyre was attached to the Bureau of Insular Affairs in 1905 and became its Chief in 1912, relieving General [[Clarence Ransom Edwards]].  During the [[World War I|War in Europe]], he was assistant chief of staff with the rank of [[Major General|major-general]]. McIntyre served as long-time Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs and played a significant role in the governance of the Philippines and Puerto Rico throughout this period. With respect to Puerto Rico, McIntyre wavered on the wisdom of granting [[United States citizenship]] to Puerto Ricans but ultimately supported the [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act]] of 1917. At times, McIntyre had strained relations with other officials in Puerto Rico, such as U.S. District Judge and fellow Alabama native[[Peter J. Hamilton]] during the 1910s and Governor [[E. Mont Reily]] during the 1920s. In his 2007 book ''Planting the American Flag: Twelve Men Who Expanded the United States Overseas'', author Peter C. Stuart devoted an entire chapter to the career of Gen. McIntyre and his leadership of the Bureau of Insular Affairs. With respect to McIntyre's administration of the Philippines  and Puerto Rico, Stuart noted \" While others more assertive or egoistic imprinted on the protectorates their personal marks, McIntyre left no memorial....yet he wielded perhaps greater sway upon the United States' little empire than all his more visible imperial colleagues.\" Stuart credits Gen. McIntyre's stewardship over the Bureau of Insular Affairs as having been critical to its survival, and noting that within a decade following his retirement the Bureau was turned over to the Department of the Interior and disbanded in 1939. Reflecting upon the Bureau's demise, Stuart noted \"An era of American imperial administration--in many ways the McIntyre era--had ended.\"\n\nMcIntyre retired from the Army in 1929.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==In retirement ==\nFollowing retirement Gen. McIntyre served for several years as the Philippine trade commissioner in Washington and lived on Massachusetts Avenue. In this role he lobbied on behalf of the islands' interests.  He later purchased and maintained a home in Montgomery, Alabama on South Hull Street, from which he helped oversee the large plantation, cotton business, and real estate interests of his older brothers Jim and John McIntyre, who established McIntyre Brothers in 1878. The main plantation, named Killybegs after the ancestral hometown, is located in Ramer, Montgomery County, Alabama. Formerly 7600 acres, over 1500 acres remain in the McIntyre family as of 2019.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was married in 1892 in [[Dallas]] to the former Marie Dennett, a native of [[New Orleans]] who grew up primarily in Texas. Marie Dennett was the daughter of James Wilson Dennett (1831-1888) a native of [[Huntsville, Alabama]] and Marie Dufilho Dennett, who was from an old New Orleans Creole family. James Dennett was an assistant quartermaster for the Confederacy in New Orleans prior to the Federals taking the city in 1862. Marie's great grandfather Christoval Toledano (1790-1869) was a sugar merchant and the son of Don Manuel Toledano y Valenzuela (1763-1806), a Spanish military official who arrived in New Orleans in the 1790s. Christoval served in Plauche's Battalion in the War of 1812 and fought at the Battle of New Orleans. The McIntyres were the parents of six children, who grew up primarily in Washington, DC: Frank Jr. James, Edward, Margaret, Marie, and Nora.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|page=259}}</ref> James continued the military tradition established by his father and retired as a major general in the United States Air Force. He served as the legislative liaison for the Air Force to Congress in the late 1940s, and is credited with helping establish the Air Force as an independent branch of the military through his efforts to help pass the National Security Act of 1947.
