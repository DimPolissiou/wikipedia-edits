He won a silver medal in the [[Soling]] class with [[Walter Glasgow]] and [[Richard Hoepfner]] at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal. In [[1987 Louis Vuitton Cup|1987]] and [[2000 Louis Vuitton Cup|2000]] he competed at the [[Louis Vuitton Cup]]. Kolius began sailing at the age of 5 when his father introduced the family to sailing as a way to spend time together. John'a first boat was a Sunfish and he grew up sailing at the Houston Yacht Club through the Ragnot program. In 1968, John won his first major championship, the US Sailing Triplehanded Championship for the [[Sears Cup]]. He was 17 years old. Two years later at the age of 19, Kolius won the [[US Sailing Senior Championship]] for the Mallory Trophy. It was not too long after that he began sailing Solings and preparing for the Olympics. In 1975, John won the [[Soling]] North Americans and in 1976 an Olympic silver medal.\n\nKolius was born in [[Houston, Texas]].\n\n==America's Cup==\n\nKolius became an [[America's Cup]] competitor in [[1983 America's Cup|1983]], skippering [[Courageous (yacht)|''Courageous'']] against [[Tom Blackaller]] in ''Defender'' and eventual cup defender [[Dennis Conner]] in ''Liberty''.  Kolius was recruited for his second Cup effort in [[1987 Louis Vuitton Cup|1987]], this time as skipper of ''[[America II]]''. When the America's Cup shifted to IACC yachts for the 1992 Cup, Kolius sailed as part of the Italian team, ''[[Il Moro di Venezia]]'', with [[Raul Gardini]] and [[Paul Cayard]], in which he placed 3rd at the [[IACC Worlds]] in 1991. He coached the team to a second place in the 1992 America's Cup. America3 recruited Kolius as a coach for their Cup run in 1995. Then when the Cup traveled to New Zealand for the 2000 event, Kolius put together the [[Aloha Racing Team]].\n\nThroughout his sailing career, John has won numerous championship events. He is a two-time winner of the J24 Worlds (1979 & 1981), the 50&nbsp;ft World Championships in 1992, the Kenwood Cup in 1994, and the 1997 Admiral's Cup just to name a few. John was also part of the team that organized the Ultimate 30 Pro Racing Series in the late '80s and went on to win the Ultimate 30 Championship in 1989.\n\nSignificant Sailing Accomplishments\n* 1968 Sears Cup Winner\n* 1971 Mallory Cup Winner\n* 1975 Soling North American Winner\n* 1976 Olympic Silver Medal\n* 1979 & 1981 J24 World Champion\n* 1981 Championship of Champions Winner\n* 1990 & 1992 50&nbsp;ft World Cup Champion\n* 1995 Transpac first to finish\n* 1997 Admiral's Cup 1st Place Team\n* 1998 One-design 48 World Champion\n* 2005 J80 North American Champion\n* 2008 ACC Melges 24 Winner\n\n==Business accomplishments==\nKolius learned his sailmaking skills working for Buddy Melges.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory.

The new facility, called the Global Hub, opened in March 2017 adjacent to Lake Michigan and includes classrooms, faculty offices, collaborative learning spaces, and administrative offices. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/about/global-hub.aspx|title=Global Hub \u2013 Kellogg School of Management \u2013 Northwestern|accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://menlocoaching.com/kellogg-global-hub/|title=Assistant Dean Kate Smith on Kellogg's Global Hub|accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Kellogg announced that [[Sally Blount]] would replace Sunil Chopra as dean, starting in July.

Kellogg accepts the [[Graduate Record Examination]] in addition to the GMAT from applicants.<ref name=\"GRE\">{{cite news |last=Moules |first=Jonathan |date=14 May 2018 |title=The GMAT is no longer the only way into business school|work=Financial Times |location=United Kingdom }}</ref> Students may choose from seven majors including accounting, economics, finance, marketing, operations, strategy, and managing organizations. If a student does not elect a major \"General Management\" will appear on their transcript. In addition to majors, Kellogg offers \"pathways\" to students who want to build expertise in certain industries. These include data analytics, entrepreneurship, growth and scaling, healthcare, real estate, social impact, and venture capital & private equity.\n\n====One-year MBA====\nKellogg offers a one-year MBA program for students who have already completed a specified list of prerequisite courses, including undergraduate-level financial accounting, statistics, finance, economics, marketing, and operations. The one-year program began in 1965 and has more than 3,500 graduates around the world. Program graduates include [[Robert Eckert]] '77, former chairman and CEO, [[Mattel]]; Richard Lenny '77, former chairman and CEO, the [[The Hershey Company|Hershey Company]]; and [[Thomas J. Wilson]] '80, chairman and CEO, [[Allstate]]. With the exception of the two-year MBA at [[London Business School]], European MBA's are one year, as at INSEAD in France, IMD in Switzerland, IE Business School in Madrid and Oxford's Sa\u00efd Business School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-ranking-2014|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times \u2013 FT.com}}</ref>\n\n====Evening & Weekend MBA====\nKellogg offers an Evening & Weekend MBA (E&W MBA) program aimed towards students who continue to develop their careers as they pursue their MBA degree. Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.\n\n====MMM====\nGraduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science]]. This seven-quarter program begins in the summer before the traditional fall start of a two-year program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two-Year MBA|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/two-year-mba-program.aspx|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====JD-MBA====\nIn cooperation with the Northwestern Pritzker School Law, Kellogg offers a program that leads to earning a JD and an MBA in just three years. Students spend their first year in law school where they study the standard curriculum. During the first summer and second-year, students study entirely at Kellogg. The second summer students choose to devote their time to either law or business entirely. During the final year, most classes are spent at the law school, but students may take some electives at the business school.<ref name=\"Law\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/jd-mba-program.aspx |title=JD-MBA Program |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Kellogg School of Management |publisher=Northwestern University |access-date=14 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Ph.D. programs ====\nKellogg awarded its first Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in 1927. Since then, more than 950 Kellogg Ph.D. alumni have gone on to positions within academia and business. Seven programs of study are offered: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, and Operations Management. The program is full-time on the Evanston campus. Students typically graduate in five years.\n\n====Kellogg Asset Management Practicum====\nStudents declaring a finance major may choose to follow the asset management track, a special set of courses offered by the Kellogg finance department. At the core of the asset management track is a yearlong experiential learning course sequence, the Asset Management Practicum (FINC 933, 934, 935, and 936). In the practicum \u2013 a for-credit course with limited enrollment \u2013 students manage a portfolio under the guidance of faculty from the finance and accounting departments.

The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.\n\nThe Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.\n\nKellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with\u2014and grant Kellogg degrees to\u2014these schools:\n\n*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong\n*Recanati Graduate School of Management at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]\n*[[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in Germany\n*[[Schulich School of Business]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada\n*[[Guanghua School of Management]] at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guanghua.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|title=Guanghua \u2013 Kellogg}}</ref>\n\n=== Student profile ===\n46% of the students in Kellogg's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2020 are women.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory.

Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.\n\n====MMM====\nGraduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R.

The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.\n\nThe Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.\n\nKellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with\u2014and grant Kellogg degrees to\u2014these schools:\n\n*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong\n*Recanati Graduate School of Management at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]\n*[[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in Germany\n*[[Schulich School of Business]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada\n*[[Guanghua School of Management]] at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guanghua.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|title=Guanghua \u2013 Kellogg}}</ref>\n\n=== Student profile ===\n46% of the students in Kellogg's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2020 are women.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed. Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] insisted his credit be removed when, like the film itself, his score was heavily edited by the studio.\n\nEven in the released version, ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' is often regarded as among [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], a distinction it shares with Welles' first film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/momentsindx.html |title=100 Greatest Films |publisher=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Tim|last=Dirks|url=http://www.filmsite.org/magn.html |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) review |website=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref> The film was nominated for four [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and it was added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1991.\n\n==Plot==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-7.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joseph Cotten, [[Anne Baxter]], and [[Tim Holt]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-2.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Dolores Costello, Agnes Moorehead, Anne Baxter, Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-5.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Richard Bennett, Agnes Moorehead, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n}}\n[[File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.0|[[:File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|''The Magnificent Ambersons'' trailer]]]]\n\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe Ambersons are by far the wealthiest family in the midwestern city of [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], at the beginning of the 20th century. Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare.

And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

It was released on May 17, 1999 by [[Mute Records|Mute]] and [[V2 Records]]. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of his fourth album, ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996), which deviated from Moby's electronica style; his goal for ''Play'' was to return to this style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the recording of the album took place at Moby's home studio in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nWhile some of Moby's earlier work garnered critical and commercial success within the [[electronic dance music]] scene, ''Play'' was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. Initially issued to lackluster sales, it topped numerous album charts months after its release and was certified [[Music recording certification|platinum]] in more than 20 countries.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and commercial advertisements. ''Play'' eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/moby-on-new-memoir-the-decade-in-nyc-that-changed-his-life-20160607 |title=Moby on New Memoir, the Decade in NYC That Changed His Life |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |last=Zlatopolsky |first=Ashley}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 341 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=500greatest/><ref name=500greatest2/>\n\n==Background==\nThe second half of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a successful [[techno]] [[Child prodigy|wunderkind]]. The release in 1996 of ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'', a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him considering quitting music altogether and going back to school to study architecture. He explained: \"I was opening for [[Soundgarden]] and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night.\" However, he claimed, \"I got one piece of fan mail from [[Terence Trent D'Arby]] and I got a phone call from [[Axl Rose]] saying he was listening to ''Animal Rights'' on repeat.

Seven of those singles were UK top 40 hits\u2014\"Honey\", the first single, was already in the market in August 1998, nearly ten months before the release of the actual album. The final single choice was \"Find My Baby\", which appeared on some national charts three and a half years after. Twelve music videos were commissioned for a total of eight different singles, produced by a large number of directors, which included [[Jonas \u00c5kerlund]] (\"Porcelain\"), [[Roman Coppola]] (\"Honey\"), [[Joseph Kahn]] (\"South Side\"), and [[David LaChapelle]] (\"Natural Blues\"). The apparent result of the marketing strategy was that the album, after an unremarkable debut, stayed on the charts for several years and broke sales projections for Moby and for the dance music scene, which was not seen to be a dominant commercial genre in the US in the 1990s (as compared with in Europe, where Moby had initially found fame).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn October 2000, a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Play: The B Sides]]'' was released, consisting of tracks released as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] on the album's singles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moby.com/discography/play-the-b-sides/ |title=Play: The B Sides |publisher=Moby.com |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby}}</ref> A [[DVD]] titled ''Play: The DVD'', produced by Moby and [[Handsome Boy Records|Jeff Rogers]], was later released in July 2001 as a companion to ''Play'', featuring most of the accompanying music videos for the album's singles, an 88-minute [[megamix]] of all the remixes created for the album accompanied by visuals created in [[Toronto]] at Crush, led by director Kathi Prosser, a performance on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', a tour diary shot by Moby and edited by Tara Bethune-Leamen entitled ''Give an Idiot a Camcorder'', a DVD-ROM component where users are able to remix two of Moby's songs, and a bonus CD containing the aforementioned megamix.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |others=[[Moby]] |year=2001 |title=Play: The DVD |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Mute Records]] |id=7243 4 92573 9 9}}</ref> The package was later nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90 |title=Final Nominations For The 44th Annual Grammy Awards |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=3 |location=New York |date=January 19, 2002 |accessdate=May 29, 2019 |pages=90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 84/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref name=\"CST\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s|Christgau's Consumer Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = A+<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVQbszFuEGMC&pg=PA208 |chapter=Moby: Play |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |page=208 |title=[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-312-24560-2}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/06/11/play |title=Play |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York |date=June 11, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Browne |first=David |authorlink=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Grow out the roots |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=May 14, 1999 |last=Simpson |first=Dave}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev6Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |title=Moby \u2013 Play |journal=[[NME]] |location=London |date=May 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 11, 2016 |last=Cigarettes |first=Johnny |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001006122253/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |archivedate=October 6, 2000}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev7score = 5/10<ref name=\"DiCrescenzo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/ |title=Moby: Play |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=DiCrescenzo |first=Brent}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Moby: Play |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |location=London |issue=153 |date=June 1999 |page=109}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/play-19990624 |title=Play |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 24, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Walters |first=Barry}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev10score = 9/10<ref name=\"Aaron\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5x8l8IaNUMC&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Agony and the Ecstasy |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=15 |issue=7 |location=New York |date=July 1999 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |last=Aaron |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Aaron |pages=125\u201326}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Play'' was met with widespread critical acclaim.

It was released on May 17, 1999 by [[Mute Records|Mute]] and [[V2 Records]]. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of his fourth album, ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996), which deviated from Moby's electronica style; his goal for ''Play'' was to return to this style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the recording of the album took place at Moby's home studio in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nWhile some of Moby's earlier work garnered critical and commercial success within the [[electronic dance music]] scene, ''Play'' was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. Initially issued to lackluster sales, it topped numerous album charts months after its release and was certified [[Music recording certification|platinum]] in more than 20 countries.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and commercial advertisements. ''Play'' eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/moby-on-new-memoir-the-decade-in-nyc-that-changed-his-life-20160607 |title=Moby on New Memoir, the Decade in NYC That Changed His Life |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |last=Zlatopolsky |first=Ashley}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 341 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=500greatest/><ref name=500greatest2/>\n\n==Background==\nThe second half of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a successful [[techno]] [[Child prodigy|wunderkind]]. The release in 1996 of ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'', a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him considering quitting music altogether and going back to school to study architecture. He explained: \"I was opening for [[Soundgarden]] and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night.\" However, he claimed, \"I got one piece of fan mail from [[Terence Trent D'Arby]] and I got a phone call from [[Axl Rose]] saying he was listening to ''Animal Rights'' on repeat. [[Bono]] told me he loved ''Animal Rights''. So if you're gonna have three pieces of fan mail, that's the fan mail to get.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>\n\nMoby started work on the album in August 1997 and put it on hold several times to complete touring obligations.<ref name=CCD99>{{cite web |url=https://www.chaoscontrol.com/moby-1999/ |title=Moby |work=Chaos Control Digizine |date=1999 |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |last=Gourley |first=Bob}}</ref> Recording sessions took place in Moby's [[Mott Street]] home studio in Manhattan, New York. At the time, Moby planned on making the album his last before ending his career.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{cite book |title=[[Porcelain: A Memoir]] |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |year=2016 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby |isbn=1-59420-642-2}}</ref> ''Play'' was delayed due to Moby's dissatisfaction with the initial mix of the album that he had produced at home. A second mixing was completed in an outside studio before attempts in two other studios displayed similar results. After returning home and producing a mix by himself, Moby felt happy with it. In the end, Moby said that he had \"wasted a lot of time and money\".<ref name=CCD99/> Moby recalled a moment from March 1999, after ''Play'' had been mixed and sequenced, where he sat on the grass in [[Sara Delano Roosevelt Park]]: \"I was sitting by the little tire swings that had been chewed apart by the pit bulls [...] thinking to myself, 'When this record comes out, it will be the end of my career. I should start thinking about what else I can do.'\" At that point, he considered returning to school to become an architect.<ref name=RS2002>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mobys-home-made-heaven-57904/ |title=Moby's Home Made Heaven |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 6, 2002 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |last=Fricke |first=David |authorlink=David Fricke}}</ref>\n\nWhen he finished recording, there was no sign that the album would perform any differently than ''Animal Rights''. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label, from [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] to [[Sony Music|Sony]] to [[RCA Records|RCA]], and was rejected every time. After [[V2 Records|V2]] finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to listen to it.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/> According to Moby's manager Eric H\u00e4rle, their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'', Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_EricHaerleInt.html |title=Interview with Eric H\u00e4rle, manager at DEF for Moby, Sonique, R\u00f6yksopp |work=[[HitQuarters]] |date=March 25, 2003 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=Bouwman |first=Kimbel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609212002/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_EricHaerleInt.html |archivedate=June 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\nAccording to ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine's [[Will Hermes]], ''Play'' was \"the high-water mark for populist electronica\" and a \"millennial [[American folk music|roots]] and [[blues]] masterwork\",<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|location=New York|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UAUQ04BGfpUC&pg=PA58|title=Electronica|last=Hermes|first=Will|authorlink=Will Hermes|date=June 2004|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> while John Bush from [[AllMusic]] said it balanced Moby's early electronica sound with \"the [[breakbeat]] techno evolution of the '90s\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/play-mw0000243891 |title=Play \u2013 Moby |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=Bush |first=John}}</ref> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Jim DeRogatis]] noted its incorporation of such disparate musical influences as early blues, African-American folk music, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[disco]] and techno, \"all within the context of his own distinctly melodic [[ambient music|ambient]] stylings.\"<ref name=\"CST\">{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4497147.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302025706/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4497147.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 2, 2017 |title=Moby, 'Play' (V2) |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=May 30, 1999 |accessdate=March 1, 2017 |last=DeRogatis |first=Jim |authorlink=Jim DeRogatis |url-access=subscription }}</ref> The album was particularly notable for its extensive use of samples from [[field recording]]s collected by [[Alan Lomax]] on the 1993 [[box set]] ''Sounds of the South: A Musical Journey from the Georgia Sea Islands to the Mississippi Delta''. Moby was introduced to the collection through a friend, Dimitri Ehrlich, who loaned the CDs to him.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/> Most of the samples were short and constantly repeated throughout the songs. For example, \"Honey\" used a sample from [[Bessie Jones (American singer)|Bessie Jones]] that consisted of a conjunction of four verses that was repeated over twenty times. In the liner notes for the album, Moby gave \"special thanks to the Lomaxes and all of the archivists and music historians whose field recordings made this record possible.\"<ref name=\"notes\"/>\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nWhen ''Play'' was released on May 17, 1999, it underperformed commercially.

Eleven months after ''Play'' was released, it was selling 150,000 copies a week. I was on tour constantly, drunk pretty much the entire time and it was just a blur. And then all of a sudden movie stars started coming to my concerts and I started getting invited to fancy parties and suddenly the journalists who wouldn't return my publicist's calls were talking about doing cover stories. It was a really odd phenomenon.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>}}\n\n''Play'' also found its major strengths on the support of its impressive string of eight hit singles, an unprecedented feat for an electronica album. Seven of those singles were UK top 40 hits\u2014\"Honey\", the first single, was already in the market in August 1998, nearly ten months before the release of the actual album. The final single choice was \"Find My Baby\", which appeared on some national charts three and a half years after. Twelve music videos were commissioned for a total of eight different singles, produced by a large number of directors, which included [[Jonas \u00c5kerlund]] (\"Porcelain\"), [[Roman Coppola]] (\"Honey\"), [[Joseph Kahn]] (\"South Side\"), and [[David LaChapelle]] (\"Natural Blues\"). The apparent result of the marketing strategy was that the album, after an unremarkable debut, stayed on the charts for several years and broke sales projections for Moby and for the dance music scene, which was not seen to be a dominant commercial genre in the US in the 1990s (as compared with in Europe, where Moby had initially found fame).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn October 2000, a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Play: The B Sides]]'' was released, consisting of tracks released as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] on the album's singles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moby.com/discography/play-the-b-sides/ |title=Play: The B Sides |publisher=Moby.com |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby}}</ref> A [[DVD]] titled ''Play: The DVD'', produced by Moby and [[Handsome Boy Records|Jeff Rogers]], was later released in July 2001 as a companion to ''Play'', featuring most of the accompanying music videos for the album's singles, an 88-minute [[megamix]] of all the remixes created for the album accompanied by visuals created in [[Toronto]] at Crush, led by director Kathi Prosser, a performance on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', a tour diary shot by Moby and edited by Tara Bethune-Leamen entitled ''Give an Idiot a Camcorder'', a DVD-ROM component where users are able to remix two of Moby's songs, and a bonus CD containing the aforementioned megamix.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |others=[[Moby]] |year=2001 |title=Play: The DVD |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Mute Records]] |id=7243 4 92573 9 9}}</ref> The package was later nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90 |title=Final Nominations For The 44th Annual Grammy Awards |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=3 |location=New York |date=January 19, 2002 |accessdate=May 29, 2019 |pages=90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 84/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref name=\"CST\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s|Christgau's Consumer Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = A+<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVQbszFuEGMC&pg=PA208 |chapter=Moby: Play |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |page=208 |title=[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-312-24560-2}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/06/11/play |title=Play |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York |date=June 11, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Browne |first=David |authorlink=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Grow out the roots |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=May 14, 1999 |last=Simpson |first=Dave}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev6Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |title=Moby \u2013 Play |journal=[[NME]] |location=London |date=May 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 11, 2016 |last=Cigarettes |first=Johnny |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001006122253/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |archivedate=October 6, 2000}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev7score = 5/10<ref name=\"DiCrescenzo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/ |title=Moby: Play |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=DiCrescenzo |first=Brent}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Moby: Play |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |location=London |issue=153 |date=June 1999 |page=109}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/play-19990624 |title=Play |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 24, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Walters |first=Barry}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev10score = 9/10<ref name=\"Aaron\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5x8l8IaNUMC&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Agony and the Ecstasy |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=15 |issue=7 |location=New York |date=July 1999 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |last=Aaron |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Aaron |pages=125\u201326}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Play'' was met with widespread critical acclaim.

[[FM broadcasting|FM]] exposure followed. But the main reason this album will sound familiar the way [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth]] does to a [[classical music|classical]] ignoramus is that little bits of it have seeped into most Americans' brains. For this be grateful, because those bits are intensely pleasurable as melody or texture or sometimes beat, and because Moby has ordered, paced, and segued them and their intimate surroundings into something that suggests a surging and receding whole.
