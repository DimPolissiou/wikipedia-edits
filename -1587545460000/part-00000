Born in the ancient city of [[Pergamon]] (present-day [[Bergama]], [[Turkey]]), Galen travelled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several [[Roman Emperor|emperors]].\n\nGalen's understanding of anatomy and [[medicine]] was principally influenced by the then-current theory of [[humorism]] (also known as the theory of the four humors: black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm), as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as [[Hippocrates]]. Galen's views dominated and influenced [[Western culture|Western]] medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports were based mainly on the [[dissection]] of [[Old World monkey|monkeys]] and pigs. However, while dissecting them he discovered that their facial expressions were too much like humans; thus, he switched to other animals, especially [[pig]]s. The reason for using animals to discover the human body was due to the fact that dissections and vivisections on humans were strictly prohibited at the time. Galen would encourage his students to go look at dead gladiators or bodies that washed up in order to get better acquainted with the human body. Galen\u2019s most famous experiment that he recreated in public was the squealing pig. The squealing pig experiment was when Galen would cut open a pig, and while it was squealing he would cut the nerve, or vocal cords, showing they controlled the making of sound. His anatomical reports remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' by [[Andreas Vesalius]]<ref name=Vesalius1543>{{cite book\n|author=[[Andreas Vesalius]]\n|title=De humani corporis Fabrica, Libri VII\n|publisher=[[Johannes Oporinus]]\n|location=[[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]\n|language=Latin\n|year=1543\n|url=http://vesalius.northwestern.edu/\n|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref><ref>O'Malley, C., ''Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514\u20131564'', Berkeley: University of California Press</ref> where Galen's physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations.<ref>Siraisi, Nancy G., (1991) Girolamo Cardano and the Art of Medical Narrative, Journal of the History of Ideas. pp. 587\u201388.</ref> Galen's theory of the physiology of the [[circulatory system]] remained unchallenged until ca. 1242, when [[Ibn al-Nafis]] published his book ''Sharh tashrih al-qanun li\u2019 Ibn Sina'' (''[[Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon]]''), in which he reported his discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=John|title=Ibn al-Nafis, the pulmonary circulation, and the Islamic Golden Age|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=1985|volume=105|issue=6|pages=1877\u20131880|pmc=2612469|pmid=18845773|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.91171.2008}}</ref>\n\nGalen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher, as he wrote in his treatise titled ''That the Best Physician Is Also a Philosopher''.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Claudii Galeni Pergameni\n|title=\"That the best physician is also a philosopher\" with a Modern Greek Translation\n|editor=Odysseas Hatzopoulos\n|publisher=Odysseas Hatzopoulos & Company: Kaktos Editions\n|location=[[Athens]], [[Greece]]\n|year=1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Theodore J.

His impatience brought him into conflict with other doctors and he felt menaced by them. His demonstrations there antagonized the less skilled and more conservative physicians in the city.  When Galen's animosity with the Roman medical practitioners became serious, he feared he might be exiled or poisoned, so he left the city.<ref name=Eichholz>D.E.

Evans, 1956, ''Galen the Physician as Physiognomist'', American Philological Association</ref> During the autumn of 169 when Roman troops were returning to [[Aquileia]], a great plague broke out, and the emperor summoned Galen back to Rome. He was ordered to accompany Marcus and Verus to Germany as the court physician. The following spring Marcus was persuaded to release Galen after receiving a report that [[Asclepius]] was against the project.<ref name=Littman>R.J. Littman and M.L. Littman, 1973 Galen and the Antonine Plague, The American Journal of Philology 94 no. 3, p. 243\u2013255</ref> He was left behind to act as physician to the imperial heir [[Commodus]]. It was here in court that Galen wrote extensively on medical subjects. Ironically, Lucius Verus died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius himself died in 180, both victims of the plague.\n\nGalen was the physician to Commodus for much of the emperor\u2019s life and treated his common illnesses. According to Dio Cassius 72.14.3\u20134, in about 189, under Commodus\u2019 reign, a pestilence occurred which at its height killed 2,000 people a day in Rome. This was most likely the same plague that struck Rome during Marcus Aurelius\u2019 reign.<ref name=Littman/>\n\nGalen became physician to [[Septimius Severus]] during his reign in Rome. Galen compliments Severus and [[Caracalla]] on keeping a supply of drugs for their friends and mentions three cases in which they had been of use in 198.<ref name=Eichholz/>\n\n===The Antonine Plague===\n{{Main|Antonine Plague}}\n[[File:Galenosgruppe (Wiener Dioskurides).jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The 'Galen' group of physicians in an image from the [[Vienna Dioscurides]]; he is depicted top center.]]\nThe Antonine Plague was named after Marcus Aurelius\u2019 family name of Antoninus. It was also known as the Plague of Galen and held an important place in medicinal history because of its association with Galen. He had first-hand knowledge of the disease, and was present in Rome when it first struck in 166 AD, and was also present in the winter of 168\u201369 during an outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]]. He had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and described its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references to the plague are scattered and brief. Galen was not trying to present a description of the disease so that it could be recognized in future generations; he was more interested in the treatment and physical effects of the disease. For example, in his writings about a young man afflicted with the plague, he concentrated on the treatment of internal and external ulcerations. According to Niebuhr, \"this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague that visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius.\"\nThe mortality rate of the plague was 7\u201310 percent; the outbreak in 165\u2013168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. [[Otto Seeck]] believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century.<ref name=Littman/> Although Galen's description is incomplete, it is sufficient to enable a firm identification of the disease as [[smallpox]].\n\nGalen notes that the [[exanthema]] covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby where there was no ulceration. He states that those who were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually in the form of a blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one [[Thucydides]] described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, [[catarrh]], cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.<ref name=Littman/>\n\n===Eudemus===\nWhen the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher Eudemus became ill with [[Plasmodium malariae|quartan fever]], Galen felt obliged to treat him \"since he was my teacher and I happened to live nearby.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1641</ref> Galen wrote: \"I return to the case of Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 207.</ref> Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the [[prognosis]] in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current [[Standard of care#Medical standard of care|standard of care]], which relied upon [[divination]] and [[mysticism]]. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: \"In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1663</ref> However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. \"Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 212.</ref>\n\nGarcia-Ballester says the following of Galen\u2019s use of prognosis: \"In modern medicine, we are used to distinguishing between the diagnostic judgment (the scientific knowledge of what a patient has) and the prognostic judgment (the conjecture about what will happen to him.) For Galen, to understand a clinical case technically, \u2018to diagnose\u2019, was, among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome for the patient, \u2018to prognosticate\u2019. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned with distinguishing prognosis from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physician's reputation.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1640</ref>\n\n===Death===\nThe 11th-century ''[[Suda]]'' lexicon states that Galen died at the age of 70, which would place his death in about the year 199. However, there is a reference in Galen's treatise ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' (which may, however, be spurious) to events of 204. There are also statements in Arabic sources<ref>Amari, M. Biblioteca Arabo-sicula, 2nd vol., Loscher, Turin, Rome, p. 503-504.</ref> that he died in Sicily at age 87, after 17 years studying medicine and 70 practicing it, which would mean he died about 217. According to these sources, the tomb of Galenus in [[Palermo]] was still well preserved in the tenth century. Nutton<ref>Nutton V. Ancient Medicine. Routledge, 2004 226\u20137</ref> believes that ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' is genuine, that the Arabic sources are correct, and that the ''Suda'' has erroneously interpreted the 70 years of Galen's career in the Arabic tradition as referring to his whole lifespan. Boudon-Millot<ref>Boudon-Millot V (ed. and trans.)

Under [[Hippocrates]]' bodily [[humors]] theory, differences in human moods come as a consequence of imbalances in one of the four [[Body fluid|bodily fluids]]: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the typology of [[Four temperaments|human temperaments]]. In Galen's view, an imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (blood\u2014sanguine, black bile\u2014melancholic, yellow bile\u2014choleric, and phlegm\u2014phlegmatic). Thus, individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social; choleric people have energy, passion, and charisma; melancholics are creative, kind, and considerate; and phlegmatic temperaments are characterized by dependability, kindness, and affection.<ref name=MarkGrant>Mark Grant, 2000, Galen on Food and Diet, Routledge]</ref>\n\n[[File:Claudius Galenus (1906) - Veloso Salgado.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Galen dissecting a monkey, as imagined by [[Veloso Salgado]] in 1906]]\n\nGalen's principal interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC.<ref>'Tragically, the prohibition of human dissection by Rome in 150 BC arrested this progress and few of their findings survived', Arthur Aufderheide, 'The Scientific Study of Mummies' (2003), page 5</ref> Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living ([[vivisection]]) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and [[primate]]s.<ref name=\"brock\"/> This work was useful because Galen believed that the anatomical structures of these animals closely mirrored those of humans.

In the middle of the 16th century, the anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] challenged the anatomical knowledge of Galen by conducting dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galen's anatomy.\n\nAmong Galen's major contributions to medicine was his work on the [[circulatory system]]. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between [[venous blood|venous]] (dark) and [[artery|arterial]] (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, [[nervous system]], [[respiratory system]], and other structures, his work contained scientific errors.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the [[rete mirabile]] in the carotid sinus.<ref name=MarkGrant/> Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later (beginning with works of [[Ibn al-Nafis]] published ca. 1242) shown to be incorrect.<ref name=Furley1984>Furley, D, and J.

Many of his procedures and techniques would not be used again for centuries, such as the procedures he performed on brains and eyes.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> To correct [[cataract]]s in patients, Galen performed an operation similar to a modern one.

This was sharply criticised by the [[Erasistratus|Erasistrateans]], who predicted dire outcomes, believing that it was not blood but ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' that flowed in the veins. Galen, however, staunchly defended venesection in his three books on the subject<ref>Brain P (trans.) Galen on Bloodletting: A study of the origins, development, and validity of his opinions, with a translation of the three works. Cambridge 1986</ref> and in his demonstrations and public disputations.\n\n==Contributions to philosophy==\n{{See also|Philosophy of medicine}}\n\nAlthough the main focus of his work was on medicine, anatomy, and physiology, Galen also wrote about logic and philosophy. His writings were influenced by earlier Greek and Roman thinkers, including [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], and the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists]]. Galen was concerned to combine philosophical thought with medical practice, as in his brief work ''That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher'' he took aspects from each group and combined them with his original thought. He regarded medicine as an interdisciplinary field that was best practiced by utilizing theory, observation, and experimentation in conjunction.\n\nSeveral schools of thought existed within the medical field during Galen's lifetime, the main two being the Empiricists and Rationalists (also called Dogmatists or Philosophers), with the Methodists being a smaller group. The Empiricists emphasized the importance of physical practice and experimentation, or \"active learning\" in the medical discipline. In direct opposition to the Empiricists were the Rationalists, who valued the study of established teachings in order to create new theories in the name of medical advancements. The Methodists formed somewhat of a middle ground, as they were not as experimental as the Empiricists, nor as theoretical as the Rationalists. The Methodists mainly utilized pure observation, showing greater interest in studying the natural course of ailments than making efforts to find remedies. Galen's education had exposed him to the five major schools of thought (Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, Pyrrhonists), with teachers from the Rationalist sect and from the Empiricist sect.\n\n=== Opposition to the Stoics ===\nGalen was well known for his advancements in medicine and the circulatory system, but he was also concerned with philosophy.

Galen, following Plato's idea, came up with two more parts to the soul.<ref name=\"gill2007\" />\n\nGalen also rejected Stoic propositional logic and instead embraced a hypothetical syllogistic which was strongly influenced by the Peripatetics and based on elements of Aristotelian logic.<ref>[[Susanne Bobzien]],'Peripatetic Hypothetical Syllogistic in Galen', ''Rhizai'' 2, 2004 pp.57\u2013102</ref>\n\n===Localization of function===\nOne of Galen's major works, ''On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'', sought to demonstrate the unity of the two subjects and their views. Using their theories, combined with Aristotle's, Galen developed a tripartite soul consisting of similar aspects.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> He used the same terms as Plato, referring to the three parts as rational, spiritual, and appetitive. Each corresponded to a localized area of the body. The rational soul was in the brain, the spiritual soul was in the heart, and the appetitive soul was in the liver. Galen was the first scientist and philosopher to assign specific parts of the soul to locations in the body because of his extensive background in medicine.<ref name= lloyd2007>Lloyd, G. (2007).

These passions were considered to be even stronger than regular emotions, and, as a consequence, more dangerous.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The third part of the soul, or the appetitive spirit, controlled the living forces in our body, most importantly blood.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The appetitive spirit also regulated the pleasures of the body and was moved by feelings of enjoyment. This third part of the soul is the animalistic, or more natural, side of the soul; it deals with the natural urges of the body and survival instincts. Galen proposed that when the soul is moved by too much enjoyment, it reaches states of \"incontinence\" and \"licentiousness\", the inability to willfully cease enjoyment, which was a negative consequence of too much pleasure.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\nIn order to unite his theories about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted the theory of the pneuma,<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic pneuma.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one on the other.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" />\n\n== Mind\u2013body problem ==\n{{further|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n\nGalen believed there to be no distinction between the mental and the physical.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was a controversial argument of the time, and Galen fell with the Greeks in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> He believed that this could be scientifically proven.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\n== Psychotherapy ==\nAnother one of Galen's major works, ''On the Diagnosis and Cure of the Soul's Passion,'' discussed how to approach and treat psychological problems.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> This was Galen's early attempt at what would later be called [[psychotherapy]]. His book contained directions on how to provide counsel to those with psychological issues to prompt them to reveal their deepest passions and secrets, and eventually cure them of their mental deficiency. The leading individual, or therapist, had to be a male, preferably of an older, wiser, age, as well as free from the control of the passions.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> These passions, according to Galen, caused the psychological problems that people experienced.\n\n==Published works==\n{{Main|Galenic corpus}}\n[[Image:Galeni De curandi ratione V00212 00000008.tif|thumb|''De curandi ratione'']]\n[[File:Galenou Apanta.tif|thumb|''Galenou apanta'' (1538)]]\nGalen may have produced more work than any author in antiquity, rivaling the quantity of work issued from [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"kotrc\">Kotrc RF, Walters KR.

In AD 191, a fire in the [[Temple of Peace, Rome#Temple of Peace|Temple of Peace]] destroyed many of his works, in particular treatises on philosophy.{{sfn|Houston|2003|p=45-47}}\n\nBecause Galen's works were not translated into Latin in the ancient period, and because of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, the study of Galen, along with the Greek medical tradition as a whole, went into decline in Western Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]], when very few Latin scholars could read Greek. However, in general, Galen and the [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greek medical tradition]] continued to be studied and followed in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. All of the extant Greek manuscripts of Galen were copied by Byzantine scholars. In the Abbasid period (after AD 750) [[Arab Muslims]] began to be interested in Greek scientific and medical texts for the first time, and had some of Galen's texts translated into Arabic, often by Syrian Christian scholars (see below). As a result, some texts of Galen exist only in Arabic translation,<ref name=\"iep\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/galen.htm|title=Galen - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}</ref> while others exist only in medieval Latin translations of the Arabic.

Sources are often in obscure and difficult-to-access journals or repositories. Although written in Greek, by convention the works are referred to by Latin titles, and often by merely abbreviations of those. No single authoritative collection of his work exists, and controversy remains as to the authenticity of a number of works attributed to Galen. As a consequence, research on Galen's work is fraught with hazard.<ref name=\"metzger\"/><ref name=\"kotrc\"/>\n\nVarious attempts have been made to classify Galen's vast output. For instance Coxe (1846) lists a Prolegomena, or introductory books, followed by 7 classes of treatise embracing Physiology (28 vols.), Hygiene (12), Aetiology (19), Semeiotics (14), Pharmacy (10), Blood letting (4) and Therapeutics (17), in addition to 4 of aphorisms, and spurious works.<ref name=\"Coxe\">[[John Redman Coxe|Coxe, John Redman]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1988&chapter=128229&layout=html&Itemid=27 ''The Writings of Hippocrates and Galen.

Over 20,000 pages in length, it is divided into 22 volumes, with 676 index pages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Many of Galen's works are included in the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]'', a digital library of Greek literature started in 1972. Another useful modern source is the French [http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/histmed/medica/galien_va.htm Biblioth\u00e8que interuniversitaire de m\u00e9decine] (BIUM).\n\n==Legacy==\n===Late antiquity===\nIn his time, Galen's reputation as both physician and philosopher was legendary,<ref name=\"nutton84a\">Nutton V. Galen in the eyes of his contemporaries. BHM 58(3) fall 1984 315\u201324</ref> the Emperor Marcus Aurelius describing him as \"Primum sane medicorum esse, philosophorum autem solum\" (first among doctors and unique among philosophers ''Praen 14: 660''). Other contemporary authors in the Greek world confirm this including [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus the Shoemaker]], [[Athenaeus]] and [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]. The 7th-century poet [[George Pisida|George of Pisida]] went so far as to refer to Christ as a second and neglected Galen.<ref>George of Pisida. Hexameron 1.1588f</ref> Galen continued to exert an important influence over the theory and practice of medicine until the mid-17th century in the Byzantine and Arabic worlds and Europe. Hippocrates and Galen form important landmarks of 600 years of Greek medicine. A. J. Brock describes them as representing the foundation and apex respectively.<ref name=\"brock\">Arthur John Brock (translator), ''Introduction. Galen. On the Natural Faculties''. Edinburgh 1916</ref> A few centuries after Galen, [[Palladius (physician)|Palladius Iatrosophista]] stated, in his commentary on Hippocrates, that Hippocrates sowed and Galen reaped.\n\nThus Galen summarised and synthesised the work of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in [[Magnus of Nisibis]]' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death.<ref name=\"brock\"/> Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/>\n\nAfter the collapse of the Western Empire the study of Galen and other Greek works almost disappeared in the Latin West. In contrast, in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire (Byzantium), many commentators of the subsequent centuries, such as [[Oribasius]], physician to the emperor [[Julian the apostate|Julian]] who compiled a ''Synopsis'' in the 4th century, preserved and disseminated Galen's works, making Galenism more accessible. Nutton refers to these authors as the \"medical refrigerators of antiquity\".<ref name=\"brock\"/><ref name=\"nutton84\"/> In late antiquity, medical writing veered increasingly in the direction of the theoretical at the expense of the practical, with many authors merely debating Galenism. Magnus of Nisibis was a pure theorist, as were [[John of Alexandria]] and Agnellus of Ravenna with their lectures on Galen's ''De Sectis''.<ref>Temkin O. Studies on late Alexandrian medicine. Bull Hist Med 3: 405\u201330, 1935</ref> So strong was Galenism that other authors such as Hippocrates began to be seen through a Galenic lens, while his opponents became marginalised and other medical sects such as Asclepiadism slowly disappeared.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Greek medicine was part of Greek culture, and Syrian Eastern Christians came in contact with it while the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantium) ruled Syria and Western Mesopotamia, regions that were conquered from Byzantium in the 7th century by Arab Muslims. After AD 750, Muslims had these Syrian Christians make the first translations of Galen into Arabic. From then on, Galen and the Greek medical tradition in general became assimilated into the medieval and early modern Islamic Middle East.<ref name=\"brock\"/>\n\n===Influence on medicine in the Islamic world===\n{{further|Medicine in the medieval Islamic world}}\n\nGalen's approach to medicine became and remains influential in the Islamic world. The first major translator of Galen into Arabic was the Arab Christian [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. He translated (c. 830\u2013870) 129 works of \"Jalinos\"<ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7100.html Dear P. Revolutionizing the Sciences: European Knowledge and Its Ambitions, 1500\u20131700.

Arabic sources, such as [[Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya al-R\u0101zi]] (AD 865\u2013925), continue to be the source of discovery of new or relatively inaccessible Galenic writings.<ref name=\"nuttonchoice\"/> One of Hunayn's Arabic translations, ''Kitab ila Aglooqan fi Shifa al Amrad'', which is extant in the Library of [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine & Sciences]], is regarded as a masterpiece of Galen's literary works. A part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galen's work, this 10th-century manuscript comprises two parts that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More important is that it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin. The book provides an insight into understanding the traditions and methods of treatment in the Greek and Roman eras. In addition, this book provides a direct source for the study of more than 150 single and compound drugs used during the Greco-Roman period.\n\nAs the title of ''Doubts on Galen'' by al-R\u0101zi implies, as well as the writings of physicians such as [[Ibn Zuhr]] and [[Ibn al-Nafis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reflections Chairman's | year = 2004 | title = Traditional Medicine Among Gulf Arabs, Part II: Blood-letting | url = | journal = Heart Views | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 74\u201385 [80] }}</ref> the works of Galen were not accepted unquestioningly, but as a challengeable basis for further [[Scientific method|inquiry]]. A strong emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and [[empiricism]] led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as al-R\u0101zi, [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis. For example, Ibn al-Nafis' discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]] contradicted the Galenic theory on the heart.<ref name=\"Dabbagh\">{{cite journal | author = Al-Dabbagh S.

From that time, Galenism took on a new, unquestioned authority, Galen even being referred to as the \"Medical Pope of the Middle Ages\".<ref name=\"brock\"/> [[Constantine the African]] was amongst those who translated both Hippocrates and Galen from Arabic. In addition to the more numerous translations of Arabic texts in this period, there were a few translations of Galenic works directly from the Greek, such as [[Burgundio of Pisa]]'s translation of ''De complexionibus''. Galen's works on anatomy and medicine became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum, alongside Ibn Sina's ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', which elaborated on Galen's works. Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} However, Galen's influence was so great that when dissections discovered anomalies compared with Galen's anatomy, the physicians often tried to fit these into the Galenic system. An example of this is [[Mondino de Liuzzi]], who describes rudimentary blood circulation in his writings but still asserts that the left ventricle should contain air. Some cited these changes as proof that human anatomy had changed since the time of Galen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Raymond F.|title=Stories of Great Physicians|publisher=Whitman|year=1963|pages=46\u201347|chapter=The Anatomist}}</ref>\n\nThe most important translator of Galen's works into Latin was Niccol\u00f2 di Deoprepio da Reggio, who spent several years working on Galen. Niccol\u00f2 worked at the Angevin Court during the reign of king [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]]. Among Niccol\u00f2's translations is a piece from a medical treatise by Galen, of which the original text is lost.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Roberto|title=The Dawn of Humanism in Italy|year=1947|publisher=H.

This [[New Learning]] and the [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] movement, particularly the work of [[Thomas Linacre|Linacre]], promoted ''[[literae humaniores]]'' including Galen in the Latin scientific canon, ''De Naturalibus Facultatibus'' appearing in London in 1523. Debates on medical science now had two traditions, the more conservative Arabian and the liberal Greek.<ref name=\"brock\"/> The more extreme liberal movements began to challenge the role of authority in medicine, as exemplified by [[Paracelsus]]' symbolically burning the works of Avicenna and Galen at his medical school in [[University of Basel|Basle]].<ref name=\"brock\"/> Nevertheless, Galen's pre-eminence amongst the great thinkers of the millennium is exemplified by a 16th-century mural in the refectory of the [[Great Lavra]] of [[Mt Athos]].

Vesalius' most famous work, ''De humani corporis fabrica'', was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen's methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen's writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen's limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as [[Jacques Dubois|Jacobus Sylvius]]. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen's approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained in the Empiricist model.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cosans C | year = 1997 | title = Galen's Critique of Rationalist and Empiricist Anatomy | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 35\u201354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1004266427468 | pmid = 11618979 }}</ref> The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of [[Aristotle]] and [[Mondino de Liuzzi]]. One of the best known examples of Vesalius' overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the [[interventricular septum]] of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (''Nat Fac III xv''). However, this had been revealed two years before by Michael Servetus in his fateful \"''Christianismi restitutio''\" (1553) with only three copies of the book surviving, but these remaining hidden for decades; the rest were burned shortly after its publication because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.\n\n[[Michael Servetus]], using the name \"Michel de Villeneuve\" during his stay in France, was [[Vesalius]]' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, according to [[Johann Winter von Andernach]],<ref>2011 \"The love for truth.

Born in the ancient city of [[Pergamon]] (present-day [[Bergama]], [[Turkey]]), Galen travelled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several [[Roman Emperor|emperors]].\n\nGalen's understanding of anatomy and [[medicine]] was principally influenced by the then-current theory of [[humorism]] (also known as the theory of the four humors: black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm), as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as [[Hippocrates]]. Galen's views dominated and influenced [[Western culture|Western]] medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports were based mainly on the [[dissection]] of [[Old World monkey|monkeys]] and pigs. However, while dissecting them he discovered that their facial expressions were too much like humans; thus, he switched to other animals, especially [[pig]]s. The reason for using animals to discover the human body was due to the fact that dissections and vivisections on humans were strictly prohibited at the time. Galen would encourage his students to go look at dead gladiators or bodies that washed up in order to get better acquainted with the human body. Galen\u2019s most famous experiment that he recreated in public was the squealing pig. The squealing pig experiment was when Galen would cut open a pig, and while it was squealing he would cut the nerve, or vocal cords, showing they controlled the making of sound.

His studies also took in each of the principal philosophical systems of the time, including [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Epicurean]]. His father had planned a traditional career for Galen in philosophy or politics and took care to expose him to literary and philosophical influences. However, Galen states that in around AD 145 his father had a dream in which the god [[Asclepius]] (Aesculapius) appeared and commanded Nicon to send his son to study medicine. Again, no expense was spared, and following his earlier liberal education, at 16 he began studies at the prestigious local sanctuary or [[Asclepeion|Asclepieum]] dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine, as a \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (''therapeutes'', or attendant) for four years. There he came under the influence of men like [[Aeschrion of Pergamon]], Stratonicus and Satyrus. Asclepiea functioned as spas or sanitoria to which the sick would come to seek the ministrations of the priesthood. Romans frequented the temple at Pergamon in search of medical relief from illness and disease. It was also the haunt of notable people such as Claudius Charax the historian, [[Aelius Aristides]] the orator, [[Polemon of Laodicea|Polemo]] the sophist, and Cuspius Rufinus the Consul.<ref name=\"nutton73\"/>\n\nGalen's father died in 148, leaving Galen independently wealthy at the age of 19. He then followed the advice he found in Hippocrates' teaching<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daedalus.umkc.edu/hippocrates/HippocratesLoeb1/page.66.php?size=240x320|title=Hippocrates Collected Works I|website=daedalus.umkc.edu}}</ref> and travelled and studied widely including such destinations as [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]), [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]], [[Crete]], [[Cilicia]] (now [[\u00c7ukurova]]), [[Cyprus]], and finally the great medical school of [[Medicine in ancient Greece|Alexandria]], exposing himself to the various schools of thought in medicine. In 157, aged 28, he returned to Pergamon as physician to the gladiators of the High Priest of Asia, one of the most influential and wealthy men in Asia. Galen claims that the High Priest chose him over other physicians after he eviscerated an ape and challenged other physicians to repair the damage. When they refused, Galen performed the [[surgery]] himself and in so doing won the favor of the High Priest of Asia. Over his four years there, he learned the importance of diet, fitness, hygiene and preventive measures, as well as living anatomy, and the treatment of fractures and severe trauma, referring to their [[wounds]] as \"windows into the body\". Only five deaths among the gladiators occurred while he held the post, compared to sixty in his predecessor's time, a result that is in general ascribed to the attention he paid to their wounds. At the same time he pursued studies in theoretical medicine and philosophy.<ref name=\"nutton73\"/><ref name=\"ustun\">Ustun C. Galen and his anatomic eponym: Vein of Galen.

His impatience brought him into conflict with other doctors and he felt menaced by them. His demonstrations there antagonized the less skilled and more conservative physicians in the city.  When Galen's animosity with the Roman medical practitioners became serious, he feared he might be exiled or poisoned, so he left the city.<ref name=Eichholz>D.E.

Evans, 1956, ''Galen the Physician as Physiognomist'', American Philological Association</ref> During the autumn of 169 when Roman troops were returning to [[Aquileia]], a great plague broke out, and the emperor summoned Galen back to Rome. He was ordered to accompany Marcus and Verus to Germany as the court physician. The following spring Marcus was persuaded to release Galen after receiving a report that [[Asclepius]] was against the project.<ref name=Littman>R.J. Littman and M.L. Littman, 1973 Galen and the Antonine Plague, The American Journal of Philology 94 no. 3, p. 243\u2013255</ref> He was left behind to act as physician to the imperial heir [[Commodus]]. It was here in court that Galen wrote extensively on medical subjects. Ironically, Lucius Verus died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius himself died in 180, both victims of the plague.\n\nGalen was the physician to Commodus for much of the emperor\u2019s life and treated his common illnesses. According to Dio Cassius 72.14.3\u20134, in about 189, under Commodus\u2019 reign, a pestilence occurred which at its height killed 2,000 people a day in Rome. This was most likely the same plague that struck Rome during Marcus Aurelius\u2019 reign.<ref name=Littman/>\n\nGalen became physician to [[Septimius Severus]] during his reign in Rome. Galen compliments Severus and [[Caracalla]] on keeping a supply of drugs for their friends and mentions three cases in which they had been of use in 198.<ref name=Eichholz/>\n\n===The Antonine Plague===\n{{Main|Antonine Plague}}\n[[File:Galenosgruppe (Wiener Dioskurides).jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The 'Galen' group of physicians in an image from the [[Vienna Dioscurides]]; he is depicted top center.]]\nThe Antonine Plague was named after Marcus Aurelius\u2019 family name of Antoninus. It was also known as the Plague of Galen and held an important place in medicinal history because of its association with Galen. He had first-hand knowledge of the disease, and was present in Rome when it first struck in 166 AD, and was also present in the winter of 168\u201369 during an outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]]. He had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and described its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references to the plague are scattered and brief. Galen was not trying to present a description of the disease so that it could be recognized in future generations; he was more interested in the treatment and physical effects of the disease. For example, in his writings about a young man afflicted with the plague, he concentrated on the treatment of internal and external ulcerations. According to Niebuhr, \"this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague that visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius.\"\nThe mortality rate of the plague was 7\u201310 percent; the outbreak in 165\u2013168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. [[Otto Seeck]] believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century.<ref name=Littman/> Although Galen's description is incomplete, it is sufficient to enable a firm identification of the disease as [[smallpox]].\n\nGalen notes that the [[exanthema]] covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby where there was no ulceration. He states that those who were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually in the form of a blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one [[Thucydides]] described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, [[catarrh]], cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.<ref name=Littman/>\n\n===Eudemus===\nWhen the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher Eudemus became ill with [[Plasmodium malariae|quartan fever]], Galen felt obliged to treat him \"since he was my teacher and I happened to live nearby.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1641</ref> Galen wrote: \"I return to the case of Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 207.</ref> Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the [[prognosis]] in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current [[Standard of care#Medical standard of care|standard of care]], which relied upon [[divination]] and [[mysticism]]. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: \"In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1663</ref> However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. \"Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him.\"<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 212.</ref>\n\nGarcia-Ballester says the following of Galen\u2019s use of prognosis: \"In modern medicine, we are used to distinguishing between the diagnostic judgment (the scientific knowledge of what a patient has) and the prognostic judgment (the conjecture about what will happen to him.) For Galen, to understand a clinical case technically, \u2018to diagnose\u2019, was, among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome for the patient, \u2018to prognosticate\u2019. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned with distinguishing prognosis from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physician's reputation.\"<ref>Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1640</ref>\n\n===Death===\nThe 11th-century ''[[Suda]]'' lexicon states that Galen died at the age of 70, which would place his death in about the year 199. However, there is a reference in Galen's treatise ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' (which may, however, be spurious) to events of 204. There are also statements in Arabic sources<ref>Amari, M. Biblioteca Arabo-sicula, 2nd vol., Loscher, Turin, Rome, p. 503-504.</ref> that he died in Sicily at age 87, after 17 years studying medicine and 70 practicing it, which would mean he died about 217. According to these sources, the tomb of Galenus in [[Palermo]] was still well preserved in the tenth century. Nutton<ref>Nutton V. Ancient Medicine. Routledge, 2004 226\u20137</ref> believes that ''\"On Theriac to Piso\"'' is genuine, that the Arabic sources are correct, and that the ''Suda'' has erroneously interpreted the 70 years of Galen's career in the Arabic tradition as referring to his whole lifespan.

Under [[Hippocrates]]' bodily [[humors]] theory, differences in human moods come as a consequence of imbalances in one of the four [[Body fluid|bodily fluids]]: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the typology of [[Four temperaments|human temperaments]]. In Galen's view, an imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (blood\u2014sanguine, black bile\u2014melancholic, yellow bile\u2014choleric, and phlegm\u2014phlegmatic). Thus, individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social; choleric people have energy, passion, and charisma; melancholics are creative, kind, and considerate; and phlegmatic temperaments are characterized by dependability, kindness, and affection.<ref name=MarkGrant>Mark Grant, 2000, Galen on Food and Diet, Routledge]</ref>\n\n[[File:Claudius Galenus (1906) - Veloso Salgado.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Galen dissecting a monkey, as imagined by [[Veloso Salgado]] in 1906]]\n\nGalen's principal interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC.<ref>'Tragically, the prohibition of human dissection by Rome in 150 BC arrested this progress and few of their findings survived', Arthur Aufderheide, 'The Scientific Study of Mummies' (2003), page 5</ref> Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living ([[vivisection]]) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and [[primate]]s.<ref name=\"brock\"/> This work was useful because Galen believed that the anatomical structures of these animals closely mirrored those of humans.

In the middle of the 16th century, the anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] challenged the anatomical knowledge of Galen by conducting dissections on human cadavers. These investigations allowed Vesalius to refute aspects of Galen's anatomy.\n\nAmong Galen's major contributions to medicine was his work on the [[circulatory system]]. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between [[venous blood|venous]] (dark) and [[artery|arterial]] (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, [[nervous system]], [[respiratory system]], and other structures, his work contained scientific errors.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the [[rete mirabile]] in the carotid sinus.<ref name=MarkGrant/> Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later (beginning with works of [[Ibn al-Nafis]] published ca. 1242) shown to be incorrect.<ref name=Furley1984>Furley, D, and J.

Many of his procedures and techniques would not be used again for centuries, such as the procedures he performed on brains and eyes.<ref name=\"Galen on the brain\"/> To correct [[cataract]]s in patients, Galen performed an operation similar to a modern one. Using a needle-shaped instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract-affected lens of the eye.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1034789 | pages=85\u201387 | volume=7 | issue=1 | journal=Med Hist | title=Galen: On Anatomical Procedures: the Later Books | doi=10.1017/s002572730002799x| year=1963 | last1=Keele | first1=K.

This was sharply criticised by the [[Erasistratus|Erasistrateans]], who predicted dire outcomes, believing that it was not blood but ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' that flowed in the veins. Galen, however, staunchly defended venesection in his three books on the subject<ref>Brain P (trans.) Galen on Bloodletting: A study of the origins, development, and validity of his opinions, with a translation of the three works. Cambridge 1986</ref> and in his demonstrations and public disputations.\n\n==Contributions to philosophy==\n{{See also|Philosophy of medicine}}\n\nAlthough the main focus of his work was on medicine, anatomy, and physiology, Galen also wrote about logic and philosophy. His writings were influenced by earlier Greek and Roman thinkers, including [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], and the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists]]. Galen was concerned to combine philosophical thought with medical practice, as in his brief work ''That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher'' he took aspects from each group and combined them with his original thought. He regarded medicine as an interdisciplinary field that was best practiced by utilizing theory, observation, and experimentation in conjunction.\n\nSeveral schools of thought existed within the medical field during Galen's lifetime, the main two being the Empiricists and Rationalists (also called Dogmatists or Philosophers), with the Methodists being a smaller group. The Empiricists emphasized the importance of physical practice and experimentation, or \"active learning\" in the medical discipline. In direct opposition to the Empiricists were the Rationalists, who valued the study of established teachings in order to create new theories in the name of medical advancements. The Methodists formed somewhat of a middle ground, as they were not as experimental as the Empiricists, nor as theoretical as the Rationalists. The Methodists mainly utilized pure observation, showing greater interest in studying the natural course of ailments than making efforts to find remedies. Galen's education had exposed him to the five major schools of thought (Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, Pyrrhonists), with teachers from the Rationalist sect and from the Empiricist sect.\n\n=== Opposition to the Stoics ===\nGalen was well known for his advancements in medicine and the circulatory system, but he was also concerned with philosophy.

Galen, following Plato's idea, came up with two more parts to the soul.<ref name=\"gill2007\" />\n\nGalen also rejected Stoic propositional logic and instead embraced a hypothetical syllogistic which was strongly influenced by the Peripatetics and based on elements of Aristotelian logic.<ref>[[Susanne Bobzien]],'Peripatetic Hypothetical Syllogistic in Galen', ''Rhizai'' 2, 2004 pp.57\u2013102</ref>\n\n===Localization of function===\nOne of Galen's major works, ''On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'', sought to demonstrate the unity of the two subjects and their views. Using their theories, combined with Aristotle's, Galen developed a tripartite soul consisting of similar aspects.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> He used the same terms as Plato, referring to the three parts as rational, spiritual, and appetitive. Each corresponded to a localized area of the body. The rational soul was in the brain, the spiritual soul was in the heart, and the appetitive soul was in the liver. Galen was the first scientist and philosopher to assign specific parts of the soul to locations in the body because of his extensive background in medicine.<ref name= lloyd2007>Lloyd, G. (2007).

These passions were considered to be even stronger than regular emotions, and, as a consequence, more dangerous.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The third part of the soul, or the appetitive spirit, controlled the living forces in our body, most importantly blood.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> The appetitive spirit also regulated the pleasures of the body and was moved by feelings of enjoyment. This third part of the soul is the animalistic, or more natural, side of the soul; it deals with the natural urges of the body and survival instincts. Galen proposed that when the soul is moved by too much enjoyment, it reaches states of \"incontinence\" and \"licentiousness\", the inability to willfully cease enjoyment, which was a negative consequence of too much pleasure.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\nIn order to unite his theories about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted the theory of the pneuma,<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, and how those organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic pneuma.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one on the other.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" />\n\n== Mind\u2013body problem ==\n{{further|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n\nGalen believed there to be no distinction between the mental and the physical.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was a controversial argument of the time, and Galen fell with the Greeks in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties.<ref name=\"lloyd2007\" /> He believed that this could be scientifically proven.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" /> This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent.<ref name=\"gill2007\" /> Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.<ref name=\"hankinson1991\" />\n\n== Psychotherapy ==\nAnother one of Galen's major works, ''On the Diagnosis and Cure of the Soul's Passion,'' discussed how to approach and treat psychological problems.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> This was Galen's early attempt at what would later be called [[psychotherapy]]. His book contained directions on how to provide counsel to those with psychological issues to prompt them to reveal their deepest passions and secrets, and eventually cure them of their mental deficiency. The leading individual, or therapist, had to be a male, preferably of an older, wiser, age, as well as free from the control of the passions.<ref name=\"king2009\" /> These passions, according to Galen, caused the psychological problems that people experienced.\n\n==Published works==\n{{Main|Galenic corpus}}\n[[Image:Galeni De curandi ratione V00212 00000008.tif|thumb|''De curandi ratione'']]\n[[File:Galenou Apanta.tif|thumb|''Galenou apanta'' (1538)]]\nGalen may have produced more work than any author in antiquity, rivaling the quantity of work issued from [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"kotrc\">Kotrc RF, Walters KR.

In AD 191, a fire in the [[Temple of Peace, Rome#Temple of Peace|Temple of Peace]] destroyed many of his works, in particular treatises on philosophy.{{sfn|Houston|2003|p=45-47}}\n\nBecause Galen's works were not translated into Latin in the ancient period, and because of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, the study of Galen, along with the Greek medical tradition as a whole, went into decline in Western Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]], when very few Latin scholars could read Greek. However, in general, Galen and the [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greek medical tradition]] continued to be studied and followed in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. All of the extant Greek manuscripts of Galen were copied by Byzantine scholars. In the Abbasid period (after AD 750) [[Arab Muslims]] began to be interested in Greek scientific and medical texts for the first time, and had some of Galen's texts translated into Arabic, often by Syrian Christian scholars (see below). As a result, some texts of Galen exist only in Arabic translation,<ref name=\"iep\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/galen.htm|title=Galen - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}</ref> while others exist only in medieval Latin translations of the Arabic.

Sources are often in obscure and difficult-to-access journals or repositories. Although written in Greek, by convention the works are referred to by Latin titles, and often by merely abbreviations of those. No single authoritative collection of his work exists, and controversy remains as to the authenticity of a number of works attributed to Galen. As a consequence, research on Galen's work is fraught with hazard.<ref name=\"metzger\"/><ref name=\"kotrc\"/>\n\nVarious attempts have been made to classify Galen's vast output. For instance Coxe (1846) lists a Prolegomena, or introductory books, followed by 7 classes of treatise embracing Physiology (28 vols.), Hygiene (12), Aetiology (19), Semeiotics (14), Pharmacy (10), Blood letting (4) and Therapeutics (17), in addition to 4 of aphorisms, and spurious works.<ref name=\"Coxe\">[[John Redman Coxe|Coxe, John Redman]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1988&chapter=128229&layout=html&Itemid=27 ''The Writings of Hippocrates and Galen.

Over 20,000 pages in length, it is divided into 22 volumes, with 676 index pages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Many of Galen's works are included in the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]'', a digital library of Greek literature started in 1972. Another useful modern source is the French [http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/histmed/medica/galien_va.htm Biblioth\u00e8que interuniversitaire de m\u00e9decine] (BIUM).\n\n==Legacy==\n===Late antiquity===\nIn his time, Galen's reputation as both physician and philosopher was legendary,<ref name=\"nutton84a\">Nutton V. Galen in the eyes of his contemporaries. BHM 58(3) fall 1984 315\u201324</ref> the Emperor Marcus Aurelius describing him as \"Primum sane medicorum esse, philosophorum autem solum\" (first among doctors and unique among philosophers ''Praen 14: 660''). Other contemporary authors in the Greek world confirm this including [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus the Shoemaker]], [[Athenaeus]] and [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]. The 7th-century poet [[George Pisida|George of Pisida]] went so far as to refer to Christ as a second and neglected Galen.<ref>George of Pisida. Hexameron 1.1588f</ref> Galen continued to exert an important influence over the theory and practice of medicine until the mid-17th century in the Byzantine and Arabic worlds and Europe. Hippocrates and Galen form important landmarks of 600 years of Greek medicine. A. J. Brock describes them as representing the foundation and apex respectively.<ref name=\"brock\">Arthur John Brock (translator), ''Introduction. Galen. On the Natural Faculties''. Edinburgh 1916</ref> A few centuries after Galen, [[Palladius (physician)|Palladius Iatrosophista]] stated, in his commentary on Hippocrates, that Hippocrates sowed and Galen reaped.\n\nThus Galen summarised and synthesised the work of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Often, this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in [[Magnus of Nisibis]]' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death.<ref name=\"brock\"/> Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/>\n\nAfter the collapse of the Western Empire the study of Galen and other Greek works almost disappeared in the Latin West. In contrast, in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire (Byzantium), many commentators of the subsequent centuries, such as [[Oribasius]], physician to the emperor [[Julian the apostate|Julian]] who compiled a ''Synopsis'' in the 4th century, preserved and disseminated Galen's works, making Galenism more accessible. Nutton refers to these authors as the \"medical refrigerators of antiquity\".<ref name=\"brock\"/><ref name=\"nutton84\"/> In late antiquity, medical writing veered increasingly in the direction of the theoretical at the expense of the practical, with many authors merely debating Galenism. Magnus of Nisibis was a pure theorist, as were [[John of Alexandria]] and Agnellus of Ravenna with their lectures on Galen's ''De Sectis''.<ref>Temkin O. Studies on late Alexandrian medicine. Bull Hist Med 3: 405\u201330, 1935</ref> So strong was Galenism that other authors such as Hippocrates began to be seen through a Galenic lens, while his opponents became marginalised and other medical sects such as Asclepiadism slowly disappeared.<ref name=\"nutton84\"/> Greek medicine was part of Greek culture, and Syrian Eastern Christians came in contact with it while the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantium) ruled Syria and Western Mesopotamia, regions that were conquered from Byzantium in the 7th century by Arab Muslims. After AD 750, Muslims had these Syrian Christians make the first translations of Galen into Arabic. From then on, Galen and the Greek medical tradition in general became assimilated into the medieval and early modern Islamic Middle East.<ref name=\"brock\"/>\n\n===Influence on medicine in the Islamic world===\n{{further|Medicine in the medieval Islamic world}}\n\nGalen's approach to medicine became and remains influential in the Islamic world. The first major translator of Galen into Arabic was the Arab Christian [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. He translated (c. 830\u2013870) 129 works of \"Jalinos\"<ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7100.html Dear P. Revolutionizing the Sciences: European Knowledge and Its Ambitions, 1500\u20131700.

Arabic sources, such as [[Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya al-R\u0101zi]] (AD 865\u2013925), continue to be the source of discovery of new or relatively inaccessible Galenic writings.<ref name=\"nuttonchoice\"/> One of Hunayn's Arabic translations, ''Kitab ila Aglooqan fi Shifa al Amrad'', which is extant in the Library of [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine & Sciences]], is regarded as a masterpiece of Galen's literary works. A part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galen's work, this 10th-century manuscript comprises two parts that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More important is that it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin. The book provides an insight into understanding the traditions and methods of treatment in the Greek and Roman eras. In addition, this book provides a direct source for the study of more than 150 single and compound drugs used during the Greco-Roman period.\n\nAs the title of ''Doubts on Galen'' by al-R\u0101zi implies, as well as the writings of physicians such as [[Ibn Zuhr]] and [[Ibn al-Nafis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reflections Chairman's | year = 2004 | title = Traditional Medicine Among Gulf Arabs, Part II: Blood-letting | url = | journal = Heart Views | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 74\u201385 [80] }}</ref> the works of Galen were not accepted unquestioningly, but as a challengeable basis for further [[Scientific method|inquiry]]. A strong emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and [[empiricism]] led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as al-R\u0101zi, [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis. For example, Ibn al-Nafis' discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]] contradicted the Galenic theory on the heart.<ref name=\"Dabbagh\">{{cite journal | author = Al-Dabbagh S.

From that time, Galenism took on a new, unquestioned authority, Galen even being referred to as the \"Medical Pope of the Middle Ages\".<ref name=\"brock\"/> [[Constantine the African]] was amongst those who translated both Hippocrates and Galen from Arabic. In addition to the more numerous translations of Arabic texts in this period, there were a few translations of Galenic works directly from the Greek, such as [[Burgundio of Pisa]]'s translation of ''De complexionibus''. Galen's works on anatomy and medicine became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum, alongside Ibn Sina's ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', which elaborated on Galen's works. Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} However, Galen's influence was so great that when dissections discovered anomalies compared with Galen's anatomy, the physicians often tried to fit these into the Galenic system. An example of this is [[Mondino de Liuzzi]], who describes rudimentary blood circulation in his writings but still asserts that the left ventricle should contain air. Some cited these changes as proof that human anatomy had changed since the time of Galen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Raymond F.|title=Stories of Great Physicians|publisher=Whitman|year=1963|pages=46\u201347|chapter=The Anatomist}}</ref>\n\nThe most important translator of Galen's works into Latin was Niccol\u00f2 di Deoprepio da Reggio, who spent several years working on Galen. Niccol\u00f2 worked at the Angevin Court during the reign of king [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]]. Among Niccol\u00f2's translations is a piece from a medical treatise by Galen, of which the original text is lost.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Roberto|title=The Dawn of Humanism in Italy|year=1947|publisher=H.

This [[New Learning]] and the [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] movement, particularly the work of [[Thomas Linacre|Linacre]], promoted ''[[literae humaniores]]'' including Galen in the Latin scientific canon, ''De Naturalibus Facultatibus'' appearing in London in 1523. Debates on medical science now had two traditions, the more conservative Arabian and the liberal Greek.<ref name=\"brock\"/> The more extreme liberal movements began to challenge the role of authority in medicine, as exemplified by [[Paracelsus]]' symbolically burning the works of Avicenna and Galen at his medical school in [[University of Basel|Basle]].<ref name=\"brock\"/> Nevertheless, Galen's pre-eminence amongst the great thinkers of the millennium is exemplified by a 16th-century mural in the refectory of the [[Great Lavra]] of [[Mt Athos]].

Vesalius' most famous work, ''De humani corporis fabrica'', was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen's methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen's writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen's limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as [[Jacques Dubois|Jacobus Sylvius]]. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen's approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained in the Empiricist model.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cosans C | year = 1997 | title = Galen's Critique of Rationalist and Empiricist Anatomy | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 35\u201354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1004266427468 | pmid = 11618979 }}</ref> The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of [[Aristotle]] and [[Mondino de Liuzzi]]. One of the best known examples of Vesalius' overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the [[interventricular septum]] of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (''Nat Fac III xv''). However, this had been revealed two years before by Michael Servetus in his fateful \"''Christianismi restitutio''\" (1553) with only three copies of the book surviving, but these remaining hidden for decades; the rest were burned shortly after its publication because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.\n\n[[Michael Servetus]], using the name \"Michel de Villeneuve\" during his stay in France, was [[Vesalius]]' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, according to [[Johann Winter von Andernach]],<ref>2011 \"The love for truth.

He was ranked as the #2 recruit in the nation behind only [[Kobe Bryant]] whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game and the All-Star [[Roundball Classic|Magic Johnson Roundball Classic]] game which they dominated together.

A national sensation in high school and outstanding collegian at Villanova University, the athletic 6'10\" 240lb talent played in the [[National_Basketball_Association|National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1998 to 2010 building a 12-year career as a pro between 7 different NBA teams. <ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thomati01.html\n</ref>\n\n==High School==\nA versatile 6'10\" forward with a soft shooting touch, Thomas was tabbed as a future NBA star when he was still in high school, and was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American]] team after averaging 25.3 points and 14.5 rebounds per game as a senior at [[Paterson Catholic High School]]. He was ranked as the #2 recruit in the nation behind only [[Kobe Bryant]] whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game and the All-Star [[Roundball Classic|Magic Johnson Roundball Classic]] game which they dominated together.  Thomas also seriously considered making the jump straight to the NBA from high school, waiting to declare his decision to attend college at Villanova until just days before the deadline to enter the NBA Draft. <ref>https://vault.si.com/vault/1996/11/15/one-year-and-then-villanova-phenom-tim-thomas-gives-it-the-old-college-try-but-the-call-of-the-nba-is-never-out-of-earshot</ref>\n\n==NCAA career==\nThomas made his mark in his one season in college at Villanova University. Joining a future NBA talent-laden team with [[Alvin Williams#Basketball career|Alvin Williams]], Jason Lawson, John Celestand and Malik Allen, he filled the void of former Big East Player of the Year [[Kerry Kittles#Career highlights|Kerry Kittles]] from the year before and helped lead the Wildcats to a BIG EAST Regular Season Championship under coach Steve Lappas.

The arc begins with \"[[Pray You Catch Me]]\", with Beyonc\u00e9 suspecting her husband of infidelity. On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 asks \"What are you doing, my love?\". She is in denial of the affair in \"[[Hold Up (song)|Hold Up]]\", but spills over into anger on \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\", telling him \"If you try this shit again, you gon lose your wife\". Beyonc\u00e9 is apathetic about the relationship in \"[[Sorry (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Sorry]]\", deciding to leave her husband and telling him \"I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away\" and saying \"He better call Becky with the good hair\". Beyonc\u00e9 expresses emptiness on \"[[6 Inch]]\", but shows signs of vulnerability as she ends the track with a repetition of \"Come back, come back\". On \"[[Daddy Lessons]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 connects Jay-Z to her father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who cheated on Beyonc\u00e9's mother [[Tina Knowles|Tina]], and contemplates if she can forgive her husband as she forgave her father. On \"[[Sandcastles]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 reaches out to Jay-Z, professing her love and making a plea to him. Beyonc\u00e9 relates how she can't live without her husband, telling him \"Your heart is broken 'cause I walked away. Show me your scars and I won't walk away, and I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby. Every promise don't work out that way\". Beyonc\u00e9 decides on moving ahead with her husband on \"[[Forward (song)|Forward]]\", while on \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\" Beyonc\u00e9 relates her overcoming of her challenges to that of African-American women. The arc ends with \"[[All Night (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|All Night]]\", where Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"They say true love's the greatest weapon to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love's too pure to watch it chip away\". On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 says \"How I missed you, my love\", mirroring the outro of the album opener, with the two phrases bookending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s emotional rollercoaster. \"Formation\" is a [[black pride]] anthem, with Beyonc\u00e9 celebrating her Deep Southern heritage and culture, such as in the lyrics \"My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana, you mix that [[negro]] with that [[Creole peoples|Creole]], make a Texas bama. I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros, I like my negro nose with [[The Jackson 5|Jackson Five]] nostrils.

[[Kendrick Lamar]]'s verse also contains many political allusions, including the lyrics \"Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona, six headlights wavin' in my direction\"; both Beyonc\u00e9 and Lamar faced backlash for their respective songs \"[[Formation (song)|Formation]]\" and \"[[Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)|Alright]]\", with some critics misconstruing the songs' messages of hope and anti-[[police brutality]] and claiming the artists were instead inciting violence and hatred.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beyonc\u00e9 (Ft.

At the end of the song \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\", an audio recording of Hattie White speaking to a crowd at her ninetieth birthday party in December 2015 is played. During the speech, Hattie says: \"I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade\", referencing the proverb \"[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]\" that encourages turning sourness and difficulty to something positive. Beyonc\u00e9 also draws a connection to her own grandmother, Agnez Der\u00e9on, using her lemonade recipe that was passed down through the generations as a metaphor for the mechanisms for healing passed through generations:<ref name=\":28\" /><blockquote>Take one pint of water, add a half pound of sugar, the juice of eight lemons, the zest of half lemon. Pour the water into one, then to another several times. Strain through a clean napkin. Grandmother, the [[Alchemy|alchemist]], you spun gold out of this hard life, conjured beauty from the things left behind. Found healing where it did not live. Discovered the antidote in your own kit. Broke the curse with your own two hands. You passed these instructions down to your daughter who then passed it down to her daughter. My grandma said \"Nothing real can be threatened. True love brought salvation back into me. With every tear came redemption and my torturer became my remedy\".</blockquote>The cover artwork for ''Lemonade'' features Beyonc\u00e9 standing next to a car, wearing a fur coat and [[cornrow]] braids, hiding her face behind her arm. It was shot during the filming of the music video for \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\".\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n''Lemonade'' was first made available for [[online streaming]] via [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] on April 23, 2016 through [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]], and for [[Music download|digital download]] the following day. It was released for [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] on May 6, 2016.

Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\".

Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\".

The arc begins with \"[[Pray You Catch Me]]\", with Beyonc\u00e9 suspecting her husband of infidelity. On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 asks \"What are you doing, my love?\". She is in denial of the affair in \"[[Hold Up (song)|Hold Up]]\", but spills over into anger on \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\", telling him \"If you try this shit again, you gon lose your wife\". Beyonc\u00e9 is apathetic about the relationship in \"[[Sorry (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Sorry]]\", deciding to leave her husband and telling him \"I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away\" and saying \"He better call Becky with the good hair\". Beyonc\u00e9 expresses emptiness on \"[[6 Inch]]\", but shows signs of vulnerability as she ends the track with a repetition of \"Come back, come back\". On \"[[Daddy Lessons]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 connects Jay-Z to her father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who cheated on Beyonc\u00e9's mother [[Tina Knowles|Tina]], and contemplates if she can forgive her husband as she forgave her father. On \"[[Sandcastles]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 reaches out to Jay-Z, professing her love and making a plea to him. Beyonc\u00e9 relates how she can't live without her husband, telling him \"Your heart is broken 'cause I walked away. Show me your scars and I won't walk away, and I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby. Every promise don't work out that way\". Beyonc\u00e9 decides on moving ahead with her husband on \"[[Forward (song)|Forward]]\", while on \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\" Beyonc\u00e9 relates her overcoming of her challenges to that of African-American women. The arc ends with \"[[All Night (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|All Night]]\", where Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"They say true love's the greatest weapon to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love's too pure to watch it chip away\". On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 says \"How I missed you, my love\", mirroring the outro of the album opener, with the two phrases bookending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s emotional rollercoaster. \"Formation\" is a [[black pride]] anthem, with Beyonc\u00e9 celebrating her Deep Southern heritage and culture, such as in the lyrics \"My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana, you mix that [[negro]] with that [[Creole peoples|Creole]], make a Texas bama.

At the end of the song \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\", an audio recording of Hattie White speaking to a crowd at her ninetieth birthday party in December 2015 is played. During the speech, Hattie says: \"I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade\", referencing the proverb \"[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]\" that encourages turning sourness and difficulty to something positive. Beyonc\u00e9 also draws a connection to her own grandmother, Agnez Der\u00e9on, using her lemonade recipe that was passed down through the generations as a metaphor for the mechanisms for healing passed through generations:<ref name=\":28\" /><blockquote>Take one pint of water, add a half pound of sugar, the juice of eight lemons, the zest of half lemon. Pour the water into one, then to another several times. Strain through a clean napkin. Grandmother, the [[Alchemy|alchemist]], you spun gold out of this hard life, conjured beauty from the things left behind. Found healing where it did not live. Discovered the antidote in your own kit. Broke the curse with your own two hands. You passed these instructions down to your daughter who then passed it down to her daughter. My grandma said \"Nothing real can be threatened. True love brought salvation back into me. With every tear came redemption and my torturer became my remedy\".</blockquote>The cover artwork for ''Lemonade'' features Beyonc\u00e9 standing next to a car, wearing a fur coat and [[cornrow]] braids, hiding her face behind her arm. It was shot during the filming of the music video for \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\".\n\n== Release and promotion ==\n''Lemonade'' was first made available for [[online streaming]] via [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] on April 23, 2016 through [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]], and for [[Music download|digital download]] the following day. It was released for [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] on May 6, 2016.

Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\".

Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\".

[[Julie Andrews]], who played Maria in the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]] of the musical, had previously sung the song on the 1961 Christmas special for ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''.\n\n== Background ==\nIn the [[musical theatre|musical]], the lyrics to the song are a reference to things Maria loves, such as \"whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens\". These are the things she selects to fill her mind with when times are bad.\n\nThe original Broadway musical places the song in the Mother Abbess's office, just before she sends Maria to serve [[Georg Ritter von Trapp|Captain von Trapp]]'s family as governess to his seven children. However, [[Ernest Lehman]], the screenwriter for the film adaptation, repositioned it so that Maria would sing it with the children during the thunderstorm scene in her bedroom, replacing \"[[The Lonely Goatherd]]\", which had originally been sung at this point. Many stage productions also make this change, shifting \"The Lonely Goatherd\" to another scene.\n\nThe first section of the melody has a distinctive property of using only the notes 1, 2, and 5 (tonic, supertonic, and dominant) of the scale. By using the same melody-pattern, Rodgers harmonized it differently in different stanzas, using a series of minor [[Triad (music)|triad]]s one time and major triads the next.\n\nThe song ends with a borrowed line of lyric and notes from Rodgers' earlier composition with [[Lorenz Hart]], \"[[Glad to Be Unhappy]]\", a standard about finding peace in the midst of unrequited love. Using the same two notes for the phrasing of \"so sad\" in the original song, Rodgers brings the gloom of the song to a similar upbeat ending \u2013 \"and then I don't feel so bad.\" Jesus is alife\n\nIn 2004 the movie version of the song finished at No. 64 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema.\n\n== Other notable versions ==\n\n[[John Coltrane]] played a fourteen-minute version in E minor as the title track of an [[My Favorite Things (John Coltrane album)|album recorded in October 1960 and released in March 1961]].

[[Julie Andrews]], who played Maria in the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]] of the musical, had previously sung the song on the 1961 Christmas special for ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''.\n\n== Background ==\nIn the [[musical theatre|musical]], the lyrics to the song are a reference to things Maria loves, such as \"whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens\". These are the things she selects to fill her mind with when times are bad.\n\nThe original Broadway musical places the song in the Mother Abbess's office, just before she sends Maria to serve [[Georg Ritter von Trapp|Captain von Trapp]]'s family as governess to his seven children. However, [[Ernest Lehman]], the screenwriter for the film adaptation, repositioned it so that Maria would sing it with the children during the thunderstorm scene in her bedroom, replacing \"[[The Lonely Goatherd]]\", which had originally been sung at this point. Many stage productions also make this change, shifting \"The Lonely Goatherd\" to another scene.\n\nThe first section of the melody has a distinctive property of using only the notes 1, 2, and 5 (tonic, supertonic, and dominant) of the scale. By using the same melody-pattern, Rodgers harmonized it differently in different stanzas, using a series of minor [[Triad (music)|triad]]s one time and major triads the next.\n\nThe song ends with a borrowed line of lyric and notes from Rodgers' earlier composition with [[Lorenz Hart]], \"[[Glad to Be Unhappy]]\", a standard about finding peace in the midst of unrequited love. Using the same two notes for the phrasing of \"so sad\" in the original song, Rodgers brings the gloom of the song to a similar upbeat ending \u2013 \"and then I don't feel so bad.\"\n\nIn 2004 the movie version of the song finished at No. 64 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema.\n\n== Other notable versions ==\n\n[[John Coltrane]] played a fourteen-minute version in E minor as the title track of an [[My Favorite Things (John Coltrane album)|album recorded in October 1960 and released in March 1961]]. It became a jazz classic and a signature song for Coltrane in concert, also appearing on ''[[Newport '63]]'' in 1963.<ref name=\"Giddins1998\">{{cite book|author=Gary Giddins|title=Visions of Jazz: The First Century|url=https://archive.org/details/visionsofjazzfir0000gidd_k9c0|url-access=registration|date=October 22, 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-987953-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/visionsofjazzfir0000gidd_k9c0/page/485 485]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964 [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]] became the first of many artists to include the song on a [[Christmas music|Christmas album]], despite its lyrics making no mention of the holiday.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/holiday/8078515/my-favorite-things-christmas-sound-of-music|title=Mystery Solved: Here's How 'My Favorite Things' From 'The Sound of Music' Became a Christmas Song|last=Bronson|first=Fred|website=Billboard|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]] released a version in 1969 as a single from their 1968 album, ''[[Christmas Album (Herb Alpert album)|Christmas Album]]''.
