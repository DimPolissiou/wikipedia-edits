Rural flight is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services (such as business enterprises and schools), which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features.\n\n==Historical trends==\n[[File:Dust Bowl - Dallas, South Dakota 1936.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The effects of the [[Dust Bowl]] in [[Dallas, South Dakota]], May 1936]]\nPrior to the [[Industrial Revolution]], rural flight occurred in mostly localized regions. Pre-industrial societies did not experience large rural-urban migration flows primarily due to the inability of cities to support large populations. Lack of large employment industries, high urban mortality, and low food supplies all served as checks keeping pre-industrial cities much smaller than their modern counterparts. [[Ancient Athens]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], scholars estimate, had peak populations of 80,000 and 500,000.<ref name=Weeks>{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=John|title=Population: an introduction to concepts and issues|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|pages=353\u2013391}}</ref>\n\nThe onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of these checks. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers arose, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the start of rural flight on a massive scale.<ref name=Weeks /> The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Kingsley|title=The Urbanization of the Human Population|journal=Scientific American|volume=213|issue=3|pages=40\u201353|url=http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/3245/871552/The_Urbanization_of_the_Human_Population--Kingsley_Davis.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2014|bibcode=1965SciAm.213c..40D|year=1965|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0965-40}}</ref> While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of rural flight focused in [[Western Europe]] and the United States, as [[industrialization]] spread throughout the world during the 20th century, rural flight and [[urbanization]] followed quickly behind.

New capital market systems and the railroad network began the trend towards larger farms that employed fewer people per acre.

While a small family farm typically produced a wide range of crop, garden, and animal products\u2014all requiring substantial labor\u2014large industrial farms typically specialize in just a few crop or livestock varieties, using large machinery and high-density livestock containment systems that require a fraction of the labor per unit produced. For example, [[Iowa State University]] reports the number of [[hog farmer]]s in Iowa dropped from 65,000 in 1980 to 10,000 in 2002, while the number of hogs per farm increased from 200 to 1,400.<ref name=\"ISU 1\">{{cite web  |url=http://www.card.iastate.edu/iowa_ag_review/summer_03/article1.aspx| title=Living with Hogs in Rural Iowa| year=2003| work=Iowa Ag Review| publisher=[[Iowa State University]]| accessdate=25 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe consolidation of the feed, seed, [[processed grain]], and livestock industries has meant that there are fewer small businesses in rural areas. This decrease in turn exacerbated the decreased demand for labor. Rural areas that used to be able to provide employment for all young adults willing to work in challenging conditions, increasingly provide fewer opportunities for young adults. The situation is made worse by the decrease in services such as schools, business, and cultural opportunities that accompany the decline in population, and the increasing age of the remaining population further stresses the social service system of rural areas.\n\n===Abandonment of small towns===\nThe rise of corporate agricultural structures directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retail outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution.<ref>[http://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/articles/duffy/DuffyOct97.htm \"Changes in Iowa farm structure\"]; University of Iowa Extension;</ref>  ''Human dehabitation'' of rural settlements is a megatrend in [[Population ageing|aging societies]] across the globe, perhaps partially reversing a historic boom in land use for settlements that coincided with [[population growth]] that began in earnest alongside the spread of the [[industrial revolution]] and [[curative medicine]].

Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the [[Harris-Todaro Model]], migration to urban areas will continue as long as \"expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product\" (127).<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=John|title=Migration, Unemployment and Development: A Two-Sector Analysis|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1222150.files/Session%2018/harris_todaro70.pdf|publisher=American Economic Association|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>  However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level.<ref name=Gugler>Gugler, Josef. \"Overurbanization Reconsidered.\" ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 31, no. 1 (1 October 1982): 173\u201389.</ref> This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as [[overurbanization]].<ref name=Davis>Davis, Kingsley, and Hilda Hertz Golden. \"Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas.\" Economic Development and Cultural Change 3, no. 1 (October 1954): 6\u201326.</ref> Since the industrialization of agriculture, mechanization has reduced the number of jobs present in rural communities. Some scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perz|first=Stephen|title=The Rural Exodus in the Context of Economic Crisis, Globalization, and Reform in Brazil|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=842\u2013881|jstor=2675947|year=2000|doi=10.1177/019791830003400308}}</ref> At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates.<ref name=Weeks /> The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as [[chain migration]], migrant networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.<ref>{{cite web|title=China Human Development Report 2005: Development with Equity|publisher=UNDP}}</ref>\n\nSome families choose to send their children to cities as a form of investment for the future. A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities. Sending their children into cities can serve as long-term investments with the hope that their children will be able to send remittances back home after getting a job in the city.<ref name=Zambia>{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Robert|title=Determinants of the Rural Exodus in Zambia|journal=Cahiers d'\u00c9tudes Africaines|volume=14|issue=55|pages=543\u2013564|jstor=4391333|year=1974|doi=10.3406/cea.1974.2636|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/82866/1/sswp22.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThere are severe challenges faced by poorer people in the agriculture sector because of diminishing access to productive farmland. Foreign investors through [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI) schemes have been encouraged to lease land in rural areas in [[Cambodia]] and [[Ethiopia]].

A study conducted in 2012 indicated that a significant proportion of rural flight in India occurred due to social factors such as migration with household, marriage, and education.

The 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States, for example, led to the flight of 2.5 million people from the Plains by 1940, many to the new cities in the West.

A corresponding principle of German law is ''[[Stadtluft macht frei]]'' (\"city air makes you free\"), in longer form ''Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag'' (\"city air makes you free after a year and a day\"): by custom and, from 1231/32, by statute, a [[serf]] who had spent a year and a day in a city was free, and could not be reclaimed by their former master.\n\n===German ''Landflucht''===\n{{Main article|Landflucht}}\n''[[Landflucht]]'' (\"flight from the land\") refers to the mass [[Human migration|migration]] of peasants into the cities that occurred in [[Germany]] (and throughout most of Europe) in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1870 the rural population of Germany constituted 64% of the population; by 1907 it had shrunk to 33%.<ref name= \"Schapiro, Shotwell p. 300\">SchapiroShotwell; 1922, p. 300.</ref> In 1900 alone, the Prussian provinces of [[East Prussia]], [[West Prussia]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]], [[Silesia]], and [[Pomerania]] lost about 1,600,000 people to the cities,<ref name= \"Kirk p. 139\">Kirk1969, p. 139.</ref> where these former agricultural workers were absorbed into the rapidly growing factory labor class;<ref name= \"Mises p. 8\">Mises2006, p. 8.</ref> One of the causes of this mass-migration was the decrease in rural income compared to the rates of pay in the cities.<ref name= \"Shafir p. 150\">Shafir 1996, p. 150.</ref>\n\nLandflucht resulted in a major transformation of the German countryside and agriculture.

The first, beginning in the 1850s when 82% of the Swedish population lived in rural areas, and continuing till the late 1880s, was mostly due to push factors in the countryside related to poverty, unemployment, low agricultural wages, debt peonage, semi-feudalism, and religious oppression by the State church. Most of the migration was ad-hoc and directed towards emigration to the three big cities of Sweden, America, Denmark, or Germany. Many of these first emigrants were unskilled, barely literate laborers who sought farm work or daily wage labour in the cities.\n\nThe second wave started from the late 1890s and reached its peak between 1922 and 1967, with the highest rates of rural flight occurring in the 1920s and the 1950s. This was mostly \"pull factors\" due to the economic boom and industrial prosperity in Sweden wherein the massive economic expansion and wage increases in the urban areas pulled young people to migrate for work and at the same time drove down work opportunities in the countryside. Between 1925 and 1965, Sweden's GDP per capita increased from US$850 to US$6200. Simultaneously, the percentage of the population living in rural areas decreased drastically from 54% in 1925 to 21% in 1965.\n\n== Russia and the former Soviet states ==\nRural flight began later for [[Russia]] and the former states of the [[USSR]] than in [[Western Europe]]. In 1926 only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, compared to over 75% at the same time in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War II and the decades immediately proceeding, rural flight proceeded at a rapid pace.

Western Russia and [[Ukraine]] experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively. Conversely, peripheral regions of the USSR, like [[Central Asia]], experienced gains, contradicting the general pattern of rural-urban migration of this period. Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.<ref name=Wadekin />\n\nRural flight in Russia and the former USSR had several major determinants. The industrialization of agriculture, which came later in Russia and the former USSR, led to declines in available rural jobs. Lower living standards and tough work also motivated some peasants to migrate to urban areas.<ref name=Wadekin /> In particular, the Soviet ''[[kolkhoz]]'' system (the collective farms in the Soviet Union) aided in maintaining low living standards for Soviet peasants. Beginning around 1928, the [[kolkhoz]] system replaced [[family farm]]s throughout the Soviet Union. Forced to work long hours for low pay at rates fixed by the government and often unadjusted to [[inflation]], Russian peasants experienced quite low living-conditions - especially compared to urban life.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Editors of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title= kolkhoz|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321400/kolkhoz|encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate= 29 March 2014}}</ref>   While [[Brezhnev]]'s wage reforms in 1965 ameliorated the low wages received by peasants, rural life remained suffocating, especially for the skilled and the educated.<ref name=Wegren /> \n[[File:Menkovo - abandoned post office - DSCF5841.JPG|thumb|An abandoned post office in [[Menkovo]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast]], Russia]]\n\nAlthough migrants came from all segments of society, several groups were more likely to migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave rural life. This exodus of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously over the course of the 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.<ref name=Wadekin /><ref name=Wegren />\n\n== Mexico ==\nRural flight in Mexico occurred throughout the 1930s up until the present day.

Concurrently, government policies favoring industrialization led to a massive increase of industrial jobs in the cities.

Additionally, due to the large demand for new workers, many of these jobs had low entrance requirements that also provided on-site job training opening the avenue for [[human migration|migration]] to many rural residents. From 1940 to about 1965, rural flight occurred in a slow, yet steady pace with both agriculture and industry growing concurrently.<ref name=Arizpe />\n\nHowever, as government policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began to regulate the price of maize through massive imports in order to keep low urban food costs.<ref name=Arizpe />  This regulation severely undercut the market price of [[maize]] lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the [[Green Revolution]] had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of [[Norman Borlaug]], farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thurow|first=Roger|title=Enough: Why the World's Poorest Starve in an Age of Plenty|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York, NY|author2=Kilman, Scott }}</ref>  Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, out of the reach of many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize.

As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate.

Many migrants do not have the education or skills to acquire decent jobs in cities and are then forced into unstable, low paying jobs. The steady stream of new rural migrants worsens underemployment and unemployment, common among rural migrants. Employers offer lower wages and poorer labor conditions to rural migrants, who must compete with each other for limited jobs, often unaware of their labor rights. Rural migrants often experience poor living conditions as well. Many cities have exploded in population; services and infrastructure, in these cities, are unable to keep up with population growth. Massive influxes in rural population can lead to severe housing shortages, inadequate water and energy supply, and general slum-like conditions throughout cities.<ref name=Weeks /><ref name=Youth />\n\nAdditionally, rural migrants often struggle adjusting to city life. In some instances, there are cultural differences between the rural and urban areas of a region. Lost in urban regions, it becomes difficult for them to continue holding onto their cultural traditions. Urban residents may also look down upon these newcomers to the city who are often unaware of city social norms. Both marginalized and separated from their home cultures, migrants face many social challenges when moving to cities.<ref name=Youth />\n\nWomen, in particular, face a unique set of challenges. Some women undergo rural flight to escape domestic abuse or forced early marriages. Some parents choose to send women to cities to find jobs in order to send remittances back home. Once in the city, employers may attempt to take advantage of these women preying on their unfamiliarity with labor laws and social networks on which to rely. In the worst of cases, destitution may force women into prostitution, exposing them to social stigma and the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.<ref name=Youth />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Demographic history of the United States]]\n*[[Highland Clearances]]\n*[[Rural development]]\n*[[Rural ghetto]]\n*[[Rural sociology]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* <cite id=refDrage1909>{{cite book |last = Geoffrey Drage |title = Austria-Hungary |edition= 1909 |publisher = J.

It is [[urbanization]] seen from the rural perspective.\n\nIn modern times, it often occurs in a region following the [[Factory farming|industrialization]] of [[agriculture]]\u2014when fewer people are needed to bring the same amount of agricultural output to market\u2014and related agricultural services and industries are consolidated.  Rural flight is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services (such as business enterprises and schools), which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features.\n\n==Historical trends==\n[[File:Dust Bowl - Dallas, South Dakota 1936.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The effects of the [[Dust Bowl]] in [[Dallas, South Dakota]], May 1936]]\nPrior to the [[Industrial Revolution]], rural flight occurred in mostly localized regions. Pre-industrial societies did not experience large rural-urban migration flows primarily due to the inability of cities to support large populations. Lack of large employment industries, high urban mortality, and low food supplies all served as checks keeping pre-industrial cities much smaller than their modern counterparts. [[Ancient Athens]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], scholars estimate, had peak populations of 80,000 and 500,000.<ref name=Weeks>{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=John|title=Population: an introduction to concepts and issues|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|pages=353\u2013391}}</ref>\n\nThe onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of these checks. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers arose, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the start of rural flight on a massive scale.<ref name=Weeks /> The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Kingsley|title=The Urbanization of the Human Population|journal=Scientific American|volume=213|issue=3|pages=40\u201353|url=http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/3245/871552/The_Urbanization_of_the_Human_Population--Kingsley_Davis.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2014|bibcode=1965SciAm.213c..40D|year=1965|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0965-40}}</ref> While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of rural flight focused in [[Western Europe]] and the United States, as [[industrialization]] spread throughout the world during the 20th century, rural flight and [[urbanization]] followed quickly behind.

New capital market systems and the railroad network began the trend towards larger farms that employed fewer people per acre. These larger farms used more efficient technologies such as steel plows, mechanical [[reaper]]s, and higher-yield seed stock, which reduced human input per unit of production.<ref name=\"Cronon\">{{cite book | last=Cronon| first=William| title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West| url=https://archive.org/details/naturesmetropoli00cron_0| url-access=registration| publisher=Norton| location=New York| year=1991}}</ref> The other issue on the Great Plains was that people were using inappropriate farming techniques for the soil and weather conditions.  Most [[Homestead Acts|homestead]]ers had family farms generally considered too small to survive (under 320 acres), and European-American subsistence farming could not continue as it was then practiced.\n\nDuring the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, large numbers of people [[Depopulation of the Great Plains|fled rural areas of the Great Plains]] and the Midwest due to depressed commodity prices and high [[debt load]]s exacerbated by several years of drought and large [[dust storm]]s.<ref name=\"Cooper\">{{cite book | last=Cooper| first=Michael L.| title=Dust to eat: drought and depression in the 1930s| url=https://archive.org/details/dusttoeatdrought00coop| url-access=registration| publisher=Clarion| location=New York| year=2004}}</ref> Rural flight from the Great Plains has been depicted in literature, such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939), in which a family from the [[Great Plains]] migrates to [[California]] during the Dust Bowl period of the 1930s.\n\n===Modern rural flight===\n{{quote|\"'''Women leave in greater numbers than men.

Small, labor-intensive [[family farms]] have grown into, or have been replaced by, heavily mechanized and specialized industrial farms. While a small family farm typically produced a wide range of crop, garden, and animal products\u2014all requiring substantial labor\u2014large industrial farms typically specialize in just a few crop or livestock varieties, using large machinery and high-density livestock containment systems that require a fraction of the labor per unit produced. For example, [[Iowa State University]] reports the number of [[hog farmer]]s in Iowa dropped from 65,000 in 1980 to 10,000 in 2002, while the number of hogs per farm increased from 200 to 1,400.<ref name=\"ISU 1\">{{cite web  |url=http://www.card.iastate.edu/iowa_ag_review/summer_03/article1.aspx| title=Living with Hogs in Rural Iowa| year=2003| work=Iowa Ag Review| publisher=[[Iowa State University]]| accessdate=25 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe consolidation of the feed, seed, [[processed grain]], and livestock industries has meant that there are fewer small businesses in rural areas. This decrease in turn exacerbated the decreased demand for labor. Rural areas that used to be able to provide employment for all young adults willing to work in challenging conditions, increasingly provide fewer opportunities for young adults. The situation is made worse by the decrease in services such as schools, business, and cultural opportunities that accompany the decline in population, and the increasing age of the remaining population further stresses the social service system of rural areas.\n\n===Abandonment of small towns===\nThe rise of corporate agricultural structures directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retail outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution.<ref>[http://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/articles/duffy/DuffyOct97.htm \"Changes in Iowa farm structure\"]; University of Iowa Extension;</ref>  ''Human dehabitation'' of rural settlements is a megatrend in [[Population ageing|aging societies]] across the globe, perhaps partially reversing a historic boom in land use for settlements that coincided with [[population growth]] that began in earnest alongside the spread of the [[industrial revolution]] and [[curative medicine]].

Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the [[Harris-Todaro Model]], migration to urban areas will continue as long as \"expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product\" (127).<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=John|title=Migration, Unemployment and Development: A Two-Sector Analysis|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1222150.files/Session%2018/harris_todaro70.pdf|publisher=American Economic Association|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>  However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level.<ref name=Gugler>Gugler, Josef. \"Overurbanization Reconsidered.\" ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 31, no. 1 (1 October 1982): 173\u201389.</ref> This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as [[overurbanization]].<ref name=Davis>Davis, Kingsley, and Hilda Hertz Golden. \"Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas.\" Economic Development and Cultural Change 3, no. 1 (October 1954): 6\u201326.</ref> Since the industrialization of agriculture, mechanization has reduced the number of jobs present in rural communities. Some scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perz|first=Stephen|title=The Rural Exodus in the Context of Economic Crisis, Globalization, and Reform in Brazil|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=842\u2013881|jstor=2675947|year=2000|doi=10.1177/019791830003400308}}</ref> At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates.<ref name=Weeks /> The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as [[chain migration]], migrant networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.<ref>{{cite web|title=China Human Development Report 2005: Development with Equity|publisher=UNDP}}</ref>\n\nSome families choose to send their children to cities as a form of investment for the future. A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities. Sending their children into cities can serve as long-term investments with the hope that their children will be able to send remittances back home after getting a job in the city.<ref name=Zambia>{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Robert|title=Determinants of the Rural Exodus in Zambia|journal=Cahiers d'\u00c9tudes Africaines|volume=14|issue=55|pages=543\u2013564|jstor=4391333|year=1974|doi=10.3406/cea.1974.2636|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/82866/1/sswp22.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThere are severe challenges faced by poorer people in the agriculture sector because of diminishing access to productive farmland. Foreign investors through [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI) schemes have been encouraged to lease land in rural areas in [[Cambodia]] and [[Ethiopia]]. This has led to the loss of farmland, range land, woodlands and water sources from local communities. Large-scale agricultural projects funded by FDI only employed a few experts specialized in the relevant new technologies.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002457/245765e.pdf|title=Learning knowledge and skills for agriculture to improve rural livelihoods|last=Robinson-Pant|first=Anna|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100169-7|location=|pages=90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n===Social determinants===\nIn other instances, rural flight may occur in response to social determinants. A study conducted in 2012 indicated that a significant proportion of rural flight in India occurred due to social factors such as migration with household, marriage, and education. Migration with households and marriage affect women in particular as most often they are the ones required to move with households and move for marriage, especially in developing regions.<ref name=India>{{cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Tarique|author2=Khan, Jabir |title=Determinants of Rural Out-Migration in India|journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Management and Social Sciences|date=December 2012|volume=1|issue=12|url=https://www.academia.edu/5450848|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> \n\t\nRural youth may choose to leave their rural communities as a method of transitioning into adulthood, seeking avenues to greater prosperity.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, a study conducted by Touray in 2006 indicated that about 15% (26 million) of urban migrants were youth. \n\t\nLastly, natural disasters can often be single-point events that lead to temporarily massive rural-urban migration flows. The 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States, for example, led to the flight of 2.5 million people from the Plains by 1940, many to the new cities in the West.

The first, beginning in the 1850s when 82% of the Swedish population lived in rural areas, and continuing till the late 1880s, was mostly due to push factors in the countryside related to poverty, unemployment, low agricultural wages, debt peonage, semi-feudalism, and religious oppression by the State church. Most of the migration was ad-hoc and directed towards emigration to the three big cities of Sweden, America, Denmark, or Germany. Many of these first emigrants were unskilled, barely literate laborers who sought farm work or daily wage labour in the cities.\n\nThe second wave started from the late 1890s and reached its peak between 1922 and 1967, with the highest rates of rural flight occurring in the 1920s and the 1950s. This was mostly \"pull factors\" due to the economic boom and industrial prosperity in Sweden wherein the massive economic expansion and wage increases in the urban areas pulled young people to migrate for work and at the same time drove down work opportunities in the countryside. Between 1925 and 1965, Sweden's GDP per capita increased from US$850 to US$6200. Simultaneously, the percentage of the population living in rural areas decreased drastically from 54% in 1925 to 21% in 1965.\n\n== Russia and the former Soviet states ==\nRural flight began later for [[Russia]] and the former states of the [[USSR]] than in [[Western Europe]]. In 1926 only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, compared to over 75% at the same time in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War II and the decades immediately proceeding, rural flight proceeded at a rapid pace. By 1965, 53% of Russians lived in urban areas.<ref name=Wadekin>{{cite journal|last= Wadekin|first= Karl-Eugen|title= Internal Migration and the Flight from the Land in USSR|journal= Soviet Studies|date= October 1966|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 131\u2013152|jstor= 149517|doi= 10.1080/09668136608410523}}</ref> Statistics compiled by M. Ya Sonin, a Soviet author, in 1959, demonstrate the rapid [[urbanization]] of the [[USSR]].

Of this dramatic shift in population, rural flight accounts for more than 60% of the change.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Sonin|first= M.

However, with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of the Soviet Union]], rural flight reversed as political and economic instability in the cities prompted many urban dwellers to return to rural villages.<ref name=Wegren>{{cite journal|last= Wegren|first= Stephen K.|title= Rural Migration and Agrarian Reform in Russia: A Research Note|journal= Europe-Asia Studies|date= July 1995|volume= 47|issue= 5|pages= 877\u2013888|jstor= 152691|doi= 10.1080/09668139508412292|pmid= 12320195}}</ref> \n[[File:Novospasskoe1.jpg|thumb|The defunct church in the abandoned village Novospasskoye, [[Saratov Oblast]], Russia]]\n\nRural flight did not occur uniformly throughout the USSR. Western Russia and [[Ukraine]] experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively. Conversely, peripheral regions of the USSR, like [[Central Asia]], experienced gains, contradicting the general pattern of rural-urban migration of this period. Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.<ref name=Wadekin />\n\nRural flight in Russia and the former USSR had several major determinants. The industrialization of agriculture, which came later in Russia and the former USSR, led to declines in available rural jobs. Lower living standards and tough work also motivated some peasants to migrate to urban areas.<ref name=Wadekin /> In particular, the Soviet ''[[kolkhoz]]'' system (the collective farms in the Soviet Union) aided in maintaining low living standards for Soviet peasants. Beginning around 1928, the [[kolkhoz]] system replaced [[family farm]]s throughout the Soviet Union. Forced to work long hours for low pay at rates fixed by the government and often unadjusted to [[inflation]], Russian peasants experienced quite low living-conditions - especially compared to urban life.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Editors of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title= kolkhoz|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321400/kolkhoz|encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate= 29 March 2014}}</ref>   While [[Brezhnev]]'s wage reforms in 1965 ameliorated the low wages received by peasants, rural life remained suffocating, especially for the skilled and the educated.<ref name=Wegren /> \n[[File:Menkovo - abandoned post office - DSCF5841.JPG|thumb|An abandoned post office in [[Menkovo]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast]], Russia]]\n\nAlthough migrants came from all segments of society, several groups were more likely to migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave rural life. This exodus of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously over the course of the 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.<ref name=Wadekin /><ref name=Wegren />\n\n== Mexico ==\nRural flight in Mexico occurred throughout the 1930s up until the present day. Like other developing nations, the beginning of industrialization in Mexico quickly accelerated the rate of rural flight.<ref name=Arizpe>{{cite journal|last=Arizpe|first=Lourdes|title=The Rural Exodus in Mexico and Mexican Migration to the United States|journal=International Migration Review|date=Winter 1981|volume=15|issue=4|pages=626\u2013649|jstor=2545516|doi=10.2307/2545516}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas|Cardenas]] implemented a series of agricultural reforms that led to massive redistribution of agricultural land among the rural peasants. Some commentators have subsequently dubbed the period from 1940-1965 as the \"Golden Era for Mexican Migration.\"<ref name=Arizpe />  During this period, Mexican agriculture grew at an average rate of 5.7% outpacing the natural increase of 3% of the rural population. Concurrently, government policies favoring industrialization led to a massive increase of industrial jobs in the cities. Statistics compiled in [[Mexico City]] demonstrate this trend with over 1.8 million jobs created over the course of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.<ref name=Arizpe /> Young people with schooling were the segment of population most likely to migrate away from rural life to urban life, attracted by the promise of many jobs and a more modern lifestyle as compared to the conservative conditions in rural villages. Additionally, due to the large demand for new workers, many of these jobs had low entrance requirements that also provided on-site job training opening the avenue for [[human migration|migration]] to many rural residents. From 1940 to about 1965, rural flight occurred in a slow, yet steady pace with both agriculture and industry growing concurrently.<ref name=Arizpe />\n\nHowever, as government policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began to regulate the price of maize through massive imports in order to keep low urban food costs.<ref name=Arizpe />  This regulation severely undercut the market price of [[maize]] lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the [[Green Revolution]] had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of [[Norman Borlaug]], farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thurow|first=Roger|title=Enough: Why the World's Poorest Starve in an Age of Plenty|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York, NY|author2=Kilman, Scott }}</ref>  Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, out of the reach of many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize.

In contrast, the top 0.5% of estates by land spanned 28.3% of all arable land. As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate. Between 1950 and 1970, the proportion of migrant workers increased from 36.7% to 54% of the total population.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Osorio|first=S.R|title=Estructura Agrariay Desarrollo Agricola en Mexico|journal=Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1974}}</ref> The centralized pattern of industrial development and government policies overwhelmingly favoring industrialization contributed to massive rural flight in Mexico beginning in the late 1960s until the present day.<ref name=Arizpe />\n\n==Consequences of rural flight==\nRural migrants to cities face several challenges that may hinder their quality of life upon moving into urbanized areas. Many migrants do not have the education or skills to acquire decent jobs in cities and are then forced into unstable, low paying jobs. The steady stream of new rural migrants worsens underemployment and unemployment, common among rural migrants. Employers offer lower wages and poorer labor conditions to rural migrants, who must compete with each other for limited jobs, often unaware of their labor rights. Rural migrants often experience poor living conditions as well. Many cities have exploded in population; services and infrastructure, in these cities, are unable to keep up with population growth. Massive influxes in rural population can lead to severe housing shortages, inadequate water and energy supply, and general slum-like conditions throughout cities.<ref name=Weeks /><ref name=Youth />\n\nAdditionally, rural migrants often struggle adjusting to city life. In some instances, there are cultural differences between the rural and urban areas of a region. Lost in urban regions, it becomes difficult for them to continue holding onto their cultural traditions. Urban residents may also look down upon these newcomers to the city who are often unaware of city social norms. Both marginalized and separated from their home cultures, migrants face many social challenges when moving to cities.<ref name=Youth />\n\nWomen, in particular, face a unique set of challenges. Some women undergo rural flight to escape domestic abuse or forced early marriages. Some parents choose to send women to cities to find jobs in order to send remittances back home. Once in the city, employers may attempt to take advantage of these women preying on their unfamiliarity with labor laws and social networks on which to rely. In the worst of cases, destitution may force women into prostitution, exposing them to social stigma and the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.<ref name=Youth />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Demographic history of the United States]]\n*[[Highland Clearances]]\n*[[Rural development]]\n*[[Rural ghetto]]\n*[[Rural sociology]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* <cite id=refDrage1909>{{cite book |last = Geoffrey Drage |title = Austria-Hungary |edition= 1909 |publisher = J.

The performance is typically given in an [[opera house]], accompanied by an [[orchestra]] or smaller [[musical ensemble]], which since the early 19th century has been led by a [[conducting|conductor]].\n\nOpera is a key part of the [[Western culture#Music|Western]] [[classical music]] tradition.<ref>Comparable art forms from various other parts of the world, many of them ancient in origin, are also sometimes called \"opera\" by analogy, usually prefaced with an adjective indicating the region (for example, [[Chinese opera]]). These independent traditions are not derivative of Western opera but are rather distinct forms of [[musical theatre]]. Opera is also not the only type of Western musical theatre: in the ancient world, [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]] featured singing and instrumental accompaniment; and in modern times, other forms such as the [[musical theatre|musical]] have appeared.</ref> Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include [[:Category:Opera genres|numerous genres]], including some that include spoken dialogue such as [[musical theater]], ''[[Singspiel]]'' and ''[[Op\u00e9ra comique]]''. In traditional [[number opera]], singers employ two styles of singing: [[recitative]], a speech-inflected style,<ref name=\"Apel, p. 718\">[[#Apel1969|Apel]], p. 718.</ref> and self-contained [[aria]]s. The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous [[Gesamtkunstwerk|music drama]].\n\n[[Origins of opera|Opera originated]] in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly [[Lost work|lost]] ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as [[George Frideric Handel]]. [[Opera seria]] was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] reacted against its artificiality with his \"reform\" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian [[comic opera]]s, especially ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' (''Le nozze di Figaro''), ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', as well as ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' (''The Abduction from the Seraglio''), and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (''Die Zauberfl\u00f6te''), landmarks in the German tradition.\n\nThe first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the [[bel canto]] style, with [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]] all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of [[Grand Opera]] typified by the works of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]. The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Italy and [[Richard Wagner]] in Germany. The popularity of opera continued through the [[verismo]] era in Italy and contemporary [[French opera]] through to [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Richard Strauss]] in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in [[Russian opera|Russia]] and [[Bohemia]]. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as [[atonality]] and [[serialism]] ([[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]), [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] ([[Igor Stravinsky]]), and [[Minimalism]] ([[Philip Glass]] and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]). With the rise of [[sound recording|recording technology]], singers such as [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Maria Callas]] became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these media. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live [[high-definition video]] transmissions of their performances in [[Movie theatre|cinemas]] all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are [[Live streaming|live streamed]].\n\n==Operatic terminology==\nThe words of an opera are known as the [[libretto]] (literally \"small book\"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]. Traditional opera, often referred to as \"[[number opera]]\", consists of two modes of singing: [[recitative]], the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech,<ref name=\"Apel, p. 718\"/> and [[aria]] (an \"air\" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as [[singspiel]], [[op\u00e9ra comique]], [[operetta]], and [[semi-opera]], the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as [[arioso]]. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail [[#Operatic voices|below]].<ref>General information in this section comes from the relevant articles in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', by. P.Scholes (10th ed., 1968).</ref> During both the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: ''secco'' (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by ''[[basso continuo]]'', which was usually a [[harpsichord]] and a cello; or ''accompagnato'' (also known as ''strumentato'') in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, ''accompagnato'' had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed \"endless melody\". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail [[#Changing role of the orchestra|below]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|Origins of opera}}\n[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claudio Monteverdi]]]]\nThe Italian word ''opera'' means \"work\", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin ''opera'', a singular noun meaning \"work\" and also the plural of the noun ''[[:wikt:opus|opus]]''. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the Italian word was first used in the sense \"composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined\" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed., s.v. \"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131729 opera]\".</ref>\n\n''[[Dafne]]'' by [[Jacopo Peri]] was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the \"[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata de' Bardi]]\". Significantly, ''Dafne'' was an attempt to revive the classical [[Tragedy|Greek drama]], part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the [[Renaissance]]. The members of the Camerata considered that the \"chorus\" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of \"restoring\" this situation. ''Dafne,'' however, is lost. A later work by Peri, ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'', dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', composed for the court of [[Mantua]] in 1607.<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 1; articles on Peri and Monteverdi in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.</ref> The Mantua court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]], employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the [[concerto delle donne]] (till 1598), but also one of the first actual \"opera singers\", [[Madama Europa]].<ref>Karin Pendle Women and music 2001 p. 65 \"From 1587\u20131600 a Jewish singer cited only as Madama Europa was in the pay of the Duke of Mantua,\"</ref>\n\n===Italian opera===\n{{Main|Italian opera}}\n\n====Baroque era====\n[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Vivaldi]], in 1723]]\n[[File:Ceskystage.jpg|thumb|Private baroque theatre in [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]]]]\n[[File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical F\u00eate - 1747.png|thumb|[[Teatro Argentina]] ([[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], 1747, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]])]]\n\nOpera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a \"season\" (often during the [[carnival]]) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in [[Venice]]. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'', for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower [[Francesco Cavalli]] helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the [[Arcadian academy|Arcadian Academy]], which came to be associated with the poet [[Metastasio]], whose [[Libretto|libretti]] helped crystallize the genre of [[opera seria]], which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called [[opera buffa]].\nBefore such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an \"opera-within-an-opera\". One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public [[opera house]]s. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the [[commedia dell'arte]], a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of \"intermezzi\", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.\n\n''Opera seria'' was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of ''secco'' recitative interspersed with long ''da capo'' arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of ''opera seria'' the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male [[castrato]] voice, which was produced by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]], which prevented a boy's [[larynx]] from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]], as well as female [[soprano]]s such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], became in great demand throughout Europe as ''opera seria'' ruled the stage in every country except France.  Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] found himself composing the likes of ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'' and ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] as well, for example in the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who wrote in Vienna near the century's close.

The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. [[Francesco Algarotti]]'s ''Essay on the Opera'' (1755) proved to be an inspiration for [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s reforms. He advocated that ''opera seria'' had to return to basics and that all the various elements\u2014music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging\u2014must be subservient to the overriding drama.

The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a \"beautiful simplicity\". This is evident in his first reform opera, ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.\n\nGluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], notably ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to ''opera seria'' was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as ''[[Idomeneo]]'' and ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again.<ref>''Man and Music: the Classical Era'', ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989); entries on Gluck and Mozart in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.</ref>\n\n====Bel canto, Verdi and verismo====\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi, by [[Giovanni Boldini]], 1886]]\nThe [[bel canto]] opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]], [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] and many others. Literally \"beautiful singing\", ''bel canto'' opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's ''[[The Barber of Seville|Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', as well as Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''.\n{{listen|type=music\n | filename     = La_Donna_E_Mobile_Rigoletto.ogg\n | title        = La donna \u00e8 mobile\n | description  = [[Enrico Caruso]] sings \"[[La donna \u00e8 mobile]]\", from [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (1908)\n | filename2    = No Pagliaccio non son.ogg\n | title2       = No Pagliaccio non-son\n | description2 = Aria from [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]''. Performed by Enrico Caruso\n}}\n\nFollowing the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], beginning with his biblical opera ''[[Nabucco]]''. This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionized Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of [[Italian nationalism]] in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy. In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]''. The first of these, ''Rigoletto'', proved the most daring and revolutionary. In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be \"an unending string of duets\". ''La traviata'' was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and is often cited as one of the first \"realistic\" operas,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French [[Grand Opera]], ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and ending his career with two [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare-inspired]] works, ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In ''Falstaff'', Verdi sets the preeminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, ''Falstaff'' contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Richard Strauss]], and [[Benjamin Britten]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardstrauss.at/strauss-and-wagner.html|title=Strauss and Wagner \u2013 Various articles \u2013 Richard Strauss|website=www.richardstrauss.at}}</ref>\n\nAfter Verdi, the sentimental \"realistic\" melodrama of [[verismo]] appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. Later Italian composers, such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], have experimented with [[modernism]].<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 5, 8 and 9.

Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, [[Sigmund Theophil Staden|Sigmund Staden]] produced the first ''[[Singspiel]]'', ''[[Seelewig]]'', a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am G\u00e4nsemarkt in [[Hamburg]] presented German operas by [[Reinhard Keiser|Keiser]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as [[Carl Heinrich Graun|Graun]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse|Hasse]] and later [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.<ref>''Man and Music: the Classical Era'' ed.

The tradition was developed in the 19th century by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] with his ''[[Fidelio]]'', inspired by the climate of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] established [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian [[bel canto]]. His ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'' (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include [[Heinrich Marschner|Marschner]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Albert Lortzing|Lortzing]], but the most significant figure was undoubtedly [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].\n[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 180.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Br\u00fcnnhilde throws herself on Siegfried's funeral pyre in Wagner's ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'']]\nWagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (a \"complete work of art\"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring [[Theme (music)|themes]] often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder]]'', ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as [[tonality]], in his quest for greater expressivity. In his mature music dramas, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'', ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of \"endless melody\". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] or [[Arthurian]] legend. Finally, Wagner built [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|his own opera house]] at [[Bayreuth]] with part of the patronage from [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.\n\nOpera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, [[Richard Strauss]] accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and the dark tragedy ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where Mozart and Viennese [[waltz]]es became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Erich Korngold]], [[Franz Schreker]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Kurt Weill]] and the Italian-born [[Ferruccio Busoni]]. The operatic innovations of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his successors are discussed in the section on [[#Modernism|modernism]].<ref>General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1\u20133, 6, 8 and 9, and ''The Oxford Companion to Music''; more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the Austrian composer [[Johann Strauss II]], an admirer of the [[French language|French]]-language [[operetta]]s composed by [[Jacques Offenbach]], composed several German-language operettas, the most famous of which was ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', which is still regularly performed today.<ref>[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]].

Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an [[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique|Academy of Music]] and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'', Lully and his librettist [[Philippe Quinault|Quinault]] created ''[[trag\u00e9die en musique]]'', a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive [[recitative]] which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], who composed five ''[[trag\u00e9die en musique|trag\u00e9dies en musique]]'' as well as numerous works in other genres such as [[op\u00e9ra-ballet]], all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian [[opera seria]] throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofop0004grou|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofop0004grou/page/133 133]|title=A Short History of Opera |publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-11958-0 |accessdate=11 April 2014|last1=Grout |first1=Donald Jay |last2=Grout |first2=Donald |last3=Williams |first3=Hermine Weigel |year=2003 }}</ref> After Rameau's death, the German [[Gluck]] was persuaded to produce six operas for the [[Paris|Parisian stage]] in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: ''[[op\u00e9ra comique]]''. This was the equivalent of the German [[singspiel]], where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Monsigny]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor|Philidor]] and, above all, [[Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try|Gr\u00e9try]]. During the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] period, composers such as [[\u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul]] and [[Luigi Cherubini]], who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly \"comic\" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Gossec|Gossec's]] ''Le triomphe de la R\u00e9publique'' (1793).\n[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2012 - Carmen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1]] and [[Jonas Kaufmann]] in a scene from ''[[Carmen]]'', [[Salzburg Festival]] 2012]]\n\nBy the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian [[bel canto]], especially after the arrival of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] in Paris. Rossini's ''[[Guillaume Tell]]'' helped found the new genre of [[Grand Opera]], a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. Meyerbeer's works, such as ''[[Les Huguenots]]'', emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter ''op\u00e9ra comique'' also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of [[Bo\u00efeldieu]], [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Ferdinand H\u00e9rold|H\u00e9rold]] and [[Adolphe Adam|Adam]]. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer [[Hector Berlioz]] struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece ''[[Les Troyens]]'', the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, [[Jacques Offenbach]] created [[operetta]] with witty and cynical works such as ''[[Orph\u00e9e aux enfers]]'', as well as the opera ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]''; [[Charles Gounod]] scored a massive success with ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''; and [[Georges Bizet]] composed ''[[Carmen]]'', which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of [[Romanticism]] and realism, became the most popular of all op\u00e9ra comiques. [[Jules Massenet]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] and [[L\u00e9o Delibes]] all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory, examples being Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'', Saint-Sa\u00ebns' ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson et Dalila]]'' and Delibes' ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]''.  Their operas formed another genre, the Opera Lyrique, combined opera comique and grand opera. It is less grandiose than grand opera, but without the spoken dialogue of opera comique.  At the same time, the influence of [[Richard Wagner]] was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from [[Claude Debussy]]. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]'' (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely un-Wagnerian.\n\nOther notable 20th-century names include [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]] and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]. [[Francis Poulenc]] is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]'') have gained a foothold in the international repertory. [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s lengthy sacred drama ''[[Saint Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise]]'' (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.<ref>General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1\u20134, 8 and 9; and ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' (10th ed., 1968); more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.</ref>\n\n===English-language opera===\n{{Main|Opera in English}}\n[[File:Henry Purcell.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Henry Purcell]]]]\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Stay, Prince and hear.ogg|title=Stay, Prince and hear|description=Scene from Purcell's ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''.

This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently [[libel]]lous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French [[masque]] was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. [[Inigo Jones]] became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Lovers Made Men'' (1617), \"the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo\".<ref name=IvanhoeSite>[http://www.webrarian.co.uk/ivanhoe/ivan01.html From Webrarian.com's] ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' site.</ref> The approach of the [[English Commonwealth]] closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the [[dramatist]] Sir [[William Davenant]] produced ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]''. Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by ''[[The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru]]'' (1658) and ''[[The History of Sir Francis Drake]]'' (1659). These pieces were encouraged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] because they were critical of Spain. With the [[English Restoration]], foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''[[Psyche (Locke)|Psyche]]'', patterned on the 1671 'com\u00e9die-ballet' of the same name produced by [[Moli\u00e8re]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. [[William Davenant]] produced ''The Tempest'' in the same year, which was the first musical adaption of a [[Shakespeare]] play (composed by Locke and Johnson).<ref name=IvanhoeSite /> About 1683, [[John Blow]] composed ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', often thought of as the first true English-language opera.\n\nBlow's immediate successor was the better known [[Henry Purcell]]. Despite the success of his masterwork ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead, he usually worked within the constraints of the [[semi-opera]] format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as [[Shakespeare]] in Purcell's ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'' (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in ''The Prophetess'' (1690) and ''Bonduca'' (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator [[John Dryden]]) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.\n\n[[File:Thomas Augustine Arne.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Arne]]]]\nFollowing Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to [[Thomas Arne]], both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being ''[[Thomas and Sally]]'' in 1760. His opera ''[[Artaxerxes (opera)|Artaxerxes]]'' (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown [[opera seria]] in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, ''Love in a Village'' (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. [[Charles Burney]] wrote that Arne introduced \"a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated\".\n[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Mikado]]'' (Lithograph)]]\nBesides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was [[George Frideric Handel]], whose ''opera serias'' filled the London operatic stages for decades and influenced most home-grown composers, like [[John Frederick Lampe]], who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of [[Michael William Balfe]], and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.\n\nThe only exceptions were [[ballad opera]]s, such as [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728), musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], European [[operetta]]s, and late [[Victorian era]] [[light opera]]s, notably the [[Savoy Operas]] of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876),<ref name=IvanhoeSite /> but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of \"English\" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' agreed, describing ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' as \"a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage\".<ref>The ''Daily Telegraph''{{'}}s review of ''Yeomen'' stated, \"The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention.

Ltd.).</ref> Sullivan produced a few light operas in the 1890s that were of a more serious nature than those in the G&S series, including ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' and ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', but ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts\u2014a record until Broadway's ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'') survives as his only [[Grand Opera]].\n\nIn the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and in particular [[Benjamin Britten]], who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. More recently [[Harrison Birtwistle|Sir Harrison Birtwistle]] has emerged as one of Britain's most significant contemporary composers from his first opera ''[[Punch and Judy (opera)|Punch and Judy]]'' to his most recent critical success in [[The Minotaur (opera)|The Minotaur]]. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, [[Michael Nyman]], has been focusing on composing operas, including ''[[Facing Goya]]'', ''[[Man and Boy: Dada]]'', and ''[[Love Counts]]''. Today composers such as [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]] continue to export English opera abroad.<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1, 3 and 9. ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Blow, Purcell and Britten.</ref>\n\nAlso in the 20th century, American composers like [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], [[Douglas Moore]], and [[Carlisle Floyd]] began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Mark Adamo]], [[John Corigliano]], [[Robert Moran]], [[John Coolidge Adams]], [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] and [[Jake Heggie]]. Many contemporary 21st century opera composers have emerged such as [[Missy Mazzoli]], [[Kevin Puts]], [[Tom Cipullo]], [[Huang Ruo]], [[David T. Little]], [[Terence Blanchard]], [[Jennifer Higdon]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Michael Ching]], and [[Ricky Ian Gordon]].\n\n===Russian opera===\n{{Main|Russian opera}}\n[[File:Feodor Chaliapin as Ivan Susanin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Feodor Chaliapin]] as [[Ivan Susanin]] in [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'']]\nOpera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the [[Italian opera]]tic [[wikt:troupe|troupes]] and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and [[aristocracy]]. Many foreign composers such as [[Baldassare Galuppi]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Giuseppe Sarti]], and [[Domenico Cimarosa]] (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the [[Italian language]]. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Dmitry Bortniansky]] were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was ''[[Tsefal i Prokris]]'' by the Italian composer [[Francesco Araja]] (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers [[Vasily Pashkevich]], [[Yevstigney Fomin]] and [[Alexey Verstovsky]].\n\nHowever, the real birth of [[Russian opera]] came with [[Mikhail Glinka]] and his two great operas ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' (1836) and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842). After him, during the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]'' by [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], ''[[Prince Igor]]'' by [[Alexander Borodin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], and ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian [[nationalism]] across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general [[Slavophilism]] movement.\n\nIn the 20th century, the [[tradition]]s of Russian opera were developed by many composers including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in his works ''[[The Miserly Knight]]'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff)|Francesca da Rimini]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]] in ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|Le Rossignol]]'', ''[[Mavra]]'', ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', and ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]] in ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'', ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'', ''[[Betrothal in a Monastery]]'', and ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]''; as well as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', [[Edison Denisov]] in ''[[L'\u00e9cume des jours (opera)|L'\u00e9cume des jours]]'', and [[Alfred Schnittke]] in ''[[Life with an Idiot]]'' and ''[[Historia von D.

During the late 18th century up until the mid-19th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.\n\nCzech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]], who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular ''[[The Bartered Bride]]''. [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], most famous for ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', wrote 13 operas; and [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]] gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including ''[[Jen\u016ffa]]'', ''[[The Cunning Little Vixen]]'', and ''[[K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1]]''.\n\nIn Russian Eastern Europe, several national operas began to emerge. Ukrainian opera was developed by [[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]] (1813\u20131873) whose most famous work ''[[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]]'' (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) is regularly performed around the world. Other Ukrainian opera composers include [[Mykola Lysenko]] (''[[Taras Bulba (opera)|Taras Bulba]]'' and ''[[Natalka Poltavka (opera)|Natalka Poltavka]]''), [[Heorhiy Maiboroda]], and [[Yuliy Meitus]]. At the turn of the century, a distinct national opera movement also began to emerge in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] under the leadership [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], who fused local [[folk song]]s and stories with 19th-century [[Romantic music|Romantic]] classical themes.\n\n[[File:Erkel Ferenc Gy\u00f6rgyi Alajos.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ferenc Erkel]], the father of Hungarian opera]]\nThe key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was [[Ferenc Erkel]], whose works mostly dealt with historical themes.

The first Brazilian opera for a libretto in Portuguese was ''A Noite de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o'', by [[Elias \u00c1lvares Lobo]]. However, [[Antonio Carlos Gomes]] is generally regarded as the most outstanding Brazilian composer, having a relative success in Italy with its Brazilian-themed operas with Italian librettos, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]''. Opera in Argentina developed in the 20th century after the inauguration of [[Teatro Col\u00f3n]] in Buenos Aires\u2014with the opera ''[[Aurora (opera)|Aurora]]'', by [[Ettore Panizza]], being heavily influenced by the Italian tradition, due to immigration. Other important composers from Argentina include [[Felipe Boero]] and [[Alberto Ginastera]].\n\n===Contemporary, recent, and modernist trends===\n\n====Modernism====\nPerhaps the most obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the development of [[atonality]]. The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with [[Richard Wagner]], and in particular the [[Tristan chord]]. Composers such as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Giacomo Puccini]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, [[Paul Hindemith]], Benjamin Britten and [[Hans Pfitzner]] pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in his ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''. Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.\n\n[[File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg . 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Arnold Schoenberg in 1917; portrait by [[Egon Schiele]]]]\nOperatic modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his student [[Alban Berg]], both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), [[dodecaphony]]. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, ''[[Erwartung]]'' (1909, premiered in 1924) and ''[[Die gl\u00fcckliche Hand]]'' display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used [[Sprechstimme]].\n\nThe two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925) and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (incomplete at his death in 1935) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.\n[[File:Igor Stravinsky Essays.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky in 1921]]\nComposers thus influenced include the Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]], the German [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. ([[Philip Glass]] also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as [[minimalist music|minimalist]], usually thought of as another 20th-century development.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/periods-genres/modern/minimalism-guide/|title=Minimalist music: where to start|website=Classic FM}}</ref><!--Most readers will find it startling to hear Glass associated with atonality.-->\n\nHowever, operatic modernism's use of atonality also sparked a backlash in the form of [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. An early leader of this movement was [[Ferruccio Busoni]], who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical [[number opera]] ''[[Arlecchino (opera)|Arlecchino]]'' (first performed in 1917).<ref>Chris Walton, \"Neo-classical opera\" in [[#Cooke2005|Cooke]], p. 108.</ref> Also among the vanguard was the Russian [[Igor Stravinsky]]. After composing music for the [[Diaghilev]]-produced ballets ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927).  Stravinsky had already turned away from the modernist trends of his early ballets to produce small-scale works that do not fully qualify as opera, yet certainly contain many operatic elements, including ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (1916: \"a burlesque in song and dance\") and ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'' (1918: \"to be read, played, and danced\"; in both cases the descriptions and instructions are those of the composer). In the latter, the actors declaim portions of speech to a specified rhythm over instrumental accompaniment, peculiarly similar to the older German genre of ''[[Melodrama]]''.  Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (1914), and ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore [[serialism|serialist technique]] and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style [[diatonic]] number opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many{{who|date=October 2012}}<!-- if references had a page number it might be possible to replace weaslely phrase with a concrete example --> other composers.<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 8; ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Schoenberg, Berg and Stravinsky; Malcolm MacDonald ''Schoenberg'' (Dent,1976); Francis Routh, ''Stravinsky'' (Dent, 1975).</ref>\n\n====Other trends====\nA common trend throughout the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the use of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased throughout the 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; [[Mark Adamo]]'s two-act realization of ''[[Little Women (opera)|Little Women]]'' is scored for 18 instrumentalists.\n\nAnother feature of late 20th-century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'', ''[[Nixon in China]]'', and ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], ''[[Dead Man Walking (opera)|Dead Man Walking]]'' by [[Jake Heggie]], and ''[[Anna Nicole]]'' by [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]] exemplify the dramatisation onstage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/met-backtracks-on-drop-in-average-audience-age/ | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel J. | last=Wakin | title=Met Backtracks on Drop in Average Audience Age | date=17 February 2011}}</ref> Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for [[classical music]] since the last decades of the 20th century.<ref>General reference for this section: ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 9.</ref> In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/about/education/student.aspx |title=Information about Metropolitan Opera Company student discounts |publisher=Metoperafamily.org |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nSmaller companies in the US have a more fragile existence, and they usually depend on a \"patchwork quilt\" of support from state and local governments, local businesses, and fundraisers.

Popular [[Musical theatre|musicals]] such as ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and in the 2010s they are sometimes seen in opera houses.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/dec/17/classicalmusicandopera1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Clements | title=Sweeney Todd, Royal Opera House, London | date=17 December 2003}}</ref> ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' (1952) is quasi-operatic and has been revived by the [[New York City Opera]].

Although none of the major opera houses \"...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre\", many use a [[sound reinforcement system]] for acoustic enhancement and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, child singers, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in ''[[Tosca]]'' or thunder effects in Wagnerian operas).<ref>Kai Harada, [http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&magazinearticleid=66853&siteid=15&magazineid=138 \"Opera's Dirty Little Secret\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031082324/http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&magazinearticleid=66853&siteid=15&magazineid=138 |date=31 October 2013 }}, ''Entertainment Design'', 1 March 2001</ref>\n\n==Operatic voices==\nOperatic vocal technique evolved, in a time before electronic amplification, to allow singers to produce enough volume to be heard over an orchestra, without the instrumentalists having to substantially compromise their volume.\n\n===Vocal classifications===\nSingers and the roles they play are classified by [[voice type]], based on the [[tessitura]], [[vocal weight|agility, power]] and [[timbre]] of their voices. Male singers can be classified by [[vocal range]] as [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[bass-baritone]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]], and female singers as [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]]. (Men sometimes sing in the \"female\" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed [[sopranist]] or [[countertenor]]. The [[countertenor]] is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for [[castrati]]\u2014men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by [[vocal weight|size]]\u2014for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, [[coloratura]], [[soubrette]], [[spinto]], or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.\n\nYet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the ''[[basso buffo]]'' who often must be a specialist in [[Patter song|patter]] as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the ''[[Fach]]'' system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken [[drama]] were often put on by the same [[repertory]] company.\n\nA particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, ''premiere dugazon'' and ''deuxieme dugazon'', were named after successive stages in the career of [[Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre]] (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the [[Paris Opera#See also|Parisian theatres]] are ''[[Jean-Blaise Martin|baryton-martin]]'' and [[soprano]] ''[[Corn\u00e9lie Falcon|falcon]]''.\n\n===Historical use of voice parts===\n:''The following is only intended as a brief overview. For the main articles, see [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[countertenor]] and [[castrato]]''.\n\nThe soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a [[castrato]]. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high [[A (musical note)|A]] ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], for example, only wrote one role extending to a high [[C (musical note)|C]]), though the castrato [[Farinelli]] was alleged to possess a top [[D (musical note)|D]] (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' to such heavyweight roles as Brang\u00e4ne in Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing \"witches, bitches, and [[breeches role|britches]]\" roles. In recent years many of the \"trouser roles\" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.\n\nThe tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the ''bel canto'' era, such as [[Donizetti]]'s sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during ''[[La fille du r\u00e9giment]]''. With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as ''Heldentenor''; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's ''Turandot''. Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in ''opera seria'' in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' to the nobility of Wotan in [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Wagner's ''Ring Cycle,'']] to the conflicted King Phillip of Verdi's ''[[Don Carlos]]''. In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's ''Cos\u00ec fan tutte'' to Posa in Verdi's ''Don Carlos''; the actual designation \"baritone\" was not standard until the mid-19th century.\n\n===Famous singers===\n[[File:Senesino portrait edited.jpg|thumb|upright|The castrato [[Senesino]], c. 1720]]\nEarly performances of opera were too infrequent for singers to make a living exclusively from the style, but with the birth of commercial opera in the mid-17th century, professional performers began to emerge. The role of the male hero was usually entrusted to a [[castrato]], and by the 18th century, when Italian opera was performed throughout Europe, leading castrati who possessed extraordinary vocal virtuosity, such as [[Senesino]] and [[Farinelli]], became international stars. The career of the first major female star (or [[prima donna]]), [[Anna Renzi]], dates to the mid-17th century. In the 18th century, a number of Italian sopranos gained international renown and often engaged in fierce rivalry, as was the case with [[Faustina Bordoni]] and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]], who started a fist fight with one another during a performance of a Handel opera. The French disliked castrati, preferring their male heroes to be sung by an [[haute-contre]] (a high tenor), of which [[Joseph Legros]] (1739\u20131793) was a leading example.<ref>''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (ed.

Opera solos during this period were accompanied by the [[basso continuo]] group, which consisted of the [[harpsichord]], \"plucked instruments\" such as [[lute]] and a bass instrument.<ref name=\"John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139\">John Spitzer. (2009). Orchestra and voice in eighteenth-century Italian opera. In: Anthony R. DelDonna and Pierpaolo Polzonetti (eds.) [[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Eighteenth-Century Opera]]. pp. 112\u201339. [Online]. Cambridge Companions to Music. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> The string orchestra typically only played when the singer was not singing, such as during a singer's \"...entrances and exits, between vocal numbers, [or] for [accompanying] dancing\". Another role for the orchestra during this period was playing an orchestral [[ritornello]] to mark the end of a singer's solo.<ref name=\"John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139\"/> During the early 1700s, some composers began to use the string orchestra to mark certain aria or recitatives \"...as special\"; by 1720, most arias were accompanied by orchestra. Opera composers such as [[Domenico Sarro]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Giambattista Pergolesi]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Johann Adolf Hasse]] added new instruments to the opera orchestra and gave the instruments new roles. They added wind instruments to the strings and used orchestral instruments to play instrumental solos, as a way to mark certain arias as special.<ref name=\"John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139\"/>\n[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006329 030 Orchester im Orchestergraben.jpg|thumb|right|German opera orchestra from the early 1950s]]\nThe orchestra has also provided an instrumental [[overture]] before the singers come onstage since the 1600s. [[Jacopo Peri|Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'' opens with a brief instrumental [[ritornello]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) opens with a [[toccata]], in this case a fanfare for muted [[trumpet]]s. The [[French overture]] as found in [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s operas<ref>Waterman, George Gow, and James R. Anthony. 2001. \"French Overture\". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.</ref> consist of a slow introduction in a marked \"dotted rhythm\", followed by a lively movement in [[fugato]] style. The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose. This overture style was also used in English opera, most notably in [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as [[Giulio Cesare]].<ref>{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8fHja-D-FvsC |last= Burrows |first = Donald|date = 2012|page = 178|title = Handel|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0-19-973736-9}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy, a distinct form called \"overture\" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century.<ref name=\"Fisher 2001\">Fisher, Stephen C. 2001. \"Italian Overture.\" ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.</ref> It uses three generally [[homophony|homophonic]] [[Movement (music)|movements]]: fast\u2013slow\u2013fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the [[gigue]] or [[minuet]], and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called \"sonatina form\" ([[sonata form]] without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical.<ref name=\"Fisher 2001\"/>\n\nIn Italian opera after about 1800, the \"overture\" became known as the ''sinfonia''.<ref name=FISH>Fisher, Stephen C. 1998. \"Sinfonia\". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', four volumes, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]]. London: Macmillan Publishers, Inc. {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}</ref> Fisher also notes the term ''Sinfonia avanti l'opera'' (literally, the \"symphony before the opera\") was \"an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work\".<ref name=FISH/> In 19th-century opera, in some operas, the overture, ''Vorspiel'', ''Einleitung'', Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, was the portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises; a specific, rigid form was no longer required for the overture.\n\nThe role of the orchestra in accompanying the singers changed over the 19th century, as the Classical style transitioned to the Romantic era. In general, orchestras got bigger, new instruments were added, such as additional percussion instruments (e.g., bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, etc.). The [[orchestration]] of orchestra parts also developed over the 19th century. In Wagnerian operas, the forefronting of the orchestra went beyond the overture. In Wagnerian operas such as ''[[Tristan]]'', the orchestra often played the recurrent musical themes or [[leitmotif]]s, a role which gave a prominence to the orchestra which \"...elevated its status to that of a [[prima donna]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Christopher John |date=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=772 }}</ref> Wagner's operas were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity, adding more brass instruments and huge ensemble sizes: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s.\n\nAs the role of the orchestra and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did the role of leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the [[concertmaster]], would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of [[music director]] became termed the [[conducting|conductor]], and a podium was used to make it easier for all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the [[orchestra pit]] and the singers up on stage.\n\n==Language and translation issues==\nSince the days of Handel and Mozart, many composers have favored Italian as the language for the libretto of their operas. From the Bel Canto era to Verdi, composers would sometimes supervise versions of their operas in both Italian and French. Because of this, operas such as ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' or ''[[Don Carlos]]'' are today deemed canonical in both their French and Italian versions.<ref>de Acha, Rafael. [http://seenandheard-international.com/2013/09/don-carlos-in-french/ \"Don Carlo or Don Carlos? In Italian or in French?\"] (Seen and Heard International, 24 September 2013)</ref>\n\nTill the mid 1950s, it was acceptable to produce operas in translations even if these had not been authorized by the composer or the original librettists. For example, opera houses in Italy routinely staged Wagner in Italian.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/whose-language-is-opera-the-audiences-or-the-composers/news-story/b8b5ea7dfc230f1eda72a2eb329d1daa|title=Whose language is opera: the audience's or the composer's?|author=Lyndon Terracini|date=11 April 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=13 April 2018|author-link=Lyndon Terracini}}</ref> After WWII, opera scholarship improved, artists refocused on the original versions, and translations fell out of favor. Knowledge of European languages, especially Italian, French, and German, is today an important part of the training for professional singers.\"The biggest chunk of operatic training is in linguistics and musicianship,\" explains mezzo-soprano [[Dolora Zajick]]. \"[I have to understand] not only what I'm singing, but what everyone else is singing. I sing Italian, Czech, Russian, French, German, English.\"<ref>[https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/03/19/291410969/dolora-zajick-singing-is-connected-to-the-body \"For Opera Powerhouse Dolora Zajick, 'Singing Is Connected To The Body'\"] (Fresh Air, 19 March 2014)</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called [[surtitles]]) began to appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally condemned as a distraction,<ref>[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/arts/music/06tomm.html \"So That's What the Fat Lady Sang\"] (''The New York Times'', 6 July 2008)</ref> today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's [[proscenium]] arch, or individual seat screens where spectators can choose from more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a [[RAI]] broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one\u2014even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.\n\nToday, operas are only rarely performed in translation. Exceptions include the [[English National Opera]], the [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]], [[Opera Theater of Pittsburgh]], and Opera South East,<ref>[http://www.operasoutheast.org.uk/all-past-productions.html \"Opera South East's past productions back to 1980...

The performance is typically given in an [[opera house]], accompanied by an [[orchestra]] or smaller [[musical ensemble]], which since the early 19th century has been led by a [[conducting|conductor]].\n\nOpera is a key part of the [[Western culture#Music|Western]] [[classical music]] tradition.<ref>Comparable art forms from various other parts of the world, many of them ancient in origin, are also sometimes called \"opera\" by analogy, usually prefaced with an adjective indicating the region (for example, [[Chinese opera]]). These independent traditions are not derivative of Western opera but are rather distinct forms of [[musical theatre]]. Opera is also not the only type of Western musical theatre: in the ancient world, [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]] featured singing and instrumental accompaniment; and in modern times, other forms such as the [[musical theatre|musical]] have appeared.</ref> Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include [[:Category:Opera genres|numerous genres]], including some that include spoken dialogue such as [[musical theatre]], ''[[Singspiel]]'' and ''[[Op\u00e9ra comique]]''. In traditional [[number opera]], singers employ two styles of singing: [[recitative]], a speech-inflected style,<ref name=\"Apel, p. 718\">{{harvnb|Apel|1969|p=718}}</ref> and self-contained [[aria]]s. The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous [[Gesamtkunstwerk|music drama]].\n\n[[Origins of opera|Opera originated]] in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly [[Lost work|lost]] ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as [[George Frideric Handel]]. [[Opera seria]] was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] reacted against its artificiality with his \"reform\" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian [[comic opera]]s, especially ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' (''Le nozze di Figaro''), ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', as well as ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' (''The Abduction from the Seraglio''), and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (''Die Zauberfl\u00f6te''), landmarks in the German tradition.\n\nThe first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the [[bel canto]] style, with [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]] all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of [[Grand Opera]] typified by the works of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]. The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Italy and [[Richard Wagner]] in Germany. The popularity of opera continued through the [[verismo]] era in Italy and contemporary [[French opera]] through to [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Richard Strauss]] in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in [[Russian opera|Russia]] and [[Bohemia]]. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as [[atonality]] and [[serialism]] ([[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]), [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] ([[Igor Stravinsky]]), and [[Minimalism]] ([[Philip Glass]] and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]). With the rise of [[sound recording|recording technology]], singers such as [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Maria Callas]] became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these media. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live [[high-definition video]] transmissions of their performances in [[Movie theatre|cinemas]] all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are [[Live streaming|live streamed]].\n\n==Operatic terminology==\nThe words of an opera are known as the [[libretto]] (literally \"small book\"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]. Traditional opera, often referred to as \"[[number opera]]\", consists of two modes of singing: [[recitative]], the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech,<ref name=\"Apel, p. 718\"/> and [[aria]] (an \"air\" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as [[singspiel]], [[op\u00e9ra comique]], [[operetta]], and [[semi-opera]], the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as [[arioso]]. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail [[#Operatic voices|below]].<ref>General information in this section comes from the relevant articles in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', by. P.Scholes (10th ed., 1968).</ref> During both the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: ''secco'' (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by ''[[basso continuo]]'', which was usually a [[harpsichord]] and a cello; or ''accompagnato'' (also known as ''strumentato'') in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, ''accompagnato'' had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed \"endless melody\". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail [[#Changing role of the orchestra|below]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|Origins of opera}}\n[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claudio Monteverdi]]]]\nThe Italian word ''opera'' means \"work\", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin ''opera'', a singular noun meaning \"work\" and also the plural of the noun ''[[:wikt:opus|opus]]''. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the Italian word was first used in the sense \"composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined\" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed., s.v. \"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131729 opera]\".</ref>\n\n''[[Dafne]]'' by [[Jacopo Peri]] was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the \"[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata de' Bardi]]\". Significantly, ''Dafne'' was an attempt to revive the classical [[Tragedy|Greek drama]], part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the [[Renaissance]]. The members of the Camerata considered that the \"chorus\" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of \"restoring\" this situation. ''Dafne,'' however, is lost. A later work by Peri, ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'', dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', composed for the court of [[Mantua]] in 1607.<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 1; articles on Peri and Monteverdi in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.</ref> The Mantua court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]], employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the [[concerto delle donne]] (till 1598), but also one of the first actual \"opera singers\", [[Madama Europa]].<ref>Karin Pendle Women and music 2001 p. 65 \"From 1587\u20131600 a Jewish singer cited only as Madama Europa was in the pay of the Duke of Mantua,\"</ref>\n\n===Italian opera===\n{{Main|Italian opera}}\n\n====Baroque era====\n[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Vivaldi]], in 1723]]\n[[File:Ceskystage.jpg|thumb|Private baroque theatre in [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]]]]\n[[File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical F\u00eate - 1747.png|thumb|[[Teatro Argentina]] ([[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], 1747, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]])]]\n\nOpera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a \"season\" (often during the [[carnival]]) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in [[Venice]]. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'', for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower [[Francesco Cavalli]] helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the [[Arcadian academy|Arcadian Academy]], which came to be associated with the poet [[Metastasio]], whose [[Libretto|libretti]] helped crystallize the genre of [[opera seria]], which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called [[opera buffa]].\nBefore such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an \"opera-within-an-opera\". One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public [[opera house]]s. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the [[commedia dell'arte]], a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of \"intermezzi\", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.\n\n''Opera seria'' was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of ''secco'' recitative interspersed with long ''da capo'' arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of ''opera seria'' the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male [[castrato]] voice, which was produced by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]], which prevented a boy's [[larynx]] from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]], as well as female [[soprano]]s such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], became in great demand throughout Europe as ''opera seria'' ruled the stage in every country except France.  Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] found himself composing the likes of ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'' and ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] as well, for example in the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of [[opera seria]] include [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Nicola Porpora|Porpora]].<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1\u20133.</ref>\n\n====Reform: Gluck and Mozart====\n{{listen|type=music\n | filename     = Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - Don Giovanni - Overt\u00fcre.ogg\n | title        = Mozart K. 527\n | description  = Overture to ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' (1787) (6:49 minutes)\n}}\n[[File:Gluck's Orph\u00e9e - title page illustration (lightened and cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Illustration for the score of the original Vienna version of ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'']]\n[[Opera seria]] had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. [[Francesco Algarotti]]'s ''Essay on the Opera'' (1755) proved to be an inspiration for [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s reforms. He advocated that ''opera seria'' had to return to basics and that all the various elements\u2014music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging\u2014must be subservient to the overriding drama. In 1765 [[Melchior Grimm]] published \"{{Lang|fr|Po\u00e8me lyrique}}\", an influential article for the [[Encyclop\u00e9die]] on [[lyric poetry|lyric]] and opera [[libretto]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/musdico/Grimm/167991|title=Encyclop\u00e9die Larousse en ligne \u2013 Melchior baron de Grimm|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|website=www.larousse.fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Music and the Origins of Language: Theories from the French Enlightenment|first= Downing A|last= Thomas|page= 148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0zct2C3-jaAC&pg=PA148|isbn= 978-0-521-47307-1|date= 15 June 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgrFMhZy3aAC&pg=PA248|title=Lully Studies|first=John Hajdu|last=Heyer|date=7 December 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-521-62183-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqdTxG3jUNMC&pg=PA171|title=A History of Western Musical Aesthetics|first=Edward A.|last=Lippman|date=26 November 1992|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-8032-7951-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/music/research/proj/esf/pos/sem1.aspx|title=King's College London \u2013 Seminar 1|website=www.kcl.ac.uk}}</ref> Several composers of the period, including [[Niccol\u00f2 Jommelli]] and [[Tommaso Traetta]], attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a \"beautiful simplicity\". This is evident in his first reform opera, ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.\n\nGluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], notably ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to ''opera seria'' was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as ''[[Idomeneo]]'' and ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again.<ref>''Man and Music: the Classical Era'', ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989); entries on Gluck and Mozart in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.</ref>\n\n====Bel canto, Verdi and verismo====\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi, by [[Giovanni Boldini]], 1886]]\nThe [[bel canto]] opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]], [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] and many others. Literally \"beautiful singing\", ''bel canto'' opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's ''[[The Barber of Seville|Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', as well as Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''.\n{{listen|type=music\n | filename     = La_Donna_E_Mobile_Rigoletto.ogg\n | title        = La donna \u00e8 mobile\n | description  = [[Enrico Caruso]] sings \"[[La donna \u00e8 mobile]]\", from [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (1908)\n | filename2    = No Pagliaccio non son.ogg\n | title2       = No Pagliaccio non-son\n | description2 = Aria from [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]''. Performed by Enrico Caruso\n}}\n\nFollowing the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], beginning with his biblical opera ''[[Nabucco]]''. This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionized Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of [[Italian nationalism]] in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy. In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]''. The first of these, ''Rigoletto'', proved the most daring and revolutionary. In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be \"an unending string of duets\". ''La traviata'' was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and is often cited as one of the first \"realistic\" operas,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French [[Grand Opera]], ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and ending his career with two [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare-inspired]] works, ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In ''Falstaff'', Verdi sets the preeminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, ''Falstaff'' contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Richard Strauss]], and [[Benjamin Britten]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardstrauss.at/strauss-and-wagner.html|title=Strauss and Wagner \u2013 Various articles \u2013 Richard Strauss|website=www.richardstrauss.at}}</ref>\n\nAfter Verdi, the sentimental \"realistic\" melodrama of [[verismo]] appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. Later Italian composers, such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], have experimented with [[modernism]].<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 5, 8 and 9.

Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, [[Sigmund Theophil Staden|Sigmund Staden]] produced the first ''[[Singspiel]]'', ''[[Seelewig]]'', a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am G\u00e4nsemarkt in [[Hamburg]] presented German operas by [[Reinhard Keiser|Keiser]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as [[Carl Heinrich Graun|Graun]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse|Hasse]] and later [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.<ref>''Man and Music: the Classical Era'' ed.

The tradition was developed in the 19th century by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] with his ''[[Fidelio]]'', inspired by the climate of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] established [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian [[bel canto]]. His ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'' (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include [[Heinrich Marschner|Marschner]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Albert Lortzing|Lortzing]], but the most significant figure was undoubtedly [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].\n[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 180.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Br\u00fcnnhilde throws herself on Siegfried's funeral pyre in Wagner's ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'']]\nWagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (a \"complete work of art\"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring [[Theme (music)|themes]] often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder]]'', ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as [[tonality]], in his quest for greater expressivity. In his mature music dramas, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'', ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of \"endless melody\". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] or [[Arthurian]] legend. Finally, Wagner built [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|his own opera house]] at [[Bayreuth]] with part of the patronage from [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.\n\nOpera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, [[Richard Strauss]] accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and the dark tragedy ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where Mozart and Viennese [[waltz]]es became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Erich Korngold]], [[Franz Schreker]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Kurt Weill]] and the Italian-born [[Ferruccio Busoni]]. The operatic innovations of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his successors are discussed in the section on [[#Modernism|modernism]].<ref>General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1\u20133, 6, 8 and 9, and ''The Oxford Companion to Music''; more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the Austrian composer [[Johann Strauss II]], an admirer of the [[French language|French]]-language [[operetta]]s composed by [[Jacques Offenbach]], composed several German-language operettas, the most famous of which was ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', which is still regularly performed today.<ref>[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]].

Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an [[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique|Academy of Music]] and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'', Lully and his librettist [[Philippe Quinault|Quinault]] created ''[[trag\u00e9die en musique]]'', a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive [[recitative]] which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], who composed five ''[[trag\u00e9die en musique|trag\u00e9dies en musique]]'' as well as numerous works in other genres such as [[op\u00e9ra-ballet]], all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian [[opera seria]] throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofop0004grou|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofop0004grou/page/133 133]|title=A Short History of Opera|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-11958-0|accessdate=11 April 2014|last1=Grout|first1=Donald Jay|authorlink1=Donald Jay Grout|last2=Williams|first2=Hermine Weigel|year=2003}}</ref> After Rameau's death, the German [[Gluck]] was persuaded to produce six operas for the [[Paris|Parisian stage]] in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: ''[[op\u00e9ra comique]]''. This was the equivalent of the German [[singspiel]], where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Monsigny]], [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor|Philidor]] and, above all, [[Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try|Gr\u00e9try]]. During the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] period, composers such as [[\u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul]] and [[Luigi Cherubini]], who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly \"comic\" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Gossec|Gossec's]] ''Le triomphe de la R\u00e9publique'' (1793).\n[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2012 - Carmen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1]] and [[Jonas Kaufmann]] in a scene from ''[[Carmen]]'', [[Salzburg Festival]] 2012]]\n\nBy the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian [[bel canto]], especially after the arrival of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] in Paris. Rossini's ''[[Guillaume Tell]]'' helped found the new genre of [[Grand Opera]], a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. Meyerbeer's works, such as ''[[Les Huguenots]]'', emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter ''op\u00e9ra comique'' also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of [[Bo\u00efeldieu]], [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Ferdinand H\u00e9rold|H\u00e9rold]] and [[Adolphe Adam|Adam]]. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer [[Hector Berlioz]] struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece ''[[Les Troyens]]'', the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, [[Jacques Offenbach]] created [[operetta]] with witty and cynical works such as ''[[Orph\u00e9e aux enfers]]'', as well as the opera ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]''; [[Charles Gounod]] scored a massive success with ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''; and [[Georges Bizet]] composed ''[[Carmen]]'', which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of [[Romanticism]] and realism, became the most popular of all op\u00e9ra comiques. [[Jules Massenet]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] and [[L\u00e9o Delibes]] all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory, examples being Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'', Saint-Sa\u00ebns' ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson et Dalila]]'' and Delibes' ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]''.  Their operas formed another genre, the Opera Lyrique, combined opera comique and grand opera. It is less grandiose than grand opera, but without the spoken dialogue of opera comique.  At the same time, the influence of [[Richard Wagner]] was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from [[Claude Debussy]]. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]'' (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely un-Wagnerian.\n\nOther notable 20th-century names include [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]] and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]. [[Francis Poulenc]] is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]'') have gained a foothold in the international repertory. [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s lengthy sacred drama ''[[Saint Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise]]'' (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.<ref>General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1\u20134, 8 and 9; and ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' (10th ed., 1968); more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.</ref>\n\n===English-language opera===\n{{Main|Opera in English}}\n[[File:Henry Purcell.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Henry Purcell]]]]\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Stay, Prince and hear.ogg|title=Stay, Prince and hear|description=Scene from Purcell's ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''.

This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently [[libel]]lous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French [[masque]] was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. [[Inigo Jones]] became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Lovers Made Men'' (1617), \"the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo\".<ref name=IvanhoeSite>[http://www.webrarian.co.uk/ivanhoe/ivan01.html From Webrarian.com's] ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' site.</ref> The approach of the [[English Commonwealth]] closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the [[dramatist]] Sir [[William Davenant]] produced ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]''. Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020|reason=William or Henry?}}, Cooke,{{who|date=April 2020}} [[Matthew Locke (composer)|Locke]], Coleman{{who|date=April 2020|reason=Charles (d. 1646)?}} and Hudson{{who|date=April 2020}}) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by ''[[The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru]]'' (1658) and ''[[The History of Sir Francis Drake]]'' (1659). These pieces were encouraged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] because they were critical of Spain. With the [[English Restoration]], foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''[[Psyche (Locke)|Psyche]]'', patterned on the 1671 'com\u00e9die-ballet' of the same name produced by [[Moli\u00e8re]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. [[William Davenant]] produced ''The Tempest'' in the same year, which was the first musical adaption of a [[Shakespeare]] play (composed by Locke and Johnson).<ref name=IvanhoeSite /> About 1683, [[John Blow]] composed ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', often thought of as the first true English-language opera.\n\nBlow's immediate successor was the better known [[Henry Purcell]]. Despite the success of his masterwork ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead, he usually worked within the constraints of the [[semi-opera]] format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as [[Shakespeare]] in Purcell's ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'' (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in ''The Prophetess'' (1690) and ''Bonduca'' (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator [[John Dryden]]) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.\n\n[[File:Thomas Augustine Arne.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Arne]]]]\nFollowing Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to [[Thomas Arne]], both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being ''[[Thomas and Sally]]'' in 1760. His opera ''[[Artaxerxes (opera)|Artaxerxes]]'' (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown [[opera seria]] in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, ''Love in a Village'' (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. [[Charles Burney]] wrote that Arne introduced \"a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated\".\n[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Mikado]]'' (Lithograph)]]\nBesides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was [[George Frideric Handel]], whose ''opera serias'' filled the London operatic stages for decades and influenced most home-grown composers, like [[John Frederick Lampe]], who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of [[Michael William Balfe]], and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.\n\nThe only exceptions were [[ballad opera]]s, such as [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728), musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], European [[operetta]]s, and late [[Victorian era]] [[light opera]]s, notably the [[Savoy Operas]] of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876),<ref name=IvanhoeSite /> but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of \"English\" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' agreed, describing ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' as \"a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage\".<ref>The ''Daily Telegraph''{{'}}s review of ''Yeomen'' stated, \"The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly. ...we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.\" (quoted at p. 312 in Allen, Reginald (1975). ''The First Night Gilbert and Sullivan''. London: Chappell & Co. Ltd.).</ref> Sullivan produced a few light operas in the 1890s that were of a more serious nature than those in the G&S series, including ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' and ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', but ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts\u2014a record until Broadway's ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'') survives as his only [[Grand Opera]].\n\nIn the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and in particular [[Benjamin Britten]], who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. More recently [[Harrison Birtwistle|Sir Harrison Birtwistle]] has emerged as one of Britain's most significant contemporary composers from his first opera ''[[Punch and Judy (opera)|Punch and Judy]]'' to his most recent critical success in [[The Minotaur (opera)|The Minotaur]]. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, [[Michael Nyman]], has been focusing on composing operas, including ''[[Facing Goya]]'', ''[[Man and Boy: Dada]]'', and ''[[Love Counts]]''. Today composers such as [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]] continue to export English opera abroad.<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1, 3 and 9. ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Blow, Purcell and Britten.</ref>\n\nAlso in the 20th century, American composers like [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], [[Douglas Moore]], and [[Carlisle Floyd]] began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Mark Adamo]], [[John Corigliano]], [[Robert Moran]], [[John Coolidge Adams]], [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] and [[Jake Heggie]]. Many contemporary 21st century opera composers have emerged such as [[Missy Mazzoli]], [[Kevin Puts]], [[Tom Cipullo]], [[Huang Ruo]], [[David T. Little]], [[Terence Blanchard]], [[Jennifer Higdon]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Michael Ching]], and [[Ricky Ian Gordon]].\n\n===Russian opera===\n{{Main|Russian opera}}\n[[File:Feodor Chaliapin as Ivan Susanin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Feodor Chaliapin]] as [[Ivan Susanin]] in [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'']]\nOpera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the [[Italian opera]]tic [[wikt:troupe|troupes]] and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and [[aristocracy]]. Many foreign composers such as [[Baldassare Galuppi]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Giuseppe Sarti]], and [[Domenico Cimarosa]] (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the [[Italian language]]. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Dmitry Bortniansky]] were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was ''[[Tsefal i Prokris]]'' by the Italian composer [[Francesco Araja]] (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers [[Vasily Pashkevich]], [[Yevstigney Fomin]] and [[Alexey Verstovsky]].\n\nHowever, the real birth of [[Russian opera]] came with [[Mikhail Glinka]] and his two great operas ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' (1836) and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842). After him, during the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]'' by [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], ''[[Prince Igor]]'' by [[Alexander Borodin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], and ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian [[nationalism]] across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general [[Slavophilism]] movement.\n\nIn the 20th century, the [[tradition]]s of Russian opera were developed by many composers including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in his works ''[[The Miserly Knight]]'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff)|Francesca da Rimini]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]] in ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|Le Rossignol]]'', ''[[Mavra]]'', ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', and ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]] in ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'', ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'', ''[[Betrothal in a Monastery]]'', and ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]''; as well as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', [[Edison Denisov]] in ''[[L'\u00e9cume des jours (opera)|L'\u00e9cume des jours]]'', and [[Alfred Schnittke]] in ''[[Life with an Idiot]]'' and ''[[Historia von D.

During the late 18th century up until the mid-19th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.\n\nCzech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]], who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular ''[[The Bartered Bride]]''. [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], most famous for ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', wrote 13 operas; and [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]] gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including ''[[Jen\u016ffa]]'', ''[[The Cunning Little Vixen]]'', and ''[[K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1]]''.\n\nIn Russian Eastern Europe, several national operas began to emerge. Ukrainian opera was developed by [[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]] (1813\u20131873) whose most famous work ''[[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]]'' (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) is regularly performed around the world. Other Ukrainian opera composers include [[Mykola Lysenko]] (''[[Taras Bulba (opera)|Taras Bulba]]'' and ''[[Natalka Poltavka (opera)|Natalka Poltavka]]''), [[Heorhiy Maiboroda]], and [[Yuliy Meitus]]. At the turn of the century, a distinct national opera movement also began to emerge in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] under the leadership [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], who fused local [[folk song]]s and stories with 19th-century [[Romantic music|Romantic]] classical themes.\n\n[[File:Erkel Ferenc Gy\u00f6rgyi Alajos.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ferenc Erkel]], the father of Hungarian opera]]\nThe key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was [[Ferenc Erkel]], whose works mostly dealt with historical themes.

The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with [[Richard Wagner]], and in particular the [[Tristan chord]]. Composers such as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Giacomo Puccini]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, [[Paul Hindemith]], Benjamin Britten and [[Hans Pfitzner]] pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in his ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''. Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.\n\n[[File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg . 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Arnold Schoenberg in 1917; portrait by [[Egon Schiele]]]]\nOperatic modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his student [[Alban Berg]], both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), [[dodecaphony]]. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, ''[[Erwartung]]'' (1909, premiered in 1924) and ''[[Die gl\u00fcckliche Hand]]'' display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used [[Sprechstimme]].\n\nThe two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925) and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (incomplete at his death in 1935) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.\n[[File:Igor Stravinsky Essays.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky in 1921]]\nComposers thus influenced include the Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]], the German [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. ([[Philip Glass]] also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as [[minimalist music|minimalist]], usually thought of as another 20th-century development.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/periods-genres/modern/minimalism-guide/|title=Minimalist music: where to start|website=Classic FM}}</ref><!--Most readers will find it startling to hear Glass associated with atonality.-->\n\nHowever, operatic modernism's use of atonality also sparked a backlash in the form of [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. An early leader of this movement was [[Ferruccio Busoni]], who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical [[number opera]] ''[[Arlecchino (opera)|Arlecchino]]'' (first performed in 1917).<ref>Chris Walton, \"Neo-classical opera\" in {{harvnb|Cooke|2005|p=108}}</ref> Also among the vanguard was the Russian [[Igor Stravinsky]]. After composing music for the [[Diaghilev]]-produced ballets ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927).  Stravinsky had already turned away from the modernist trends of his early ballets to produce small-scale works that do not fully qualify as opera, yet certainly contain many operatic elements, including ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (1916: \"a burlesque in song and dance\") and ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'' (1918: \"to be read, played, and danced\"; in both cases the descriptions and instructions are those of the composer). In the latter, the actors declaim portions of speech to a specified rhythm over instrumental accompaniment, peculiarly similar to the older German genre of ''[[Melodrama]]''.  Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (1914), and ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore [[serialism|serialist technique]] and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style [[diatonic]] number opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many{{who|date=October 2012}}<!-- if references had a page number it might be possible to replace weaslely phrase with a concrete example --> other composers.<ref>''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 8; ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Schoenberg, Berg and Stravinsky; Malcolm MacDonald ''Schoenberg'' (Dent,1976); Francis Routh, ''Stravinsky'' (Dent, 1975).</ref>\n\n====Other trends====\nA common trend throughout the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the use of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased throughout the 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; [[Mark Adamo]]'s two-act realization of ''[[Little Women (opera)|Little Women]]'' is scored for 18 instrumentalists.\n\nAnother feature of late 20th-century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'', ''[[Nixon in China]]'', and ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], ''[[Dead Man Walking (opera)|Dead Man Walking]]'' by [[Jake Heggie]], and ''[[Anna Nicole]]'' by [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]] exemplify the dramatisation onstage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/met-backtracks-on-drop-in-average-audience-age/ | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel J. | last=Wakin | title=Met Backtracks on Drop in Average Audience Age | date=17 February 2011}}</ref> Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for [[classical music]] since the last decades of the 20th century.<ref>General reference for this section: ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 9.</ref> In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/about/education/student.aspx |title=Information about Metropolitan Opera Company student discounts |publisher=Metoperafamily.org |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nSmaller companies in the US have a more fragile existence, and they usually depend on a \"patchwork quilt\" of support from state and local governments, local businesses, and fundraisers.

Popular [[Musical theatre|musicals]] such as ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and in the 2010s they are sometimes seen in opera houses.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/dec/17/classicalmusicandopera1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Clements | title=Sweeney Todd, Royal Opera House, London | date=17 December 2003}}</ref> ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' (1952) is quasi-operatic and has been revived by the [[New York City Opera]].

Although none of the major opera houses \"...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre\", many use a [[sound reinforcement system]] for acoustic enhancement and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, child singers, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in ''[[Tosca]]'' or thunder effects in Wagnerian operas).<ref>Kai Harada, [http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&magazinearticleid=66853&siteid=15&magazineid=138 \"Opera's Dirty Little Secret\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031082324/http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&magazinearticleid=66853&siteid=15&magazineid=138 |date=31 October 2013 }}, ''Entertainment Design'', 1 March 2001</ref>\n\n==Operatic voices==\nOperatic vocal technique evolved, in a time before electronic amplification, to allow singers to produce enough volume to be heard over an orchestra, without the instrumentalists having to substantially compromise their volume.\n\n===Vocal classifications===\nSingers and the roles they play are classified by [[voice type]], based on the [[tessitura]], [[vocal weight|agility, power]] and [[timbre]] of their voices. Male singers can be classified by [[vocal range]] as [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[bass-baritone]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]], and female singers as [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]]. (Men sometimes sing in the \"female\" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed [[sopranist]] or [[countertenor]]. The [[countertenor]] is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for [[castrati]]\u2014men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by [[vocal weight|size]]\u2014for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, [[coloratura]], [[soubrette]], [[spinto]], or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.\n\nYet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the ''[[basso buffo]]'' who often must be a specialist in [[Patter song|patter]] as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the ''[[Fach]]'' system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken [[drama]] were often put on by the same [[repertory]] company.\n\nA particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, ''premiere dugazon'' and ''deuxieme dugazon'', were named after successive stages in the career of [[Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre]] (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the [[Paris Opera#See also|Parisian theatres]] are ''[[Jean-Blaise Martin|baryton-martin]]'' and [[soprano]] ''[[Corn\u00e9lie Falcon|falcon]]''.\n\n===Historical use of voice parts===\n:''The following is only intended as a brief overview. For the main articles, see [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[countertenor]] and [[castrato]]''.\n\nThe soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a [[castrato]]. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high [[A (musical note)|A]] ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], for example, only wrote one role extending to a high [[C (musical note)|C]]), though the castrato [[Farinelli]] was alleged to possess a top [[D (musical note)|D]] (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' to such heavyweight roles as Brang\u00e4ne in Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing \"witches, bitches, and [[breeches role|britches]]\" roles. In recent years many of the \"trouser roles\" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.\n\nThe tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the ''bel canto'' era, such as [[Donizetti]]'s sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during ''[[La fille du r\u00e9giment]]''. With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as ''Heldentenor''; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's ''Turandot''. Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in ''opera seria'' in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' to the nobility of Wotan in [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Wagner's ''Ring Cycle,'']] to the conflicted King Phillip of Verdi's ''[[Don Carlos]]''. In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's ''Cos\u00ec fan tutte'' to Posa in Verdi's ''Don Carlos''; the actual designation \"baritone\" was not standard until the mid-19th century.\n\n===Famous singers===\n[[File:Senesino portrait edited.jpg|thumb|upright|The castrato [[Senesino]], c. 1720]]\nEarly performances of opera were too infrequent for singers to make a living exclusively from the style, but with the birth of commercial opera in the mid-17th century, professional performers began to emerge. The role of the male hero was usually entrusted to a [[castrato]], and by the 18th century, when Italian opera was performed throughout Europe, leading castrati who possessed extraordinary vocal virtuosity, such as [[Senesino]] and [[Farinelli]], became international stars. The career of the first major female star (or [[prima donna]]), [[Anna Renzi]], dates to the mid-17th century. In the 18th century, a number of Italian sopranos gained international renown and often engaged in fierce rivalry, as was the case with [[Faustina Bordoni]] and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]], who started a fist fight with one another during a performance of a Handel opera. The French disliked castrati, preferring their male heroes to be sung by an [[haute-contre]] (a high tenor), of which [[Joseph Legros]] (1739\u20131793) was a leading example.<ref>''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (ed.

Opera composers such as [[Domenico Sarro]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Giambattista Pergolesi]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Johann Adolf Hasse]] added new instruments to the opera orchestra and gave the instruments new roles.

As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called \"sonatina form\" ([[sonata form]] without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical.<ref name=\"Fisher 2001\"/>\n\nIn Italian opera after about 1800, the \"overture\" became known as the ''sinfonia''.<ref name=FISH>Fisher, Stephen C. 1998. \"Sinfonia\".

London: Macmillan Publishers, Inc. {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}</ref> Fisher also notes the term ''Sinfonia avanti l'opera'' (literally, the \"symphony before the opera\") was \"an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work\".<ref name=FISH/> In 19th-century opera, in some operas, the overture, ''Vorspiel'', ''Einleitung'', Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, was the portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises; a specific, rigid form was no longer required for the overture.\n\nThe role of the orchestra in accompanying the singers changed over the 19th century, as the Classical style transitioned to the Romantic era. In general, orchestras got bigger, new instruments were added, such as additional percussion instruments (e.g., bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, etc.). The [[orchestration]] of orchestra parts also developed over the 19th century. In Wagnerian operas, the forefronting of the orchestra went beyond the overture. In Wagnerian operas such as ''[[Tristan]]'', the orchestra often played the recurrent musical themes or [[leitmotif]]s, a role which gave a prominence to the orchestra which \"...elevated its status to that of a [[prima donna]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Christopher John |date=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=772 }}</ref> Wagner's operas were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity, adding more brass instruments and huge ensemble sizes: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s.\n\nAs the role of the orchestra and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did the role of leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the [[concertmaster]], would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of [[music director]] became termed the [[conducting|conductor]], and a podium was used to make it easier for all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the [[orchestra pit]] and the singers up on stage.\n\n==Language and translation issues==\nSince the days of Handel and Mozart, many composers have favored Italian as the language for the libretto of their operas. From the Bel Canto era to Verdi, composers would sometimes supervise versions of their operas in both Italian and French. Because of this, operas such as ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' or ''[[Don Carlos]]'' are today deemed canonical in both their French and Italian versions.<ref>de Acha, Rafael.

TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a [[RAI]] broadcast of an Italian opera).

The show's title has a double meaning, sounding like a weather forecast (Mostly fair skies, but then Guu) and a normal title (The Jungle was Nice, then came Guu). Many fans avoid translating the title, some simply referring to it as ''Hare Nochi Guu'' or (as the show does) ''HareGuu''. Some fans of the show simply just refer to the show as ''Guu'', being that Guu is a unique character.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n* '''Har\u00e9''' (\u30cf\u30ec) (Hale in the manga)\n: {{voiced by|[[Rikako Aikawa]]|[[Philece Sampler]]}}\n:: One of the main protagonists of the series. Har\u00e9 is a boy who grew up in a jungle village with Weda. He sports a sleeveless white shirt, red shorts, and is always barefoot. The usually patient and sweet-natured Har\u00e9 (whose name means 'fair weather') is usually troubled by Guu's joy in creating [[Civil disorder|chaos]] and he is prone to anxious rants or tantrums whenever Guu does something unnatural. This is accompanied by a sudden downpour of rain. Har\u00e9 is used by Weda to do household chores and he is teased by Guu for having an [[Oedipus complex]], exhibited in his competitive nature trying to keep Dr. Clive away from Weda. He gets worried about any other male character trying to win over Weda, such as Asio, coming to a boil in an episode where he throws himself into a competition over rights to her for a year, with Dr. Clive, Mari, and Uigher. Har\u00e9 tends to think about things too much, and Guu takes advantage of that by psychoanalyzing Har\u00e9 at every opportunity, and playfully taking advantage of Har\u00e9's neurosis. Hare is also seen reading the Hare+Guu manga. At the end of the manga, six years after Guu suddenly disappeared, Hare has become a teacher at the village school and marries Marie, who gives birth to his daughter. Upon seeing his face, the child gives him Guu's trademark smirk, which comically alarms Hare and prompts him to name her \"Guu\". In the omake, it appears the baby also has Guu's snarky attitude and generally demeaning behavior towards Hare, and she likes to act spoiled to annoy Hare.\n\n* '''Guu''' (\u30b0\u30a5) (Goo in the manga)\n: {{voiced by|[[Naoko Watanabe (voice actress)|Naoko Watanabe]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}\n:: One of the main protagonists of the series. Guu is a young girl with light pink hair, a pink dress, and is always barefoot. Guu's stomach is a world filled with buildings, hundred-legged [[cat]]s, and a nice young couple of lovers that have been trapped there for ages (but apparently don't mind their predicament). Other than Har\u00e9, no character seems to be aware of Guu's strange nature (or for that matter the bizarre circumstances surrounding everything else in the series). The weird events that occur because of her are only ever acknowledged by Har\u00e9. Everyone who is eaten by Guu, only to be spat out later (excluding Har\u00e9) dismisses what happened as \"sleeping\" (occasionally, dreaming about Guu's Stomach world). Har\u00e9 even dismisses his first time in Guu's Stomach but is quickly proved wrong. There are other strange things Guu can do which defy the laws of physics, logic, and reality which have included but are not limited to [[Teleportation|teleporting]], [[time travel]], reality warping, superhuman strength, elongating her body parts, breathing underwater, causing people to switch bodies, [[Telepathy|mind reading]], causing disco music to play suddenly, switching her face (from a cute face to a completely plain face), transforming into a giant [[kaiju]] monster version of herself, and inciting mental breakdowns in Har\u00e9, though the latter is more of a talent than an actual power. She apparently has more than one stomach and cares enough about the people and creatures she swallows to keep dangerous things away from the area she keeps her 'guests'. Despite all this, Guu actually cares for some of Hare's personal problems, and often gives him advice with profound sayings- a lot of her powers are used to make Hare learn a lesson. At the end of the manga, Guu leads Hare to her birthplace in a dream (and refuses to let him go further, saying it would be a one-way trip for him), and it's strongly implied that Guu's birthplace is somewhere between life and death, and that she's some kind of physical god. Guu disappears the next morning, releasing the people in her stomach (who turn up in a TV show about missing people suddenly reappear) and erasing everybody's memories of her, except Hare's. Six years later, Hare spots Guu's smirk on his newborn daughter's face, and realizes she might be a reincarnation of Guu.\n\n* '''Adult Guu (Big Guu in the manga)'''\n:: A resident living inside Guu who is separate from Guu and can take over whenever she feels like it, she's a grown-up version of Guu and is very beautiful. Fortunately for Guu and the rest of the residents inside her stomach, she cares about them and their wants and desires, going so far as to steal Ame from Hare. She's also the one responsible for ripping off the village elder's chest hair, making him permanently traumatized of Guu. She also appeared one time to act as the school doctor after Clive tried unsuccessfully to give Guu a physical, causing Guu to tie-up Clive. Big Guu becomes a frequent visitor to the outside world when they are all in the city.\n\n* '''Weda (\u30a6\u30a7\u30c0)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Kaoru Morota]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}\n:: Weda is Har\u00e9's mother. She is carefree and inclined to [[binge drinking]]. Because of her laziness, Har\u00e9 looks after her and does most of the \"housewifely\" things. She left life in a rich home at the age of 14 when her father disowned her for becoming pregnant and refusing to divulge the father's name (out of fear that her father would destroy Clive's life). Upon living in a jungle village, Weda started sporting a [[leopard]]-printed fur bikini and is always barefoot. She raised Hare in the jungle by herself which, due to her chronic irresponsibility, is quite difficult to fathom. She may have survived on the fact that she's a brilliant [[Hunting|hunter]] (her hunting activity is one of a few times when Weda wears sneakers) and is second only to the Elder. Despite her flakiness, Weda does love her son very much and sometimes tries to give him advice and cook lunches for him. Unfortunately, she is a terrible cook and usually injures herself badly when she tries to cook anything but shrimp au gratin. She is extremely maternal despite her sometime immaturity, since she enjoys mothering Marie and Guu, is delighted to discover her second pregnancy, and tells Hare that if he vanished she would follow him anywhere. Weda's relationship with Dr. Clive is an odd one, since she seems to be very fond of him and bears him no ill will, but inexplicably seems to regard any romantic overtures as jokes. She seems to be unaware that Asio and Uighur are in love with her, and she regards the Stupid Couple with contempt and irritation. In the OAVs, she becomes pregnant with her second baby with Clive, and later marries Clive. After the marriage, she appears much less tolerant of Clive's skirt-chasing.\n\n* '''Ame'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuri Shiratori]]}}\n:: Hare's baby brother who was born in the OVA ''Har\u00e9+Guu Deluxe'', but has barely any significance in the story. His name comes from \"Megumi no Ame\" (Rain of Blessing), When Har\u00e9 goes back in time and met up with the past Weda, he claimed that his name was Ame rather than Har\u00e9. When he got back in the present, Weda remembered the boy from the past while naming her 2nd child.\n\n* '''Dr. Clive (\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30f4 ''Kuraivu'')'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Mitsuaki Madono]]|[[Liam O'Brien]]}}\n:: The [[Physician|doctor]] of the school, Dr. Clive is apathetic towards everyone in the jungle, unless they happen to be female. He came in from the city shortly after the series began, and had a 'relationship' with Weda while she was 14 years old, which, as Weda admits, resulted in Har\u00e9's birth. The anime and manga state that Dr. Clive is Har\u00e9's biological father but despite this, he engages in violent arguments with Har\u00e9 (most of the time the center of it being Weda). Highly perverted, he uses every opportunity to \"reignite his old relationship\" with Weda, which usually end in failures until he chases after Weda when she leaves for the city. When Weda later becomes pregnant with their second child, this prompts the doctor to propose marriage at last. He has white hair when the series begins, but eventually Hare dyes it black so Dama will stop stalking him. In the anime, it is shown that Dr. Clive was an abused child with a highly perverted mom that hated him which may explain his [[promiscuity]] and his [[antipathy]] towards young boys. He is fond of Marie in a paternal manner, even wearing clothes she makes for him and telling her that her food is delicious. His body language and high-strung nature (as well as his awareness of Guu's weirdness) are very similar to Hare's.\n\n===Jungle villagers===\n* '''Pokute (\u30dd\u30af\u30c6)'''\n:: The Pokute are creatures abundant in the jungle that are often seen in people's houses. They look like armless [[rabbit]]s with human faces. While it is said that Pokute were supposedly sent from the heavens as protectors, the villagers use them as a food source. No matter where they go in the world, the characters of this anime will always find pokute.\n\n* '''Marie (\u30de\u30ea\u30a3)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuki Matsuoka]]|[[Sandy Fox]]}}\n:: A girl who is a student of the school that Har\u00e9 and Guu attend and Reiji-sensei's younger sister. Mari is friendly towards Har\u00e9 (Later turning into a crush), and imagines herself as a tragic, [[sh\u014djo]] [[manga]]-esque character. She really loves Weda because she never had the chance to have a mother, and pictures Dr. Clive (father figure) as a part of her family as well.  She gets extremely jealous of Hare whenever he goes to the city, always imagining Hare hooking up with various women. Her love for Hare has become very aggressive. At the end of the series, she marries Hare.\n\n* '''Reiji-sensei/Lazy-Sensei (\u30ec\u30b8\u30a3) (Leiji)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Kazuhiko Inoue]]|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n:: Reiji is the [[teacher]] at the school that Har\u00e9 and Guu attend and is Marie's older brother. He's taken care of Marie since she was a child after their parents died, and once was very close to Weda when she first came to the Jungle with a newborn Hare. However, he was soon put off by her after taking care of her when she was drunk. He likes to stay up all night watching anime, so he falls asleep during the day. The school does not have many students so they all are in Reiji's class. Unfortunately Reiji would much rather rest than teach. In fact, the only \"lesson\" he seems to want to teach is \"mid-morning [[siesta]]s.\" Later in the manga, Rebecca is captured by her pokute family and Lazy rescues her, convincing the pokutes that Lazy is the right love for her, despite his trying to convince them otherwise, and in a sudden twist, becomes the pokute's leader (a position usually reserved for pokutes only).\n\n* '''Chourou/Village Elder (\u30dc\u30fc\u30a2)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]]|[[Michael McConnohie]]}}\n:: Chourou is an old man with a ''lot'' of chest hair, which he feels is a sign of his strength and manliness. Adult Guu steals it and this is used as a plot device. (As a result of this he has taken to calling her \"Lord Guu\" and keeping a safe distance.) As the Village [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]], he leads the pokute (recurring and common creatures in the jungle) hunts, and has dozens of recipes in which pokutes are used. He falls in love with a cat that looks almost like him which he ends up giving to Hare (much to Hare's chagrin) and even disappears for a while when his chest hair growth goes out of control. By the end, he's merely a furball with a head. His chest hair later becomes a warp zone between his hair and a fuzzball in a closet in the city, in which Hare uses.\n\n* '''Toposte (\u30c8\u30dd\u30b9\u30c6)'''\n: {{voiced by|Konomi Maeda|[[David Neil Black]]}}\n:: Toposte is the grandchild of Chourou and like him, does not wear a shirt. He initially does not have chest hair like his grandfather, though he fears it is genetic. He attends at the school. When he does ends up growing chest hair, he accepts it happily after learning that the chest hair is how Chourou got girls attracted to him back when he was young. In the city, he is mind controlled by his chest hair and takes over his new class, becoming an idol because of his chest hair. But he is saved by Hare and Guu when the chest hair is removed. When everyone returns to the jungle he is still being sought out by Yumi-sensei, but he eventually returns her feelings.\n\n* '''Rebecca (\u30ec\u30d9\u30c3\u30ab)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Takako Nakamura]]|[[Melissa Fahn]]}}\n:: Rebecca is Weda's drinking friend who was raised by Pokutes that take care of her, even after she started living in the village. They have been revealed as the source of her \"magically cleaning\" house (of which she has no knowledge). She is used as a female stock character, filling out various roles as Weda's friend. Later, her Pokute family tries to take her away. Thanks to Hare, Guu, and Lazy-Sensei, she is saved from the Pokutes.\n\n* '''Uigher/Wiggle (\u30a6\u30a4\u30b0\u30eb)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Iwanaga]]|[[Dave Wittenberg]]}}\n:: A boy who is one of the older students. The lack of influence he has on the storyline is occasionally used as a gag. He is madly in love with Weda, but never gets to prove his love, usually resulting in a comedic attempt to hang himself. Even after Weda marries Clive, he still fantasizes and pursues Weda. After they all decide to return from the jungle, he ends up staying in the city and six years later, became an assistant professor at the university.\n\n* '''Gupta (\u30b0\u30d7\u30bf)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[S\u014dichir\u014d Hoshi]]|[[Richard Cansino]]}}\n:: A boy who is another upperclassman in the school. He is fairly impulsive but not particularly mature. Starts off with long blonde hair, gets it cut short and blackened when Dama first appears, then it grows back out to a brown color later. In the manga, it frequently shown that he is in love with Ravenna. In the manga, Guu swaps everyone's genders to teach Hare a lesson and later turns everyone back to normal, but makes no change to Gupta's gender, making everyone (except Hare) believe that Gupta is a girl since birth. He spends the rest of the series gender-swapped and continues to pursue his interest in Lavenna (who has become a boy), and their relationship works out so much better that Hare is convinced he would rather let them stay that way. At the end of the series when Guu disappears, he gets his original gender back, and becomes a [[teacher]] in the village school six years later.\n\n* '''Waji (\u30ef\u30b8)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Yuri Lowenthal]]}}\n:: An obnoxious student who always combines his speech with laughter, and tries to encourage Guu to do the same, to questionable results. He is sometimes found weeping in the forest for unknown reasons. Some theorize it is because his father beats him. At the end of the series, he finds work in the city.\n\n* '''Ravenna (\u30e9\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30ca)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuri Shiratori]]|[[Karen Strassman]]}}\n:: A girl who is the oldest female student in the school. She is a bit air-headed and unsure of herself. Completely lost in her own world as she fails to pay attention or care about events going on around her when she runs errands for her mom. She is in a relationship with Gupta, but when he went to the city and Guu made him a woman, it is still unsure whether or not Guu made her a man so the relationship stays the same. At the end of the series, she becomes a [[Nursing|nurse]].\n\n* '''R\u0101ya (\u30e9\u30fc\u30e4)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Masayo Kurata]]|[[Kari Wahlgren|Shawna Smith]]}}\n:: A reticent girl. Along with Sagin, she seems to be part of a running gag in the series as both of them never talk or are always interrupted when they are about to (Like when Har\u00e9 asks for an answer from everyone, and the camera pans over everyone, skipping past Sagin and R\u0101ya when he looked at them). She only speaks two phrases in the entire course of the anime series and OVAs- \"The Crotch\" and \"Briefs\".\n\n* '''Chet and Addie'''\n: Chet {{voiced by|[[Takahiro Yoshimizu]]|[[Johnny Yong Bosch]]}}\n: Addie {{voiced by|[[Emi Uwagawa]]|[[Michelle Ruff]]}}\n:: Dubbed the \"stupid couple\" by the village, they are a couple that have been madly in love with each other for the past few years. Chet claims to have come from [[England]] on a research trip only to stay in the jungle when he laid eyes on Addie. A running joke later in the series is that whenever Chet and Addie are together on screen, they're usually doing something that needs to be blurred out. The true story behind them is that Chet, ever since he was a child, wanted to go to the jungle. He got good grades in school and excelled all for the sake of being able to go there. When he got there, he was given a [[guide]] so he could find his way around. The guide was Addie. After touring around for a bit, she got very mad at him for hitting on her so much and she yelled at him and said she doesn't like him that way. But later to be nice, Chet goes to find his way in the jungle without help, where he gets sick and lost. Addie goes to find him and does, where seeing how far he would go for her happiness, she returned his feelings. While Hare and friends are in the city, Guu sometimes pulls the couple out of nowhere when they are needed. It is unsure whether or not this is because she currently holds them in her stomach.\n\n* '''Yumi-sensei'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Junko Minagawa]]|[[Kate Higgins]]}}\n:: A [[substitute teacher]] that took over for Lazy while he was sick. Ironic since she absolutely hates children and has never had a boyfriend. Extremely short fuse. She exhibited a 1-way attraction to Hare after Hare was so nice and understanding towards her plight, and eventually breaks it off in the end to be with Toposte. In the end, her and Toposte end up becoming a couple.\n\n* '''Dama'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Chie K\u014djiro]]|[[Jessica Gee]]}}\n:: A [[hairdresser]] with an afro-style hair from a nearby village that became obsessed with her long-lost white-haired husband. Unfortunately, she mistakes Dr. Clive for her dead husband and even spins an elaborate fantasy life explaining why he doesn't know her. After spending most of the series stalking Clive, she is eventually told to live for new love and starts training her body to be in top shape. Dama later meets, fights, and marries the bank robber only to get seduced by an assassin later. After realizing she was only being used by the assassin, she resumes her happily married life with the bank robber. She is found by Hare in Guu's stomach on their most recent trip to the city. Dama's sister is Tama, whom she used to get along with but now they fight. The two merged once while fighting and Hare and Guu had to stop her. She was able to separate from the merged self and stop her sister. They now get along once again and work as a pair of singer and pianist at the bar her husband runs. Dama has a habit of acting and thinking (her thoughts are often narrated to Hare as a common break-the-fourth-wall comedy trick) very girlishly (usually seductively), which is strongly inappropriate for her old age and often exasperates Hare.\n\n* '''Tama'''\n:: Dama's twin sister who looks exactly like Dama, but with white skin. The two were close as children. But as they grew, Dama became more popular especially with their teacher as the two were teenagers. Tama and Dama were eaten by Guu and spent some time within her stomach in the RPG simulated world she created. In one story in the manga, the two sisters meet up, argue, and merge into a giant Dama/Tama monster that fights Hare, Guu, and the Hare and Guu from a short time in the future. She plays piano as her sister sings in the bar. Like her sister, Tama also exhibits very inappropriately (to Hare, sickeningly) girlish behaviors (and it's shown she thinks like one, as well), and harbors feelings for her brother-in-law, although her feelings is resolved after a talk with her sister. Hare eventually finds himself unable to stand their presences and soon quits his part-time job at their bar.\n\n===Guu's Stomach World inhabitants===\n* '''Tomoyo'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Ky\u014dko Hikami]]|[[Kari Wahlgren|Shawna Smith]]}}\n:: One of three people living inside Guu's stomach world. A kind and friendly office lady, she does not seem to mind living inside of Guu. Seiichi and she are good friends and are even possibly a couple. She takes care of Har\u00e9's pet bird Hee after Guu eats him.\n\n* '''Seiichi'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Akira Ishida]]|[[Steve Staley]]}}\n:: One of three people living inside Guu's stomach world. Like Tomoyo, he is a friendly high school boy who doesn't seem to mind living inside of Guu. He is good friends with Tomoyo and is even possibly her boyfriend.\n\n* '''Hiroko Yamada/\"Angry Yamada\"'''\n: {{voiced by|{{illm|Ayumi Furuyama|ja|\u53e4\u5c71\u3042\u3086\u307f}}|[[Julie Ann Taylor]]}}\n:: One of three people living inside Guu's stomach world who first appears in episode 8 of the TV series. She is a 22-year-old who attempted suicide by throwing herself into the ocean and was rescued by Guu, who swallowed her while fishing (and while bringing in a massive haul of various sea life, she technically didn't catch any fish). Unlike Seiichi and Tomoyo, Hiroko is mentally unstable and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]], making her dangerous and unpredictable. In fact, she tried to kill herself in an elaborate plot to take revenge on her cheating husband by dying, going through hell, and coming back as an evil spirit to haunt him for the rest of his life. She now spends most of her time in Guu's stomach world drinking alone on a hill, where most of the other inhabitants have now learned to avoid. Became fast-friends with Yumi-sensei when Guu had swallowed Yumi for a short time.\n\n===City inhabitants===\n* '''Asio (\u30a2\u30b7\u30aa)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu]]|[[Sam Riegel]]}}\n:: A servant at Weda's parent's estate, he has very scary eyes (though it wasn't always the case, was stated to have beautiful eyes when he was younger). Loves Weda, but she thinks of him as a brother. He is often the one who goes to pick up Weda after nights where she had been drinking specifically heavily (revealed to be quite frequent due to Weda's habits). Often coming up with ideas that seem not to be possible, Har\u00e9 is put off by him from their first meeting.\n\n* '''Bell (\u30d9\u30eb)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Mari Yok\u014d]]|[[Melodee Spevack]]}}\n:: Another servant, she is prone to gigantic nosebleeds when thinking of Weda as a child (this implies she has a perverted obsession with Weda). She and Asio have often been used to fill in the story of Weda's past. Though Weda is quite happy the two of them returned, their odd tendencies often frighten Har\u00e9, who is quite easily unbalanced by their (and Guu's) acts that seem to defy the laws of physics. She hates Clive with a passion, which works to Hare's advantage when he tries to keep Clive from wooing his mother. In the manga, Bell is a heterosexual drag queen. His clothes are chosen to draw attention away from his height, broad shoulders, & flat chest. When Weda was younger, he had shorter hair & dressed like a normal man.\n\n* '''Sagin (\u30b5\u30ae\u30f3)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Shizuka Ishikawa]]|[[Tony Oliver]]}}\n:: A reticent boy. Along with R\u0101ya, he seems to be part of a running gag in the series as both of them never talk, or are always interrupted when they are about to (Like having a video interview with everyone, where when their turn came the camera switched to the next person immediately when they open their mouths).\n\n* '''Robert'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Sh\u014dtar\u014d Morikubo]]|[[Keith Silverstein]]}}\n:: Weda's trigger-happy [[bodyguard]] after she, Hare, and Guu go to the city. After graduating high school, he arrived in the city and was beat up one night, and was later found by Bel. It's because of her that he got his job. At first he doesn't get along well with Weda, saying that she wasn't worthy of Bel's love, but that changes after they foil a bank robbery. He may or may not have feelings for Bel (as episode 23 implies). In addition to being trigger-happy, he is a paranoid lunatic and once tried to kill a boy who bullied Hare causing him to ironically protect his own abuser from Robert. After Guu switched everyone's genders, it took her a while to change him back.\n\n* '''Bank Robber Guy'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]|[[Patrick Seitz]]}}\n:: A complete video game nerd who gets along with Hare due to their mutual love of video games. They'd be friends if he wasn't constantly taking Hare as a hostage. He eventually marries Dama after being bested by her in battle. He now runs a bar in the jungle.\n\n* '''Rita'''\n: {{voiced by|Naoko Takano}}\n:: A self-centered girl around Hare's age that attends school in the city, who only cares about herself, and pleases others to not make enemies so she can get ahead in life. Hare ends up becoming her first true friend. She seems to eventually grow a serious love for Hare.\n\n* '''Johan'''\n:: A student that went to school with Har\u00e9 and Guu in the city. He is secretly in love with Rita and usually beats up Hare for being so close to her. At first he is fat but when the group returns to the city later he lost a lot of weight. By the time Hare and everyone leaves the city, he has accepted Rita and Hare's \"love.\"\n\n* '''Bartholomew'''\n:: Weda's older brother whom she believes to have sent hitmen to kill her in order to take her out of the family will. Later, it's revealed that the hitmen were sent by Bartholomew's son Alva, who was upset with his grandfather's will that left Weda a big portion of the family fortune, while Bartholomew is shown to be as loving as Weda remembers him. Bartholomew is actually happy that his father has forgiven Weda and written her into the family's will.\n\n* '''Donna'''\n:: Weda's older sister whom Weda believes to conspire with Bartholomew to send hitmen after her and Hare. The hitmen, however, were actually sent by Donna's nephew Alva, while Donna herself is happy with Weda's return to the family.\n\n* '''Quincy Porter (QP)/Pretty'''\n:: A very large, muscular bald man who everyone met on an island when their plane crashed on their way to the city. His name is meant to be very ironic. He first protected the gang when they were trapped on the island but he sometimes appears in the city when Guu pulls him out of nowhere. He and Robert have become rivals but later became friends. QP has a wife named Sera, with whom he has two daughters. He has five younger brothers and sisters: Sam, Simon, Sandora, and Sean, Samuel. They all look too alike that annoys Har\u00e9. He is currently a woman because of Guu and he/she works as a maid for Hare's grandmother's mansion. He's likely changed back after Guu disappears.\n\n* '''IT 1'''\n:: A black-haired man who shows no emotion. He is actually a human form of a [[cockroach]], changed into human form by Guu to get Hare to stop being afraid of bugs.\n\n* '''IT 2'''\n:: The sister of the black-haired man. Neither show any emotion or compassion for anything, except for their home.\n\n* '''Alex'''\n:: The family's [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] who was bribed by Alva to crash Weda's plane and kill everyone. However, due to Alex's absent-mindedness, he forgets to plan his own escape route from said crashed plane, and has to befriends the Jungle clients to work their way to the main family (it's hinted that Alex earns his share by acting in gay porn movies). He is very childish and is never serious. He is sometimes referred to as a yankee because of the way he stands. Despite his carefree attitude, Alex is an unfortunate man who divorced thrice, was stripped from the right to see his two children. The two ex-wives sabotaged his last marriage by accusing him being gay.\n\n* '''Shirley'''\n:: Alex's friend who helped him with his assassination attempt. She is very shy and only ever opens up when it comes to Alex. It was because of her that Robert decided not to shoot the two when captured.\n\n* '''Alva'''\n:: Bartholomew's son and Hare's cousin, and the true mastermind behind the assassination plots aimed at Weda since he loved his father and was upset to see Bartholomew's share in the will being reduced due to Weda's presence. He ends up going with everyone back to the jungle. He is usually getting lost, causing him to be returned to home by a rather over-sized Pokute. At the end of the series, he succeeds his father's business and sends Hare gifts when his daughter is born.\n\n* '''Angela'''\n:: Alva's mother and a famous [[Actor|actress]]. However, he denies that he has one. The reason for this is clear when Angela first appears in Hare's village after Alva goes there and claims she would like him back with her to help her rehearse for a new role, and denies that she ever care for her son at all. However, a conversation with Weda has revealed that Angela is actually a [[tsundere]] and loves her son very much, despite always acting the opposite. She later returns to check on Alva and hires Hare as her guide, but stays in disguise through much of the visit as she doesn't want people to think she's there for her son. She has an assistant who is frequently seen by her side, and usually interprets her true feelings to people whenever her tsundere side makes her unable to say it.\n\n* '''Margaret'''\n:: Robert's acquaintance, the de facto leader of a famous group of female assassins. She's in charge of the intelligence, and uses her hacking ability to aid her comrades during missions. It's also shown that she has a photographic memory, and is able to recite the number of pi for as long as three to four days. Robert and Hare hires her group to rescue Robert's friend from an enemy assassination group. Afterwards, Margaret and her friends are revealed to have become romantically interested in Hare.\n\n* '''Dandelion'''\n:: An assassin of Margaret's group. She has the best fighting ability among them, and is deadly with knives.\n\n* '''Dahlia'''\n:: An assassin of Margaret's group. She is the physically strongest, and is able to burst a volleyball with her bare hand. She specializes in close-range combat.\n\n* '''Chamomile'''\n:: An assassin of Margaret's group, she appears to be still in school. She's a very proficient sniper.\n\n* '''Cherry'''\n:: An assassin of Margaret's group, she appears to be in kindergarten. She has vast chemical knowledge, and is good at making bombs and chemicals.\n\n* '''Lloyd'''\n:: One of Wiggle's roommates in college. Being the top grader of his year, grandson of the college's principal, heir of a doctor family-line, he is very snobby and is always taking his girlfriend out and buying her expensive gifts.\n\n* '''Sarah'''\n:: Another one of Wiggle's roommates. She is of the typical snobby teen girl type.\n\n* '''Ann'''\n:: Another one of Wiggle's roommates. She seems peppy and excited all the time, but she is actually very sad. She once kidnapped Hare in an attempt to gain a large sum of money from his grandmother to pay for her family's debt. But she is stopped and thanks to Hare is still excepted by everyone.\n\n* '''Yuuki'''\n:: Wiggle's last roommate. He is very quiet but nice. People usually avoid him though because he has a scary face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List of Hare+Guu characters}}\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Hare+Guu]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Har\u00e9+Guu'' characters}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=July 2012}}\n{{context|date=August 2012}}\n{{fiction trivia|date=August 2012}}\n}}\nThis page contains a list of characters from the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Har\u00e9+Guu]]''\n\n==Description==\nMany characters in the series have names relating to [[weather]] (including, most obviously 'We-da'). The show's title has a double meaning, sounding like a weather forecast (Mostly fair skies, but then Guu) and a normal title (The Jungle was Nice, then came Guu). Many fans avoid translating the title, some simply referring to it as ''Hare Nochi Guu'' or (as the show does) ''HareGuu''. Some fans of the show simply just refer to the show as ''Guu'', being that Guu is a unique character.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n* '''Har\u00e9''' (\u30cf\u30ec) (Hale in the manga)\n: {{voiced by|[[Rikako Aikawa]]|[[Philece Sampler]]}}\n:: One of the main protagonists of the series. Har\u00e9 is a boy who grew up in a jungle village with Weda. He sports a sleeveless white shirt, red shorts, and is always barefoot. The usually patient and sweet-natured Har\u00e9 (whose name means 'fair weather') is usually troubled by Guu's joy in creating [[Civil disorder|chaos]] and he is prone to anxious rants or tantrums whenever Guu does something unnatural. This is accompanied by a sudden downpour of rain. Har\u00e9 is used by Weda to do household chores and he is teased by Guu for having an [[Oedipus complex]], exhibited in his competitive nature trying to keep Dr. Clive away from Weda. He gets worried about any other male character trying to win over Weda, such as Asio, coming to a boil in an episode where he throws himself into a competition over rights to her for a year, with Dr. Clive, Mari, and Uigher. Har\u00e9 tends to think about things too much, and Guu takes advantage of that by psychoanalyzing Har\u00e9 at every opportunity, and playfully taking advantage of Har\u00e9's neurosis. Hare is also seen reading the Hare+Guu manga. At the end of the manga, six years after Guu suddenly disappeared, Hare has become a teacher at the village school and marries Marie, who gives birth to his daughter. Upon seeing his face, the child gives him Guu's trademark smirk, which comically alarms Hare and prompts him to name her \"Guu\". In the omake, it appears the baby also has Guu's snarky attitude and generally demeaning behavior towards Hare, and she likes to act spoiled to annoy Hare.\n\n* '''Guu''' (\u30b0\u30a5) (Goo in the manga)\n: {{voiced by|[[Naoko Watanabe (voice actress)|Naoko Watanabe]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}\n:: One of the main protagonists of the series. Guu is a young girl with light pink hair, a pink dress, and is always barefoot. Guu's stomach is a world filled with buildings, hundred-legged [[cat]]s, and a nice young couple of lovers that have been trapped there for ages (but apparently don't mind their predicament). Other than Har\u00e9, no character seems to be aware of Guu's strange nature (or for that matter the bizarre circumstances surrounding everything else in the series). The weird events that occur because of her are only ever acknowledged by Har\u00e9. Everyone who is eaten by Guu, only to be spat out later (excluding Har\u00e9) dismisses what happened as \"sleeping\" (occasionally, dreaming about Guu's Stomach world). Har\u00e9 even dismisses his first time in Guu's Stomach but is quickly proved wrong. There are other strange things Guu can do which defy the laws of physics, logic, and reality which have included but are not limited to [[Teleportation|teleporting]], [[time travel]], reality warping, superhuman strength, elongating her body parts, breathing underwater, causing people to switch bodies, [[Telepathy|mind reading]], causing disco music to play suddenly, switching her face (from a cute face to a completely plain face), transforming into a giant [[kaiju]] monster version of herself, and inciting mental breakdowns in Har\u00e9, though the latter is more of a talent than an actual power. She apparently has more than one stomach and cares enough about the people and creatures she swallows to keep dangerous things away from the area she keeps her 'guests'. Despite all this, Guu actually cares for some of Hare's personal problems, and often gives him advice with profound sayings- a lot of her powers are used to make Hare learn a lesson. At the end of the manga, Guu leads Hare to her birthplace in a dream (and refuses to let him go further, saying it would be a one-way trip for him), and it's strongly implied that Guu's birthplace is somewhere between life and death, and that she's some kind of physical god. Guu disappears the next morning, releasing the people in her stomach (who turn up in a TV show about missing people suddenly reappear) and erasing everybody's memories of her, except Hare's. Six years later, Hare spots Guu's smirk on his newborn daughter's face, and realizes she might be a reincarnation of Guu.\n\n* '''Adult Guu (Big Guu in the manga)'''\n:: A resident living inside Guu who is separate from Guu and can take over whenever she feels like it, she's a grown-up version of Guu and is very beautiful. Fortunately for Guu and the rest of the residents inside her stomach, she cares about them and their wants and desires, going so far as to steal Ame from Hare. She's also the one responsible for ripping off the village elder's chest hair, making him permanently traumatized of Guu. She also appeared one time to act as the school doctor after Clive tried unsuccessfully to give Guu a physical, causing Guu to tie-up Clive. Big Guu becomes a frequent visitor to the outside world when they are all in the city.\n\n* '''Weda (\u30a6\u30a7\u30c0)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Kaoru Morota]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}\n:: Weda is Har\u00e9's mother. She is carefree and inclined to [[binge drinking]]. Because of her laziness, Har\u00e9 looks after her and does most of the \"housewifely\" things. She left life in a rich home at the age of 14 when her father disowned her for becoming pregnant and refusing to divulge the father's name (out of fear that her father would destroy Clive's life). Upon living in a jungle village, Weda started sporting a [[leopard]]-printed fur bikini and is always barefoot. She raised Hare in the jungle by herself which, due to her chronic irresponsibility, is quite difficult to fathom. She may have survived on the fact that she's a brilliant [[Hunting|hunter]] (her hunting activity is one of a few times when Weda wears sneakers) and is second only to the Elder. Despite her flakiness, Weda does love her son very much and sometimes tries to give him advice and cook lunches for him. Unfortunately, she is a terrible cook and usually injures herself badly when she tries to cook anything but shrimp au gratin. She is extremely maternal despite her sometime immaturity, since she enjoys mothering Marie and Guu, is delighted to discover her second pregnancy, and tells Hare that if he vanished she would follow him anywhere. Weda's relationship with Dr. Clive is an odd one, since she seems to be very fond of him and bears him no ill will, but inexplicably seems to regard any romantic overtures as jokes. She seems to be unaware that Asio and Uighur are in love with her, and she regards the Stupid Couple with contempt and irritation. In the OAVs, she becomes pregnant with her second baby with Clive, and later marries Clive. After the marriage, she appears much less tolerant of Clive's skirt-chasing.\n\n* '''Ame'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuri Shiratori]]}}\n:: Hare's baby brother who was born in the OVA ''Har\u00e9+Guu Deluxe'', but has barely any significance in the story. His name comes from \"Megumi no Ame\" (Rain of Blessing), When Har\u00e9 goes back in time and met up with the past Weda, he claimed that his name was Ame rather than Har\u00e9. When he got back in the present, Weda remembered the boy from the past while naming her 2nd child.\n\n* '''Dr. Clive (\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30f4 ''Kuraivu'')'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Mitsuaki Madono]]|[[Liam O'Brien]]}}\n:: The [[Physician|doctor]] of the school, Dr. Clive is apathetic towards everyone in the jungle, unless they happen to be female. He came in from the city shortly after the series began, and had a 'relationship' with Weda while she was 14 years old, which, as Weda admits, resulted in Har\u00e9's birth. The anime and manga state that Dr. Clive is Har\u00e9's biological father but despite this, he engages in violent arguments with Har\u00e9 (most of the time the center of it being Weda). Highly perverted, he uses every opportunity to \"reignite his old relationship\" with Weda, which usually end in failures until he chases after Weda when she leaves for the city. When Weda later becomes pregnant with their second child, this prompts the doctor to propose marriage at last. He has white hair when the series begins, but eventually Hare dyes it black so Dama will stop stalking him. In the anime, it is shown that Dr. Clive was an abused child with a highly perverted mom that hated him which may explain his [[promiscuity]] and his [[antipathy]] towards young boys. He is fond of Marie in a paternal manner, even wearing clothes she makes for him and telling her that her food is delicious. His body language and high-strung nature (as well as his awareness of Guu's weirdness) are very similar to Hare's.\n\n===Jungle villagers===\n* '''Pokute (\u30dd\u30af\u30c6)'''\n:: The Pokute are creatures abundant in the jungle that are often seen in people's houses. They look like armless [[rabbit]]s with human faces. While it is said that Pokute were supposedly sent from the heavens as protectors, the villagers use them as a food source. No matter where they go in the world, the characters of this anime will always find pokute.\n\n* '''Marie (\u30de\u30ea\u30a3)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuki Matsuoka]]|[[Sandy Fox]]}}\n:: A girl who is a student of the school that Har\u00e9 and Guu attend and Reiji-sensei's younger sister. Mari is friendly towards Har\u00e9 (Later turning into a crush), and imagines herself as a tragic, [[sh\u014djo]] [[manga]]-esque character. She really loves Weda because she never had the chance to have a mother, and pictures Dr. Clive (father figure) as a part of her family as well.  She gets extremely jealous of Hare whenever he goes to the city, always imagining Hare hooking up with various women. Her love for Hare has become very aggressive. At the end of the series, she marries Hare.\n\n* '''Reiji-sensei/Lazy-Sensei (\u30ec\u30b8\u30a3) (Leiji)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Kazuhiko Inoue]]|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n:: Reiji is the [[teacher]] at the school that Har\u00e9 and Guu attend and is Marie's older brother. He's taken care of Marie since she was a child after their parents died, and once was very close to Weda when she first came to the Jungle with a newborn Hare. However, he was soon put off by her after taking care of her when she was drunk. He likes to stay up all night watching anime, so he falls asleep during the day. The school does not have many students so they all are in Reiji's class. Unfortunately Reiji would much rather rest than teach. In fact, the only \"lesson\" he seems to want to teach is \"mid-morning [[siesta]]s.\" Later in the manga, Rebecca is captured by her pokute family and Lazy rescues her, convincing the pokutes that Lazy is the right love for her, despite his trying to convince them otherwise, and in a sudden twist, becomes the pokute's leader (a position usually reserved for pokutes only).\n\n* '''Chourou/Village Elder (\u30dc\u30fc\u30a2)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]]|[[Michael McConnohie]]}}\n:: Chourou is an old man with a ''lot'' of chest hair, which he feels is a sign of his strength and manliness. Adult Guu steals it and this is used as a plot device. (As a result of this he has taken to calling her \"Lord Guu\" and keeping a safe distance.) As the Village [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]], he leads the pokute (recurring and common creatures in the jungle) hunts, and has dozens of recipes in which pokutes are used. He falls in love with a cat that looks almost like him which he ends up giving to Hare (much to Hare's chagrin) and even disappears for a while when his chest hair growth goes out of control. By the end, he's merely a furball with a head. His chest hair later becomes a warp zone between his hair and a fuzzball in a closet in the city, in which Hare uses.\n\n* '''Toposte (\u30c8\u30dd\u30b9\u30c6)'''\n: {{voiced by|Konomi Maeda|[[David Neil Black]]}}\n:: Toposte is the grandchild of Chourou and like him, does not wear a shirt. He initially does not have chest hair like his grandfather, though he fears it is genetic. He attends at the school. When he does ends up growing chest hair, he accepts it happily after learning that the chest hair is how Chourou got girls attracted to him back when he was young. In the city, he is mind controlled by his chest hair and takes over his new class, becoming an idol because of his chest hair. But he is saved by Hare and Guu when the chest hair is removed. When everyone returns to the jungle he is still being sought out by Yumi-sensei, but he eventually returns her feelings.\n\n* '''Rebecca (\u30ec\u30d9\u30c3\u30ab)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Takako Nakamura]]|[[Melissa Fahn]]}}\n:: Rebecca is Weda's drinking friend who was raised by Pokutes that take care of her, even after she started living in the village. They have been revealed as the source of her \"magically cleaning\" house (of which she has no knowledge). She is used as a female stock character, filling out various roles as Weda's friend. Later, her Pokute family tries to take her away. Thanks to Hare, Guu, and Lazy-Sensei, she is saved from the Pokutes.\n\n* '''Uigher/Wiggle (\u30a6\u30a4\u30b0\u30eb)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Iwanaga]]|[[Dave Wittenberg]]}}\n:: A boy who is one of the older students. The lack of influence he has on the storyline is occasionally used as a gag. He is madly in love with Weda, but never gets to prove his love, usually resulting in a comedic attempt to hang himself. Even after Weda gets married to Clive, he still fantasizes and pursues Weda. After they all decide to return from the jungle, he ends up staying in the city and six years later, became an assistant professor at the university.\n\n* '''Gupta (\u30b0\u30d7\u30bf)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[S\u014dichir\u014d Hoshi]]|[[Richard Cansino]]}}\n:: A boy who is another upperclassman in the school. He is fairly impulsive but not particularly mature. Starts off with long blonde hair, gets it cut short and blackened when Dama first appears, then it grows back out to a brown color later. In the manga, it frequently shown that he is in love with Ravenna. In the manga, Guu swaps everyone's genders to teach Hare a lesson and later turns everyone back to normal, but makes no change to Gupta's gender, making everyone (except Hare) believe that Gupta is a girl since birth. He spends the rest of the series genderswapped and continues to pursue his interest in Lavenna (who has become a boy), and their relationship works out so much better that Hare is convinced he would rather let them stay that way. At the end of the series when Guu disappears, he gets his original gender back, and becomes a [[teacher]] in the village school six years later.\n\n* '''Waji (\u30ef\u30b8)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Yuri Lowenthal]]}}\n:: An obnoxious student who always combines his speech with laughter, and tries to encourage Guu to do the same, to questionable results. He is sometimes found weeping in the forest for unknown reasons. Some theorize it is because his father beats him. At the end of the series, he finds work in the city.\n\n* '''Ravenna (\u30e9\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30ca)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuri Shiratori]]|[[Karen Strassman]]}}\n:: A girl who is the oldest female student in the school. She is a bit air-headed and unsure of herself. Completely lost in her own world as she fails to pay attention or care about events going on around her when she runs errands for her mom. She is in a relationship with Gupta, but when he went to the city and Guu made him a woman, it is still unsure whether or not Guu made her a man so the relationship stays the same. At the end of the series, she becomes a [[Nursing|nurse]].\n\n* '''R\u0101ya (\u30e9\u30fc\u30e4)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Masayo Kurata]]|[[Kari Wahlgren|Shawna Smith]]}}\n:: A reticent girl. Along with Sagin, she seems to be part of a running gag in the series as both of them never talk or are always interrupted when they are about to (Like when Har\u00e9 asks for an answer from everyone, and the camera pans over everyone, skipping past Sagin and R\u0101ya when he looked at them). She only speaks two phrases in the entire course of the anime series and OVAs- \"The Crotch\" and \"Briefs\".\n\n* '''Chet and Addie'''\n: Chet {{voiced by|[[Takahiro Yoshimizu]]|[[Johnny Yong Bosch]]}}\n: Addie {{voiced by|[[Emi Uwagawa]]|[[Michelle Ruff]]}}\n:: Dubbed the \"stupid couple\" by the village, they are a couple that have been madly in love with each other for the past few years. Chet claims to have come from [[England]] on a research trip only to stay in the jungle when he laid eyes on Addie. A running joke later in the series is that whenever Chet and Addie are together on screen, they're usually doing something that needs to be blurred out. The true story behind them is that Chet, ever since he was a child, wanted to go to the jungle. He got good grades in school and excelled all for the sake of being able to go there. When he got there, he was given a [[guide]] so he could find his way around. The guide was Addie. After touring around for a bit, she got very mad at him for hitting on her so much and she yelled at him and said she doesn't like him that way. But later to be nice, Chet goes to find his way in the jungle without help, where he gets sick and lost. Addie goes to find him and does, where seeing how far he would go for her happiness, she returned his feelings. While Hare and friends are in the city, Guu sometimes pulls the couple out of nowhere when they are needed. It is unsure whether or not this is because she currently holds them in her stomach.\n\n* '''Yumi-sensei'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Junko Minagawa]]|[[Kate Higgins]]}}\n:: A [[substitute teacher]] that took over for Lazy while he was sick. Ironic since she absolutely hates children and has never had a boyfriend. Extremely short fuse. She exhibited a 1-way attraction to Hare after Hare was so nice and understanding towards her plight, and eventually breaks it off in the end to be with Toposte. In the end, her and Toposte end up becoming a couple.\n\n* '''Dama'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Chie K\u014djiro]]|[[Jessica Gee]]}}\n:: A [[hairdresser]] with an afro-style hair from a nearby village that became obsessed with her long-lost white-haired husband. Unfortunately, she mistakes Dr. Clive for her dead husband and even spins an elaborate fantasy life explaining why he doesn't know her. After spending most of the series stalking Clive, she is eventually told to live for new love and starts training her body to be in top shape. Dama later meets, fights, and marries the bank robber only to get seduced by an assassin later. After realizing she was only being used by the assassin, she resumes her happily married life with the bank robber. She is found by Hare in Guu's stomach on their most recent trip to the city. Dama's sister is Tama, whom she used to get along with but now they fight. The two merged once while fighting and Hare and Guu had to stop her. She was able to separate from the merged self and stop her sister. They now get along once again and work as a pair of singer and pianist at the bar her husband runs. Dama has a habit of acting and thinking (her thoughts are often narrated to Hare as a common break-the-fourth-wall comedy trick) very girlishly (usually seductively), which is strongly inappropriate for her old age and often exasperates Hare.\n\n* '''Tama'''\n:: Dama's twin sister who looks exactly like Dama, but with white skin. The two were close as children. But as they grew, Dama became more popular especially with their teacher as the two were teenagers. Tama and Dama were eaten by Guu and spent some time within her stomach in the RPG simulated world she created. In one story in the manga, the two sisters meet up, argue, and merge into a giant Dama/Tama monster that fights Hare, Guu, and the Hare and Guu from a short time in the future. She plays piano as her sister sings in the bar. Like her sister, Tama also exhibits very inappropriately (to Hare, sickeningly) girlish behaviors (and it's shown she thinks like one, as well), and harbors feelings for her brother-in-law, although her feelings is resolved after a talk with her sister. Hare eventually finds himself unable to stand their presences and soon quits his part-time job at their bar.\n\n===Guu's Stomach World inhabitants===\n* '''Tomoyo'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Ky\u014dko Hikami]]|[[Kari Wahlgren|Shawna Smith]]}}\n:: One of three people living inside Guu's stomach world. A kind and friendly office lady, she does not seem to mind living inside of Guu. Seiichi and she are good friends and are even possibly a couple. She takes care of Har\u00e9's pet bird Hee after Guu eats him.\n\n* '''Seiichi'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Akira Ishida]]|[[Steve Staley]]}}\n:: One of three people living inside Guu's stomach world. Like Tomoyo, he is a friendly high school boy who doesn't seem to mind living inside of Guu. He is good friends with Tomoyo and is even possibly her boyfriend.\n\n* '''Hiroko Yamada/\"Angry Yamada\"'''\n: {{voiced by|{{illm|Ayumi Furuyama|ja|\u53e4\u5c71\u3042\u3086\u307f}}|[[Julie Ann Taylor]]}}\n:: One of three people living inside Guu's stomach world who first appears in episode 8 of the TV series. She is a 22-year-old who attempted suicide by throwing herself into the ocean and was rescued by Guu, who swallowed her while fishing (and while bringing in a massive haul of various sea life, she technically didn't catch any fish). Unlike Seiichi and Tomoyo, Hiroko is mentally unstable and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]], making her dangerous and unpredictable. In fact, she tried to kill herself in an elaborate plot to take revenge on her cheating husband by dying, going through hell, and coming back as an evil spirit to haunt him for the rest of his life. She now spends most of her time in Guu's stomach world drinking alone on a hill, where most of the other inhabitants have now learned to avoid. Became fast-friends with Yumi-sensei when Guu had swallowed Yumi for a short time.\n\n===City inhabitants===\n* '''Asio (\u30a2\u30b7\u30aa)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu]]|[[Sam Riegel]]}}\n:: A servant at Weda's parent's estate, he has very scary eyes (though it wasn't always the case, was stated to have beautiful eyes when he was younger). Loves Weda, but she thinks of him as a brother. He is often the one who goes to pick up Weda after nights where she had been drinking specifically heavily (revealed to be quite frequent due to Weda's habits). Often coming up with ideas that seem not to be possible, Har\u00e9 is put off by him from their first meeting.\n\n* '''Bell (\u30d9\u30eb)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Mari Yok\u014d]]|[[Melodee Spevack]]}}\n:: Another servant, she is prone to gigantic nosebleeds when thinking of Weda as a child (this implies she has a perverted obsession with Weda). She and Asio have often been used to fill in the story of Weda's past. Though Weda is quite happy the two of them returned, their odd tendencies often frighten Har\u00e9, who is quite easily unbalanced by their (and Guu's) acts that seem to defy the laws of physics. She hates Clive with a passion, which works to Hare's advantage when he tries to keep Clive from wooing his mother. In the manga, Bell is a heterosexual drag queen. His clothes are chosen to draw attention away from his height, broad shoulders, & flat chest. When Weda was younger, he had shorter hair & dressed like a normal man.\n\n* '''Sagin (\u30b5\u30ae\u30f3)'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Shizuka Ishikawa]]|[[Tony Oliver]]}}\n:: A reticent boy. Along with R\u0101ya, he seems to be part of a running gag in the series as both of them never talk, or are always interrupted when they are about to (Like having a video interview with everyone, where when their turn came the camera switched to the next person immediately when they open their mouths).\n\n* '''Robert'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Sh\u014dtar\u014d Morikubo]]|[[Keith Silverstein]]}}\n:: Weda's trigger-happy [[bodyguard]] after she, Hare, and Guu go to the city. After graduating high school, he arrived in the city and was beat up one night, and was later found by Bel. It's because of her that he got his job. At first he doesn't get along well with Weda, saying that she wasn't worthy of Bel's love, but that changes after they foil a bank robbery. He may or may not have feelings for Bel (as episode 23 implies). In addition to being trigger-happy, he is a paranoid lunatic and once tried to kill a boy who bullied Hare causing him to ironically protect his own abuser from Robert. After Guu switched everyone's genders, it took her a while to change him back.\n\n* '''Bank Robber Guy'''\n: {{voiced by|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]|[[Patrick Seitz]]}}\n:: A complete video game nerd who gets along with Hare due to their mutual love of video games. They'd be friends if he wasn't constantly taking Hare as a hostage. He eventually marries Dama after being bested by her in battle. He now runs a bar in the jungle.\n\n* '''Rita'''\n: {{voiced by|Naoko Takano}}\n:: A self-centered girl around Hare's age that attends school in the city, who only cares about herself, and pleases others to not make enemies so she can get ahead in life. Hare ends up becoming her first true friend. She seems to eventually grow a serious love for Hare.\n\n* '''Johan'''\n:: A student that went to school with Har\u00e9 and Guu in the city. He is secretly in love with Rita and usually beats up Hare for being so close to her. At first he is fat but when the group returns to the city later he lost a lot of weight. By the time Hare and everyone leaves the city, he has accepted Rita and Hare's \"love.\"\n\n* '''Bartholomew'''\n:: Weda's older brother whom she believes to have sent hitmen to kill her in order to take her out of the family will. Later, it's revealed that the hitmen were sent by Bartholomew's son Alva, who was upset with his grandfather's will that left Weda a big portion of the family fortune, while Bartholomew is shown to be as loving as Weda remembers him. Bartholomew is actually happy that his father has forgiven Weda and written her into the family's will.\n\n* '''Donna'''\n:: Weda's older sister whom Weda believes to conspire with Bartholomew to send hitmen after her and Hare. The hitmen, however, were actually sent by Donna's nephew Alva, while Donna herself is happy with Weda's return to the family.\n\n* '''Quincy Porter (QP)/Pretty'''\n:: A very large, muscular bald man who everyone met on an island when their plane crashed on their way to the city. His name is meant to be very ironic. He first protected the gang when they were trapped on the island but he sometimes appears in the city when Guu pulls him out of nowhere. He and Robert have become rivals but later became friends. QP has a wife named Sera, with whom he has two daughters. He has five younger brothers and sisters: Sam, Simon, Sandora, and Sean, Samuel. They all look too alike that annoys Har\u00e9. He is currently a woman because of Guu and he/she works as a maid for Hare's grandmother's mansion. He's likely changed back after Guu disappears.\n\n* '''IT 1'''\n:: A black-haired man who shows no emotion. He is actually a human form of a [[cockroach]], changed into human form by Guu to get Hare to stop being afraid of bugs.\n\n* '''IT 2'''\n:: The sister of the black-haired man. Neither show any emotion or compassion for anything, except for their home.\n\n* '''Alex'''\n:: The family's [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] who was bribed by Alva to crash Weda's plane and kill everyone. However, due to Alex's absent-mindedness, he forgets to plan his own escape route from said crashed plane, and has to befriends the Jungle clients to work their way to the main family (it's hinted that Alex earns his share by acting in gay porn movies). He is very childish and is never serious. He is sometimes referred to as a yankee because of the way he stands. Despite his carefree attitude, Alex is an unfortunate man who divorced thrice, was stripped from the right to see his two children. The two ex-wives sabotaged his last marriage by accusing him being gay.\n\n* '''Shirley'''\n:: Alex's friend who helped him with his assassination attempt. She is very shy and only ever opens up when it comes to Alex. It was because of her that Robert decided not to shoot the two when captured.\n\n* '''Alva'''\n:: Bartholomew's son and Hare's cousin, and the true mastermind behind the assassination plots aimed at Weda since he loved his father and was upset to see Bartholomew's share in the will being reduced due to Weda's presence. He ends up going with everyone back to the jungle. He is usually getting lost, causing him to be returned to home by a rather over-sized Pokute. At the end of the series, he succeeds his father's business and sends Hare gifts when his daughter is born.\n\n* '''Angela'''\n:: Alva's mother and a famous [[Actor|actress]]. However, he denies that he has one. The reason for this is clear when Angela first appears in Hare's village after Alva goes there and claims she would like him back with her to help her rehearse for a new role, and denies that she ever care for her son at all. However, a conversation with Weda has revealed that Angela is actually a [[tsundere]] and loves her son very much, despite always acting the opposite. She later returns to check on Alva and hires Hare as her guide, but stays in disguise through much of the visit as she doesn't want people to think she's there for her son. She has an assistant who is frequently seen by her side, and usually interprets her true feelings to people whenever her tsundere side makes her unable to say it.\n\n* '''Margaret'''\n:: Robert's acquaintance, the de facto leader of a famous group of female assassins. She's in charge of the intelligence, and uses her hacking ability to aid her comrades during missions. It's also shown that she has a photographic memory, and is able to recite the number of pi for as long as three to four days. Robert and Hare hires her group to rescue Robert's friend from an enemy assassination group. Afterwards, Margaret and her friends are revealed to have become romantically interested in Hare.\n\n* '''Dandelion'''\n:: An assassin of Margaret's group. She has the best fighting ability among them, and is deadly with knives.\n\n* '''Dahlia'''\n:: An assassin of Margaret's group. She is the physically strongest, and is able to burst a volleyball with her bare hand. She specializes in close-range combat.\n\n* '''Chamomile'''\n:: An assassin of Margaret's group, she appears to be still in school. She's a very proficient sniper.\n\n* '''Cherry'''\n:: An assassin of Margaret's group, she appears to be in kindergarten. She has vast chemical knowledge, and is good at making bombs and chemicals.\n\n* '''Lloyd'''\n:: One of Wiggle's roommates in college. Being the top grader of his year, grandson of the college's principal, heir of a doctor family-line, he is very snobby and is always taking his girlfriend out and buying her expensive gifts.\n\n* '''Sarah'''\n:: Another one of Wiggle's roommates. She is of the typical snobby teen girl type.\n\n* '''Ann'''\n:: Another one of Wiggle's roommates. She seems peppy and excited all the time, but she is actually very sad. She once kidnapped Hare in an attempt to gain a large sum of money from his grandmother to pay for her family's debt. But she is stopped and thanks to Hare is still excepted by everyone.\n\n* '''Yuuki'''\n:: Wiggle's last roommate. He is very quiet but nice. People usually avoid him though because he has a scary face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List of Hare+Guu characters}}\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Hare+Guu]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Har%C3%A9%2BGuu_characters"}

There are overlapping and conflicting definitions as to where exactly Southeastern Europe begins or ends or how it relates to other regions of the continent. Sovereign states and territories that are included in the region are, in alphabetical order: [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Kosovo]],{{efn|name=Kosovo}} [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[East Thrace]] (part of [[Turkey]]). Sometimes, [[Moldova]] and [[Slovenia]] are also included. The largest city of the region is [[Istanbul]] (which straddles the [[Bosporus]] strait between Southeast Europe and [[Western Asia]]), followed by [[Bucharest]], [[Sofia]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Athens]].\n\nThe boundaries of the region can vary greatly and are widely disputed, due to political, economic, historical, cultural, and geographical considerations and point of view of the observer.\n\n==Definition==\nThe first known use of the term \"Southeast Europe\" was by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] researcher [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] (1811\u20131869) as a broader term than the traditional [[Balkans]],<ref>H\u00f6sch, Nehring, Sundhaussen (Hrsg.), Lexikon zur Geschichte S\u00fcdosteuropas, S. 663, {{ISBN|3-8252-8270-8}}</ref> a concept based on the boundaries of the Balkan Peninsula (the countries that have been described as being entirely within the Balkan region are: [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]],{{efn|name=Kosovo}} [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Montenegro]], and [[North Macedonia]]<ref>Istituto Geografico De Agostini, ''L'Enciclopedia Geografica \u2013 Vol.I \u2013 Italia'', 2004, Ed.

There are overlapping and conflicting definitions as to where exactly Southeastern Europe begins or ends or how it relates to other regions of the continent. Sovereign states and territories that are included in the region are, in alphabetical order: [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Kosovo]],{{efn|name=Kosovo}} [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[East Thrace]] (part of [[Turkey]]). Sometimes, [[Moldova]] and [[Slovenia]] are also included. The largest city of the region is [[Istanbul]] (which straddles the [[Bosporus]] strait between Southeast Europe and [[Western Asia]]), followed by [[Bucharest]], [[Sofia]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Athens]].\n\nThe boundaries of the region can vary greatly and are widely disputed, due to political, economic, historical, cultural, and geographical considerations and point of view of the observer.\n\n==Definition==\nThe first known use of the term \"Southeast Europe\" was by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] researcher [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] (1811\u20131869) as a broader term than the traditional [[Balkans]],<ref>H\u00f6sch, Nehring, Sundhaussen (Hrsg.), Lexikon zur Geschichte S\u00fcdosteuropas, S. 663, {{ISBN|3-8252-8270-8}}</ref> a concept based on the boundaries of the Balkan Peninsula (the countries that have been described as being entirely within the Balkan region are: [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]],{{efn|name=Kosovo}} [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Montenegro]], and [[North Macedonia]]<ref>Istituto Geografico De Agostini, ''L'Enciclopedia Geografica \u2013 Vol.I \u2013 Italia'', 2004, Ed.

He was a friend and frequent collaborator with his fellow countryman [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and is the author of the [[Fantastique|fantastic fiction]] novel  ''[[The Invention of Morel]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nAdolfo Bioy Casares was born on September 15, 1914 in [[Buenos Aires]], the only child of Adolfo Bioy Domecq and Marta Ignacia Casares [[Patrick Lynch (Argentina)|Lynch]]. He was born in [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]], a neighborhood of Buenos Aires traditionally inhabited by upper-class families, where he would reside the majority of his life. Due to his family's high social class, he was able to dedicate himself exclusively to [[literature]] and, at the same time, distinguish his work from the traditional literary medium of his time. He wrote his first story (\"Iris y Margarita\") at the age of eleven. He began his secondary education in the [[Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense\u00f1anza]] at the [[Universidad de Buenos Aires]]. Later, he started but did not end up finishing degrees in [[law]], [[philosophy]], and [[literature]]. Fueled by disappointment with the university atmosphere, he moved to a family ranch where, when he didn't have visitors, he devoted himself almost entirely to his study of literature.  By the time he reached his late twenties, he maintained proficiency in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] (which he spoke from the age of 4) and [[German language|German]]. Between 1929 and 1937 Bioy Casares published a number of books (''Pr\u00f3logo'', ''17 disparos contra lo porvenir'', ''Caos'', ''La nueva tormenta'', ''La estatua casera'', ''Luis Greve, muerto'') that he would later disdain, restricting additional publications and refusing to discuss them, labeling all his work previous to 1940 as 'horrible'.\n\nIn 1932 he met [[Jorge Luis Borges]] at Villa Ocampo, a house in [[San Isidro Partido|San Isidro]] belonging to [[Victoria Ocampo]]. There, she often hosted different international figures and organized cultural celebrations, one of which brought Borges and Bioy Casares together. Bioy Casares recalled that on that particular occasion, the two writers stepped away from the rest of the guests, only to be reprimanded by Ocampo.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/suplementos/cultura/1999/08/22/e-01501d.htm \u00abEl tercer hombre.\u00bb 22 de agosto de 1999.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821080316/http://edant.clarin.com/suplementos/cultura/1999/08/22/e-01501d.htm |date=August 21, 2016 }} ''Clar\u00edn''.</ref> This reproach provoked them to leave the gathering and return to the city together. The journey sealed a lifelong friendship and many influential literary collaborations. Under the pseudonyms [[Honorio Bustos Domecq|H. Bustos Domecq]] and Benito Su\u00e1rez Lynch, the two teamed up on a variety of projects from short stories (''Seis problemas para don Isidro Parodi'', ''Dos fantas\u00edas memorables'', ''Un modelo para la muerte''), to screenplays  (''Los orilleros'', ''Invasi\u00f3n''), and fantastic fiction (''Antolog\u00eda de la literatura fant\u00e1stica'', ''Cuentos breves y extraordinarios''). Between 1945 and 1955, they directed \"El s\u00e9ptimo c\u00edrculo\" (\"The Seventh Circle\"), a collection of translations of popular English [[detective fiction]], a genre that Borges greatly admired. In 2006, ''Borges'', a biographical volume of more than 1600 pages from Bioy Casares' journals, revealed many additional details of the friendship shared by the two writers. Bioy Casares had already prepared and corrected the texts some time previously, but he never was able to publish them himself.\n\nIn 1940, he published the short novel ''[[The Invention of Morel]]'', which marked the beginning of his literary maturity. The novel's introduction was written by Borges, in which he comments on the absence of precursors to science fiction in Spanish literature, presenting Bioy Casares as the pioneer of a new genre. The novella was very well accepted and received the Primer Premio Municipal de Literatura (First Municipal Prize of Literature) in 1941. During this same time, in collaboration with Borges and Silvina Ocampo, he published two anthologies: ''Antolog\u00eda de la literatura fant\u00e1stica'' (1940) y ''Antolog\u00eda po\u00e9tica argentina'' (1941).\n\nIn 1940, Bioy Casares married [[Silvina Ocampo]], Victoria's sister, who was a painter as well as a writer. In 1954, one of Bioy Casares' mistresses gave birth in the United States to his daughter, Marta, who was subsequently adopted by his wife Silvina. Marta was killed in an automobile accident just three weeks after Silvina Ocampo's death, leaving Adolfo with two children. The estate of Silvina Ocampo and Adolfo Bioy Casares was awarded by a Buenos Aires court to yet another love child of Adolfo Bioy Casares, Fabi\u00e1n Bioy. Fabi\u00e1n Bioy died, aged 40, in [[Paris, France]] on 11 February 2006.\n\nBioy won several awards, including the Gran Premio de Honor of SADE (the Argentine Society of Writers, 1975), the French [[Legion of Honour]] (1981), the Diamond [[Konex Award]] of Literature (1994) the title of Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires (1986), and the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] (awarded to him in 1991 in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]]). Adolfo Bioy Casares is buried in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]], Buenos Aires.\n\n==Works==\nThe best-known novel by Bioy Casares is ''La invenci\u00f3n de Morel'' (''[[The Invention of Morel]]''). It is the story of a man who, evading justice, escapes to an island said to be infected with a mysterious fatal disease. Struggling to understand why everything seems to repeat, he realizes that all the people he sees there are actually recordings, made with a special machine, invented by Morel, which is able to record not only three-dimensional images, but also voices and scents, making it all indistinguishable from reality. The story mixes [[Literary realism|realism]], [[fantasy]], science fiction and [[fear|terror]]. Borges wrote an introduction in which he called it a work of \"reasoned imagination\" and linked it to [[H. G. Wells]]' ''oeuvre''. Both Borges and [[Octavio Paz]] described the novel as \"perfect\".

He was a friend and frequent collaborator with his fellow countryman [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and is the author of the [[Fantastique|fantastic fiction]] novel  ''[[The Invention of Morel]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nAdolfo Bioy Casares was born on September 15, 1914 in [[Buenos Aires]], the only child of Adolfo Bioy Domecq and Marta Ignacia Casares [[Patrick Lynch (Argentina)|Lynch]]. He was born in [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]], a neighborhood of Buenos Aires traditionally inhabited by upper-class families, where he would reside the majority of his life. Due to his family's high social class, he was able to dedicate himself exclusively to [[literature]] and, at the same time, distinguish his work from the traditional literary medium of his time. He wrote his first story (\"Iris y Margarita\") at the age of eleven. He began his secondary education in the [[Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense\u00f1anza]] at the [[Universidad de Buenos Aires]]. Later, he started but did not end up finishing degrees in [[law]], [[philosophy]], and [[literature]]. Fueled by disappointment with the university atmosphere, he moved to a family ranch where, when he didn't have visitors, he devoted himself almost entirely to his study of literature.  By the time he reached his late twenties, he maintained proficiency in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] (which he spoke from the age of 4) and [[German language|German]]. Between 1929 and 1937 Bioy Casares published a number of books (''Pr\u00f3logo'', ''17 disparos contra lo porvenir'', ''Caos'', ''La nueva tormenta'', ''La estatua casera'', ''Luis Greve, muerto'') that he would later disdain, restricting additional publications and refusing to discuss them, labeling all his work previous to 1940 as 'horrible'.\n\nIn 1932 he met [[Jorge Luis Borges]] at Villa Ocampo, a house in [[San Isidro Partido|San Isidro]] belonging to [[Victoria Ocampo]]. There, she often hosted different international figures and organized cultural celebrations, one of which brought Borges and Bioy Casares together. Bioy Casares recalled that on that particular occasion, the two writers stepped away from the rest of the guests, only to be reprimanded by Ocampo.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/suplementos/cultura/1999/08/22/e-01501d.htm \u00abEl tercer hombre.\u00bb 22 de agosto de 1999.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821080316/http://edant.clarin.com/suplementos/cultura/1999/08/22/e-01501d.htm |date=August 21, 2016 }} ''Clar\u00edn''.</ref> This reproach provoked them to leave the gathering and return to the city together. The journey sealed a lifelong friendship and many influential literary collaborations. Under the pseudonyms [[Honorio Bustos Domecq|H. Bustos Domecq]] and Benito Su\u00e1rez Lynch, the two teamed up on a variety of projects from short stories (''Seis problemas para don Isidro Parodi'', ''Dos fantas\u00edas memorables'', ''Un modelo para la muerte''), to screenplays  (''Los orilleros'', ''Invasi\u00f3n''), and fantastic fiction (''Antolog\u00eda de la literatura fant\u00e1stica'', ''Cuentos breves y extraordinarios''). Between 1945 and 1955, they directed \"El s\u00e9ptimo c\u00edrculo\" (\"The Seventh Circle\"), a collection of translations of popular English [[detective fiction]], a genre that Borges greatly admired. In 2006, ''Borges'', a biographical volume of more than 1600 pages from Bioy Casares' journals, revealed many additional details of the friendship shared by the two writers. Bioy Casares had already prepared and corrected the texts some time previously, but he never was able to publish them himself.\n\nIn 1940, he published the short novel ''[[The Invention of Morel]]'', which marked the beginning of his literary maturity. The novel's introduction was written by Borges, in which he comments on the absence of precursors to science fiction in Spanish literature, presenting Bioy Casares as the pioneer of a new genre. The novella was very well accepted and received the Primer Premio Municipal de Literatura (First Municipal Prize of Literature) in 1941. During this same time, in collaboration with Borges and Silvina Ocampo, he published two anthologies: ''Antolog\u00eda de la literatura fant\u00e1stica'' (1940) y ''Antolog\u00eda po\u00e9tica argentina'' (1941).\n\nIn 1940, Bioy Casares married [[Silvina Ocampo]], Victoria's sister, who was a painter as well as a writer. In 1954, one of Bioy Casares' mistresses gave birth in the United States to his daughter, Marta, who was subsequently adopted by his wife Silvina. Marta was killed in an automobile accident just three weeks after Silvina Ocampo's death, leaving Adolfo with two children. The estate of Silvina Ocampo and Adolfo Bioy Casares was awarded by a Buenos Aires court to yet another love child of Adolfo Bioy Casares, Fabi\u00e1n Bioy. Fabi\u00e1n Bioy died, aged 40, in [[Paris, France]] on 11 February 2006.\n\nBioy won several awards, including the Gran Premio de Honor of SADE (the Argentine Society of Writers, 1975), the French [[Legion of Honour]] (1981), the Diamond [[Konex Award]] of Literature (1994) the title of Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires (1986), and the [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] (awarded to him in 1991 in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]]). Adolfo Bioy Casares is buried in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]], Buenos Aires.\n\n==Works==\nThe best-known novel by Bioy Casares is ''La invenci\u00f3n de Morel'' (''[[The Invention of Morel]]''). It is the story of a man who, evading justice, escapes to an island said to be infected with a mysterious fatal disease. Struggling to understand why everything seems to repeat, he realizes that all the people he sees there are actually recordings, made with a special machine, invented by Morel, which is able to record not only three-dimensional images, but also voices and scents, making it all indistinguishable from reality. The story mixes [[Literary realism|realism]], [[fantasy]], science fiction and [[fear|terror]]. Borges wrote an introduction in which he called it a work of \"reasoned imagination\" and linked it to [[H. G. Wells]]' ''oeuvre''. Both Borges and [[Octavio Paz]] described the novel as \"perfect\". The story is held to be the inspiration for Alan Resnais's ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''<ref>Thomas Beltzer, ''Last Year at Marienbad: An Intertextual Meditation'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120121024525/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2000/10/marienbad/ ].</ref> and an influence on the TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.\n\n'''Novels and novellas'''\n* ''La nueva tormenta o la vida de Juan Ruteno'', 167 pp. (1935; \"The New Storm or The Life of Juan Ruteno\")\n* ''[[La invenci\u00f3n de Morel]]'', 126 pp. (1940; translated into English as ''[[The Invention of Morel]]'', 1964, {{ISBN|1-59017-057-1}})\n* ''El perjurio de la nieve'', 64 pp. (1944; \"The Snow's Perjury\")\n* ''Plan de evasi\u00f3n'', 162 pp. (1945; translated into English as ''A Plan for Escape'', 1975, {{ISBN|1-55597-107-5}})\n* ''El sue\u00f1o de los h\u00e9roes'', 216 pp. (1954; translated into English as ''The Dream of Heroes'', 1987, {{ISBN|0-7043-2634-5}})\n* ''Homenaje a Francisco Almeyra'', 37 pp. (1954; \"Homage to Francisco Almeyra\")\n* ''Diario de la guerra del cerdo'', 207 pp. (1969; translated into English as ''Diary of the War of the Pig'', 1972, {{ISBN|0-07-073742-8}})\n* ''Dormir al Sol'', 229 pp. (1973; translated into English as ''Asleep in the Sun'', 1978, {{ISBN|0-89255-030-9}})\n* ''La aventura de un fot\u00f3grafo en La Plata'', 223 pp. (1985; translated into English as ''The Adventures of a Photographer in [[La Plata]]'', 1989, {{ISBN|0-7475-0798-8}})\n* ''Un campe\u00f3n desparejo'', 110 pp. (1993; \"An Uneven Champion\")\n\n'''Short story collections'''\n* ''17 disparos contra el porvenir'', 173 pp. (1933; \"17 Shots Against the Future\")\n* ''Caos'', 283 pp. (1934, \"Chaos\")\n* ''Luis Greve, muerto'', 157 pp. (1937; \"Luis Greve, Deceased\")\n* ''[[La trama celeste]]'', 246 pp. (1948; \"The Celestial Plot\")\n* ''Las v\u00edsperas de Fausto'', 15 pp. (1949; \"Faust's Eve\")\n* ''Historia prodigiosa'', 151 pp. (1956; \"A Remarkable History\")\n* ''El lado de la sombra'', 192 pp. (1962; \"The Shady Side\")\n* ''El gran seraf\u00edn'', 190 pp. (1967; \"The Great Seraph\")\n* ''[[The Hero of Women|El h\u00e9roe de las mujeres]]'', 191 pp. (1978; \"The Hero of Women\")\n* ''Historias desaforadas'', 231 pp. (1986; \"Colossal Stories\")\n* ''Una mu\u00f1eca rusa'', 179 pp. (1991; translated into English as ''A Russian Doll and Other Stories'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-8112-1211-4}})\n\nGenerally, these Spanish-language collections have not been systematically translated into English.
