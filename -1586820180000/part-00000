The economy hit bottom in the winter of 1932\u201333; then came four years of growth until the [[recession of 1937\u201338]] brought back high levels of unemployment.<ref>Chandler (1970); Jensen (1989); Mitchell (1964)</ref>\n\n[[File:Real GDP of the United States from 1910-1960.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|US annual real GDP from 1910 to 1960, with the years of the Great Depression (1929\u20131939) highlighted]]\n[[File:US Unemployment from 1910-1960.svg|thumb|300px|Unemployment rate in the US 1910\u201360, with the years of the Great Depression (1929\u201339) highlighted; accurate data begins in 1939, represented by a blue line.]]\n\nThe Depression caused major political changes in America. Three years into the depression, President [[Herbert Hoover]], widely shamed for not doing enough to combat the crisis, lost the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]] to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] by an embarrassingly wide margin. Roosevelt's economic recovery plan, the [[New Deal]], instituted unprecedented programs for relief, recovery and reform, and brought about a major realignment of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].\n\nThe Depression also resulted in an increase of [[emigration]] for the first time in American history. Some immigrants went back to their native countries, and some native U.S. citizens went to [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. There were mass migrations of people from badly hit areas in the [[Great Plains]] (the [[Okies]]) and the South to places such as California and the cities of the North (the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]).<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/afctshtml/tsme.html The Migrant Experience].

A well-known example of an emigrant was [[Frank McCourt]], who went to [[Ireland]], as recounted in his book ''[[Angela's Ashes]]''.\n\nThe memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with economic downturns, such as the use of [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus packages]], [[Keynesian economics]], and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. It also shaped modern American literature, resulting in famous novels such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''.\n\nExamining the [[causes of the Great Depression]] raises multiple issues: what factors set off the first downturn in 1929; what structural weaknesses and specific events turned it into a major depression; how the downturn spread from country to country; and why the economic recovery was so prolonged.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Defining Moment: The Great Depression and the American Economy in the Twentieth Century |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-226-06589-2 |editor-last=Bordo |editor-first=Michael D. |editor-link=Michael D.

There was no [[FDIC|federal deposit insurance]] during that time as [[Bank failure|bank failures]] were considered a normal part of economic life. Worried depositors started to withdraw savings, so the [[money multiplier]] worked in reverse.

It began on October 24, 1929, and was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States. Much of the stock market crash can be attributed to exuberance and false expectations. In the years leading up to 1929, the rising stock market prices had created vast sums of wealth in relation to amounts invested, in turn encouraging borrowing to further buy more stock. However, on October 24 (Black Thursday), share prices began to fall and panic selling caused prices to fall sharply. On October 29 (Black Tuesday), share prices fell by $14 billion in a single day, more than $30 billion in the week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/economic-forces/the-economic-causes-and-impacts-of-the-stock-market-crash-of-1929-fall-2012|title=The Economic Causes and Impacts of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 (Fall 2012) - Historpedia|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> The value that evaporated that week was ten times more than the entire federal budget and more than all of what the U.S. had spent on [[World War I]].

After the stock market crash and the bank closures, people were afraid of losing more money. Because of their fears of further economic challenge, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing and consuming. Thousands of individual investors who believed they could get rich by investing on margin lost everything they had. The stock market crash severely impacted the American economy.\n\n==Banking failures==\n\nA large contribution to the [[recession]] was the closure and suspension of thousands of banks across the country. Financial institutions failed for several reasons, including unregulated lending procedures, confidence in the [[Gold standard]], [[consumer confidence]] in future economics, and agricultural defaults on outstanding loans. With these compounding issues the banking system struggled to keep up with the public's increasing demand for cash withdrawals. This overall decreased the money supply and forced the banks to result to [[short sale (real estate)]] and [[liquidation]] of existing loans.<ref name=\"Fuller 2012\" /> In the race to liquidate assets the banking system began to fail on a wide scale. In November 1930 the first major banking crisis began with over 800 banks closing their doors by January 1931. By October 1931 over 2100 banks were suspended with the highest suspension rate recorded in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District, with 2 out of every 5 banks suspended.<ref>\"Banking Panics (1930\u20131933).\" Encyclopedia of the Great Depression. Encyclopedia.com. 13 Jun. 2017<http://www.encyclopedia.com>.</ref> The economy as a whole experienced a massive reduction in banking footholds across the country amounting to more than nine thousand closed banks by 1933. \n[[File:Banking_Closure_in_1929_-_New_York_City.jpg|thumb|People outside a closed bank after 1929 stock market crash.]]\n\nThe closures resulted in a massive withdrawal of deposits by millions of Americans estimated at near $6.8 billion (equivalent to around $60 billion in today's dollars). During this time the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) was not in place resulting in a loss of roughly $1.36 billion (or 20%) of the total $6.8 billion accounted for within the failed banks. These losses came directly from everyday individuals' savings, investments and bank accounts. As a result, [[GDP]] fell from the high seven-hundreds in 1929 to the low to mid six-hundreds in 1933 before seeing any recovery for the first time in nearly 4 years.<ref>USA annual GDP from 1910-60, in billions of constant 2005 dollars, with the years of the [[Great Depression]] (1929\u20131939) highlighted. Based on data from: Louis D. Johnston and Samuel H. Williamson, \"What Was the U.S. GDP Then?\" MeasuringWorth, 2008</ref> Federal leadership intervention is highly debated on its effectiveness and overall participation. The [[Federal Reserve Act]] could not effectively tackle the banking crisis as state bank and trust companies were not compelled to be a member, paper eligible discount member banks heavily restricted access to the Federal Reserve, power between the twelve Federal Reserve banks was decentralized and federal level leadership was ineffective, inexperienced, and weak.\n\n===Unregulated growth===\n\nThroughout the early 1900s banking regulations were extremely lax if not non-existent. The Currency Act of 1900 lowered the required [[Capital (economics)|capital]] of investors from 50,000 to 25,000 to create a [[national bank]]. As a result of this change nearly two thirds of the banks formed over the next ten years were quite small, averaging just above the 25,000 in required capital.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 39-41. Web. 2005</ref> The number of banks would nearly double (number of banks divided by Real GDP) from 1890 to 1920 due to the lack of oversight and qualification when banking [[charter]]s were being issued in the first two decades of the 1900s.<ref>(Federal Reserve Board 1933, 63\u201365).</ref>\n\nThe unregulated growth of small rural banking institutions can be partially attributed to the rising cost of [[agriculture]] especially in the [[Corn Belt]] and [[Cotton Belt]]. Throughout the corn and cotton belts real estate increases drove the demand for more local funding to continue to supply rising agricultural economics. The rural banking structures would supply the needed capital to meet the farm [[commodity market]], however, this came with a price of reliability and low risk lending. Economic growth was promising from 1887 to 1920 with an average of 6 percent growth in [GDP]. In particular the participation in [[World War I]] drove a booming agricultural market that drove optimism at the consumer and lending level which, in turn, resulted in a more lax approach in the lending process. Over banked conditions existed which pressured struggling banks to increase their services (specifically to the agricultural customers) without any additional regulatory oversight or qualifications. This dilemma introduced several high risk and marginal business returns to the banking market.<ref>Federal Reserve Board 1933, 67.</ref> Banking growth would continue through the first two decades well outside of previous trends disregarding the current economic and population standards. Banking profitability and loan standards begin to deteriorate as early as 1900 as a result. \n[[File:Dust storm approaching Stratford, Texas 1935.jpg|thumb|Approaching dust storm near Stratford, Texas. April 18, 1935.]]\nCrop failures beginning in 1921 began to impact this poorly regulated system, the expansion areas of corn and cotton suffered the largest due to the [[dust bowl]] era resulting in real estate value reductions. In addition, the year 1921 was the peak for banking expansion with roughly 31,000 banks in activity, however, with the failures at the agricultural level 505 banks would close between 1921 -1930 marking the largest banking system failure on record.  Regulatory questions began to hit the debating table around banking qualifications as a result; discussions would continue into the [Great Depression] as not only were banks failing but some would disappear altogether with no rhyme or reason.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 39-53. Web. 21 May 2017.</ref> The panic of financial crisis would increase in the Great Depression due to the lack of confidence in the regulatory and recovery displayed during the 1920s, this ultimately drove a nation of doubts, uneasiness, and lack of consumer confidence in the banking system.\n\n===Contagion===\n\nWith a lack of consumer confidence in the economic direction given by the federal government panic started to spread across the country shortly after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. President Hoover retained the [[Gold Standard]] as the country's currency gauge throughout the following years. As a result, the American shareholders with the majority of the gold reserves began to grow wary of the value of gold in the near future. [[Europe]]'s decision to move away from the [[Gold Standard]] caused individuals to start to withdraw gold shares and move the investments out of the country or began to hoard gold for future investment. The market continued to suffer due to these reactions, and in result caused several of the everyday individuals to speculate on the economy in the coming months.  Rumors of market stability and banking conditions began to spread, consumer confidence continued to drop and panic began to set in. Contagion spread like wild fire pushing Americans all over the country to withdraw their deposits ''en masse''. This idea would continue from 1929-1933 causing the greatest financial crisis ever seen at the banking level pushing the economic recovery efforts further from resolution. An increase in the currency-deposit ratio and a money stock determinant forced money stock to fall and income to decline. This panic-induced banking failure took a mild recession to a major recession.<ref>Richardson, Gary. \"Banking Panics of 1930\u201331\". Federal Reserve History. N.p., 22 Nov. 2013. Web. 13 June 2017</ref>\n\nWhether this caused the Great Depression is still heavily debated due to many other attributing factors. However, it is evident that the banking system suffered massive reductions across the country due to the lack of consumer confidence. As withdraw requests would exceed cash availability banks began conducting steed discount sales such as fire sales and short sales. Due to the inability to immediately determine current value worth these fire sales and short sales would result in massive losses when recuperating any possible revenue for outstanding and defaulted loans. This would allow healthy banks to take advantage of the struggling units forcing additional losses resulting in banks not being able to deliver on depositor demands and creating a failing cycle that would become widespread.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 45\u201346. Web. 2005</ref> Investment would continue to stay low through the next half decade as the private sector would hoard savings due to uncertainty of the future. The federal government would run additional policy changes such as the Check tax, monetary restrictions (including reduction of money supply by burning), High Wage Policy, and the New Deal through the Hoover and Roosevelt administration.\n\n==Urban desperation politic==\n[[File:Huts and unemployed, West Houston and Mercer St., Manhattan (NYPL b13668355-482853).jpg|thumb|Huts and unemployed men in New York City, 1935]]\nOne visible effect of the depression was the advent of [[Hooverville]]s,  which were ramshackle assemblages on vacant lots of cardboard boxes, tents, and small rickety wooden sheds built by homeless people. Residents lived in the shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the [[Democratic National Committee]], to refer sardonically to President [[Herbert Hoover]] whose policies Michelson blamed for the depression.<ref>Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88</ref>\n\nThe government did not calculate unemployment rates in the 1930s. The most widely accepted estimates of unemployment rates for the Great Depression are those by Stanley Lebergott from the 1950s. He estimated that unemployment reached 24.9 percent in the worst days of 1933. Another commonly cited estimate is by Michael Darby in 1976. He put the unemployment rate at a peak of 22.5 percent in 1932.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smiley |first1=Gene |title=Recent Unemployment Rate Estimates for the 1920s and 1930s |url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~gwallace/Papers/2120839.pdf |website=wisc.edu |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Job losses were less severe among women, workers in non durable industries (such as food and clothing), services and sales workers, and those employed by the government. Unskilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates. Age also played a factor. Young people had a hard time getting their first job. Men over the age of 45, if they lost their job, would rarely find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were not, and they fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration in the 1920s that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities suddenly reversed itself. Unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.<ref>Richard J. Jensen, \"The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553\u2013583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954 in JSTOR]; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]</ref>  City governments in 1930\u201331 tried to meet the depression by expanding [[Public works|public works projects]], as President Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However, tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931; no one was able to provide significant additional relief. People fell back on the cheapest possible relief, including soup kitchens providing free meals to anyone who showed up.<ref>Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)</ref> After 1933, new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.\n\nThe federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by President Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis. The [[alphabet agencies]] [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|FERA]], [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]] built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector. FERA, CCC and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.\n\nThe Democrats won easy landslide victories in 1932 and 1934, and an even bigger one in 1936; the hapless [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] seemed doomed. The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled and Catholics, Jews, and Blacks were especially impacted. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs. The cities' [[political machine]]s were stronger than ever, for they mobilized their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief. FDR won the vote of practically every demographic in 1936, including taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However, the Protestant middle class voters turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937\u201338 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system. However, for Roosevelt to win the presidency in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm rural voters. The machines came through for him.<ref>Roger Biles, ''Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago'' (1984).</ref>  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, [[Tammany Hall]] in Manhattan. There he [[History of New York City (1898\u20131945)#Politics|supported the complicated coalition]] built around the nominal Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]],  and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.<ref>Mason B. Williams, ''City of Ambition: FDR, LaGuardia, and the Making of Modern New York'' (2013)</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the Republicans made an unexpected comeback, and Roosevelt's efforts to purge the Democratic Party of his political opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took control of Congress, outvoted the urban liberals, and halted the expansion of New Deal ideas. Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities. In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored Willkie 52%\u201348%.<ref>Richard Jensen, \"The cities reelect Roosevelt: Ethnicity, religion, and class in 1940.\" ''Ethnicity.

Even before Pearl Harbor, Washington pumped massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.<ref>[[Jon C. Teaford]], ''The twentieth-century American city'' (1986) pp 90-96.</ref> The war brought a restoration of prosperity and hopeful expectations for the future across the nation.

They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending  (in 1935 dollars, or $1.95 million in year 2000 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide, and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Whaples and Randall E.

Families saw most or all of their assets disappear and their debts became heavier as prices fell. Local and provincial government set up relief programs but there was no nationwide New-Deal-like program. The [[15th Canadian Ministry|Conservative government]] of Prime Minister [[R. B.

Nevertheless, the [[Economy of Canada|Canadian economy]] suffered.

The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It is precisely because of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and after the collapse of the stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world in depression, 1929\u20131939|last=Kindleberger|first=Charles P.|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.\n\n=== Hoover Administration gold standard ===\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1930s, The United States began to try the tight money policy to promote economic growth. In terms of the fiscal policy, the US government failed to reach a consensus on the fiscal issue. President Hoover began to expand federal spending, he set up a governmental financial revitalization company to provide emergency assistance to banks and financial institutions that were on the verge of bankruptcy. Hoover's fiscal policy had accelerated the recession. In December 1929, as means of showing government confidence of the economy, Hoover reduced all income tax rates by 1% of 1929 due to the continuing budget surplus. By 1930, the surplus turned into a fast-growing deficit of economic contraction. In 1931, the US federal fiscal revenue and expenditure changed from the financial surplus to deficit for the first time (the deficit was less than 2.8% of GDP). By the end of 1931, Hoover had decided to recommend a large increase in taxes to balance the budget; in addition, Congress approved the tax increase in 1932, a substantial reduction in personal immunity to increase the number of taxpayers, and the interest rates had risen sharply, the lowest marginal rate rose from 25% on taxable income in excess of $100,000 to 63% on taxable income in excess of $1 million as the rates were made much more progressive. Hoover changed his approach to fighting the Depression. He justified his call for more federal assistance by noting that \"We used such emergency powers to win the war; we can use them to fight the Depression, the misery, and suffering from which are equally great.\" This new approach embraced a number of initiatives. Unfortunately for the President, none proved especially effective. Just as important, with the presidential election approaching, the political heat generated by the Great Depression and the failure of Hoover's policies grew only more withering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://millercenter.org/president/hoover/domestic-affairs|title=Herbert Hoover: Domestic Affairs {{!}} Miller Center|website=millercenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the financial reform, since the recession, Hoover had been trying to repair the economy. He founded government agencies to encourage labor harmony and support local public works aid which promoted cooperation of government and business, stabilize prices, and strive to balance the budget. His work focused on indirect relief from individual countries and the private sector, which was reflected in the letter emphasizing \"more effective supporting for each national committee\" and volunteer service -\" appealing for funding\" from outside the government.<ref name=\"Gilder Lehrman\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/new-deal/resources/herbert-hoover-great-depression-and-new-deal-1931%E2%80%931933|title=Herbert Hoover on the Great Depression and New Deal, 1931\u20131933 {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2013-07-24|website=gilderlehrman.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> The commitment to maintain the gold standard system prevented the Federal Reserve expanded its money supply operations in 1930 and 1931, and it promoted Hoover's destructive balancing budgetary action to avoid the gold standard system overwhelming the dollar. As the Great Depression became worse, the call raised for increasing in federal intervention and spending. But Hoover refused to allow the federal government to force fixed prices, control the value of the business or manipulate the currency, in contrast, he started to control the dollar price. For official dollar prices, he expanded the credit base through free market operations in federal reserve system to ensure the domestic value of the dollar. He also tended to provide indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, refused to use federal funds to give aid to citizens directly, which will reduce public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteering to raise money.<ref name=\"Gilder Lehrman\" /> Even though Hoover was a philanthropist before becoming president, his opponents regarded him as not responsible for the citizens. During the administration of Hoover, the US economic policies had moved to activism and interventionism. In his re-election campaign, Hoover tried to persuade the Americans to claim that the measures they requested seemed to be helpful in the short term, but it would be devastating in the long run. Eventually, he was defeated by Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.\n\n==== Consequences of the Hoover policy ====\nIn 1929, the Great Depression began, the asset bubble burst, and the unemployment rate rose. The following year, though most people thought that there was nothing worth worrying about, Hoover took decisive action on issues such as employment, construction, public construction, and agriculture, which helped restore public confidence. The unemployed population rose, although it remained less than 9%.\n\nIn 1931, \"the tragic year\", politicians and economists were convinced that the economy would recover in 1931, but a serious economic crisis and depression happened this year. In a somewhat critical atmosphere, at the Congress meeting in 1932, Hoover prepared to take more vigorous measures in the government work report which he submitted to the Congress. Primarily, Hoover affirmed his own achievements over the past two years. Owing to Hoover's policy having led to financial spending increases and financial difficulties, he decided to increase taxes.\n\n=== Roosevelt Administration gold standard ===\nAt the beginning of 1933, during the last few weeks of Hoover's term, the American financial system was paralyzed. The Great Depression had been extended by the interventionist policy for four years. Bank crisis caused the serious deflationary pressures. In fact, the worst period of 1932 \u2013 the Great Depression had passed, but the recovery was slow and weak. Roosevelt understood that traditional political and financial policy was not an adequate response to the crisis, and his administration chose to pursue the more radical measures of the [[New Deal]].\n<p>During the financial crisis of 1933 culminating in the banking holiday of March 1933, gold had flowed out from the Fed in large quantities, to individuals and companies in the United States worried about bank failures, and to foreign entities worried about the depreciation of the dollar.<ref name=\"Federal Reserve History\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts_gold_program|title=Roosevelt's Gold Program {{!}} Federal Reserve History|last=Richardson|first=Gary|website=federalreservehistory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> \n<p>In the spring and summer of 1933, the Roosevelt administration and the Congress took several actions that effectively suspended the gold standard. \nRoosevelt took office on March 4, 1933, and thirty-six hours later, he declared a nationwide bank moratorium in order to prevent a run on the banks by consumers lacking confidence in the economy. He also forbade banks to pay out gold or to export it. \n<p>On March 9, Congress passed the [[Emergency Banking Act]], giving the President the power to control international and domestic gold exports. It also gave the treasury secretary the power to surrender of gold coins and certificates. \n<p>On April 5, Roosevelt ordered all gold coins and gold certificates in denominations of more than $100 turned in for other money. It required all persons to deliver all gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve by May 1 for the set price of $20.67 per ounce. By May 10, the government had taken in $300 million of gold coin and $470 million of gold certificates.\n<p>On April 20, President Roosevelt issued a formal proclamation prohibiting gold exports, and prohibiting conversion of money and deposits into gold coins and ingots.\n<p>On May 12, the United States weakened the monetary connection with gold further when FDR signed the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]]. Title III of this act, also known as the Thomas amendment, gave the President power to reduce the dollar's gold content by as much as 50%. President Roosevelt also used the silver standard instead of gold to exchange dollars, it determined by the price of the bank.<ref name=\"Federal Reserve History\" /> \n<p>On June 5, Congress enacted a joint resolution nullifying the clauses in many public and private obligations that permitted creditors to demand repayment in gold.\n<p>In 1934, the government price of gold was increased to $35 per ounce, effectively increasing the gold on the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheets by 69 percent. This increase in assets allowed the Federal Reserve to further inflate the money supply.\nThe abandonment of the gold standard made the Wall Street stock prices quickly increase; Wall Street's stock trading was exceptionally active.\n\n==Political responses of the depression era==\n\n=== Hoover's response ===\n[[File:President Hoover portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Herbert Hoover]]\nThe [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover Administration]] attempted to correct the economic situation quickly, but was unsuccessful. Throughout Hoover's presidency, businesses were encouraged to keep wage rates high.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/746.html|title=A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> President Hoover and many academics believed that high wage rates would maintain a steady level of purchasing power, keeping the economy turning. In December 1929, after the beginning phases of the depression had begun, President Hoover continued to promote high wages. It wasn't until 1931 that business owners began reducing wages in order to stay afloat. Later that year, The Hoover Administration created the Check Tax<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ari.aynrand.org/blog/2017/02/01/the-great-depression-and-the-role-of-government-intervention|title=The Great Depression and the Role of Government Intervention|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> to generate extra government funding. The tax added a two cent tax to the purchase of all bank checks, directly affecting the common person. This additional cost pushed people away from using checks, so instead the majority of the population increased their usage of cash. Banks had already closed due to cash shortage, but this reaction to the Check Tax rapidly increased the pace.\n\n===Roosevelt's New Deal===\nIn the \"First New Deal\" of 1933\u201334, a wide variety of programs were targeted toward the depression and agriculture in rural areas, in the banking industry, and for the economy as a whole. Relief programs were set up for the long-term unemployed who are routinely passed over whenever new jobs did open up.<ref>Eric Rauchway. ''The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction'' (2008).</ref><ref>Aaron D. Purcell, ed. ''Interpreting American History: The New Deal and the Great Depression'' (2014).</ref> The most popular program was the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] that put young men to work in construction jobs, especially in rural areas. Prohibition was repealed, fulfilling a campaign pledge and generating new tax revenues for local and state government. A series of relief programs were designed to provide jobs, in cooperation with local governments.\n\nThe [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief through increased government spending. To end [[deflation]] the [[gold standard]] was suspended and a series of panels comprising business leaders in each industry set regulations which ended what was called \"cut-throat competition,\" believed to be responsible for forcing down prices and profits nationwide.<ref>Olivier Blanchard und Gerhard Illing, ''Makro\u00f6konomie'', Pearson Studium, 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8273-7363-2}}, pp. 696\u201397</ref>  Several Hoover agencies were continued, most notably the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], which provided large-scale financial aid to banks, railroads, and other agencies.<ref>James Stuart Olson, ''Saving Capitalism: The Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the New Deal, 1933\u20131940'' (2nd ed. 2017).</ref> Reforms that had never been enacted in the 1920s now took center stage, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) designed to electrify and modernize a very poor, mountainous region in Appalachia.\n\n[[File:NewDeal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Top left: the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], part of the [[New Deal]], being signed into law in 1933.<br />Top right: [[Franklin D.

Unemployment fell by \u2154 in Roosevelt's first term (from 25% to 9%, 1933\u20131937). The second set of reforms launched by the Roosevelt Administration during the same period included the [[Social Security Act|Social Security Act of 1935]]. Insurance and poor relief (\"public assistance\" or \"welfare\") are constituent parts of the legislation, which provided pensions to the aged, benefit payments to dependent mothers, crippled children and blind people, and unemployment insurance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1851.html|title=The New Deal|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> The Social Security Act still plays a significant role of the American health and human service system so far.

In 1937, the American economy unexpectedly fell, lasting through most of 1938. Production declined sharply, as did profits and employment. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938.<ref>Kenneth D. Roose, ''The Economics of Recession and Revival: An Interpretation of 1937\u201338'', (1969)</ref> A contributing factor to the Recession of 1937 was a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.

Ignoring the pleas of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], Roosevelt embarked on an antidote to the depression, reluctantly abandoning his efforts to balance the budget and launching a $5 billion spending program in the spring of 1938 in an effort to increase mass purchasing power.\n\n[[File:US Employment Graph - 1920 to 1940.svg|thumb|Total employment numbers in the United States from 1920 to 1940, excluding farms and [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]]]\n\nBusiness-oriented observers explained the recession and recovery in very different terms from the Keynesian economists. They argued the New Deal had been very hostile to business expansion in 1935\u201337. They said it had encouraged massive strikes which had a negative impact on major industries and had threatened anti-trust attacks on big corporations. But all those threats diminished sharply after 1938. For example, the antitrust efforts fizzled out without major cases. The [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] unions started battling each other more than corporations, and tax policy became more favorable to long-term growth.<ref>Gary Dean Best, ''Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933\u20131938'' (1990) pp 175\u2013216</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, according to economist [[Robert Higgs]], when looking only at the supply of consumer goods, significant GDP growth only resumed in 1946. (Higgs does not estimate the value to consumers of collective goods like victory in war.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Higgs |first=Robert |date=March 1992 |title=Wartime Prosperity?

''The Library of Congress''.</ref> By 1945, 17 million had entered service to their country, but that was not enough to absorb all the unemployed. During the war, the government subsidized wages through [[cost-plus contract]]s. Government contractors were paid in full for their costs, plus a certain percentage profit margin. That meant the more wages a person was paid the higher the company profits since the government would cover them plus a percentage.<ref>Paul A. C. Koistinen, ''Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940\u20131945'' (2004)</ref>\n\nUsing these cost-plus contracts in 1941\u20131943, factories hired hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers and trained them, at government expense. The military's own training programs concentrated on teaching technical skills involving machinery, engines, electronics and radio, preparing soldiers and sailors for the post-war economy.<ref>Jensen (1989); Edwin E.

(See [[Fair Employment Practices Commission|FEPC]]) Strikes (except in [[coal mining]]) were sharply reduced as unions pushed their members to work harder. Tens of thousands of new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery care for children making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of all these factors drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.<ref>Harold G. Vester. ''The U.S. Economy in World War III''. (1988)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's declining popularity in 1938 was evident throughout the US in the business community, the press, and the Senate and House. Many were labeling the recession the \"Roosevelt Recession\". In late December 1938, Roosevelt looked to gain popularity with the American people, and try to regain the nation's confidence in the economy. His decision that December to name [[Harry Hopkins]] as [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] was an attempt to achieve the confidence he so badly needed. The appointment came as a surprise to most because of Hopkins' lack of business experience, but proved to be vastly important in shaping the years following the recession.<ref name=\"Smiley, Gene 2002\">Smiley, Gene. ''Rethinking the Great Depression''. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, publisher. 2002.</ref>\n\nHopkins made it his mission to strengthen ties between the Roosevelt administration and the business community. While Roosevelt believed in complete reform (The New Deal), Hopkins took a more administrative position;{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} he felt that recovery was imperative and that The New Deal would continue to hinder recovery. With support from [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Henry A.

The biggest shift towards recovery, however, came with the decision of Germany to invade France at the beginning of WWII. After France had been defeated, the U.S. economy would skyrocket in the months following. France's defeat meant that Britain and other allies would look to the U.S. for large supplies of materials for the war.<ref name=\"Hall, Thomas E. 1998. pg 155\">Hall, Thomas E., and Ferguson, David J. \"The Great Depression: An International Disaster of Perverse Economic Policies\".

Also hard hit was the manufacturing of durable goods like automobiles and appliances, whose purchase consumers could postpone. The economy hit bottom in the winter of 1932\u201333; then came four years of growth until the [[recession of 1937\u201338]] brought back high levels of unemployment.<ref>Chandler (1970); Jensen (1989); Mitchell (1964)</ref>\n\n[[File:Real GDP of the United States from 1910-1960.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|US annual real GDP from 1910 to 1960, with the years of the Great Depression (1929\u20131939) highlighted]]\n[[File:US Unemployment from 1910-1960.svg|thumb|300px|Unemployment rate in the US 1910\u201360, with the years of the Great Depression (1929\u201339) highlighted; accurate data begins in 1939, represented by a blue line.]]\n\nThe Depression caused major political changes in America. Three years into the depression, President [[Herbert Hoover]], widely shamed for not doing enough to combat the crisis, lost the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]] to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] by an embarrassingly wide margin. Roosevelt's economic recovery plan, the [[New Deal]], instituted unprecedented programs for relief, recovery and reform, and brought about a major realignment of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].\n\nThe Depression also resulted in an increase of [[emigration]] for the first time in American history. Some immigrants went back to their native countries, and some native U.S. citizens went to [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. There were mass migrations of people from badly hit areas in the [[Great Plains]] (the [[Okies]]) and the South to places such as California and the cities of the North (the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]).<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/afctshtml/tsme.html The Migrant Experience].

Retrieved on 2013-07-14.</ref> Racial tensions also increased during this time. By the 1940s immigration had returned to normal, and emigration declined. A well-known example of an emigrant was [[Frank McCourt]], who went to [[Ireland]], as recounted in his book ''[[Angela's Ashes]]''.\n\nThe memory of the Depression also shaped modern theories of economics and resulted in many changes in how the government dealt with economic downturns, such as the use of [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus packages]], [[Keynesian economics]], and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. It also shaped modern American literature, resulting in famous novels such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''.\n\nExamining the [[causes of the Great Depression]] raises multiple issues: what factors set off the first downturn in 1929; what structural weaknesses and specific events turned it into a major depression; how the downturn spread from country to country; and why the economic recovery was so prolonged.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Defining Moment: The Great Depression and the American Economy in the Twentieth Century |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-226-06589-2 |editor-last=Bordo |editor-first=Michael D. |editor-link=Michael D.

There was no [[FDIC|federal deposit insurance]] during that time as [[Bank failure|bank failures]] were considered a normal part of economic life. Worried depositors started to withdraw savings, so the [[money multiplier]] worked in reverse. Banks were forced to liquidate assets (such as calling in loans rather than creating new loans).<ref name=\"Fuller 2012\">Robert Fuller (2012), ''Phantom of Fear: The Banking Panic of 1933'', pp. 241\u201342 fn. 45</ref> This caused the [[money supply]] to shrink and the economy to contract (the [[Great Contraction]]), resulting in a significant decline in aggregate investment.

However, the high interest also inhibited domestic business borrowing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nThe U.S. interest rates were also affected by [[France]]'s decision to raise their interest rates to attract gold to their vaults. In theory, the U.S. would have two potential responses to that: Allow the [[exchange rate]] to adjust, or increase their own interest rates to maintain the gold standard. At the time, the U.S. was pegged to the gold standard. Therefore, Americans converted their dollars into [[Franc|francs]] to buy more French assets, the demand for the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] fell, and the exchange rate increased.

It began on October 24, 1929, and was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States. Much of the stock market crash can be attributed to exuberance and false expectations. In the years leading up to 1929, the rising stock market prices had created vast sums of wealth in relation to amounts invested, in turn encouraging borrowing to further buy more stock. However, on October 24 (Black Thursday), share prices began to fall and panic selling caused prices to fall sharply. On October 29 (Black Tuesday), share prices fell by $14 billion in a single day, more than $30 billion in the week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/economic-forces/the-economic-causes-and-impacts-of-the-stock-market-crash-of-1929-fall-2012|title=The Economic Causes and Impacts of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 (Fall 2012) - Historpedia|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> The value that evaporated that week was ten times more than the entire federal budget and more than all of what the U.S. had spent on [[World War I]].

After the stock market crash and the bank closures, people were afraid of losing more money. Because of their fears of further economic challenge, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing and consuming. Thousands of individual investors who believed they could get rich by investing on margin lost everything they had. The stock market crash severely impacted the American economy.\n\n==Banking failures==\n\nA large contribution to the [[recession]] was the closure and suspension of thousands of banks across the country. Financial institutions failed for several reasons, including unregulated lending procedures, confidence in the [[Gold standard]], [[consumer confidence]] in future economics, and agricultural defaults on outstanding loans. With these compounding issues the banking system struggled to keep up with the public's increasing demand for cash withdrawals. This overall decreased the money supply and forced the banks to result to [[short sale (real estate)]] and [[liquidation]] of existing loans.<ref name=\"Fuller 2012\" /> In the race to liquidate assets the banking system began to fail on a wide scale. In November 1930 the first major banking crisis began with over 800 banks closing their doors by January 1931. By October 1931 over 2100 banks were suspended with the highest suspension rate recorded in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District, with 2 out of every 5 banks suspended.<ref>\"Banking Panics (1930\u20131933).\" Encyclopedia of the Great Depression. Encyclopedia.com. 13 Jun. 2017<http://www.encyclopedia.com>.</ref> The economy as a whole experienced a massive reduction in banking footholds across the country amounting to more than nine thousand closed banks by 1933. \n[[File:Banking_Closure_in_1929_-_New_York_City.jpg|thumb|People outside a closed bank after 1929 stock market crash.]]\n\nThe closures resulted in a massive withdrawal of deposits by millions of Americans estimated at near $6.8 billion (equivalent to around $60 billion in today's dollars). During this time the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) was not in place resulting in a loss of roughly $1.36 billion (or 20%) of the total $6.8 billion accounted for within the failed banks. These losses came directly from everyday individuals' savings, investments and bank accounts. As a result, [[GDP]] fell from the high seven-hundreds in 1929 to the low to mid six-hundreds in 1933 before seeing any recovery for the first time in nearly 4 years.<ref>USA annual GDP from 1910-60, in billions of constant 2005 dollars, with the years of the [[Great Depression]] (1929\u20131939) highlighted. Based on data from: Louis D. Johnston and Samuel H. Williamson, \"What Was the U.S. GDP Then?\" MeasuringWorth, 2008</ref> Federal leadership intervention is highly debated on its effectiveness and overall participation. The [[Federal Reserve Act]] could not effectively tackle the banking crisis as state bank and trust companies were not compelled to be a member, paper eligible discount member banks heavily restricted access to the Federal Reserve, power between the twelve Federal Reserve banks was decentralized and federal level leadership was ineffective, inexperienced, and weak.\n\n===Unregulated growth===\n\nThroughout the early 1900s banking regulations were extremely lax if not non-existent. The Currency Act of 1900 lowered the required [[Capital (economics)|capital]] of investors from 50,000 to 25,000 to create a [[national bank]]. As a result of this change nearly two thirds of the banks formed over the next ten years were quite small, averaging just above the 25,000 in required capital.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 39-41. Web. 2005</ref> The number of banks would nearly double (number of banks divided by Real GDP) from 1890 to 1920 due to the lack of oversight and qualification when banking [[charter]]s were being issued in the first two decades of the 1900s.<ref>(Federal Reserve Board 1933, 63\u201365).</ref>\n\nThe unregulated growth of small rural banking institutions can be partially attributed to the rising cost of [[agriculture]] especially in the [[Corn Belt]] and [[Cotton Belt]]. Throughout the corn and cotton belts real estate increases drove the demand for more local funding to continue to supply rising agricultural economics. The rural banking structures would supply the needed capital to meet the farm [[commodity market]], however, this came with a price of reliability and low risk lending. Economic growth was promising from 1887 to 1920 with an average of 6 percent growth in [GDP]. In particular the participation in [[World War I]] drove a booming agricultural market that drove optimism at the consumer and lending level which, in turn, resulted in a more lax approach in the lending process. Over banked conditions existed which pressured struggling banks to increase their services (specifically to the agricultural customers) without any additional regulatory oversight or qualifications. This dilemma introduced several high risk and marginal business returns to the banking market.<ref>Federal Reserve Board 1933, 67.</ref> Banking growth would continue through the first two decades well outside of previous trends disregarding the current economic and population standards. Banking profitability and loan standards begin to deteriorate as early as 1900 as a result. \n[[File:Dust storm approaching Stratford, Texas 1935.jpg|thumb|Approaching dust storm near Stratford, Texas. April 18, 1935.]]\nCrop failures beginning in 1921 began to impact this poorly regulated system, the expansion areas of corn and cotton suffered the largest due to the [[dust bowl]] era resulting in real estate value reductions. In addition, the year 1921 was the peak for banking expansion with roughly 31,000 banks in activity, however, with the failures at the agricultural level 505 banks would close between 1921 -1930 marking the largest banking system failure on record.  Regulatory questions began to hit the debating table around banking qualifications as a result; discussions would continue into the [Great Depression] as not only were banks failing but some would disappear altogether with no rhyme or reason.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 39-53. Web. 21 May 2017.</ref> The panic of financial crisis would increase in the Great Depression due to the lack of confidence in the regulatory and recovery displayed during the 1920s, this ultimately drove a nation of doubts, uneasiness, and lack of consumer confidence in the banking system.\n\n===Contagion===\n\nWith a lack of consumer confidence in the economic direction given by the federal government panic started to spread across the country shortly after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. President Hoover retained the [[Gold Standard]] as the country's currency gauge throughout the following years. As a result, the American shareholders with the majority of the gold reserves began to grow wary of the value of gold in the near future. [[Europe]]'s decision to move away from the [[Gold Standard]] caused individuals to start to withdraw gold shares and move the investments out of the country or began to hoard gold for future investment. The market continued to suffer due to these reactions, and in result caused several of the everyday individuals to speculate on the economy in the coming months.  Rumors of market stability and banking conditions began to spread, consumer confidence continued to drop and panic began to set in. Contagion spread like wild fire pushing Americans all over the country to withdraw their deposits ''en masse''. This idea would continue from 1929-1933 causing the greatest financial crisis ever seen at the banking level pushing the economic recovery efforts further from resolution. An increase in the currency-deposit ratio and a money stock determinant forced money stock to fall and income to decline. This panic-induced banking failure took a mild recession to a major recession.<ref>Richardson, Gary. \"Banking Panics of 1930\u201331\". Federal Reserve History. N.p., 22 Nov. 2013. Web. 13 June 2017</ref>\n\nWhether this caused the Great Depression is still heavily debated due to many other attributing factors. However, it is evident that the banking system suffered massive reductions across the country due to the lack of consumer confidence. As withdraw requests would exceed cash availability banks began conducting steed discount sales such as fire sales and short sales. Due to the inability to immediately determine current value worth these fire sales and short sales would result in massive losses when recuperating any possible revenue for outstanding and defaulted loans. This would allow healthy banks to take advantage of the struggling units forcing additional losses resulting in banks not being able to deliver on depositor demands and creating a failing cycle that would become widespread.<ref>Walter, John R. \"Failures: The Great Contagion or the Great Shakeout?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly Volume 91/1 Winter 2005 91.1 (2005): 45\u201346. Web. 2005</ref> Investment would continue to stay low through the next half decade as the private sector would hoard savings due to uncertainty of the future. The federal government would run additional policy changes such as the Check tax, monetary restrictions (including reduction of money supply by burning), High Wage Policy, and the New Deal through the Hoover and Roosevelt administration.\n\n==Urban desperation politic==\n[[File:Huts and unemployed, West Houston and Mercer St., Manhattan (NYPL b13668355-482853).jpg|thumb|Huts and unemployed men in New York City, 1935]]\nOne visible effect of the depression was the advent of [[Hooverville]]s,  which were ramshackle assemblages on vacant lots of cardboard boxes, tents, and small rickety wooden sheds built by homeless people. Residents lived in the shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the [[Democratic National Committee]], to refer sardonically to President [[Herbert Hoover]] whose policies Michelson blamed for the depression.<ref>Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88</ref>\n\nThe government did not calculate unemployment rates in the 1930s. The most widely accepted estimates of unemployment rates for the Great Depression are those by Stanley Lebergott from the 1950s. He estimated that unemployment reached 24.9 percent in the worst days of 1933. Another commonly cited estimate is by Michael Darby in 1976. He put the unemployment rate at a peak of 22.5 percent in 1932.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smiley |first1=Gene |title=Recent Unemployment Rate Estimates for the 1920s and 1930s |url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~gwallace/Papers/2120839.pdf |website=wisc.edu |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Job losses were less severe among women, workers in non durable industries (such as food and clothing), services and sales workers, and those employed by the government. Unskilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates. Age also played a factor. Young people had a hard time getting their first job. Men over the age of 45, if they lost their job, would rarely find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were not, and they fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration in the 1920s that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities suddenly reversed itself. Unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.<ref>Richard J. Jensen, \"The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553\u2013583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954 in JSTOR]; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]</ref>  City governments in 1930\u201331 tried to meet the depression by expanding [[Public works|public works projects]], as President Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However, tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931; no one was able to provide significant additional relief. People fell back on the cheapest possible relief, including soup kitchens providing free meals to anyone who showed up.<ref>Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)</ref> After 1933, new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.\n\nThe federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by President Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis. The [[alphabet agencies]] [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|FERA]], [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]] built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector. FERA, CCC and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.\n\nThe Democrats won easy landslide victories in 1932 and 1934, and an even bigger one in 1936; the hapless [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] seemed doomed. The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled and Catholics, Jews, and Blacks were especially impacted. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs. The cities' [[political machine]]s were stronger than ever, for they mobilized their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief. FDR won the vote of practically every demographic in 1936, including taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However, the Protestant middle class voters turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937\u201338 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system. However, for Roosevelt to win the presidency in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm rural voters. The machines came through for him.<ref>Roger Biles, ''Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago'' (1984).</ref>  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, [[Tammany Hall]] in Manhattan. There he [[History of New York City (1898\u20131945)#Politics|supported the complicated coalition]] built around the nominal Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]],  and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.<ref>Mason B. Williams, ''City of Ambition: FDR, LaGuardia, and the Making of Modern New York'' (2013)</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the Republicans made an unexpected comeback, and Roosevelt's efforts to purge the Democratic Party of his political opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took control of Congress, outvoted the urban liberals, and halted the expansion of New Deal ideas. Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities. In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored Willkie 52%\u201348%.<ref>Richard Jensen, \"The cities reelect Roosevelt: Ethnicity, religion, and class in 1940.\" ''Ethnicity.

Even before Pearl Harbor, Washington pumped massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.<ref>[[Jon C. Teaford]], ''The twentieth-century American city'' (1986) pp 90-96.</ref> The war brought a restoration of prosperity and hopeful expectations for the future across the nation.

They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending  (in 1935 dollars, or $1.95 million in year 2000 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide, and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Whaples and Randall E.

The boom of the US economy in the 1920s was based on high indebtedness, and the rupture of the debt chain caused by the collapse of the bank had produced widespread and far-reaching adverse effects. It is precisely because of the shaky banking system, the United States was using monetary policy to save the economy that had been severely constrained. The American economist [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] of long-term studying of the Great Depression pointed out that in the 1929, before and after the collapse of the stock market, the Fed lowered interest rates, tried to expand the money supply and eased the financial market tensions for several times, however they were not successful, the fundamental reason was that the relationship between various credit institutions and the community was in a drastic adjustment process, the normal supply channels for money supply were blocked.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world in depression, 1929\u20131939|last=Kindleberger|first=Charles P.|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Later, some economists argued that the Fed should do a large-scale opening market business at that time, but the essence of the statement was that the US government should be quick to implement measures to expand fiscal spending and fiscal deficits, whereas, the essence of this argument was that the US government should be promptly implemented to expand the fiscal spending and the fiscal deficits measures.\n\n=== Hoover Administration gold standard ===\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1930s, The United States began to try the tight money policy to promote economic growth. In terms of the fiscal policy, the US government failed to reach a consensus on the fiscal issue. President Hoover began to expand federal spending, he set up a governmental financial revitalization company to provide emergency assistance to banks and financial institutions that were on the verge of bankruptcy. Hoover's fiscal policy had accelerated the recession. In December 1929, as means of showing government confidence of the economy, Hoover reduced all income tax rates by 1% of 1929 due to the continuing budget surplus. By 1930, the surplus turned into a fast-growing deficit of economic contraction. In 1931, the US federal fiscal revenue and expenditure changed from the financial surplus to deficit for the first time (the deficit was less than 2.8% of GDP). By the end of 1931, Hoover had decided to recommend a large increase in taxes to balance the budget; in addition, Congress approved the tax increase in 1932, a substantial reduction in personal immunity to increase the number of taxpayers, and the interest rates had risen sharply, the lowest marginal rate rose from 25% on taxable income in excess of $100,000 to 63% on taxable income in excess of $1 million as the rates were made much more progressive. Hoover changed his approach to fighting the Depression. He justified his call for more federal assistance by noting that \"We used such emergency powers to win the war; we can use them to fight the Depression, the misery, and suffering from which are equally great.\" This new approach embraced a number of initiatives. Unfortunately for the President, none proved especially effective. Just as important, with the presidential election approaching, the political heat generated by the Great Depression and the failure of Hoover's policies grew only more withering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://millercenter.org/president/hoover/domestic-affairs|title=Herbert Hoover: Domestic Affairs {{!}} Miller Center|website=millercenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the financial reform, since the recession, Hoover had been trying to repair the economy. He founded government agencies to encourage labor harmony and support local public works aid which promoted cooperation of government and business, stabilize prices, and strive to balance the budget. His work focused on indirect relief from individual countries and the private sector, which was reflected in the letter emphasizing \"more effective supporting for each national committee\" and volunteer service -\" appealing for funding\" from outside the government.<ref name=\"Gilder Lehrman\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/new-deal/resources/herbert-hoover-great-depression-and-new-deal-1931%E2%80%931933|title=Herbert Hoover on the Great Depression and New Deal, 1931\u20131933 {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2013-07-24|website=gilderlehrman.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> The commitment to maintain the gold standard system prevented the Federal Reserve expanded its money supply operations in 1930 and 1931, and it promoted Hoover's destructive balancing budgetary action to avoid the gold standard system overwhelming the dollar. As the Great Depression became worse, the call raised for increasing in federal intervention and spending. But Hoover refused to allow the federal government to force fixed prices, control the value of the business or manipulate the currency, in contrast, he started to control the dollar price. For official dollar prices, he expanded the credit base through free market operations in federal reserve system to ensure the domestic value of the dollar. He also tended to provide indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, refused to use federal funds to give aid to citizens directly, which will reduce public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteering to raise money.<ref name=\"Gilder Lehrman\" /> Even though Hoover was a philanthropist before becoming president, his opponents regarded him as not responsible for the citizens. During the administration of Hoover, the US economic policies had moved to activism and interventionism. In his re-election campaign, Hoover tried to persuade the Americans to claim that the measures they requested seemed to be helpful in the short term, but it would be devastating in the long run. Eventually, he was defeated by Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.\n\n==== Consequences of the Hoover policy ====\nIn 1929, the Great Depression began, the asset bubble burst, and the unemployment rate rose. The following year, though most people thought that there was nothing worth worrying about, Hoover took decisive action on issues such as employment, construction, public construction, and agriculture, which helped restore public confidence. The unemployed population rose, although it remained less than 9%.\n\nIn 1931, \"the tragic year\", politicians and economists were convinced that the economy would recover in 1931, but a serious economic crisis and depression happened this year. In a somewhat critical atmosphere, at the Congress meeting in 1932, Hoover prepared to take more vigorous measures in the government work report which he submitted to the Congress. Primarily, Hoover affirmed his own achievements over the past two years. Owing to Hoover's policy having led to financial spending increases and financial difficulties, he decided to increase taxes.\n\n=== Roosevelt Administration gold standard ===\nAt the beginning of 1933, during the last few weeks of Hoover's term, the American financial system was paralyzed. The Great Depression had been extended by the interventionist policy for four years. Bank crisis caused the serious deflationary pressures. In fact, the worst period of 1932 \u2013 the Great Depression had passed, but the recovery was slow and weak. Roosevelt understood that traditional political and financial policy was not an adequate response to the crisis, and his administration chose to pursue the more radical measures of the [[New Deal]].\n<p>During the financial crisis of 1933 culminating in the banking holiday of March 1933, gold had flowed out from the Fed in large quantities, to individuals and companies in the United States worried about bank failures, and to foreign entities worried about the depreciation of the dollar.<ref name=\"Federal Reserve History\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts_gold_program|title=Roosevelt's Gold Program {{!}} Federal Reserve History|last=Richardson|first=Gary|website=federalreservehistory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> \n<p>In the spring and summer of 1933, the Roosevelt administration and the Congress took several actions that effectively suspended the gold standard. \nRoosevelt took office on March 4, 1933, and thirty-six hours later, he declared a nationwide bank moratorium in order to prevent a run on the banks by consumers lacking confidence in the economy. He also forbade banks to pay out gold or to export it. \n<p>On March 9, Congress passed the [[Emergency Banking Act]], giving the President the power to control international and domestic gold exports. It also gave the treasury secretary the power to surrender of gold coins and certificates. \n<p>On April 5, Roosevelt ordered all gold coins and gold certificates in denominations of more than $100 turned in for other money. It required all persons to deliver all gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve by May 1 for the set price of $20.67 per ounce. By May 10, the government had taken in $300 million of gold coin and $470 million of gold certificates.\n<p>On April 20, President Roosevelt issued a formal proclamation prohibiting gold exports, and prohibiting conversion of money and deposits into gold coins and ingots.\n<p>On May 12, the United States weakened the monetary connection with gold further when FDR signed the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]]. Title III of this act, also known as the Thomas amendment, gave the President power to reduce the dollar's gold content by as much as 50%. President Roosevelt also used the silver standard instead of gold to exchange dollars, it determined by the price of the bank.<ref name=\"Federal Reserve History\" /> \n<p>On June 5, Congress enacted a joint resolution nullifying the clauses in many public and private obligations that permitted creditors to demand repayment in gold.\n<p>In 1934, the government price of gold was increased to $35 per ounce, effectively increasing the gold on the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheets by 69 percent. This increase in assets allowed the Federal Reserve to further inflate the money supply.\nThe abandonment of the gold standard made the Wall Street stock prices quickly increase; Wall Street's stock trading was exceptionally active.\n\n==Political responses of the depression era==\n\n=== Hoover's response ===\n[[File:President Hoover portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Herbert Hoover]]\nThe [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover Administration]] attempted to correct the economic situation quickly, but was unsuccessful. Throughout Hoover's presidency, businesses were encouraged to keep wage rates high.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/746.html|title=A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> President Hoover and many academics believed that high wage rates would maintain a steady level of purchasing power, keeping the economy turning. In December 1929, after the beginning phases of the depression had begun, President Hoover continued to promote high wages. It wasn't until 1931 that business owners began reducing wages in order to stay afloat. Later that year, The Hoover Administration created the Check Tax<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ari.aynrand.org/blog/2017/02/01/the-great-depression-and-the-role-of-government-intervention|title=The Great Depression and the Role of Government Intervention|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> to generate extra government funding. The tax added a two cent tax to the purchase of all bank checks, directly affecting the common person. This additional cost pushed people away from using checks, so instead the majority of the population increased their usage of cash. Banks had already closed due to cash shortage, but this reaction to the Check Tax rapidly increased the pace.\n\n===Roosevelt's New Deal===\nIn the \"First New Deal\" of 1933\u201334, a wide variety of programs were targeted toward the depression and agriculture in rural areas, in the banking industry, and for the economy as a whole. Relief programs were set up for the long-term unemployed who are routinely passed over whenever new jobs did open up.<ref>Eric Rauchway. ''The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction'' (2008).</ref><ref>Aaron D. Purcell, ed. ''Interpreting American History: The New Deal and the Great Depression'' (2014).</ref> The most popular program was the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] that put young men to work in construction jobs, especially in rural areas. Prohibition was repealed, fulfilling a campaign pledge and generating new tax revenues for local and state government. A series of relief programs were designed to provide jobs, in cooperation with local governments.\n\nThe [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief through increased government spending. To end [[deflation]] the [[gold standard]] was suspended and a series of panels comprising business leaders in each industry set regulations which ended what was called \"cut-throat competition,\" believed to be responsible for forcing down prices and profits nationwide.<ref>Olivier Blanchard und Gerhard Illing, ''Makro\u00f6konomie'', Pearson Studium, 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8273-7363-2}}, pp. 696\u201397</ref>  Several Hoover agencies were continued, most notably the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], which provided large-scale financial aid to banks, railroads, and other agencies.<ref>James Stuart Olson, ''Saving Capitalism: The Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the New Deal, 1933\u20131940'' (2nd ed. 2017).</ref> Reforms that had never been enacted in the 1920s now took center stage, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) designed to electrify and modernize a very poor, mountainous region in Appalachia.\n\n[[File:NewDeal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Top left: the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], part of the [[New Deal]], being signed into law in 1933.<br />Top right: [[Franklin D.

Unemployment fell by \u2154 in Roosevelt's first term (from 25% to 9%, 1933\u20131937). The second set of reforms launched by the Roosevelt Administration during the same period included the [[Social Security Act|Social Security Act of 1935]]. Insurance and poor relief (\"public assistance\" or \"welfare\") are constituent parts of the legislation, which provided pensions to the aged, benefit payments to dependent mothers, crippled children and blind people, and unemployment insurance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1851.html|title=The New Deal|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> The Social Security Act still plays a significant role of the American health and human service system so far.

In 1937, the American economy unexpectedly fell, lasting through most of 1938. Production declined sharply, as did profits and employment. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938.<ref>Kenneth D. Roose, ''The Economics of Recession and Revival: An Interpretation of 1937\u201338'', (1969)</ref> A contributing factor to the Recession of 1937 was a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.

Ignoring the pleas of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], Roosevelt embarked on an antidote to the depression, reluctantly abandoning his efforts to balance the budget and launching a $5 billion spending program in the spring of 1938 in an effort to increase mass purchasing power.\n\n[[File:US Employment Graph - 1920 to 1940.svg|thumb|Total employment numbers in the United States from 1920 to 1940, excluding farms and [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]]]\n\nBusiness-oriented observers explained the recession and recovery in very different terms from the Keynesian economists. They argued the New Deal had been very hostile to business expansion in 1935\u201337. They said it had encouraged massive strikes which had a negative impact on major industries and had threatened anti-trust attacks on big corporations. But all those threats diminished sharply after 1938. For example, the antitrust efforts fizzled out without major cases. The [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] unions started battling each other more than corporations, and tax policy became more favorable to long-term growth.<ref>Gary Dean Best, ''Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933\u20131938'' (1990) pp 175\u2013216</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, according to economist [[Robert Higgs]], when looking only at the supply of consumer goods, significant GDP growth only resumed in 1946. (Higgs does not estimate the value to consumers of collective goods like victory in war.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Higgs |first=Robert |date=March 1992 |title=Wartime Prosperity?

''The Library of Congress''.</ref> By 1945, 17 million had entered service to their country, but that was not enough to absorb all the unemployed. During the war, the government subsidized wages through [[cost-plus contract]]s. Government contractors were paid in full for their costs, plus a certain percentage profit margin. That meant the more wages a person was paid the higher the company profits since the government would cover them plus a percentage.<ref>Paul A. C. Koistinen, ''Arsenal of World War II: The Political Economy of American Warfare, 1940\u20131945'' (2004)</ref>\n\nUsing these cost-plus contracts in 1941\u20131943, factories hired hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers and trained them, at government expense. The military's own training programs concentrated on teaching technical skills involving machinery, engines, electronics and radio, preparing soldiers and sailors for the post-war economy.<ref>Jensen (1989); Edwin E.

(See [[Fair Employment Practices Commission|FEPC]]) Strikes (except in [[coal mining]]) were sharply reduced as unions pushed their members to work harder. Tens of thousands of new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery care for children making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of all these factors drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.<ref>Harold G. Vester. ''The U.S. Economy in World War III''. (1988)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's declining popularity in 1938 was evident throughout the US in the business community, the press, and the Senate and House. Many were labeling the recession the \"Roosevelt Recession\". In late December 1938, Roosevelt looked to gain popularity with the American people, and try to regain the nation's confidence in the economy. His decision that December to name [[Harry Hopkins]] as [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] was an attempt to achieve the confidence he so badly needed. The appointment came as a surprise to most because of Hopkins' lack of business experience, but proved to be vastly important in shaping the years following the recession.<ref name=\"Smiley, Gene 2002\">Smiley, Gene. ''Rethinking the Great Depression''. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, publisher. 2002.</ref>\n\nHopkins made it his mission to strengthen ties between the Roosevelt administration and the business community. While Roosevelt believed in complete reform (The New Deal), Hopkins took a more administrative position;{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} he felt that recovery was imperative and that The New Deal would continue to hinder recovery. With support from [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]] and [[United States Treasury Secretary|Treasury Secretary]] [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr]], popular support for recovery, rather than reform, swept the nation. By the end of 1938 reform had been struck down, as no new reform laws were passed.<ref name=\"Smiley, Gene 2002\"/>\n\nThe economy in America was now beginning to show signs of recovery and the unemployment rate was lowering following the abysmal year of 1938. The biggest shift towards recovery, however, came with the decision of Germany to invade France at the beginning of WWII. After France had been defeated, the U.S. economy would skyrocket in the months following. France's defeat meant that Britain and other allies would look to the U.S. for large supplies of materials for the war.<ref name=\"Hall, Thomas E. 1998. pg 155\">Hall, Thomas E., and Ferguson, David J. \"The Great Depression: An International Disaster of Perverse Economic Policies\".

Moreover, Britain chose to pay for their materials in gold.

The medium is commonly applied to the base with a [[brush]], but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and [[airbrush]]es, can be used.  The final work is also called a painting.\n\nPainting is an important form in the [[visual arts]], bringing in elements such as [[drawing]], [[gesture]] (as in [[gestural painting]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[narrative|narration]] (as in [[narrative art]]), or [[abstraction]] (as in [[abstract art]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=Lincoln|title=The Music of Painting|journal=The American Scholar|date=Summer 2014|volume=83|issue=3|page=85}}</ref> Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a [[still life]] or [[landscape art|landscape painting]]), [[Photorealism|photographic]], abstract, narrative, [[symbol]]istic (as in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist art]]), [[emotion|emotive]] (as in [[Expressionism]]), or [[Politics|political]] in nature (as in [[Artivism]]).\n\nA portion of the [[history of painting]] in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by [[religious art]]. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting [[Mythology|mythological]] figures on pottery, to [[Bible|Biblical]] scenes [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], to scenes from the life of [[Chinese painting|Buddha]] or other images of [[Eastern art history|Eastern religious origin]].\n\nIn [[art]], the term ''painting ''describes both the act and the result of the action. The support for paintings includes such surfaces as [[wall]]s, [[paper]], [[canvas]], wood, [[glass]], [[lacquer]], [[pottery]], [[leaf]], [[copper]] and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, as well as objects.\n\n==Elements of painting==\n[[File:Chen Hongshou, leaf album painting.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chen Hongshou]] (1598\u20131652), ''Leaf album painting'' ([[Ming dynasty]])]]\n\n===Color and tone===\n[[Color]], made up of [[hue]], [[Saturation color|saturation]], and [[Value (color)|value]], dispersed over a surface is the essence of painting, just as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[rhythm]] are the essence of [[music]]. Color is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]],<ref>[https://archive.org/details/goethestheoryco01goetgoog Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Goethe's theory of colours], John Murray, London 1840</ref> [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]],<ref>Wassily Kandinsky Concerning The Spiritual in Art, [Translated By Michael T. H. Sadler, [http://www.semantikon.com/art/kandinskyspiritualinart.pdf pdf].</ref> and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]],<ref>A letter to the Royal Society presenting A new theory of light and colours Isaac Newton, 1671 [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/newton1671.pdf pdf]</ref> have written their own [[color theory]].\n\nMoreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a color equivalent. The word \"[[red]]\", for example, can cover a wide range of variations from the pure red of the [[visible spectrum]] of light. There is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as [[F (musical note)|F]] or [[C\u266f (musical note)|C\u266f]]. For a painter, color is not simply divided into basic (primary) and derived (complementary or mixed) colors (like red, blue, green, brown, etc.).\n\nPainters deal practically with [[pigments]],<ref>[http://colourlex.com/pigments/pigments-colour/ Pigments] at ColourLex</ref> so \"[[blue]]\" for a painter can be any of the blues: [[phthalocyanine blue]], [[Prussian blue]], [[indigo]], [[Cobalt blue]], [[ultramarine]], and so on. Psychological and symbolical meanings of color are not, strictly speaking, means of painting. Colors only add to the potential, derived context of meanings, and because of this, the perception of a painting is highly subjective. The analogy with music is quite clear\u2014sound in music (like a C note) is analogous to \"light\" in painting, \"shades\" to [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and \"coloration\" is to painting as the specific [[Tone color|timbre]] of musical instruments is to music. These elements do not necessarily form a melody (in music) of themselves; rather, they can add different contexts to it.\n\n[[File:Georges Seurat 066.jpg|thumb|''[[Parade de cirque|Circus Sideshow]] ({{Lang-fr|Parade de cirque}})'', [[Georges Seurat]], 1887\u201388|alt=Shows a pointillist painting of a trombone soloist.]]\n\n===Non-traditional elements===\nModern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, as one example, [[collage]], which began with [[Cubism]] and is not painting in the strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as metal, plastic, [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]], [[Leaf painting|leaves]] or [[wood]] for their [[Texture (painting)|texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Jean Dubuffet]] and [[Anselm Kiefer]]. There is a growing community of artists who use computers to \"paint\" color onto a digital \"canvas\" using programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Corel Painter]], and many others. These images can be printed onto traditional canvas if required.\n\n===Rhythm===\n[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1906, La dance (Bacchante), oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm DSC05359...jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], c.1906, ''[[La danse, Bacchante|La danse (Bacchante)]]'', oil on canvas, 73 x 54&nbsp;cm, [[Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum]]]]\n[[Jean Metzinger]]'s mosaic-like [[Divisionist]] technique had its parallel in literature; a characteristic of the alliance between [[Symbolist]] writers and Neo-Impressionist artists:\n\n<blockquote>I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescences and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature. (Jean Metzinger, circa 1907)<ref>Jean Metzinger, circa 1907, quoted by Georges Desvalli\u00e8res in La Grande Revue, vol. 124, 1907</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1921 - Composition en rouge, jaune, bleu et noir.jpg|thumb|[[Piet Mondrian]], 1921, ''Composition en rouge, jaune, bleu et noir'', [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag]]]]\n[[Rhythm]], for artists such as [[Piet Mondrian]],<ref name=\"Tosaki\">[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9402411984 Eiichi Tosaki, ''Mondrian's Philosophy of Visual Rhythm: Phenomenology, Wittgenstein, and Eastern thought''], Volume 23 of Sophia ''Studies in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Traditions and Cultures'', Springer, 15 Nov 2017, pp. 108\u2013109, 130, 139, 158, {{ISBN|9402411984}}</ref><ref>Piet Mondrian, ''Neo-Plasticism: Its Realization in Music and in Future Theater'', 1922</ref> is important in painting as it is in music. If one defines rhythm as \"a pause incorporated into a sequence\", then there can be rhythm in paintings. These pauses allow creative force to intervene and add new creations\u2014form, melody, coloration. The distribution of form, or any kind of information is of crucial importance in the given work of art, and it directly affects the aesthetic value of that work. This is because the aesthetic value is functionality dependent, i.e. the freedom (of movement) of perception is perceived as beauty. Free flow of energy, in art as well as in other forms of \"[[techne]]\", directly contributes to the aesthetic value.<ref name=\"Tosaki\" />\n\nMusic was important to the birth of [[abstract art]], since music is abstract by nature\u2014it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. [[Wassily Kandinsky]] often used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings \"improvisations\" and described more elaborate works as \"compositions\". Kandinsky theorized that \"music is the ultimate teacher,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/quotes.php|title=Wassily Kandinsky \u2013 Quotes|website=www.wassilykandinsky.net|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> and subsequently embarked upon the first seven of his ten ''Compositions''. Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that (for example), yellow is the color of middle [[C (musical note)|C]] on a brassy trumpet; black is the color of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colors produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}</ref><ref>Susan B.

They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment, and they show horses, [[rhinoceros]], lions, [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], [[mammoth]], abstract designs and what are possibly partial human figures. However, the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters in [[Arnhem Land]], in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites, there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a [[Bradshaw rock paintings|limestone rock-shelter]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of North-Western Australia, that is dated 40,000 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalartonline.com/art/rockage.php |title=How Old is Australia's Rock Art? |publisher=Aboriginalartonline.com |accessdate=2014-03-13}}</ref> There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world\u2014in Italy, France, Spain, [[Portugal]], China, Australia, Mexico,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/noticias/2013/05/130523_pinturas_caverna_mexico_an | title=Milhares de pinturas rupestres s\u00e3o descobertas em cavernas no M\u00e9xico|work = BBC News Brasil|language = Portuguese|date = 23 May 2013}}</ref> etc. In Western cultures, [[oil painting]] and [[watercolor]] painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter. In the East, [[ink]] and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions.\n\nThe invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the first [[photograph]] was produced in 1829, [[photography|photographic]] processes improved and became more widely practiced, depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world. A series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\u2014notably [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Dada]]ism\u2014challenged the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] view of the world. Eastern and African painting, however, continued a long history of [[stylization]] and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n[[Modern Art|Modern]] and [[Contemporary Art]] has moved away from the historic value of craft and documentation in favour of [[concept]]. This has not deterred the majority of living painters from continuing to practice painting either as whole or part of their work. The vitality and versatility of painting in the 21st century defies the previous \"declarations\" of its demise. In an epoch characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]], there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age. Artists continue to make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic [[temperament]]s\u2014their merits are left to the public and the marketplace to judge.\n\n==Aesthetics and theory==\n{{Main|Theory of painting}}\n[[Aesthetics]] is the study of [[art]] and [[beauty]]; it was an important issue for 18th- and 19th-century philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]. Classical philosophers like [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] also theorized about art and painting in particular. Plato disregarded painters (as well as sculptors) in his philosophical system; he maintained that painting cannot depict the [[truth]]\u2014it is a copy of reality (a shadow of the world of ideas) and is nothing but a [[craft]], similar to shoemaking or iron casting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plato's Aesthetics|url=http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/aesthetics/philos_artists_onart/plato.htm|website=www.rowan.edu|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref> By the time of Leonardo, painting had become a closer representation of the truth than painting was in [[Ancient Greece]].

Recent contributions to thinking about painting have been offered by the painter and writer [[Julian Bell (artist)|Julian Bell]].

Often the oil was boiled with a resin such as pine resin or even [[frankincense]]; these were called 'varnishes' and were prized for their body and gloss. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in northern Europe, and by the height of the [[Renaissance]] oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced [[tempera]] paints in the majority of Europe.\n\n===Pastel===\n[[File:Louis15-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]], ''Portrait of Louis XV of France.'' (1748) Pastel.]]\n[[Pastel]] is a painting medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder.<ref>Mayer, Ralph,''The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques'', Third Edition, New York: Viking, 1970, p. 312.</ref> The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including [[oil paint]]s; the binder is of a neutral hue and low [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturation]]. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.<ref>Mayer, Ralph. The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques. Viking Adult; 5th revised and updated edition, 1991. {{ISBN|0-670-83701-6}}</ref> Because the surface of a pastel painting is fragile and easily smudged, its preservation requires protective measures such as framing under glass; it may also be sprayed with a [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]]. Nonetheless, when made with permanent pigments and properly cared for, a pastel painting may endure unchanged for centuries. Pastels are not susceptible, as are paintings made with a fluid medium, to the cracking and discoloration that result from changes in the color, opacity, or dimensions of the medium as it dries.\n\n===Acrylic===\n[[File:Jungle Arc.jpg|thumb|''Jungle Arc'' by [[Ray Burggraf]]. Acrylic paint on wood. (1998)]] [[Acrylic paint]] is fast drying paint containing pigment suspension in [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] polymer [[emulsion]]. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] or an [[oil painting]], or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media. The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over under-paintings. This slow drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but may also impede the artist's ability to work quickly.\n\n=== Watercolor ===\n[[File:John Martin - Manfred on the Jungfrau (1837).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Manfred on the Jungfrau (Martin)|Manfred on the Jungfrau]]'' (1837), [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]. Watercolor painting]]\n[[Watercolor]] is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle. The traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings is paper; other supports include [[papyrus]], bark papers, plastics, [[vellum]] or [[leather]], [[textile|fabric]], wood and [[canvas]]. In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as [[brush painting]] or scroll painting. In [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Korean painting|Korean]], and [[Japanese painting]] it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns. India, [[Ethiopia]] and other countries also have long traditions. [[Finger-painting]] with watercolor paints originated in China. Watercolor pencils (water-soluble color pencils) may be used either wet or dry.\n\n===Ink===\n[[File:Landscapes of the Four Seasons.jpg|thumb|''Landscapes of the Four Seasons'' (1486), [[Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d]]. Ink and light color on paper. ]]\nInk paintings are done with a liquid that contains pigments and/or [[dye]]s and is used to color a surface to produce an image, [[writing|text]], or [[design]]. Ink is used for drawing with a [[pen]], [[brush]], or [[quill]]. Ink can be a complex medium, composed of [[solvent]]s, pigments, dyes, [[resin]]s, [[lubricant]]s, solubilizers, [[surfactant]]s, [[suspended solids|particulate matter]], [[fluorescent|fluorescers]], and other materials. The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink\u2019s carrier, colorants, and other additives control flow and thickness of the ink and its appearance when dry.\n\n===Hot wax or encaustic===\n[[File:Petersinai.jpg|thumb|A 6th-century encaustic icon from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Egypt]].]]\n[[Encaustic painting]], also known as hot wax painting, involves using heated [[beeswax]] to which colored pigments are added. The liquid/paste is then applied to a surface\u2014usually prepared wood, though [[canvas]] and other materials are often used. The simplest encaustic mixture can be made from adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be used\u2014some containing other types of [[wax]]es, [[damar resin]], [[linseed oil]], or other ingredients. Pure, powdered pigments can be purchased and used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment. Metal tools and special brushes can be used to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools can be used to manipulate the wax once it has cooled onto the surface. Other materials can be encased or [[collage]]d into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to adhere it to the surface.\n\nThe technique was the normal one for ancient Greek and Roman panel paintings, and remained in use in the Eastern Orthodox [[icon]] tradition.\n\n===Fresco===\n[[File:Meister von Mileseva 001.jpg|thumb|''[[White Angel]]'', a fresco from Mile\u0161eva, Serbia]]\n[[Fresco]] is any of several related [[mural]] painting types, done on [[plaster]] on walls or ceilings. The word fresco comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''affresco'' {{IPA|[af\u02c8fres\u02d0ko]}}, which derives from the Latin word for ''fresh''. Frescoes were often made during the Renaissance and other early time periods.\n''[[Buon fresco]]'' technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin layer of wet, fresh [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]], for which the Italian word for plaster, [[intonaco]], is used. ''[[A secco]]'' painting, in contrast, is done on dry plaster (''secco'' is \"dry\" in Italian). The pigments require a binding medium, such as [[egg (food)|egg]] ([[tempera]]), glue or [[oil painting|oil]] to attach the pigment to the wall.\n\n===Gouache===\n[[Gouache]] is a water-based paint consisting of pigment and other materials designed to be used in an opaque painting method. Gouache differs from [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] in that the particles are larger, the ratio of pigment to water is much higher, and an additional, inert, white pigment such as [[chalk]] is also present. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque, with greater reflective qualities. Like all watermedia, it is diluted with water.<ref name=\"wash_gou\">Cohn, Marjorie B., ''Wash and Gouache'', Fogg Museum, 1977.</ref>\n\n===Enamel===\n[[File:Waddesdon bequest British Museum DSCF9814 05.JPG|thumb|300px|Detail of painted [[Limoges enamel]] dish, mid-16th century, attributed to [[Jean de Court]], [[Waddesdon Bequest]], [[British Museum]]]]\n[[Vitreous enamel|Enamels]] are made by painting a substrate, typically metal, with powdered glass; minerals called color oxides provide coloration. After firing at a temperature of 750\u2013850 degrees Celsius (1380\u20131560 degrees Fahrenheit), the result is a fused lamination of glass and metal.  Unlike most painted techniques, the surface can be handled and wetted Enamels have traditionally been used for decoration of precious objects,<ref>Mayer, Ralph,''The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques'', Third Edition, New York: Viking, 1970, p. 375.</ref> but have also been used for other purposes. [[Limoges enamel]] was the leading centre of Renaissance enamel painting, with small religious and mythological scenes in decorated surrounds, on plaques or objects such as [[Salt cellar|salts]] or caskets.  In the 18th century, enamel painting enjoyed a vogue in Europe, especially as a medium for [[portrait miniature]]s.<ref>McNally, Rika Smith, \"Enamel\", ''Oxford Art Online''</ref> In the late 20th century, the technique of porcelain enamel on metal has been used as a durable medium for outdoor murals.<ref>Mayer, Ralph,''The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques'', Third Edition, New York: Viking, 1970, p. 371.</ref>\n\n===Spray paint===\n[[Aerosol paint]] (also called spray paint) is a type of paint that comes in a sealed pressurized container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a [[valve]] button. A form of [[spray painting]], [[aerosol]] paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface. Standard sized cans are portable, inexpensive and easy to store<!--, unlike _industrial painters_ or artist [[airbrush]]es-->. Aerosol [[Primer (paint)|primer]] can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.\n\nSpeed, portability and permanence also make aerosol paint a common [[graffiti]] medium. In the late 1970s, street graffiti writers' signatures and murals became more elaborate and a unique style developed as a factor of the aerosol medium and the speed required for illicit work. Many now recognize graffiti and street art as a unique art form and specifically manufactured aerosol paints are made for the graffiti artist. A [[stencil]] protects a surface, except the specific shape to be painted. Stencils can be purchased as movable letters, ordered as professionally cut [[logo]]s or hand-cut by artists.\n\n===Tempera===\n[[Tempera]], also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigment mixed with a water-soluble [[Binder (material)|binder]] medium (usually a glutinous material such as egg yolk or some other [[Sizing|size]]). Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long lasting, and examples from the first centuries CE still exist. Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of [[oil painting]]. A paint commonly called tempera (though it is not) consisting of pigment and glue size is commonly used and referred to by some manufacturers in America as [[poster paint]].\n\n===Water miscible oil paint===\n[[Water miscible oil paint]]s (also called \"water soluble\" or \"water-mixable\") is a modern variety of [[oil paint]] engineered to be thinned and cleaned up with water, rather than having to use chemicals such as [[turpentine]]. It can be mixed and applied using the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint, but while still wet it can be effectively removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from the use of an [[oil]] medium in which one end of the [[molecule]] has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a [[solution]].\n\n=== Digital painting ===\n{{Main|Digital painting}}\n\nDigital painting is a method of creating an art object (painting) digitally and/or a technique for making digital art in the computer. As a method of creating an art object, it adapts traditional painting medium such as [[acrylic paint]], [[Oil paint|oils]], [[ink]], [[watercolor]], etc. and applies the pigment to traditional carriers, such as woven canvas cloth, paper, polyester etc. by means of [[computer]] [[software]] driving [[industrial robot]]ic or office machinery (printers). As a technique, it refers to a [[computer graphics]] software program that uses a [[virtuality|virtual]] canvas and virtual painting box of brushes, colors and other supplies. The virtual box contains many instruments that do not exist outside the computer, and which give a [[digital art]]work a different look and feel from an artwork that is made the traditional way. Furthermore, digital painting is not 'computer-generated' art as the computer does not automatically create images on the screen using some mathematical calculations. On the other hand, the artist uses his own painting technique to create the particular piece of work on the computer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.turningpointarts.com/what-is-digital-painting/|title=What is digital painting? |date=2008-11-01|work=Turning Point Arts|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Painting styles==\n{{Main|Style (visual arts)}}\n''Style'' is used in two senses: It can refer to the distinctive visual elements, techniques and methods that typify an ''individual'' artist's work. It can also refer to the [[Art movement|movement]] or school that an artist is associated with. This can stem from an actual group that the artist was consciously involved with or it can be a category in which art historians have placed the painter. The word 'style' in the latter sense has fallen out of favor in academic discussions about contemporary painting, though it continues to be used in popular contexts. Such movements or classifications include the following:\n<!--When the section below is fully fleshed out, we might end up duplicating the History of painting article...this might be OK if this section is substantially shorter than the History of painting article! -->\n\n===Western===\n\n====Modernism====\n[[Modernism]] describes both a set of cultural tendencies and an array of associated [[cultural movement]]s, originally arising from wide-scale and far-reaching changes to [[Western culture|Western society]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Modernism was a revolt against the conservative values of [[Realism (arts)|realism]].<ref name=\"Barth79Replenishment\">[[John Barth|Barth, John]] (1979) ''[[The Literature of Replenishment]]'', later republished in ''[[The Friday Book]]'(1984)'.</ref><ref name=\"Graff75\">[[Gerald Graff|Graff, Gerald]] (1975) ''Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern.

This often led to experiments with form, and work that draws attention to the processes and materials used (and to the further tendency of abstraction).<ref>Gardner, Helen, Horst De la Croix, Richard G.

Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored [[Paris Salon]], the [[Impressionists]] organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]], created by [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]] to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon.\n\n=====Abstract styles=====\n[[Abstract art|Abstract painting]] uses a [[visual language]] of form, colour and line to create a composition that may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.<ref>[[Rudolph Arnheim|Arnheim, Rudolph]], 1969, ''Visual Thinking''</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Key|first1=Joan|title=Future Use: Abstract Painting|journal=Third Text|date=September 2009|volume=23|issue=5|pages=557\u201363|doi=10.1080/09528820903184666}}</ref> [[Abstract expressionism]] was an American post-[[World War II]] [[art movement]] that combined the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools\u2014such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], [[Bauhaus]] and [[Cubism]], and the image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.<ref>Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000): Abstract Expressionism.

The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with [[abstract expressionism]] (some critics have used the terms \"action painting\" and \"abstract expressionism\" interchangeably).\n\nOther modernist styles include:\n* [[Color Field]]\n* [[Lyrical Abstraction]]\n* [[Hard-edge painting]]\n* [[Pop art]]\n\n=====Outsider art=====\nThe term [[outsider art]] was coined by [[art critic]] Roger Cardinal in 1972 as an English synonym for art brut ({{IPA-fr|a\u0281 b\u0281yt|lang}}, \"raw art\" or \"rough art\"), a label created by [[France|French]] [[artist]] [[Jean Dubuffet]] to describe [[art]] created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused particularly on art by [[Psychiatric hospital|insane-asylum]] inmates.<ref>Cardinal, Roger, ''Outsider Art'', London, 1972</ref> Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category (an annual Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1992). The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by people outside the mainstream \"art world,\" regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work.\n\n=====Photorealism=====\n[[Photorealism]] is the genre of painting based on using the camera and photographs to gather information and then from this information, creating a painting that appears to be very realistic like a [[photograph]].

Tate Museum, Publishers, UK. 2006. p. 1</ref>\n\n=====Surrealism=====\n[[Surrealism]] is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for the artistic and literary production of those affiliated with the [[Surrealist Movement]]. Surrealist artworks feature the element of surprise, the uncanny, the unconscious, unexpected juxtapositions and [[non-sequitur (humor)|non-sequitur]]; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Leader [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement.\n\nSurrealism developed out of the [[Dada]] activities of [[World War I]] and the most important center of the movement was [[Paris]]. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, eventually affecting the [[visual art]]s, [[literature]], [[film]] and [[music]] of many countries, as well as [[politics|political]] thought and practice, [[philosophy]] and [[social theory]].\n\n{{See also|Outline of painting#Styles of painting}}\n\n===Far Eastern===\n* '''[[Chinese painting|Chinese]]'''\n** [[Tang Dynasty painting|Tang Dynasty]]\n** [[Ming Dynasty painting|Ming Dynasty]]\n** [[Shan shui]]\n** [[Ink and wash painting]]\n** [[Bird-and-flower painting|Hua niao]]\n** [[Southern School]]\n*** [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]]\n*** [[Wu School]]\n** [[History of Chinese art#Contemporary Art|Contemporary]]\n* '''[[Japanese painting|Japanese]]'''\n** [[Yamato-e]]\n** [[Rimpa school]]\n** [[Emakimono]]\n** [[Kan\u014d school]]\n** [[Shij\u014d school]]\n** [[Superflat]]\n* '''[[Korean painting|Korean]]'''\n\n===Islamic===\n* [[Arabic miniature]]\n* [[Mughal miniature]]\n* [[Ottoman miniature]]\n* [[Persian miniature]]\n\n===Indian===\n* [[Pattachitra|Oriya school]]\n* [[Bengal school of art|Bengal school]]\n* [[Kangra painting|Kangra]]\n* [[Madhubani art|Madhubani]]\n* [[Mysore painting|Mysore]]\n* [[Rajput painting|Rajput]]\n* [[Mughal painting|Mughal]]\n* [[Samikshavad]]\n* [[Tanjore painting|Tanjore]]\n* [[Warli painting|Warli]]\n* [[Kerala mural painting]]\n\n===African===\n* [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]]\n\n===Contemporary art===\n<!-- It seems that some of the art forms listed here are not painting forms--for example video art -->\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%; border:0 solid #e5ffec; background:#=#e5ffec;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:17%;\"|\n\n===1950s===\n* [[Abstract Expressionism]]\n* [[American Figurative Expressionism]]\n* [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]\n* [[Lyrical Abstraction]]\n* [[New York Figurative Expressionism]]\n* [[New York School (art)|New York School]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===1960s===\n* [[Abstract expressionism]]\n* [[American Figurative Expressionism]]\n* [[Abstract Imagists]]\n* [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]\n* [[Color field]]\n* [[Computer art]]\n* [[Conceptual art]]\n* [[Fluxus]]\n* [[Happening]]s\n* [[Hard-edge painting]]\n* [[Lyrical Abstraction]]\n* [[Minimalism]]\n* [[Neo-figurative]]\n* [[Neo-Dada]]\n* [[New York School (art)|New York School]]\n* [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]]\n* [[Op Art]]\n* [[Performance art]]\n* [[Pop Art]]\n* [[Postminimalism]]\n* [[Washington Color School]]\n* [[Kinetic art]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===1970s===\n* [[Arte Povera]]\n* [[Ascii Art]]\n* [[Bad Painting]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Artist's book]]\n* [[Feminist art]]\n* [[Installation art]]\n* [[Land Art]]\n* [[Lowbrow (art movement)]]\n* [[Photorealism]]\n* [[Postminimalism]]\n* [[Process Art]]\n* [[Video art]]\n* [[Funk art]]\n* [[Pattern and Decoration]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===1980s===\n* [[Appropriation art]]\n* [[Culture jamming]]\n* [[Demoscene]]\n* [[Electronic art]]\n* [[Figuration Libre]]\n* [[Graffiti Art]]\n* [[Live Art (art form)|Live art]]\n* [[Mail art]]\n* [[Postmodern art]]\n* [[Neo-conceptual art]]\n* [[Neo-expressionism]]\n* [[Neo-pop]]\n* [[Sound art]]\n* [[Transgressive art]]\n* [[Video installation]]\n* [[Institutional Critique]]\n* [[Neogeo (art)|NeoGeo]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===1990s===\n* [[Bio art]]\n* [[Cyberarts]]\n* [[Cynical Realism]]\n* [[Digital Art]]\n* [[Information art]]\n* [[Internet art]]\n* [[Massurrealism]]\n* [[Maximalism]]\n* [[New media art]]\n* [[Software art]]\n* [[New European Painting]]\n* [[Young British Artists]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===2000s===\n* [[Digital painting|Digital Painting]]\n* [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|Hyperrealism]]\n* [[Classical Realism]]\n* [[Relational art]]\n* [[Street art]]\n* [[Stuckism]]\n* [[Superflat]]\n* [[Pseudorealism]]\n* [[Videogame art]]\n* [[Superstroke]]\n* [[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ art]]\n* [[Virtual art]]\n* [[Indigenouism|Indigenous Art]]\n|}\n\n==Types of painting==\n\n===Allegory===\n[[Allegory]] is a [[Figurative art|figurative]] [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of representation conveying meaning other than the literal. Allegory communicates its message by means of [[symbol]]ic figures, actions or symbolic representation. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of [[rhetoric]], but an allegory does not have to be expressed in [[language]]: it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in realistic painting. An example of a simple visual allegory is the image of the [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]]. Viewers understand that the image of the grim reaper is a symbolic representation of death.\n\n===Bodeg\u00f3n===\n[[File:Bodeg\u00f3n de recipientes (Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|thumb|''Bodeg\u00f3n'' or ''Still Life with Pottery Jars'', by [[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n]]. 1636, Oil on canvas; 46 x 84&nbsp;cm; [[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]]]]\n\nIn [[Spanish art]], a [[bodeg\u00f3n]] is a [[still life]] painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but significant still life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. Starting in the [[Baroque]] period, such paintings became popular in Spain in the second quarter of the 17th century. The tradition of still life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary [[Low Countries]], today Belgium and [[Netherlands]] (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in [[southern Europe]]. [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Still lifes|Northern still lifes]] had many subgenres: the ''breakfast piece'' was augmented by the ''[[trompe-l'\u0153il]]'', the ''flower bouquet'', and the ''[[vanitas]]''. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of ''breakfast piece'' did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table.\n\n===Figure painting===\nA [[figure painting]] is a [[work of art]] in any of the painting media with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or [[Nude (art)|nude]].\nFigure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the contrast subjects of art since the first stone age cave paintings, and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Droste|first1=Flip|title=Cave Paintings of the Early Stone Age|journal=Semiotica|date=October 2014|volume=2014|issue=202|pages=155\u2013165|doi=10.1515/sem-2014-0035}}</ref> Some artists well known for figure painting are [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[\u00c9douard Manet]].\n\n[[File:Reza Abbasi - Two Lovers (1630).jpg|thumb|''Two Lovers'' by [[Reza Abbasi]], 1630]]\n\n===Illustration painting===\n[[Illustration]] paintings are those used as illustrations in books, magazines, and theater or movie [[posters]] and comic books. Today, there is a growing interest in collecting and admiring the original artwork. Various museum exhibitions, magazines and art galleries have devoted space to the illustrators of the past. In the visual art world, illustrators have sometimes been considered less important in comparison with fine artists and [[graphic designer]]s. But as the result of [[computer game]] and comic industry growth, illustrations are becoming valued as popular and profitable art works that can acquire a wider market than the other two, especially in [[Korea]], Japan, [[Hong Kong]] and United States.\n\n===Landscape painting===\n{{main|Landscape art}}\n[[File:Andreas Achenbach - Clearing Up\u2014Coast of Sicily - Walters 37116.jpg|left|thumb|''Clearing Up, Coast of Sicily'', a painting by [[Andreas Achenbach]], who specialized in the \"sublime\" mode of landscape painting in which man is dwarfed by nature's might and fury. \u2013 1847<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/19760\n |title=Clearing Up\u2014Coast of Sicily}}</ref> [[The Walters Art Museum]].]]\n[[Landscape art|Landscape painting]] is a term that covers the depiction of natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, and especially art where the main subject is a wide view, with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and [[weather]] is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects. The two main traditions spring from [[Western painting]] and [[Chinese art]], going back well over a thousand years in both cases.\n\n===Portrait painting===\n[[Portrait painting]]s are representations of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, [[Personality type|personality]], and even the mood of the person. The art of the portrait flourished in Ancient Greek and especially [[Roman sculpture]], where sitters demanded individualized and realistic portraits, even unflattering ones. One of the best-known portraits in the Western world is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting titled ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', which is thought to be a portrait of [[Lisa del Giocondo|Lisa Gherardini]], the wife of Francesco del Giocondo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mona-lisa-%E2%80%93-portrait-lisa-gherardini-wife-francesco-del-giocondo |title=Mona Lisa \u2013 Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo |publisher=Louvre Museum |date= c. 1503\u201319|accessdate=2014-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730003620/http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mona-lisa-%E2%80%93-portrait-lisa-gherardini-wife-francesco-del-giocondo |archivedate=30 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Still life===\n[[File:Otto Marseus van Schrieck - A Forest Floor Still-Life - WGA21061.jpg|thumb|''A Forest Floor Still-Life'' by [[Otto Marseus van Schrieck]], 1666]]\nA [[still life]] is a work of [[art]] depicting mostly [[inanimate]] subject matter, typically commonplace objects\u2014which may be either natural (food, flowers, plants, rocks, or shells) or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, and so on). With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Greek/Roman art, still life paintings give the artist more leeway in the arrangement of design elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as [[Landscape art|landscape]] or [[portrait]]ure. Still life paintings, particularly before 1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. Some modern still life breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media, and uses found objects, photography, computer graphics, as well as video and sound.\n\n===Veduta===\nA [[veduta]] is a highly detailed, usually large-scale painting of a [[cityscape]] or some other vista. This [[genre]] of [[landscape art|landscape]] originated in [[Flanders]], where artists such as [[Paul Bril]] painted ''vedute'' as early as the 16th century. As the itinerary of the [[Grand Tour]] became somewhat standardized, ''vedute'' of familiar scenes like the Roman Forum or the Grand Canal recalled early ventures to the Continent for aristocratic Englishmen. In the later 19th century, more personal impressions of cityscapes replaced the desire for topographical accuracy, which was satisfied instead by painted [[panorama]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Visual arts|Painting}}\n* [[20th-century Western painting]]\n* [[Cobweb painting]]\n* [[Drawing]]\n* [[Graphic arts]]\n* [[Index of painting-related articles]]\n* [[List of most expensive paintings]]\n* [[Outline of painting]]\n* [[Business process outsourcing in China#Painting|Painting outsourcing in China]]\n* [[Visual arts]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Painting}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Wiktionary|painting}}\n* Daniel, H.

The medium is commonly applied to the base with a [[brush]], but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and [[airbrush]]es, can be used.  The final work is also called a painting.\n\nPainting is an important form in the [[visual arts]], bringing in elements such as [[drawing]], [[gesture]] (as in [[gestural painting]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[narrative|narration]] (as in [[narrative art]]), or [[abstraction]] (as in [[abstract art]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=Lincoln|title=The Music of Painting|journal=The American Scholar|date=Summer 2014|volume=83|issue=3|page=85}}</ref> Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a [[still life]] or [[landscape art|landscape painting]]), [[Photorealism|photographic]], abstract, narrative, [[symbol]]istic (as in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist art]]), [[emotion|emotive]] (as in [[Expressionism]]), or [[Politics|political]] in nature (as in [[Artivism]]).\n\nA portion of the [[history of painting]] in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by [[religious art]]. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting [[Mythology|mythological]] figures on pottery, to [[Bible|Biblical]] scenes [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], to scenes from the life of [[Chinese painting|Buddha]] or other images of [[Eastern art history|Eastern religious origin]].\n\nIn [[art]], the term ''painting ''describes both the act and the result of the action. The support for paintings includes such surfaces as [[wall]]s, [[paper]], [[canvas]], wood, [[glass]], [[lacquer]], [[pottery]], [[leaf]], [[copper]] and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, as well as objects.\n\n==Elements of painting==\n[[File:Chen Hongshou, leaf album painting.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chen Hongshou]] (1598\u20131652), ''Leaf album painting'' ([[Ming dynasty]])]]\n\n===Color and tone===\n[[Color]], made up of [[hue]], [[Saturation color|saturation]], and [[Value (color)|value]], dispersed over a surface is the essence of painting, just as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[rhythm]] are the essence of [[music]]. Color is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]],<ref>[https://archive.org/details/goethestheoryco01goetgoog Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Goethe's theory of colours], John Murray, London 1840</ref> [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]],<ref>Wassily Kandinsky Concerning The Spiritual in Art, [Translated By Michael T. H. Sadler, [http://www.semantikon.com/art/kandinskyspiritualinart.pdf pdf].</ref> and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]],<ref>A letter to the Royal Society presenting A new theory of light and colours Isaac Newton, 1671 [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/newton1671.pdf pdf]</ref> have written their own [[color theory]].\n\nMoreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a color equivalent. The word \"[[red]]\", for example, can cover a wide range of variations from the pure red of the [[visible spectrum]] of light. There is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as [[F (musical note)|F]] or [[C\u266f (musical note)|C\u266f]]. For a painter, color is not simply divided into basic (primary) and derived (complementary or mixed) colors (like red, blue, green, brown, etc.).\n\nPainters deal practically with [[pigments]],<ref>[http://colourlex.com/pigments/pigments-colour/ Pigments] at ColourLex</ref> so \"[[blue]]\" for a painter can be any of the blues: [[phthalocyanine blue]], [[Prussian blue]], [[indigo]], [[Cobalt blue]], [[ultramarine]], and so on. Psychological and symbolical meanings of color are not, strictly speaking, means of painting. Colors only add to the potential, derived context of meanings, and because of this, the perception of a painting is highly subjective. The analogy with music is quite clear\u2014sound in music (like a C note) is analogous to \"light\" in painting, \"shades\" to [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and \"coloration\" is to painting as the specific [[Tone color|timbre]] of musical instruments is to music. These elements do not necessarily form a melody (in music) of themselves; rather, they can add different contexts to it.\n\n[[File:Georges Seurat 066.jpg|thumb|''[[Parade de cirque|Circus Sideshow]] ({{Lang-fr|Parade de cirque}})'', [[Georges Seurat]], 1887\u201388|alt=Shows a pointillist painting of a trombone soloist.]]\n\n===Non-traditional elements===\nModern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, as one example, [[collage]], which began with [[Cubism]] and is not painting in the strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as metal, plastic, [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]], [[Leaf painting|leaves]] or [[wood]] for their [[Texture (painting)|texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Jean Dubuffet]] and [[Anselm Kiefer]]. There is a growing community of artists who use computers to \"paint\" color onto a digital \"canvas\" using programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Corel Painter]], and many others. These images can be printed onto traditional canvas if required.\n\n===Rhythm===\n[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1906, La dance (Bacchante), oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm DSC05359...jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], c.1906, ''[[La danse, Bacchante|La danse (Bacchante)]]'', oil on canvas, 73 x 54&nbsp;cm, [[Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum]]]]\n[[Jean Metzinger]]'s mosaic-like [[Divisionist]] technique had its parallel in literature; a characteristic of the alliance between [[Symbolist]] writers and Neo-Impressionist artists:\n\n<blockquote>I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescences and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature.

If one defines rhythm as \"a pause incorporated into a sequence\", then there can be rhythm in paintings. These pauses allow creative force to intervene and add new creations\u2014form, melody, coloration. The distribution of form, or any kind of information is of crucial importance in the given work of art, and it directly affects the aesthetic value of that work. This is because the aesthetic value is functionality dependent, i.e. the freedom (of movement) of perception is perceived as beauty. Free flow of energy, in art as well as in other forms of \"[[techne]]\", directly contributes to the aesthetic value.<ref name=\"Tosaki\" />\n\nMusic was important to the birth of [[abstract art]], since music is abstract by nature\u2014it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. [[Wassily Kandinsky]] often used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings \"improvisations\" and described more elaborate works as \"compositions\". Kandinsky theorized that \"music is the ultimate teacher,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/quotes.php|title=Wassily Kandinsky \u2013 Quotes|website=www.wassilykandinsky.net|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> and subsequently embarked upon the first seven of his ten ''Compositions''. Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that (for example), yellow is the color of middle [[C (musical note)|C]] on a brassy trumpet; black is the color of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colors produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}</ref><ref>Susan B.

[[Jackson Pollock]] underscores that interest with his 1950 painting ''[[Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)]]''.<ref>[http://www.interlude.hk/front/intersections-art-music-rothko-pollock/ Intersections with art and music, Rothko and Pollock]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of painting}}\n\n[[File:Lascaux 04.jpg|thumb|Cave painting of [[aurochs]], ({{lang-fr|Bos primigenius primigenius)}}, [[Lascaux]], France, an example of [[prehistoric art]]]]\nThe oldest known paintings are at the [[Grotte Chauvet]] in France, which some historians believe are about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment, and they show horses, [[rhinoceros]], lions, [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], [[mammoth]], abstract designs and what are possibly partial human figures. However, the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters in [[Arnhem Land]], in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites, there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a [[Bradshaw rock paintings|limestone rock-shelter]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of North-Western Australia, that is dated 40,000 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalartonline.com/art/rockage.php |title=How Old is Australia's Rock Art? |publisher=Aboriginalartonline.com |accessdate=2014-03-13}}</ref> There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world\u2014in Italy, France, Spain, [[Portugal]], China, Australia, Mexico,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/noticias/2013/05/130523_pinturas_caverna_mexico_an | title=Milhares de pinturas rupestres s\u00e3o descobertas em cavernas no M\u00e9xico|work = BBC News Brasil|language = Portuguese|date = 23 May 2013}}</ref> etc. In Western cultures, [[oil painting]] and [[watercolor]] painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter. In the East, [[ink]] and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions.\n\nThe invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the first [[photograph]] was produced in 1829, [[photography|photographic]] processes improved and became more widely practiced, depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world. A series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\u2014notably [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Dada]]ism\u2014challenged the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] view of the world. Eastern and African painting, however, continued a long history of [[stylization]] and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n[[Modern Art|Modern]] and [[Contemporary Art]] has moved away from the historic value of craft and documentation in favour of [[concept]]. This has not deterred the majority of living painters from continuing to practice painting either as whole or part of their work. The vitality and versatility of painting in the 21st century defies the previous \"declarations\" of its demise. In an epoch characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]], there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age. Artists continue to make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic [[temperament]]s\u2014their merits are left to the public and the marketplace to judge.\n\n==Aesthetics and theory==\n{{Main|Theory of painting}}\n[[Aesthetics]] is the study of [[art]] and [[beauty]]; it was an important issue for 18th- and 19th-century philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]. Classical philosophers like [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] also theorized about art and painting in particular. Plato disregarded painters (as well as sculptors) in his philosophical system; he maintained that painting cannot depict the [[truth]]\u2014it is a copy of reality (a shadow of the world of ideas) and is nothing but a [[craft]], similar to shoemaking or iron casting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plato's Aesthetics|url=http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/aesthetics/philos_artists_onart/plato.htm|website=www.rowan.edu|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref> By the time of Leonardo, painting had become a closer representation of the truth than painting was in [[Ancient Greece]].

Turner]] and [[Caspar David Friedrich]].\n\nHegel recognized the failure of attaining a universal concept of beauty and, in his aesthetic essay, wrote that painting is one of the three \"romantic\" arts, along with [[Poetry]] and [[Music]], for its [[symbol]]ic, highly intellectual purpose.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5m5z_ca-qDkC&pg=PA276|title=Craig, Edward.

Recent contributions to thinking about painting have been offered by the painter and writer [[Julian Bell (artist)|Julian Bell]]. In his book ''What is Painting?'', Bell discusses the development, through history, of the notion that paintings can express feelings and ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/index/cohen/cohen8-16-99.asp |title=Review by art historian David Cohen |publisher=Artnet.com |accessdate=2014-03-13}}</ref> In ''Mirror of The World,'' Bell writes:\n<blockquote>A ''work'' of art seeks to hold your attention and keep it fixed: a ''history'' of art urges it onwards, bulldozing a highway through the homes of the imagination.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mirror of the World: A New History of Art |first=Julian |last=Bell |publisher=Thames and Hudson |page=496 |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-500-23837-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Painting media==\nDifferent types of paint are usually identified by the medium that the pigment is suspended or embedded in, which determines the general working characteristics of the paint, such as [[viscosity]], [[miscibility]], [[solubility]], drying time, etc.\n\n===Oil===\n[[File:Honor\u00e9 Daumier 008.jpg|thumb|[[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] (1808\u20131879), ''The Painter'', oil on panel with visible brushstrokes]]\n[[Oil painting]] is the process of painting with [[pigments]] that are bound with a medium of [[drying oil]], such as [[linseed oil]], which was widely used in early modern Europe. Often the oil was boiled with a resin such as pine resin or even [[frankincense]]; these were called 'varnishes' and were prized for their body and gloss. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in northern Europe, and by the height of the [[Renaissance]] oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced [[tempera]] paints in the majority of Europe.\n\n===Pastel===\n[[File:Louis15-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]], ''Portrait of Louis XV of France.'' (1748) Pastel.]]\n[[Pastel]] is a painting medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder.<ref>Mayer, Ralph,''The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques'', Third Edition, New York: Viking, 1970, p. 312.</ref> The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including [[oil paint]]s; the binder is of a neutral hue and low [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturation]]. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.<ref>Mayer, Ralph. The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques. Viking Adult; 5th revised and updated edition, 1991. {{ISBN|0-670-83701-6}}</ref> Because the surface of a pastel painting is fragile and easily smudged, its preservation requires protective measures such as framing under glass; it may also be sprayed with a [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]]. Nonetheless, when made with permanent pigments and properly cared for, a pastel painting may endure unchanged for centuries. Pastels are not susceptible, as are paintings made with a fluid medium, to the cracking and discoloration that result from changes in the color, opacity, or dimensions of the medium as it dries.\n\n===Acrylic===\n[[File:Jungle Arc.jpg|thumb|''Jungle Arc'' by [[Ray Burggraf]]. Acrylic paint on wood. (1998)]] [[Acrylic paint]] is fast drying paint containing pigment suspension in [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] polymer [[emulsion]]. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] or an [[oil painting]], or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media. The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over under-paintings. This slow drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but may also impede the artist's ability to work quickly.\n\n=== Watercolor ===\n[[File:John Martin - Manfred on the Jungfrau (1837).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Manfred on the Jungfrau (Martin)|Manfred on the Jungfrau]]'' (1837), [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]. Watercolor painting]]\n[[Watercolor]] is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle. The traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings is paper; other supports include [[papyrus]], bark papers, plastics, [[vellum]] or [[leather]], [[textile|fabric]], wood and [[canvas]]. In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as [[brush painting]] or scroll painting. In [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Korean painting|Korean]], and [[Japanese painting]] it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns. India, [[Ethiopia]] and other countries also have long traditions. [[Finger-painting]] with watercolor paints originated in China. Watercolor pencils (water-soluble color pencils) may be used either wet or dry.\n\n===Ink===\n[[File:Landscapes of the Four Seasons.jpg|thumb|''Landscapes of the Four Seasons'' (1486), [[Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d]]. Ink and light color on paper. ]]\nInk paintings are done with a liquid that contains pigments and/or [[dye]]s and is used to color a surface to produce an image, [[writing|text]], or [[design]]. Ink is used for drawing with a [[pen]], [[brush]], or [[quill]]. Ink can be a complex medium, composed of [[solvent]]s, pigments, dyes, [[resin]]s, [[lubricant]]s, solubilizers, [[surfactant]]s, [[suspended solids|particulate matter]], [[fluorescent|fluorescers]], and other materials. The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink\u2019s carrier, colorants, and other additives control flow and thickness of the ink and its appearance when dry.\n\n===Hot wax or encaustic===\n[[File:Petersinai.jpg|thumb|A 6th-century encaustic icon from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Egypt]].]]\n[[Encaustic painting]], also known as hot wax painting, involves using heated [[beeswax]] to which colored pigments are added. The liquid/paste is then applied to a surface\u2014usually prepared wood, though [[canvas]] and other materials are often used. The simplest encaustic mixture can be made from adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be used\u2014some containing other types of [[wax]]es, [[damar resin]], [[linseed oil]], or other ingredients. Pure, powdered pigments can be purchased and used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment. Metal tools and special brushes can be used to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools can be used to manipulate the wax once it has cooled onto the surface. Other materials can be encased or [[collage]]d into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to adhere it to the surface.\n\nThe technique was the normal one for ancient Greek and Roman panel paintings, and remained in use in the Eastern Orthodox [[icon]] tradition.\n\n===Fresco===\n[[File:Meister von Mileseva 001.jpg|thumb|''[[White Angel]]'', a fresco from Mile\u0161eva, Serbia]]\n[[Fresco]] is any of several related [[mural]] painting types, done on [[plaster]] on walls or ceilings. The word fresco comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''affresco'' {{IPA|[af\u02c8fres\u02d0ko]}}, which derives from the Latin word for ''fresh''. Frescoes were often made during the Renaissance and other early time periods.\n''[[Buon fresco]]'' technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin layer of wet, fresh [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]], for which the Italian word for plaster, [[intonaco]], is used. ''[[A secco]]'' painting, in contrast, is done on dry plaster (''secco'' is \"dry\" in Italian). The pigments require a binding medium, such as [[egg (food)|egg]] ([[tempera]]), glue or [[oil painting|oil]] to attach the pigment to the wall.\n\n===Gouache===\n[[Gouache]] is a water-based paint consisting of pigment and other materials designed to be used in an opaque painting method. Gouache differs from [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] in that the particles are larger, the ratio of pigment to water is much higher, and an additional, inert, white pigment such as [[chalk]] is also present. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque, with greater reflective qualities. Like all watermedia, it is diluted with water.<ref name=\"wash_gou\">Cohn, Marjorie B., ''Wash and Gouache'', Fogg Museum, 1977.</ref>\n\n===Enamel===\n[[File:Waddesdon bequest British Museum DSCF9814 05.JPG|thumb|300px|Detail of painted [[Limoges enamel]] dish, mid-16th century, attributed to [[Jean de Court]], [[Waddesdon Bequest]], [[British Museum]]]]\n[[Vitreous enamel|Enamels]] are made by painting a substrate, typically metal, with powdered glass; minerals called color oxides provide coloration. After firing at a temperature of 750\u2013850 degrees Celsius (1380\u20131560 degrees Fahrenheit), the result is a fused lamination of glass and metal.  Unlike most painted techniques, the surface can be handled and wetted Enamels have traditionally been used for decoration of precious objects,<ref>Mayer, Ralph,''The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques'', Third Edition, New York: Viking, 1970, p. 375.</ref> but have also been used for other purposes. [[Limoges enamel]] was the leading centre of Renaissance enamel painting, with small religious and mythological scenes in decorated surrounds, on plaques or objects such as [[Salt cellar|salts]] or caskets.  In the 18th century, enamel painting enjoyed a vogue in Europe, especially as a medium for [[portrait miniature]]s.<ref>McNally, Rika Smith, \"Enamel\", ''Oxford Art Online''</ref> In the late 20th century, the technique of porcelain enamel on metal has been used as a durable medium for outdoor murals.<ref>Mayer, Ralph,''The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques'', Third Edition, New York: Viking, 1970, p. 371.</ref>\n\n===Spray paint===\n[[Aerosol paint]] (also called spray paint) is a type of paint that comes in a sealed pressurized container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a [[valve]] button. A form of [[spray painting]], [[aerosol]] paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface. Standard sized cans are portable, inexpensive and easy to store<!--, unlike _industrial painters_ or artist [[airbrush]]es-->. Aerosol [[Primer (paint)|primer]] can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.\n\nSpeed, portability and permanence also make aerosol paint a common [[graffiti]] medium. In the late 1970s, street graffiti writers' signatures and murals became more elaborate and a unique style developed as a factor of the aerosol medium and the speed required for illicit work. Many now recognize graffiti and street art as a unique art form and specifically manufactured aerosol paints are made for the graffiti artist. A [[stencil]] protects a surface, except the specific shape to be painted. Stencils can be purchased as movable letters, ordered as professionally cut [[logo]]s or hand-cut by artists.\n\n===Tempera===\n[[Tempera]], also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigment mixed with a water-soluble [[Binder (material)|binder]] medium (usually a glutinous material such as egg yolk or some other [[Sizing|size]]). Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long lasting, and examples from the first centuries CE still exist. Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of [[oil painting]]. A paint commonly called tempera (though it is not) consisting of pigment and glue size is commonly used and referred to by some manufacturers in America as [[poster paint]].\n\n===Water miscible oil paint===\n[[Water miscible oil paint]]s (also called \"water soluble\" or \"water-mixable\") is a modern variety of [[oil paint]] engineered to be thinned and cleaned up with water, rather than having to use chemicals such as [[turpentine]]. It can be mixed and applied using the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint, but while still wet it can be effectively removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from the use of an [[oil]] medium in which one end of the [[molecule]] has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a [[solution]].\n\n=== Digital painting ===\n{{Main|Digital painting}}\n\nDigital painting is a method of creating an art object (painting) digitally and/or a technique for making digital art in the computer. As a method of creating an art object, it adapts traditional painting medium such as [[acrylic paint]], [[Oil paint|oils]], [[ink]], [[watercolor]], etc. and applies the pigment to traditional carriers, such as woven canvas cloth, paper, polyester etc. by means of [[computer]] [[software]] driving [[industrial robot]]ic or office machinery (printers). As a technique, it refers to a [[computer graphics]] software program that uses a [[virtuality|virtual]] canvas and virtual painting box of brushes, colors and other supplies. The virtual box contains many instruments that do not exist outside the computer, and which give a [[digital art]]work a different look and feel from an artwork that is made the traditional way. Furthermore, digital painting is not 'computer-generated' art as the computer does not automatically create images on the screen using some mathematical calculations. On the other hand, the artist uses his own painting technique to create the particular piece of work on the computer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.turningpointarts.com/what-is-digital-painting/|title=What is digital painting? |date=2008-11-01|work=Turning Point Arts|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Painting styles==\n{{Main|Style (visual arts)}}\n''Style'' is used in two senses: It can refer to the distinctive visual elements, techniques and methods that typify an ''individual'' artist's work. It can also refer to the [[Art movement|movement]] or school that an artist is associated with. This can stem from an actual group that the artist was consciously involved with or it can be a category in which art historians have placed the painter. The word 'style' in the latter sense has fallen out of favor in academic discussions about contemporary painting, though it continues to be used in popular contexts. Such movements or classifications include the following:\n<!--When the section below is fully fleshed out, we might end up duplicating the History of painting article...this might be OK if this section is substantially shorter than the History of painting article! -->\n\n===Western===\n\n====Modernism====\n[[Modernism]] describes both a set of cultural tendencies and an array of associated [[cultural movement]]s, originally arising from wide-scale and far-reaching changes to [[Western culture|Western society]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Modernism was a revolt against the conservative values of [[Realism (arts)|realism]].<ref name=\"Barth79Replenishment\">[[John Barth|Barth, John]] (1979) ''[[The Literature of Replenishment]]'', later republished in ''[[The Friday Book]]'(1984)'.</ref><ref name=\"Graff75\">[[Gerald Graff|Graff, Gerald]] (1975) ''Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern.

A salient characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness. This often led to experiments with form, and work that draws attention to the processes and materials used (and to the further tendency of abstraction).<ref>Gardner, Helen, Horst De la Croix, Richard G. Tansey, and Diane Kirkpatrick.

Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored [[Paris Salon]], the [[Impressionists]] organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]], created by [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]] to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon.\n\n=====Abstract styles=====\n[[Abstract art|Abstract painting]] uses a [[visual language]] of form, colour and line to create a composition that may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.<ref>[[Rudolph Arnheim|Arnheim, Rudolph]], 1969, ''Visual Thinking''</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Key|first1=Joan|title=Future Use: Abstract Painting|journal=Third Text|date=September 2009|volume=23|issue=5|pages=557\u201363|doi=10.1080/09528820903184666}}</ref> [[Abstract expressionism]] was an American post-[[World War II]] [[art movement]] that combined the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools\u2014such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], [[Bauhaus]] and [[Cubism]], and the image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.<ref>Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000): Abstract Expressionism.

The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with [[abstract expressionism]] (some critics have used the terms \"action painting\" and \"abstract expressionism\" interchangeably).\n\nOther modernist styles include:\n* [[Color Field]]\n* [[Lyrical Abstraction]]\n* [[Hard-edge painting]]\n* [[Pop art]]\n\n=====Outsider art=====\nThe term [[outsider art]] was coined by [[art critic]] Roger Cardinal in 1972 as an English synonym for art brut ({{IPA-fr|a\u0281 b\u0281yt|lang}}, \"raw art\" or \"rough art\"), a label created by [[France|French]] [[artist]] [[Jean Dubuffet]] to describe [[art]] created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused particularly on art by [[Psychiatric hospital|insane-asylum]] inmates.<ref>Cardinal, Roger, ''Outsider Art'', London, 1972</ref> Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category (an annual Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1992). The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by people outside the mainstream \"art world,\" regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work.\n\n=====Photorealism=====\n[[Photorealism]] is the genre of painting based on using the camera and photographs to gather information and then from this information, creating a painting that appears to be very realistic like a [[photograph]]. The term is primarily applied to paintings from the United States [[art movement]] that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from [[Pop Art]]<ref name=\"Supperrealist Pop Art\">Lindey, Christine ''Superrealist Painting and Sculpture,'' William Morrow and Company, New York, 1980, pp. 27\u201333.</ref><ref name=\"Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15\">Chase, Linda, Photorealism at the Millennium, ''The Not-So-Innocent Eye: Photorealism in Context.''

Tate Museum, Publishers, UK. 2006. p. 1</ref>\n\n=====Surrealism=====\n[[Surrealism]] is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for the artistic and literary production of those affiliated with the [[Surrealist Movement]]. Surrealist artworks feature the element of surprise, the uncanny, the unconscious, unexpected juxtapositions and [[non-sequitur (humor)|non-sequitur]]; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Leader [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement.\n\nSurrealism developed out of the [[Dada]] activities of [[World War I]] and the most important center of the movement was [[Paris]]. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, eventually affecting the [[visual art]]s, [[literature]], [[film]] and [[music]] of many countries, as well as [[politics|political]] thought and practice, [[philosophy]] and [[social theory]].\n\n{{See also|Outline of painting#Styles of painting}}\n\n===Far Eastern===\n* '''[[Chinese painting|Chinese]]'''\n** [[Tang Dynasty painting|Tang Dynasty]]\n** [[Ming Dynasty painting|Ming Dynasty]]\n** [[Shan shui]]\n** [[Ink and wash painting]]\n** [[Bird-and-flower painting|Hua niao]]\n** [[Southern School]]\n*** [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]]\n*** [[Wu School]]\n** [[History of Chinese art#Contemporary Art|Contemporary]]\n* '''[[Japanese painting|Japanese]]'''\n** [[Yamato-e]]\n** [[Rimpa school]]\n** [[Emakimono]]\n** [[Kan\u014d school]]\n** [[Shij\u014d school]]\n** [[Superflat]]\n* '''[[Korean painting|Korean]]'''\n\n===Islamic===\n* [[Arabic miniature]]\n* [[Mughal miniature]]\n* [[Ottoman miniature]]\n* [[Persian miniature]]\n\n===Indian===\n* [[Pattachitra|Oriya school]]\n* [[Bengal school of art|Bengal school]]\n* [[Kangra painting|Kangra]]\n* [[Madhubani art|Madhubani]]\n* [[Mysore painting|Mysore]]\n* [[Rajput painting|Rajput]]\n* [[Mughal painting|Mughal]]\n* [[Samikshavad]]\n* [[Tanjore painting|Tanjore]]\n* [[Warli painting|Warli]]\n* [[Kerala mural painting]]\n\n===African===\n* [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]]\n\n===Contemporary art===\n<!-- It seems that some of the art forms listed here are not painting forms--for example video art -->\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%; border:0 solid #e5ffec; background:#=#e5ffec;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:17%;\"|\n\n===1950s===\n* [[Abstract Expressionism]]\n* [[American Figurative Expressionism]]\n* [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]\n* [[Lyrical Abstraction]]\n* [[New York Figurative Expressionism]]\n* [[New York School (art)|New York School]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===1960s===\n* [[Abstract expressionism]]\n* [[American Figurative Expressionism]]\n* [[Abstract Imagists]]\n* [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]\n* [[Color field]]\n* [[Computer art]]\n* [[Conceptual art]]\n* [[Fluxus]]\n* [[Happening]]s\n* [[Hard-edge painting]]\n* [[Lyrical Abstraction]]\n* [[Minimalism]]\n* [[Neo-figurative]]\n* [[Neo-Dada]]\n* [[New York School (art)|New York School]]\n* [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]]\n* [[Op Art]]\n* [[Performance art]]\n* [[Pop Art]]\n* [[Postminimalism]]\n* [[Washington Color School]]\n* [[Kinetic art]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===1970s===\n* [[Arte Povera]]\n* [[Ascii Art]]\n* [[Bad Painting]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Artist's book]]\n* [[Feminist art]]\n* [[Installation art]]\n* [[Land Art]]\n* [[Lowbrow (art movement)]]\n* [[Photorealism]]\n* [[Postminimalism]]\n* [[Process Art]]\n* [[Video art]]\n* [[Funk art]]\n* [[Pattern and Decoration]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===1980s===\n* [[Appropriation art]]\n* [[Culture jamming]]\n* [[Demoscene]]\n* [[Electronic art]]\n* [[Figuration Libre]]\n* [[Graffiti Art]]\n* [[Live Art (art form)|Live art]]\n* [[Mail art]]\n* [[Postmodern art]]\n* [[Neo-conceptual art]]\n* [[Neo-expressionism]]\n* [[Neo-pop]]\n* [[Sound art]]\n* [[Transgressive art]]\n* [[Video installation]]\n* [[Institutional Critique]]\n* [[Neogeo (art)|NeoGeo]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===1990s===\n* [[Bio art]]\n* [[Cyberarts]]\n* [[Cynical Realism]]\n* [[Digital Art]]\n* [[Information art]]\n* [[Internet art]]\n* [[Massurrealism]]\n* [[Maximalism]]\n* [[New media art]]\n* [[Software art]]\n* [[New European Painting]]\n* [[Young British Artists]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:16%;\"|\n\n===2000s===\n* [[Digital painting|Digital Painting]]\n* [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|Hyperrealism]]\n* [[Classical Realism]]\n* [[Relational art]]\n* [[Street art]]\n* [[Stuckism]]\n* [[Superflat]]\n* [[Pseudorealism]]\n* [[Videogame art]]\n* [[Superstroke]]\n* [[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ art]]\n* [[Virtual art]]\n* [[Indigenouism|Indigenous Art]]\n|}\n\n==Types of painting==\n\n===Allegory===\n[[Allegory]] is a [[Figurative art|figurative]] [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of representation conveying meaning other than the literal. Allegory communicates its message by means of [[symbol]]ic figures, actions or symbolic representation. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of [[rhetoric]], but an allegory does not have to be expressed in [[language]]: it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in realistic painting. An example of a simple visual allegory is the image of the [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]]. Viewers understand that the image of the grim reaper is a symbolic representation of death.\n\n===Bodeg\u00f3n===\n[[File:Bodeg\u00f3n de recipientes (Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|thumb|''Bodeg\u00f3n'' or ''Still Life with Pottery Jars'', by [[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n]]. 1636, Oil on canvas; 46 x 84&nbsp;cm; [[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]]]]\n\nIn [[Spanish art]], a [[bodeg\u00f3n]] is a [[still life]] painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but significant still life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. Starting in the [[Baroque]] period, such paintings became popular in Spain in the second quarter of the 17th century. The tradition of still life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary [[Low Countries]], today Belgium and [[Netherlands]] (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in [[southern Europe]]. [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Still lifes|Northern still lifes]] had many subgenres: the ''breakfast piece'' was augmented by the ''[[trompe-l'\u0153il]]'', the ''flower bouquet'', and the ''[[vanitas]]''. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of ''breakfast piece'' did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table.\n\n===Figure painting===\nA [[figure painting]] is a [[work of art]] in any of the painting media with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or [[Nude (art)|nude]].\nFigure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the contrast subjects of art since the first stone age cave paintings, and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Droste|first1=Flip|title=Cave Paintings of the Early Stone Age|journal=Semiotica|date=October 2014|volume=2014|issue=202|pages=155\u2013165|doi=10.1515/sem-2014-0035}}</ref> Some artists well known for figure painting are [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[\u00c9douard Manet]].\n\n[[File:Reza Abbasi - Two Lovers (1630).jpg|thumb|''Two Lovers'' by [[Reza Abbasi]], 1630]]\n\n===Illustration painting===\n[[Illustration]] paintings are those used as illustrations in books, magazines, and theater or movie [[posters]] and comic books. Today, there is a growing interest in collecting and admiring the original artwork. Various museum exhibitions, magazines and art galleries have devoted space to the illustrators of the past. In the visual art world, illustrators have sometimes been considered less important in comparison with fine artists and [[graphic designer]]s. But as the result of [[computer game]] and comic industry growth, illustrations are becoming valued as popular and profitable art works that can acquire a wider market than the other two, especially in [[Korea]], Japan, [[Hong Kong]] and United States.\n\n===Landscape painting===\n{{main|Landscape art}}\n[[File:Andreas Achenbach - Clearing Up\u2014Coast of Sicily - Walters 37116.jpg|left|thumb|''Clearing Up, Coast of Sicily'', a painting by [[Andreas Achenbach]], who specialized in the \"sublime\" mode of landscape painting in which man is dwarfed by nature's might and fury. \u2013 1847<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/19760\n |title=Clearing Up\u2014Coast of Sicily}}</ref> [[The Walters Art Museum]].]]\n[[Landscape art|Landscape painting]] is a term that covers the depiction of natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, and especially art where the main subject is a wide view, with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and [[weather]] is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects. The two main traditions spring from [[Western painting]] and [[Chinese art]], going back well over a thousand years in both cases.\n\n===Portrait painting===\n[[Portrait painting]]s are representations of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, [[Personality type|personality]], and even the mood of the person. The art of the portrait flourished in Ancient Greek and especially [[Roman sculpture]], where sitters demanded individualized and realistic portraits, even unflattering ones. One of the best-known portraits in the Western world is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting titled ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', which is thought to be a portrait of [[Lisa del Giocondo|Lisa Gherardini]], the wife of Francesco del Giocondo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mona-lisa-%E2%80%93-portrait-lisa-gherardini-wife-francesco-del-giocondo |title=Mona Lisa \u2013 Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo |publisher=Louvre Museum |date= c. 1503\u201319|accessdate=2014-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730003620/http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mona-lisa-%E2%80%93-portrait-lisa-gherardini-wife-francesco-del-giocondo |archivedate=30 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Still life===\n[[File:Otto Marseus van Schrieck - A Forest Floor Still-Life - WGA21061.jpg|thumb|''A Forest Floor Still-Life'' by [[Otto Marseus van Schrieck]], 1666]]\nA [[still life]] is a work of [[art]] depicting mostly [[inanimate]] subject matter, typically commonplace objects\u2014which may be either natural (food, flowers, plants, rocks, or shells) or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, and so on). With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Greek/Roman art, still life paintings give the artist more leeway in the arrangement of design elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as [[Landscape art|landscape]] or [[portrait]]ure. Still life paintings, particularly before 1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. Some modern still life breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media, and uses found objects, photography, computer graphics, as well as video and sound.\n\n===Veduta===\nA [[veduta]] is a highly detailed, usually large-scale painting of a [[cityscape]] or some other vista. This [[genre]] of [[landscape art|landscape]] originated in [[Flanders]], where artists such as [[Paul Bril]] painted ''vedute'' as early as the 16th century. As the itinerary of the [[Grand Tour]] became somewhat standardized, ''vedute'' of familiar scenes like the Roman Forum or the Grand Canal recalled early ventures to the Continent for aristocratic Englishmen. In the later 19th century, more personal impressions of cityscapes replaced the desire for topographical accuracy, which was satisfied instead by painted [[panorama]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Visual arts|Painting}}\n* [[20th-century Western painting]]\n* [[Cobweb painting]]\n* [[Drawing]]\n* [[Graphic arts]]\n* [[Index of painting-related articles]]\n* [[List of most expensive paintings]]\n* [[Outline of painting]]\n* [[Business process outsourcing in China#Painting|Painting outsourcing in China]]\n* [[Visual arts]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Painting}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Wiktionary|painting}}\n* Daniel, H.

He escaped along with John Hawkins, surviving the attack by swimming.\n\nDrake's hostility towards the Spanish is said to have started with this incident. Following the [[Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa (1568)|defeat at San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], Drake vowed revenge.<ref>\"Drake escaped during the attack and returned to England in command of a small vessel, the Judith, with an even greater determination to have his revenge upon Spain and the Spanish king, Philip II.\"\u2014\"[http://library.eb.co.uk/levels/high/article/31135 Sir Francis Drake]\" article in online ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|Britannica Library]]''.

He renewed his visit the next year for the sole purpose of obtaining information.<ref name=\"James Mill\"/>\n\nIn 1572, he embarked on his first major independent enterprise. He planned an attack on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], known to the Spanish as [[Tierra Firma|Tierra Firme]] and the English as the [[Spanish Main]].  This was the point at which the silver and gold treasure of [[Peru]] had to be landed and sent overland to the [[Caribbean Sea]], where galleons from Spain would pick it up at the town of [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]]. Drake left Plymouth on 24 May 1572, with a crew of 73 men in two small vessels, the ''Pascha'' (70 tons) and the ''Swan'' (25 tons), to capture Nombre de Dios.\n\nHis first raid was late in July 1572.  Drake and his men captured the town and its treasure.  When his men noticed that Drake was bleeding profusely from a wound, they insisted on withdrawing to save his life and left the treasure.  Drake stayed in the area for almost a year, raiding Spanish shipping and attempting to capture a treasure shipment.\n\n{{quote box2 |width=320px |border=1px |align=right |bgcolor=#ffe4b5 |fontsize=100% |halign=center\n|quote=The people of quality dislike him for having risen so high from such a lowly family; the rest say he is the main cause of wars.\n|source=<small>{{mdash}} Gonzalo Gonz\u00e1lez del Castillo, letter to [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]], 1592</small><ref>Cummins 1997, p. 5</ref>}}\n\nThe most celebrated of Drake's adventures along the [[Spanish Main]] was his capture of the Spanish Silver Train at [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]] in March 1573. He raided the waters around [[Dari\u00e9n, Panama|Darien]] (in modern [[Panama]]) with a crew including many French privateers including [[Guillaume Le Testu]], a French buccaneer, and [[Maroon (people)|African slaves (Maroons)]] who had escaped the Spanish. Drake tracked the Silver Train to the nearby port of Nombre de Dios. After their attack on the richly laden mule train, Drake and his party found that they had captured around 20 tons of silver and gold. They buried much of the treasure, as it was too much for their party to carry, and made off with a fortune in gold.<ref name=\"Marley2008\">{{cite book|author=David Marley|title=Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkgGVTOr2EsC&pg=PA103|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-100-8|pages=103\u2013104}}</ref><ref name=\"Konstam2011\">{{cite book|author=Angus Konstam|title=The Great Expedition: Sir Francis Drake on the Spanish Main 1585\u201386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKyHCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT29|date=20 December 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78096-233-7|page=29}}</ref> (An account of this may have given rise to subsequent stories of pirates and buried treasure). Wounded, Le Testu was captured and later beheaded.  The small band of adventurers dragged as much gold and silver as they could carry back across some 18 miles of jungle-covered mountains to where they had left the raiding boats. When they got to the coast, the boats were gone. Drake and his men, downhearted, exhausted and hungry, had nowhere to go and the Spanish were not far behind.\n\nAt this point, Drake rallied his men, buried the treasure on the beach, and built a raft to sail with two volunteers ten miles along the surf-lashed coast to where they had left the flagship.  When Drake finally reached its deck, his men were alarmed at his bedraggled appearance.  Fearing the worst, they asked him how the raid had gone. Drake could not resist a joke and teased them by looking downhearted. Then he laughed, pulled a necklace of Spanish gold from around his neck and said \"Our voyage is made, lads!\" By 9 August 1573, he had returned to Plymouth.\n\nIt was during this expedition that he climbed a high tree in the central mountains of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and thus became the first Englishman to see the Pacific Ocean. He remarked as he saw it that he hoped one day an Englishman would be able to sail it\u2014which he would do years later as part of his circumnavigation of the world.<ref>Cummins 1997, p. 287</ref>\n\nWhen Drake returned to Plymouth after the raids, the government signed a temporary truce with King Philip II of Spain and so was unable to acknowledge Drake's accomplishment officially.

The northern limit of Drake's exploration of the Pacific coast of North America is still in dispute. [[Drake's Bay]] is south of [[Cape Mendocino]].]]\n\nWith the success of the Panama isthmus raid in 1577, [[Elizabeth I of England]] sent Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake used the plans that Sir [[Richard Grenville]] had received the patent for in 1574 from Elizabeth, which was rescinded a year later after protests from Philip of Spain. He set out from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, but bad weather threatened him and his fleet.  They were forced to take refuge in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], from where they returned to Plymouth for repair.\n\nAfter this major setback, Drake set sail again on 13 December aboard ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'' with four other ships and 164 men. He soon added a sixth ship, ''Mary'' (formerly ''Santa Maria''), a Portuguese merchant ship that had been captured off the coast of Africa near the [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]. He also added its captain, Nuno da Silva, a man with considerable experience navigating in South American waters.\n\nDrake's fleet suffered great attrition; he scuttled both ''Christopher'' and the [[flyboat]] ''Swan'' due to loss of men on the Atlantic crossing. He made landfall at the gloomy bay of [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n|San Julian]], in what is now [[Argentina]]. Ferdinand Magellan had called here half a century earlier, where he put to death some mutineers. Drake's men saw weathered and bleached skeletons on the grim Spanish [[gibbet]]s. Following Magellan's example, Drake tried and executed his own \"mutineer\" [[Thomas Doughty (explorer)|Thomas Doughty]]. The crew discovered that ''Mary'' had rotting timbers, so they burned the ship. Drake decided to remain the winter in San Julian before attempting the [[Strait of Magellan]].\n\n===Execution of Thomas Doughty===\n{{Main|Thomas Doughty (explorer)}}\n[[File:DrakeStatueTavistock.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue in Tavistock, in the parish of which he was born, by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883.]]\n\nOn his voyage to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets, Drake had several quarrels with his co-commander Thomas Doughty and on 3 June 1578, accused him of witchcraft and charged him with [[mutiny]] and [[treason]] in a shipboard trial.<ref name= Coote /> Drake claimed to have a (never presented) commission from the Queen to carry out such acts and denied Doughty a trial in England. The main pieces of evidence against Doughty were the testimony of the ship's carpenter, Edward Bright, who after the trial was promoted to master of the ship ''Marigold'', and Doughty's admission of telling [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], a vocal opponent of agitating the Spanish, of the intent of the voyage. Drake consented to his request of [[Eucharist|Communion]] and dined with him, of which [[Francis Fletcher (clergyman)|Francis Fletcher]] had this strange account:\n\n{{quote|And after this holy repast, they dined also at the same table together, as cheerfully, in sobriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime, each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if some journey only had been in hand.}}\n\nDrake had Thomas Doughty beheaded on 2 July 1578. When the ship's chaplain Francis Fletcher in a sermon suggested that the woes of the voyage in January 1580 were connected to the unjust demise of Doughty, Drake chained the clergyman to a hatch cover and pronounced him excommunicated.\n\n===Entering the Pacific (1578)===\n[[File:Sfec goldenhind02crop.jpg|thumb|A replica of the ''[[Golden Hind]]'']]\n\nThe three remaining ships of his convoy departed for the Magellan Strait at the southern tip of South America. A few weeks later (September 1578) Drake made it to the Pacific, but violent storms destroyed one of the three ships, the ''Marigold'' (captained by John Thomas) in the strait and caused another, the ''Elizabeth'' captained by [[John Wynter]], to return to England, leaving only the ''Pelican''. After this passage, the ''Pelican'' was pushed south and discovered an island that Drake called [[Elizabeth Island (Cape Horn)|Elizabeth Island]]. Drake, like navigators before him, probably reached a latitude of 55\u00b0S (according to astronomical data quoted in [[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation'' of 1589) along the Chilean coast.<ref name=Wagner>Wagner, Henry R., ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4286-2255-1}}.</ref> In the Magellan Strait Francis and his men engaged in skirmish with local indigenous people, becoming the first Europeans to kill indigenous peoples in southern Patagonia.<ref name=Mateo>{{cite book |last=Martinic |first=Mateo |author-link=Mateo Martinic |date=1977 |title=Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-10441.html |location=Santiago |publisher=Andr\u00e9s Bello |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=}}</ref> During the stay in the strait, crew members discovered that an infusion made of the bark of ''[[Drimys winteri]]'' could be used as remedy against [[scurvy]].

The ''Golden Hind'' sailed north along the Pacific coast of South America, attacking Spanish ports and pillaging towns. Some Spanish ships were captured, and Drake used their more accurate charts.

Drake also discovered news of another ship, ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n]]'', which was sailing west towards [[Manila]]. It would come to be called the ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n|Cacafuego]]''. Drake gave chase and eventually captured the treasure ship, which proved his most profitable capture.\n\nAboard ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n'', Drake found {{convert|80|lb|order=flip}} of gold, a golden [[crucifix]], [[gemstone|jewels]], 13&nbsp;chests full of royals of plate and {{convert|26|long ton|e3kg|order=flip}} of silver. Drake was naturally pleased at his good luck in capturing the galleon, and he showed it by dining with the captured ship's officers and gentleman passengers. He offloaded his captives a short time later, and gave each one gifts appropriate to their rank, as well as a letter of [[safe conduct]].\n\n===Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)===\n{{Main|New Albion}}\n[[File:Drake CA 1590.jpg|thumb|250px|Drake's landing in California, engraving published 1590 by [[Theodor de Bry]]]]\n\nAfter looting the Cacafuego, Drake turned north, hoping to meet another Spanish treasure ship coming south on its return from [[Manila galleon|Manila to Acapulco]]. Although he failed to find a treasure ship, Drake reputedly sailed as far north as the 38th parallel, landing on the coast of California on 17 June 1579. He found a good port, landed, repaired and restocked his vessels, then stayed for a time, keeping friendly relations with the [[Coast Miwok]] natives. He claimed the land in the name of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] for the English Crown, called ''[[Nova Albion]]''\u2014[[Latin]] for \"New Britain\". Assertions that he left some of his men behind as an embryo \"colony\" are founded on the reduced number who were with him in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]].<ref>Dismissed by John Cummins, ''Francis Drake: The Lives of a Hero'' (1997) p. 118: \"In view of the prominence given in different versions to the crowning of Drake it would be odd if the establishment of a colony had gone unrecorded.\"</ref>\n\nThe precise location of the port was carefully guarded to keep it secret from the Spaniards, and several of Drake's maps may have been altered to this end.  All first-hand records from the voyage, including logs, paintings and charts, were lost when [[Whitehall Palace]] burned in 1698. A bronze plaque inscribed with Drake's claim to the new lands \u2013 [[Drake's Plate of Brass]] \u2013 fitting the description in his account, was discovered in [[Marin County]], California but was later declared a hoax.

While there, ''Golden Hind'' became caught on a reef and was almost lost. After the sailors waited three days for convenient tides and had dumped cargo, they freed the barque. Befriending a sultan king of the Moluccas, Drake and his men became involved in some intrigues with the Portuguese there. He made multiple stops on his way toward the tip of Africa, eventually rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and reached [[Sierra Leone]] by 22 July 1580.\n\n===Return to Plymouth (1580)===\n\nOn 26 September, ''Golden Hind'' sailed into Plymouth with Drake and 59&nbsp;remaining crew aboard, along with a rich cargo of spices and captured Spanish treasures. The Queen's half-share of the cargo surpassed the rest of the crown's income for that entire year. Drake was hailed as the first Englishman to circumnavigate the Earth (and the second such voyage arriving with at least one ship intact, after [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano|Elcano]]'s in 1520).<ref name=\"The Drake Jewel\">{{cite web|url=http://oieahc.wm.edu/uncommon/118/drake.cfm |title=The Drake Jewel |publisher=Oieahc.wm.edu |accessdate=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Queen declared that all written accounts of Drake's voyages were to become the Queen's secrets of the Realm,<!--first publication date is needed here--> and Drake and the other participants of his voyages on the pain of death sworn to their secrecy; she intended to keep Drake's activities away from the eyes of rival Spain. Drake presented the Queen with a jewel token commemorating the circumnavigation. Taken as a prize off the Pacific coast of Mexico, it was made of enamelled gold and bore an African diamond and a ship with an ebony hull.<ref name=\"The Drake Jewel\"/>\n\nFor her part, the Queen gave Drake a jewel with her portrait, an unusual gift to bestow upon a commoner, and one that Drake sported proudly in his 1591 portrait by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger|Marcus Gheeraerts]] now at the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich. On one side is a state portrait of Elizabeth by the miniaturist [[Nicholas Hilliard]], on the other a [[sardonyx]] cameo of double portrait busts, a regal woman and an African male.

Often abroad, there is little evidence to suggest he was active in Westminster, despite being a member of parliament on three occasions.\n\nAfter returning from his voyage of circumnavigation, Drake became the Mayor of [[Plymouth]], in September 1581.<ref name=\"ODNB04\"/> He became a member of parliament during a session of the 4th Parliament of [[Elizabeth I]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/parliament/1572|title = 1572| website=History of Parliament.|accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref> on 16 January 1581, for the constituency of [[Camelford]].

Buckland Abbey is now in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and a number of mementos of his life are displayed there.\n\n==Great Expedition to America==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Boazio-Sir Francis Drakes West Indian Voyage.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Drake's Great Expedition in 1585 by [[Giovanni Battista Boazio]]]]\n\nWar had already been declared by Phillip II after the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]], so the Queen through [[Francis Walsingham]] ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish colonies in a kind of [[preemptive strike]]. An expedition left Plymouth in September 1585 with Drake in command of twenty-one ships with 1,800 soldiers under [[Christopher Carleill]]. He first attacked [[Vigo]] in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. He then [[Capture of Santiago (1585)|plundered Santiago]] in the Cape Verde islands after which the fleet then sailed across the Atlantic, [[Battle of Santo Domingo (1586)|sacked the port]] of [[Santo Domingo]], and [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|captured the city]] of [[Cartagena de Indias]] in present-day Colombia. On 6 June 1586, during the return leg of the voyage, [[Raid on St. Augustine|he raided]] the Spanish fort of [[St. Augustine, Florida|San August\u00edn]] in [[Spanish Florida]].\n\nAfter the raids he then went on to find Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s settlement much further north at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] which he replenished and also took back with him all of the original colonists before Sir Richard Greynvile arrived with supplies and more colonists.

Bronze plaque by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883, base of Drake statue, Tavistock]]\n[[File:Loutherbourg-Spanish Armada.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Spanish Armada]].]]\n\nDrake was [[vice admiral]] in command of the English fleet (under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]],) when it overcame the [[Spanish Armada]] that was attempting to invade England in 1588. As the English fleet pursued the Armada up the English Channel in closing darkness, Drake broke off and captured the Spanish galleon ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario (1587)|Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario]]'', along with Admiral Pedro de Vald\u00e9s and all his crew. The Spanish ship was known to be carrying substantial funds to pay the Spanish Army in the Low Countries. Drake's ship had been leading the English pursuit of the Armada by means of a lantern. By extinguishing this for the capture, Drake put the fleet into disarray overnight.\n\nOn the night of 29 July, along with Howard, Drake organised [[Fire ship|fire-ships]], causing the majority of the Spanish captains to break formation and sail out of [[Calais]] into the open sea. The next day, Drake was present at the [[Naval battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]]. He wrote as follows to Admiral Henry Seymour after coming upon part of the Spanish Armada, whilst aboard ''[[English ship Revenge (1577)|Revenge]]'' on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]):<ref>Letter to Admiral Henry Seymour written aboard ''Revenge'' on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]) Turner, Sharon. ''The History of England from the Earliest Period to the Death of Elizabeth'', 1835.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Coming up to them, there has passed some common shot between some of our fleet and some of them; and as far as we perceive, they are determined to sell their lives with blows.</blockquote>\n\nThe most famous (but probably apocryphal) anecdote about Drake relates that, prior to the battle, he was playing a game of [[bowls]] on [[Plymouth Hoe]]. On being warned of the approach of the Spanish fleet, Drake is said to have remarked that there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the Spaniards. There is no known eyewitness account of this incident and the earliest retelling of it was printed 37 years later.<ref name=Kelsey/> Adverse winds and currents caused some delay in the launching of the English fleet as the Spanish drew nearer,<ref name=Kelsey /> perhaps prompting a popular myth of Drake's cavalier attitude to the Spanish threat.  It might also have been later ascribed to the [[Stiff upper lip|stoic]] attribute of [[Britishness|British culture]].\n\n===Drake\u2013Norris Expedition===\n{{Main|English Armada}}\n\nIn 1589, the year after defeating the Armada the English sent their own to attack Spain, Drake and [[John Norreys|Sir John Norreys]] were given three tasks: seek out and destroy the remaining ships, support the rebels in [[Lisbon]], Portugal against King Philip II (then king of Spain and Portugal), and take the [[Azores]] if possible. In [[the Siege of Coru\u00f1a]] Drake and Norreys destroyed a few ships in the harbour of [[A Coru\u00f1a]] in Spain but lost more than 12,000 lives and 20 ships.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} This defeat in all fronts delayed Drake, and he was forced to forgo hunting the rest of the surviving ships and head on to Lisbon.<ref name=Kraus />\n\n==Defeats and death==\n[[File:BurialOfDrakeTavistockMonument.jpg|thumb|Drake's burial at sea off [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]]. Bronze plaque by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883, base of Drake statue, Tavistock.]]\n\nDrake's seafaring career continued into his mid-fifties. In 1595, he [[Battle of Las Palmas|failed to conquer]] the port of [[Las Palmas]], and following a disastrous campaign against Spanish America, where he suffered a number of defeats, he unsuccessfully attacked San Juan de Puerto Rico, eventually losing the [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|Battle of San Juan]].\n\nThe Spanish gunners from [[El Morro Castle]] shot a cannonball through the cabin of Drake's flagship, but he survived. He attempted to [[Drake's Assault on Panama|attack over land]] in an effort to capture the rich port of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo|Panam\u00e1]] but was defeated again. A few weeks later, in January 1596, he died (aged about 56) of [[dysentery]], a common disease in the tropics at the time, while anchored off the coast of [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobelo]] where some Spanish treasure ships had sought shelter. Following his death, the English fleet withdrew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepirateking.com/bios/drake_francis.htm|title=Sir Francis Drake | website=thepirateking.com |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBefore dying, he asked to be dressed in his full armour. He was buried at sea in a sealed lead-lined coffin, near Portobelo, a few miles off the coastline. It is supposed that his final resting place is near the wrecks of two British ships, the ''Elizabeth'' and the ''Delight'', scuttled in Portobelo Bay.

Places there carrying his name include the naval base [[HMS Drake]], [[Drake's Island]], and a [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre|shopping centre]] and [[roundabout]] named [[Drake (ward)|Drake Circus]]. [[Plymouth Hoe]] is also home to a statue of Drake.\n\nIn the United States [[Drakes Bay]] and [[Sir Francis Drake Boulevard]] of [[Marin County, California]] are both named after him, as well as the high school in [[San Anselmo, California]]. The boulevard runs between Drakes Bay at [[Point Reyes]] to [[New Albion#Point San Quentin, San Francisco Bay, California|Point San Quentin]] on [[San Francisco Bay]]. A large hotel in [[Union Square, San Francisco]] also bears his name.  Additionally, the [[Sir Francis Drake Channel]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]] bears his name.\n\nIn [[British Columbia]], Canada, where some theorise he may also have landed to the north of the usual site considered to be [[Nova Albion]], various mountains were named in the 1930s for him, or in connection with Elizabeth I or other figures of that era, including [[Mount Sir Francis Drake]], [[Mount Queen Bess]], and the [[Golden Hinde]], the highest mountain on [[Vancouver Island]].\n\nDrake's will was the focus of a vast [[confidence scheme]] which [[Oscar Hartzell]] perpetrated in the 1920s and 1930s.  He convinced thousands of people, mostly in the American Midwest, that Drake's fortune was being held by the British government, and had compounded to a huge amount. If their last name was Drake they might be eligible for a share if they paid Hartzell to be their agent. The swindle continued until a copy of Drake's will was brought to Hartzell's mail fraud trial and he was convicted and imprisoned.<ref name=Rayner-Richard>Rayner, Richard (22 April 2002). \"The Admiral and the Con Man\".

He escaped along with John Hawkins, surviving the attack by swimming.\n\nDrake's hostility towards the Spanish is said to have started with this incident. Following the [[Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa (1568)|defeat at San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], Drake vowed revenge.<ref>\"Drake escaped during the attack and returned to England in command of a small vessel, the Judith, with an even greater determination to have his revenge upon Spain and the Spanish king, Philip II.\"\u2014\"[http://library.eb.co.uk/levels/high/article/31135 Sir Francis Drake]\" article in online ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|Britannica Library]]''.

He renewed his visit the next year for the sole purpose of obtaining information.<ref name=\"James Mill\"/>\n\nIn 1572, he embarked on his first major independent enterprise. He planned an attack on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], known to the Spanish as [[Tierra Firma|Tierra Firme]] and the English as the [[Spanish Main]].  This was the point at which the silver and gold treasure of [[Peru]] had to be landed and sent overland to the [[Caribbean Sea]], where galleons from Spain would pick it up at the town of [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]]. Drake left Plymouth on 24 May 1572, with a crew of 73 men in two small vessels, the ''Pascha'' (70 tons) and the ''Swan'' (25 tons), to capture Nombre de Dios.\n\nHis first raid was late in July 1572.  Drake and his men captured the town and its treasure.  When his men noticed that Drake was bleeding profusely from a wound, they insisted on withdrawing to save his life and left the treasure.  Drake stayed in the area for almost a year, raiding Spanish shipping and attempting to capture a treasure shipment.\n\n{{quote box2 |width=320px |border=1px |align=right |bgcolor=#ffe4b5 |fontsize=100% |halign=center\n|quote=The people of quality dislike him for having risen so high from such a lowly family; the rest say he is the main cause of wars.\n|source=<small>{{mdash}} Gonzalo Gonz\u00e1lez del Castillo, letter to [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]], 1592</small><ref>Cummins 1997, p. 5</ref>}}\n\nThe most celebrated of Drake's adventures along the [[Spanish Main]] was his capture of the Spanish Silver Train at [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]] in March 1573. He raided the waters around [[Dari\u00e9n, Panama|Darien]] (in modern [[Panama]]) with a crew including many French privateers including [[Guillaume Le Testu]], a French buccaneer, and [[Maroon (people)|African slaves (Maroons)]] who had escaped the Spanish. Drake tracked the Silver Train to the nearby port of Nombre de Dios. After their attack on the richly laden mule train, Drake and his party found that they had captured around 20 tons of silver and gold. They buried much of the treasure, as it was too much for their party to carry, and made off with a fortune in gold.<ref name=\"Marley2008\">{{cite book|author=David Marley|title=Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkgGVTOr2EsC&pg=PA103|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-100-8|pages=103\u2013104}}</ref><ref name=\"Konstam2011\">{{cite book|author=Angus Konstam|title=The Great Expedition: Sir Francis Drake on the Spanish Main 1585\u201386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKyHCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT29|date=20 December 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78096-233-7|page=29}}</ref> (An account of this may have given rise to subsequent stories of pirates and buried treasure). Wounded, Le Testu was captured and later beheaded.  The small band of adventurers dragged as much gold and silver as they could carry back across some 18 miles of jungle-covered mountains to where they had left the raiding boats. When they got to the coast, the boats were gone. Drake and his men, downhearted, exhausted and hungry, had nowhere to go and the Spanish were not far behind.\n\nAt this point, Drake rallied his men, buried the treasure on the beach, and built a raft to sail with two volunteers ten miles along the surf-lashed coast to where they had left the flagship.  When Drake finally reached its deck, his men were alarmed at his bedraggled appearance.  Fearing the worst, they asked him how the raid had gone. Drake could not resist a joke and teased them by looking downhearted. Then he laughed, pulled a necklace of Spanish gold from around his neck and said \"Our voyage is made, lads!\" By 9 August 1573, he had returned to Plymouth.\n\nIt was during this expedition that he climbed a high tree in the central mountains of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and thus became the first Englishman to see the Pacific Ocean. He remarked as he saw it that he hoped one day an Englishman would be able to sail it\u2014which he would do years later as part of his circumnavigation of the world.<ref>Cummins 1997, p. 287</ref>\n\nWhen Drake returned to Plymouth after the raids, the government signed a temporary truce with King Philip II of Spain and so was unable to acknowledge Drake's accomplishment officially. Drake was considered a hero in England and a pirate in Spain for his raids.<ref>Cummins 1997, p. 273</ref>\n\n==Rathlin Island massacre==\n\nDrake was present at the [[Rathlin Island massacre]] in 1575. Acting on the instructions of Sir Henry Sidney and the Earl of Essex, Sir John Norreys and Drake laid siege to [[Rathlin Castle]].

The northern limit of Drake's exploration of the Pacific coast of North America is still in dispute. [[Drake's Bay]] is south of [[Cape Mendocino]].]]\n\nWith the success of the Panama isthmus raid in 1577, [[Elizabeth I of England]] sent Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake used the plans that Sir [[Richard Grenville]] had received the patent for in 1574 from Elizabeth, which was rescinded a year later after protests from Philip of Spain. He set out from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, but bad weather threatened him and his fleet.  They were forced to take refuge in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], from where they returned to Plymouth for repair.\n\nAfter this major setback, Drake set sail again on 13 December aboard ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'' with four other ships and 164 men. He soon added a sixth ship, ''Mary'' (formerly ''Santa Maria''), a Portuguese merchant ship that had been captured off the coast of Africa near the [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]. He also added its captain, Nuno da Silva, a man with considerable experience navigating in South American waters.\n\nDrake's fleet suffered great attrition; he scuttled both ''Christopher'' and the [[flyboat]] ''Swan'' due to loss of men on the Atlantic crossing. He made landfall at the gloomy bay of [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n|San Julian]], in what is now [[Argentina]]. Ferdinand Magellan had called here half a century earlier, where he put to death some mutineers. Drake's men saw weathered and bleached skeletons on the grim Spanish [[gibbet]]s. Following Magellan's example, Drake tried and executed his own \"mutineer\" [[Thomas Doughty (explorer)|Thomas Doughty]]. The crew discovered that ''Mary'' had rotting timbers, so they burned the ship. Drake decided to remain the winter in San Julian before attempting the [[Strait of Magellan]].\n\n===Execution of Thomas Doughty===\n{{Main|Thomas Doughty (explorer)}}\n[[File:DrakeStatueTavistock.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue in Tavistock, in the parish of which he was born, by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883.]]\n\nOn his voyage to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets, Drake had several quarrels with his co-commander Thomas Doughty and on 3 June 1578, accused him of witchcraft and charged him with [[mutiny]] and [[treason]] in a shipboard trial.<ref name= Coote /> Drake claimed to have a (never presented) commission from the Queen to carry out such acts and denied Doughty a trial in England. The main pieces of evidence against Doughty were the testimony of the ship's carpenter, Edward Bright, who after the trial was promoted to master of the ship ''Marigold'', and Doughty's admission of telling [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], a vocal opponent of agitating the Spanish, of the intent of the voyage. Drake consented to his request of [[Eucharist|Communion]] and dined with him, of which [[Francis Fletcher (clergyman)|Francis Fletcher]] had this strange account:\n\n{{quote|And after this holy repast, they dined also at the same table together, as cheerfully, in sobriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime, each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if some journey only had been in hand.}}\n\nDrake had Thomas Doughty beheaded on 2 July 1578. When the ship's chaplain Francis Fletcher in a sermon suggested that the woes of the voyage in January 1580 were connected to the unjust demise of Doughty, Drake chained the clergyman to a hatch cover and pronounced him excommunicated.\n\n===Entering the Pacific (1578)===\n[[File:Sfec goldenhind02crop.jpg|thumb|A replica of the ''[[Golden Hind]]'']]\n\nThe three remaining ships of his convoy departed for the Magellan Strait at the southern tip of South America. A few weeks later (September 1578) Drake made it to the Pacific, but violent storms destroyed one of the three ships, the ''Marigold'' (captained by John Thomas) in the strait and caused another, the ''Elizabeth'' captained by [[John Wynter]], to return to England, leaving only the ''Pelican''. After this passage, the ''Pelican'' was pushed south and discovered an island that Drake called [[Elizabeth Island (Cape Horn)|Elizabeth Island]]. Drake, like navigators before him, probably reached a latitude of 55\u00b0S (according to astronomical data quoted in [[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation'' of 1589) along the Chilean coast.<ref name=Wagner>Wagner, Henry R., ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4286-2255-1}}.</ref> In the Magellan Strait Francis and his men engaged in skirmish with local indigenous people, becoming the first Europeans to kill indigenous peoples in southern Patagonia.<ref name=Mateo>{{cite book |last=Martinic |first=Mateo |author-link=Mateo Martinic |date=1977 |title=Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-10441.html |location=Santiago |publisher=Andr\u00e9s Bello |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=}}</ref> During the stay in the strait, crew members discovered that an infusion made of the bark of ''[[Drimys winteri]]'' could be used as remedy against [[scurvy]].

The ''Golden Hind'' sailed north along the Pacific coast of South America, attacking Spanish ports and pillaging towns. Some Spanish ships were captured, and Drake used their more accurate charts. Before reaching the coast of [[Peru]], Drake visited [[Mocha Island]], where he was seriously injured by hostile [[Mapuche]]. Later he sacked the port of [[Valpara\u00edso]] further north in Chile, where he also captured a ship full of [[Chilean wine]].<ref name=Orich>{{cite journal|last=Cort\u00e9s Olivares|first=Hern\u00e1n F. |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-23762005000200005&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es |title=El origen, producci\u00f3n y comercio del pisco chileno, 1546\u20131931 |doi=10.4067/S0718-23762005000200005 |journal=[[Universum (journal)|Universum]]|year=2005|volume=2|issue=20|pages=42\u201381 |publisher=Scielo.cl |accessdate=25 October 2012 |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Capture of Spanish treasure ships===\nNear [[Lima]], Drake captured a Spanish ship laden with 25,000&nbsp;[[Spanish dollar|pesos]] of Peruvian gold, amounting in value to 37,000&nbsp;[[ducat]]s of Spanish money (about \u00a37m by modern standards). Drake also discovered news of another ship, ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n]]'', which was sailing west towards [[Manila]]. It would come to be called the ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n|Cacafuego]]''. Drake gave chase and eventually captured the treasure ship, which proved his most profitable capture.\n\nAboard ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n'', Drake found {{convert|80|lb|order=flip}} of gold, a golden [[crucifix]], [[gemstone|jewels]], 13&nbsp;chests full of royals of plate and {{convert|26|long ton|e3kg|order=flip}} of silver. Drake was naturally pleased at his good luck in capturing the galleon, and he showed it by dining with the captured ship's officers and gentleman passengers. He offloaded his captives a short time later, and gave each one gifts appropriate to their rank, as well as a letter of [[safe conduct]].\n\n===Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)===\n{{Main|New Albion}}\n[[File:Drake CA 1590.jpg|thumb|250px|Drake's landing in California, engraving published 1590 by [[Theodor de Bry]]]]\n\nAfter looting the Cacafuego, Drake turned north, hoping to meet another Spanish treasure ship coming south on its return from [[Manila galleon|Manila to Acapulco]]. Although he failed to find a treasure ship, Drake reputedly sailed as far north as the 38th parallel, landing on the coast of California on 17 June 1579. He found a good port, landed, repaired and restocked his vessels, then stayed for a time, keeping friendly relations with the [[Coast Miwok]] natives. He claimed the land in the name of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] for the English Crown, called ''[[Nova Albion]]''\u2014[[Latin]] for \"New Britain\". Assertions that he left some of his men behind as an embryo \"colony\" are founded on the reduced number who were with him in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]].<ref>Dismissed by John Cummins, ''Francis Drake: The Lives of a Hero'' (1997) p. 118: \"In view of the prominence given in different versions to the crowning of Drake it would be odd if the establishment of a colony had gone unrecorded.\"</ref>\n\nThe precise location of the port was carefully guarded to keep it secret from the Spaniards, and several of Drake's maps may have been altered to this end.  All first-hand records from the voyage, including logs, paintings and charts, were lost when [[Whitehall Palace]] burned in 1698. A bronze plaque inscribed with Drake's claim to the new lands \u2013 [[Drake's Plate of Brass]] \u2013 fitting the description in his account, was discovered in [[Marin County]], California but was later declared a hoax.

While there, ''Golden Hind'' became caught on a reef and was almost lost. After the sailors waited three days for convenient tides and had dumped cargo, they freed the barque. Befriending a sultan king of the Moluccas, Drake and his men became involved in some intrigues with the Portuguese there. He made multiple stops on his way toward the tip of Africa, eventually rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and reached [[Sierra Leone]] by 22 July 1580.\n\n===Return to Plymouth (1580)===\n\nOn 26 September, ''Golden Hind'' sailed into Plymouth with Drake and 59&nbsp;remaining crew aboard, along with a rich cargo of spices and captured Spanish treasures. The Queen's half-share of the cargo surpassed the rest of the crown's income for that entire year. Drake was hailed as the first Englishman to circumnavigate the Earth (and the second such voyage arriving with at least one ship intact, after [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano|Elcano]]'s in 1520).<ref name=\"The Drake Jewel\">{{cite web|url=http://oieahc.wm.edu/uncommon/118/drake.cfm |title=The Drake Jewel |publisher=Oieahc.wm.edu |accessdate=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Queen declared that all written accounts of Drake's voyages were to become the Queen's secrets of the Realm,<!--first publication date is needed here--> and Drake and the other participants of his voyages on the pain of death sworn to their secrecy; she intended to keep Drake's activities away from the eyes of rival Spain. Drake presented the Queen with a jewel token commemorating the circumnavigation. Taken as a prize off the Pacific coast of Mexico, it was made of enamelled gold and bore an African diamond and a ship with an ebony hull.<ref name=\"The Drake Jewel\"/>\n\nFor her part, the Queen gave Drake a jewel with her portrait, an unusual gift to bestow upon a commoner, and one that Drake sported proudly in his 1591 portrait by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger|Marcus Gheeraerts]] now at the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich. On one side is a state portrait of Elizabeth by the miniaturist [[Nicholas Hilliard]], on the other a [[sardonyx]] cameo of double portrait busts, a regal woman and an African male.

An expedition left Plymouth in September 1585 with Drake in command of twenty-one ships with 1,800 soldiers under [[Christopher Carleill]]. He first attacked [[Vigo]] in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies.

Bronze plaque by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883, base of Drake statue, Tavistock]]\n[[File:Loutherbourg-Spanish Armada.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Spanish Armada]].]]\n\nDrake was [[vice admiral]] in command of the English fleet (under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]],) when it overcame the [[Spanish Armada]] that was attempting to invade England in 1588. As the English fleet pursued the Armada up the English Channel in closing darkness, Drake broke off and captured the Spanish galleon ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario (1587)|Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario]]'', along with Admiral Pedro de Vald\u00e9s and all his crew. The Spanish ship was known to be carrying substantial funds to pay the Spanish Army in the Low Countries. Drake's ship had been leading the English pursuit of the Armada by means of a lantern. By extinguishing this for the capture, Drake put the fleet into disarray overnight.\n\nOn the night of 29 July, along with Howard, Drake organised [[Fire ship|fire-ships]], causing the majority of the Spanish captains to break formation and sail out of [[Calais]] into the open sea. The next day, Drake was present at the [[Naval battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]]. He wrote as follows to Admiral Henry Seymour after coming upon part of the Spanish Armada, whilst aboard ''[[English ship Revenge (1577)|Revenge]]'' on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]):<ref>Letter to Admiral Henry Seymour written aboard ''Revenge'' on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]) Turner, Sharon.

On being warned of the approach of the Spanish fleet, Drake is said to have remarked that there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the Spaniards. There is no known eyewitness account of this incident and the earliest retelling of it was printed 37 years later.<ref name=Kelsey/> Adverse winds and currents caused some delay in the launching of the English fleet as the Spanish drew nearer,<ref name=Kelsey /> perhaps prompting a popular myth of Drake's cavalier attitude to the Spanish threat.  It might also have been later ascribed to the [[Stiff upper lip|stoic]] attribute of [[Britishness|British culture]].\n\n===Drake\u2013Norris Expedition===\n{{Main|English Armada}}\n\nIn 1589, the year after defeating the Armada the English sent their own to attack Spain, Drake and [[John Norreys|Sir John Norreys]] were given three tasks: seek out and destroy the remaining ships, support the rebels in [[Lisbon]], Portugal against King Philip II (then king of Spain and Portugal), and take the [[Azores]] if possible. In [[the Siege of Coru\u00f1a]] Drake and Norreys destroyed a few ships in the harbour of [[A Coru\u00f1a]] in Spain but lost more than 12,000 lives and 20 ships.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} This defeat in all fronts delayed Drake, and he was forced to forgo hunting the rest of the surviving ships and head on to Lisbon.<ref name=Kraus />\n\n==Defeats and death==\n[[File:BurialOfDrakeTavistockMonument.jpg|thumb|Drake's burial at sea off [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]]. Bronze plaque by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883, base of Drake statue, Tavistock.]]\n\nDrake's seafaring career continued into his mid-fifties. In 1595, he [[Battle of Las Palmas|failed to conquer]] the port of [[Las Palmas]], and following a disastrous campaign against Spanish America, where he suffered a number of defeats, he unsuccessfully attacked San Juan de Puerto Rico, eventually losing the [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|Battle of San Juan]].\n\nThe Spanish gunners from [[El Morro Castle]] shot a cannonball through the cabin of Drake's flagship, but he survived. He attempted to [[Drake's Assault on Panama|attack over land]] in an effort to capture the rich port of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo|Panam\u00e1]] but was defeated again. A few weeks later, in January 1596, he died (aged about 56) of [[dysentery]], a common disease in the tropics at the time, while anchored off the coast of [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobelo]] where some Spanish treasure ships had sought shelter. Following his death, the English fleet withdrew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepirateking.com/bios/drake_francis.htm|title=Sir Francis Drake | website=thepirateking.com |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBefore dying, he asked to be dressed in his full armour. He was buried at sea in a sealed lead-lined coffin, near Portobelo, a few miles off the coastline. It is supposed that his final resting place is near the wrecks of two British ships, the ''Elizabeth'' and the ''Delight'', scuttled in Portobelo Bay. Divers continue to search for the coffin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Francis Drake's body 'close to being found off Panama'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15447632|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/panama/8847105/Sir-Francis-Drakes-final-fleet-discovered-off-the-coast-of-Panama.html|website=The Daily Telegraph|title=Sir Francis Drake's final fleet 'discovered off the coast of Panama' |last1 = Henderson | first1 =Barney  |last2 = Swaine| first2=Jon  | date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref> Drake's body has never been recovered.\n\n==Cultural impact==\n[[File:Francis Drake, por un artista an\u00f3nimo.jpg|thumb|upright|This portrait, circa 1581, may have been copied from [[Nicholas Hilliard|Hilliard's]] [[:Image:Sfdrake42.jpg|miniature]]\u2014note the similar shirt\u2014and the somewhat oddly-proportioned body, added by an artist who did not have access to Drake.

One version says that when Drake sacked the port he found the plunder to be not worth enought to take it on board his galleon, hiding it in the cave.<ref name=Sonia2015/> Another version says a treasure was left in the cave because the plunder had been more than he could take on board.<ref name=Sonia2015>{{Cite book|title=Mitos de Chile: Enciclopedia de seres, apariciones y encantos|last=Montecino Aguirre|first=Sonia|publisher=[[Catalonia (publisher)|Catalonia]]|year=2015|isbn=978-956-324-375-8|pages=196-197|language=Spanish}}</ref> Together with the treasure Drake would have left a man chained or a sentry to wait for them to return, which they did not.<ref name=Sonia2015/> The treasure is said to still be there, but those who approach it drown.<ref name=Sonia2015/>  \n\nIn the UK there are various places named after him, especially in [[Plymouth]], Devon. Places there carrying his name include the naval base [[HMS Drake]], [[Drake's Island]], and a [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre|shopping centre]] and [[roundabout]] named [[Drake (ward)|Drake Circus]]. [[Plymouth Hoe]] is also home to a statue of Drake.\n\nIn the United States [[Drakes Bay]] and [[Sir Francis Drake Boulevard]] of [[Marin County, California]] are both named after him, as well as the high school in [[San Anselmo, California]]. The boulevard runs between Drakes Bay at [[Point Reyes]] to [[New Albion#Point San Quentin, San Francisco Bay, California|Point San Quentin]] on [[San Francisco Bay]]. A large hotel in [[Union Square, San Francisco]] also bears his name.  Additionally, the [[Sir Francis Drake Channel]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]] bears his name.\n\nIn [[British Columbia]], Canada, where some theorise he may also have landed to the north of the usual site considered to be [[Nova Albion]], various mountains were named in the 1930s for him, or in connection with Elizabeth I or other figures of that era, including [[Mount Sir Francis Drake]], [[Mount Queen Bess]], and the [[Golden Hinde]], the highest mountain on [[Vancouver Island]].\n\nDrake's will was the focus of a vast [[confidence scheme]] which [[Oscar Hartzell]] perpetrated in the 1920s and 1930s.  He convinced thousands of people, mostly in the American Midwest, that Drake's fortune was being held by the British government, and had compounded to a huge amount. If their last name was Drake they might be eligible for a share if they paid Hartzell to be their agent. The swindle continued until a copy of Drake's will was brought to Hartzell's mail fraud trial and he was convicted and imprisoned.<ref name=Rayner-Richard>Rayner, Richard (22 April 2002). \"The Admiral and the Con Man\". ''The New Yorker''. p. 150.</ref>\n\n[[Drake's Drum]] has become an icon of [[English folklore]] with its variation of the classic [[King asleep in mountain]] story motif.\n\nDrake was a major focus in the video game ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' where the main character, a supposed descendant of Drake, searches for the treasure of El Dorado.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Drake in California]]\n* [[Drake's Leat]], a water supply for Plymouth, promoted by Drake\n* [[Francis William Drake]], relative of Sir Francis Drake\n* [[Giovanni Battista Boazio]], Drake's mapmaker\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|first=John|last=Barrow|title=The life, voyages, and exploits of Admiral Sir Francis Drake : with numerous original letters from him and the Lord High Admiral to the Queen and great officers of state|date=1843|place=London|publisher=John Murray|url=https://archive.org/details/lifevoyagesexplo00barruoft/page/n3}}\n* [[Sam Bawlf|Bawlf, Samuel]] (2003).

The QLDS was the first quality of life instrument to be developed in 2 languages simultaneously. <ref name=\"tuynman\"/>  The development of the QLDS coincided with a rising interest on the impact of illness and its treatment on the quality of life of the patient. McKenna and Hunt constructed the QLDS on the basis of providing a measure for this, as well as attempting to overcome contemporary studies concerning low correlations between patient [[self-assessment]] and nurse or therapist evaluations. <ref name=\"hunt\" />  \n\nThe items in the UK English QLDS were derived from statements made in [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] interviews by 30 depressed or recently recovered patients based in the [[North West of England]] and [[Scotland]]. Interviews took a [[conversational]] approach and lasted between 30 minutes to 2 hours. Interviewees were between the age range of 19-64 years, with 22 females and 8 males. After a refinement process, based on categories of needs proposed by McKenna and Hunt, 426 relevant statements were derived from the interview transcripts. Upon further scrutinization they produced 41 statements for an initial questionnaire. <ref name=\"hunt\" />\n\nA further 35 patients were asked to complete the draft questionnaire and review their experience with it. They were composed of 22 females and 13 males in the age range of 24-72 years. Interviewees expressed a great degree of approval with the questionnaire, although a few mentioned how the binomial system caused difficulty, as it required them to make complete choices. <ref name=\"hunt\" />\n\nFollowing this, the questionnaire was revised to 34 items and field tested to determine construct validity and [[Reliability (research methods)|reliability]].<ref name=\"hunt\" />\n\n=== International development ===\n\nThe first two languages the QLDS was available in were UK English and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. These were shown to have good [[Reliability (research methods)|reliability]], [[validity (statistics)|validity]] and responsiveness. <ref name=\"hunt\" /> In 1999, McKenna in collaboration with a team of international researchers developed and tested the QLDS in 9 new languages. This involved translation, followed by field testing for [[content validity]] and the new measure's [[construct validity]]. \n\nAcross the majority of translations, no major difficulties arose excluding [[Moroccan language|Morocco]]. Cultural differences between Morocco and the UK provided challenge, alongside a lack of [[literal translation|literal]] equivalents between the two languages. An example of this is the absence of an equivalent for the verb 'to enjoy' in Arabic. Researchers also faced further difficulty due to the contemporarily high rate of [[illiteracy]], as the test could not be [[self-administration|self-administrative]] on as large a scale as anticipated. As a result, although the data demonstrated both reliability and construct validity, they were unable to place confidence in the Arabic adaptation's equivalence to the other developed versions. <ref name=\"elsevier\" />\n\n== Reliability, validity and responsiveness ==\n\n=== Testing the Anglo-Dutch project===\n\nFollowing the collaborative Anglo-Dutch project, researchers had to compare the QLDS\u2019 success with established measures of the same concept. No measure of quality of life in depression was available so both versions had to be matched to related measures. In the UK this was the General Well-Being Index (GWBI) whilst in the Netherlands the Sickness Impact Profile (PS-SIP) acted as a comparison.<ref name=\"tuynman\"/>  \n\n==== Reliability and internal consistency ====\n\nFor use in a clinical trial, an instrument like the QLDS should have a test-retest reliability [[coefficient]] of minimum 0.85. Internal consistency also requires a minimum of 0.85 and is assessed using [[Cronbach\u2019s alpha|Cronbach\u2019s alpha-coefficient]]. <ref name=\"tuynman\"/>  \n\nIn the UK, the test-retest correlation coefficient for patients with stable depression was 0.94 (n=37). The test-retest correlation coefficient in the Netherlands was 0.87 (n=33). <ref name=\"tuynman\"/>  \n\nFor internal consistency the UK recorded a value of 0.95 and the Netherlands a value of 0.92. These results suggested the QLDS produced a low degree of measurement error and high internal consistency. <ref name=\"tuynman\"/>  \n\n==== Content and construct validity ====\n\nNo missing items applicable to participants were recognised. The relevancy and ease of completion indicated by field-test interviews suggested the high content validity of the QLDS.\n\nThe QLDS and GWBI had a correlation score of 0.79 in the UK (n=65). The Dutch adaptation had a correlation of 0.71 with the PS-SIP (n=77). These measurements were anticipated to be slightly lower due to the difference of purpose between measures. <ref name=\"tuynman\"/>  \n\n==== Responsiveness ====\n\nThe QLDS\u2019 responsiveness was analysed in a [[general practice]] population of 540 patients with major depression. Over a 6-month period, substantial progress in the level of depression was seen. <ref name=\"tuynman\"/>  \n\n8 weeks into treatment the mean QLDS score rose by 68%, with patients who continued treatment for the full 6-months recording an increase of 78%. The QLDS was concluded by the researchers to be responsive to change in quality of life throughout successful pharmacological depression treatment. <ref name=\"tuynman\"/>  \n\n== International use ==\n\nSince its development, the QLDS has been adapted and validated in 17 languages other than UK English, <ref name=\"pmh21\" />including [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]],<ref name=\"berle\" /> [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Danish language| Danish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. <ref name=\"elsevier\" /> This has allowed the QLDS to be used in research and clinical studies worldwide. \n\nStudies utilizing the QLDS include investigations into [[venlafaxine]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14639509 |year=2003 |last1=Baca Baldomero |first1=Enrique |last2=Cervera Enguix |first2=Salvador |title=Calidad de vida en pacientes con depresi\u00f3n tratados en Atenci\u00f3n Primaria.
