[[Sire Records]] released it as the album's [[lead single]] on March 3, 1989. Written and produced by Madonna and [[Patrick Leonard]], the track heralded an artistic and personal approach to songwriting for Madonna, who believed that she needed to cater more to her [[adult contemporary music|adult audience]]. Thematically the song speaks about a passionate young girl in love with God, who becomes the only male figure in her life.\n\n\"Like a Prayer\" is a [[pop rock]] song and incorporates [[gospel music]]. It features background vocals from a [[choir]] and also a [[Rock music|rock]] guitar. The lyrics contain [[Liturgy|liturgical]] words, but they have dual meanings of sexual innuendo and religion. \"Like a Prayer\" was acclaimed by critics, and was also a commercial success. It was Madonna's seventh number-one single on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the [[record charts|singles charts]] in many other countries, including Australia, Canada, Spain, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed \"Like a Prayer\" among [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Mary Lambert (director)|Mary Lambert]], portrays Madonna witnessing a young white woman being killed by a group of white men. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety, seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as [[stigmata]]. It also features [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s [[cross burning|burning crosses]] and a dream about kissing a black saint. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested against its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer [[Pepsi]], who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.\n\n\"Like a Prayer\" has been featured on five of Madonna's concert tours, most recently on the [[Madame X Tour]] in 2019\u20132020. It has been [[Cover version|covered]] by numerous artists. The song is noted for the mayhem surrounding the music video, and the various interpretations of its content, leading to discussions among music and film scholars. Along with the parent album, the track has been considered a turning point in Madonna's career, with critics starting to acknowledge her as an artist rather than a mere pop star.\n\n==Background==\n[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] had not recorded any music throughout most of 1988. Following the critical and commercial failure of back-to-back big-budget films, ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'' (1986) and ''[[Who's That Girl (1987 film)|Who's That Girl]]'' (1987), she acted in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway production]] ''[[Speed-the-Plow]]''.<ref name=\"nmee\"/> However, the unfavorable reviews once again caused her discomfort. Her marriage to actor [[Sean Penn]] ended, leading to the couple filing for divorce in January 1989. Madonna had also turned 30, the age at which her mother had died, and thus the singer experienced more emotional turmoil.<ref name=\"nmee\"/><ref name=\"rikk1\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=30}}</ref> She commented in the March 1989 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that her Catholic upbringing struck a feeling of guilt in her all the time:\n<blockquote>\nOnce you're a Catholic, you're always a Catholic\u2014in terms of your feelings of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner and you are a sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.<ref name=Johnston1989>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rolling-stone-interview-madonna-19890323|title=Madonna: The Rolling Stone Interview|last=Zehme|first=Billy|date=March 23, 1989|accessdate=May 13, 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427132237/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rolling-stone-interview-madonna-19890323|archivedate=April 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nMadonna also understood that as she was growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to attempt something different, she wanted the sound of her new album to dictate what could be popular in the music world.<ref name=\"lucy1\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=120}}</ref> The singer had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never shared with the general public. She perused her personal journals and diaries, and began considering options. She recalled, \"What was it I wanted to say? I wanted the album to speak to things on my mind. It was a complex time in my life.\"<ref name=\"tara1\">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=168}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"I think there was a point when we realized that it was the title track, and the lead track, and it was going to be a powerhouse.

Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him.<ref name=\"tara1\"/> Once Madonna had conceptualized the way she would interpose her ideas with the music, she wrote \"Like a Prayer\" in about three hours. Writing and producing it with Leonard, it became the first song developed for the album.<ref name=\"fred\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=727}}</ref> The singer has described \"Like a Prayer\" as the song of a passionate young girl \"so in love with God that it is almost as though He were the male figure in her life.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/lady-gaga-madonna-plagiarism-accusations-ripped-express-retarded-article-1.113468|title=Lady Gaga on Madonna plagiarism: Accusations she ripped off 'Express Yourself' are 'retarded'|last=Perricone|first=Kathleen|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=July 4, 2011|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318053421/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-20/entertainment/29473121_1_lady-gaga-love-and-complete-support-material-girl|archivedate=March 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMadonna's further inspiration for the track came from the Catholic belief of [[Transubstantiation#In Roman Catholic theology|transubstantiation]].<ref name=\"lucy2\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=122}}</ref> She introduced [[liturgy|liturgical]] words in the track, but changed the context so that the lyrics had dual meaning.<ref name=\"lucy3\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=124}}</ref> With superficial [[Pop music|pop]] lyrics about sexuality and religion on the surface,<ref name=\"lucy3\"/> the song had different meaning underneath to provoke reaction from her listeners.

After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a [[choir]] around September 1988.<ref name=\"nmee\"/><ref name=\"fred\"/> Both of them met with musician [[Andra\u00e9 Crouch]] and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to \"find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard.\"<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and explained to them what they needed to do during the recording session. He had listened to the [[Demo (music)|demo]] of \"Like a Prayer\" in his car, and directed the choir accordingly. The choir was recorded separately, and Leonard wanted it to be added during post-production.<ref name=\"fred\"/>\n\nRecording took more time than usual since Madonna and Leonard fought \"tooth and nail\" in the studio. According to author [[Lucy O'Brien]], the singer wanted to prove that her second chance as a record producer (following her previous album ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'') was not a fluke.<ref name=\"lucy4\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=119}}</ref> Leonard started working on the [[Chord (music)|chord]] changes for the verses and the [[Refrain|chorus]].<ref name=\"nmee\"/> He had hired guitarist [[Bruce Gaitsch]] and [[bass guitar]] player [[Guy Pratt]] to work on the track. Pratt had in turn hired some additional [[drummer]]s.<ref name=\"lucy4\"/> On the day of the recording, the drummers canceled, which irritated Madonna, and she started shouting and swearing profusely at Leonard and Pratt.<ref name=\"lucy4\"/> The producer then hired British drum and guitar players such as [[Chester Kamen]], along with Americans [[David Williams (guitarist)|David Williams]] and [[Dann Huff]]. He commented that the choice was deliberate since he was a fan of [[British rock]], and wanted that kind of attitude and quirkiness of the musicians in \"Like a Prayer\", as well as the other songs of the album.<ref name=\"lucy5\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=126}}</ref> Pratt was not fired, but later he realized that Madonna did not forgive him; she would call him at late nights for his opinion, and urgently ask him to come to the recording studio, only to be dismissed.<ref name=\"lucy4\"/>\n\nMadonna had her own opinion of how the different musical instruments should be played to achieve the sound that she envisioned.<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> Pratt recalled that after the [[chorus effect|middle chorus]] was recorded, she notified the musicians of some changes in the production. \"Jonathan, do less of the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|high-hat]] in the [[middle eight]], and more of a [[Fill (music)|fill]] towards the end. Guy, I want duck eggs <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Whole note|semibreves]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> on the end, and Chester, bring in your guitar on the second verse,\" she instructed.<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> The team checked the instructions once more, and did a final recording with vocals and one with the [[String instrument|string]]s. Gaitsch heard Madonna telling Leonard that no further recording was to be done for the song.<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> Leonard then gave the track to Bill Bottrell for the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] process.<ref name=\"fred\"/> But the producer felt that the [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and the [[Latin Percussion]] would sound really mismatched if Crouch's choir was added, so he removed them.<ref name=\"fred\"/> For the introduction, Leonard used some guitar recordings by musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], who had been asked by Madonna to contribute to the track. He recalled in 2014 that no other music by Prince was used on the release, but some effects around the choruses might have been his.<ref name=\"Madonna Producer Patrick Leonard Talks 'Like A Prayer' at 25\">{{cite web|last1=Caulfield|first1=Keith|last2=Leonard|first2=Patrick|title=Madonna Producer Patrick Leonard Talks 'Like A Prayer' at 25|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5944767/madonna-producer-patrick-leonard-talks-like-a-prayer-at-25|website=Billboard|date=March 21, 2014|accessdate=October 7, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007070541/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5944767/madonna-producer-patrick-leonard-talks-like-a-prayer-at-25|archivedate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> [[Junior Vasquez]] remixed the [[12-inch single|12\"]] version of the track, overlaying the choir sound with [[Fast Eddie (producer)|Fast Eddie]]'s single \"Let's Go\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.emusician.com/news/0766/junior-vasquez/141475|title=Junior Vasquez|last=Kleinfield|first=Justin|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=March 30, 2013|work=[[Electronic Musician]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022031200/http://www.emusician.com/news/0766/junior-vasquez/141475|archivedate=October 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\"Like a Prayer\" is a [[pop rock]] song that incorporates elements of [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[funk music]].<ref name=\"nmee\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-greatest-pop-songs-in-history-no-3-madonna-like-a-prayer-781320|title=The Greatest Pop Songs In History&nbsp;\u2013 No. 3: Madonna, 'Like A Prayer'|first=Priya|last=Elan|work=[[NME]]|date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=May 29, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810091905/http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-greatest-pop-songs-in-history-no-3-madonna-like-a-prayer-781320|archivedate=August 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"rikky31\"/> According to the sheet music published in Musicnotes.com, the song follows a time signature of [[time signature|common time]], and was composed in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[D minor]], with a moderate [[tempo]] of 120 [[beats per minute]].

Madonna sings the opening lines accompanied by light [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], as drums start during the first verse. The percussion and the choir sound are added interchangeably between the verses and the bridges, until the second chorus.

This was achieved by the gospel choir, whose voice heightens the song's spiritual nature, while the rock guitar sound keeps it dark and mysterious.<ref name=\"tara2\"/> For O'Brien, the lyrics describe Madonna receiving a [[vocation]] from God.<ref name=\"lucy4\"/> Certain portions of the lyrics also alluded to Sean Penn and their failed marriage. According to Priya Elan from ''[[NME]]'', the line \"Just like a muse to me, You are a mystery\" was an example of this, befitting the description of an unattainable lover. This was also evident in the artwork for the 12\" version, painted by her brother, Christopher Ciccone.

But underlying that is a rigorous mediation on prayer. In shorter words, 'Like a Prayer' really takes you there,\" she concluded.<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> This view was shared by Mary Cross, who wrote in her biography of Madonna that \"the song is a mix of the sacred and the profane.

Both the hands show a small hole in the middle of the palm.]]\nScholars and academics have offered different interpretations of the music video and its story line. Allen Metz, one of the authors of ''The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary'', noted that when Madonna enters the church at the beginning of the clip, the line \"I hear you call my name, And it feels like.... Home\" is played. The women of Italian [[East Harlem]] in New York call their Church as ''la casa di momma'' (Momma's House). In that respect, Metz believed that Madonna alluded herself to be one from Harlem, but also refers herself as divinity returning to the Church.<ref name=\"metz1\"/> This divine aspect is further explored by [[Nicholas Dirks|Nicholas B. Dirks]], author of ''Culture/power/history'', who argued that Madonna falling into a dream is the most important point of the narrative as it signified that \"Madonna is really not putting herself in place of the redeemer, but imagining herself as one.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dirks|Eley|Ortner|1994|p=89}}</ref>\n\nSantiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez wrote in his book, ''Madonna's Drowned Worlds'', that the Black woman who catches Madonna when she is falling through heaven in her dream, is a symbol for the divinity, as she helps Madonna throughout the video to come to the correct decision. Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez explained how the physical similarity between Madonna and woman indicated that it was actually Madonna's inner divinity which was rescuing her.<ref name=\"fouz\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=112}}</ref> When the singer accidentally cuts her hand on the dagger, it was described as receiving [[stigmata]] by scholar [[Robert McQueen Grant]], who believed that the scene marked Madonna as having an important role to play in the narrative.<ref name=\"grant\">{{harvnb|Grant|Neupert|2003|p=32}}</ref> This was evident when the crime scene is shown in detail, and an identification is established between Madonna and the victim. Freya Jarman-Ivens, coauthor with Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez, noted that the woman cries out for help when Madonna sings the line \"When you call my name, It's like a little prayer\". However, Madonna could not do anything thus portraying failure of divinity to save.<ref name=\"fouz\"/> Jarman-Ivens also noted the look between the gang member and Madonna, which she thought was a [[complicity]] of \"White men rape/kill women, white men blame it on Black men; Women are raped/killed for being on the streets at night, Black men are nevertheless thrown in jail.\"<ref name=\"fouz\"/>\n\nOther themes noted by Metz include the burning crosses scene, which he felt evoked the [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|murder scene of three civil workers]], portrayed in the 1988 American crime drama film ''[[Mississippi Burning]]''.<ref name=\"metz2\"/> He also noted that when Madonna dances with the choir in the church altar, a young Black boy joins her. This was a reference to the only person who had protested against the Ku Klux Klan murders in ''Mississippi Burning'', a Black man. For the author, it was symbolic of his protest being transferred in Madonna.<ref name=\"metz2\">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=194}}</ref> Regarding the kissing scene between the saint and Madonna, Carol Benson observed that the \"numerous cut-scenes of burning crosses, shocked face of Madonna, bleeding eye of the icon etc\" made a point that multiple times in history, black men have been punished for kissing or desiring [[White people|white]] women.<ref name=\"metz2\"/> Grant believed this was where the racial equality message of the video came across as most poignant.<ref name=\"grant\"/> On the contrary, when the curtain falls and the scene shifts to a smiling Madonna among the burning crosses, professor [[Maury Dean]] felt that another explanation was inevitable. Madonna portrays a successful heroine and thus the whole video becomes about female empowerment.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=103}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:MDNA 7329247960 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Madonna, flanked by a choir, performs \"Like a Prayer\" on [[The MDNA Tour]] in 2012|alt=Madonna in the middle of a stage singing as a choir is present behind her.]]\nThe first live performance of \"Like a Prayer\" was on the 1990 [[Blond Ambition World Tour]].

The author further argued that the controversial clip was evidence of the emergence of the \"video commodity as a different entity from the song that spawned it\".<ref name=\"campbell1\"/> As author Judith Marcus explained in her book, ''Surviving the Twentieth Century'', Madonna used the church to make her own point on victimization. For Marcus the main impact lay in the fact that the clip ultimately portrayed an empowerment message, questioning and \"attacking\" the Church's male prejudice and continuous female subjugation throughout history.<ref>{{harvnb|Marcus|1999|p=179}}</ref>\n\nThe song was noted by Campbell for the mix of choir and organ, which according to him paved the way for gospel music to be more [[mainstream]] than before.<ref name=\"campbell1\"/> In 1999, the [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance]] held a seminar on the different implications and metaphors present in the song; it was headed by professors [[Martin Katz]], [[George Shirley]] and [[Michael Daugherty]]. The main topic discussed was the fact that there can be different metaphorical meanings of the song, as the word \"like\" can be taken in separate contexts.<ref name=\"metz179\">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=179}}</ref>\n\nTaraborrelli commented that \"in the end, the events surrounding 'Like a Prayer' only served to enhance Madonna's reputation as a shrewd businesswoman, someone who knows how to sell a concept.\"<ref name=\"tara7\"/> Before Madonna's deal with Pepsi, pop stars in general were not given much artistic freedom by sponsors. However, Madonna made it a point to have the commercial be dictated by her.<ref name=\"tara7\"/> While she said that it was never her intention for Pepsi to get entangled in the controversy of the music video, Taraborrelli observed that Madonna stayed true to herself. Although the commercial intended to promote Pepsi the [[soft drink]], she did not bother to hold even a can of the product, leading the author to comment that \"Madonna the pop star was going to do it her way, no matter what Madonna the businesswoman had agreed to do\".<ref name=\"tara7\"/> She maintained all along that the Pepsi commercial and the music video were two different commodities and she was right to stand her ground. Taraborrelli noted that after \"Like a Prayer\", the recruitment of pop stars and athletes to sell soft drinks became commonplace.

[[Sire Records]] released it as the album's [[lead single]] on March 3, 1989. Written and produced by Madonna and [[Patrick Leonard]], the track heralded an artistic and personal approach to songwriting for Madonna, who believed that she needed to cater more to her [[adult contemporary music|adult audience]]. Thematically the song speaks about a passionate young girl in love with God, who becomes the only male figure in her life.\n\n\"Like a Prayer\" is a [[pop rock]] song and incorporates [[gospel music]]. It features background vocals from a [[choir]] and also a [[Rock music|rock]] guitar. The lyrics contain [[Liturgy|liturgical]] words, but they have dual meanings of sexual innuendo and religion. \"Like a Prayer\" was acclaimed by critics, and was also a commercial success. It was Madonna's seventh number-one single on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the [[record charts|singles charts]] in many other countries, including Australia, Canada, Spain, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed \"Like a Prayer\" among [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Mary Lambert (director)|Mary Lambert]], portrays Madonna witnessing a young white woman being killed by a group of white men. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety, seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as [[stigmata]]. It also features [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s [[cross burning|burning crosses]] and a dream about kissing a black saint. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested against its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer [[Pepsi]], who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.\n\n\"Like a Prayer\" has been featured on five of Madonna's concert tours, most recently on the [[Madame X Tour]] in 2019\u20132020. It has been [[Cover version|covered]] by numerous artists. The song is noted for the mayhem surrounding the music video, and the various interpretations of its content, leading to discussions among music and film scholars. Along with the parent album, the track has been considered a turning point in Madonna's career, with critics starting to acknowledge her as an artist rather than a mere pop star.\n\n==Background==\n[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] had not recorded any music throughout most of 1988. Following the critical and commercial failure of back-to-back big-budget films, ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'' (1986) and ''[[Who's That Girl (1987 film)|Who's That Girl]]'' (1987), she acted in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway production]] ''[[Speed-the-Plow]]''.<ref name=\"nmee\"/> However, the unfavorable reviews once again caused her discomfort. Her marriage to actor [[Sean Penn]] ended, leading to the couple filing for divorce in January 1989. Madonna had also turned 30, the age at which her mother had died, and thus the singer experienced more emotional turmoil.<ref name=\"nmee\"/><ref name=\"rikk1\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=30}}</ref> She commented in the March 1989 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that her Catholic upbringing struck a feeling of guilt in her all the time:\n<blockquote>\nOnce you're a Catholic, you're always a Catholic\u2014in terms of your feelings of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner and you are a sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.<ref name=Johnston1989>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rolling-stone-interview-madonna-19890323|title=Madonna: The Rolling Stone Interview|last=Zehme|first=Billy|date=March 23, 1989|accessdate=May 13, 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427132237/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rolling-stone-interview-madonna-19890323|archivedate=April 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nMadonna also understood that as she was growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to attempt something different, she wanted the sound of her new album to dictate what could be popular in the music world.<ref name=\"lucy1\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=120}}</ref> The singer had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never shared with the general public. She perused her personal journals and diaries, and began considering options. She recalled, \"What was it I wanted to say? I wanted the album to speak to things on my mind. It was a complex time in my life.\"<ref name=\"tara1\">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=168}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"I think there was a point when we realized that it was the title track, and the lead track, and it was going to be a powerhouse.

Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him.<ref name=\"tara1\"/> Once Madonna had conceptualized the way she would interpose her ideas with the music, she wrote \"Like a Prayer\" in about three hours. Writing and producing it with Leonard, it became the first song developed for the album.<ref name=\"fred\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=727}}</ref> The singer has described \"Like a Prayer\" as the song of a passionate young girl \"so in love with God that it is almost as though He were the male figure in her life.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/lady-gaga-madonna-plagiarism-accusations-ripped-express-retarded-article-1.113468|title=Lady Gaga on Madonna plagiarism: Accusations she ripped off 'Express Yourself' are 'retarded'|last=Perricone|first=Kathleen|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=July 4, 2011|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318053421/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-20/entertainment/29473121_1_lady-gaga-love-and-complete-support-material-girl|archivedate=March 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMadonna's further inspiration for the track came from the Catholic belief of [[Transubstantiation#In Roman Catholic theology|transubstantiation]].<ref name=\"lucy2\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=122}}</ref> She introduced [[liturgy|liturgical]] words in the track, but changed the context so that the lyrics had dual meaning.<ref name=\"lucy3\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=124}}</ref> With superficial [[Pop music|pop]] lyrics about sexuality and religion on the surface,<ref name=\"lucy3\"/> the song had different meaning underneath to provoke reaction from her listeners.

After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a [[choir]] around September 1988.<ref name=\"nmee\"/><ref name=\"fred\"/> Both of them met with musician [[Andra\u00e9 Crouch]] and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to \"find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard.\"<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and explained to them what they needed to do during the recording session. He had listened to the [[Demo (music)|demo]] of \"Like a Prayer\" in his car, and directed the choir accordingly. The choir was recorded separately, and Leonard wanted it to be added during post-production.<ref name=\"fred\"/>\n\nRecording took more time than usual since Madonna and Leonard fought \"tooth and nail\" in the studio. According to author [[Lucy O'Brien]], the singer wanted to prove that her second chance as a record producer (following her previous album ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'') was not a fluke.<ref name=\"lucy4\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=119}}</ref> Leonard started working on the [[Chord (music)|chord]] changes for the verses and the [[Refrain|chorus]].<ref name=\"nmee\"/> He had hired guitarist [[Bruce Gaitsch]] and [[bass guitar]] player [[Guy Pratt]] to work on the track. Pratt had in turn hired some additional [[drummer]]s.<ref name=\"lucy4\"/> On the day of the recording, the drummers canceled, which irritated Madonna, and she started shouting and swearing profusely at Leonard and Pratt.<ref name=\"lucy4\"/> The producer then hired British drum and guitar players such as [[Chester Kamen]], along with Americans [[David Williams (guitarist)|David Williams]] and [[Dann Huff]]. He commented that the choice was deliberate since he was a fan of [[British rock]], and wanted that kind of attitude and quirkiness of the musicians in \"Like a Prayer\", as well as the other songs of the album.<ref name=\"lucy5\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=126}}</ref> Pratt was not fired, but later he realized that Madonna did not forgive him; she would call him at late nights for his opinion, and urgently ask him to come to the recording studio, only to be dismissed.<ref name=\"lucy4\"/>\n\nMadonna had her own opinion of how the different musical instruments should be played to achieve the sound that she envisioned.<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> Pratt recalled that after the [[chorus effect|middle chorus]] was recorded, she notified the musicians of some changes in the production. \"Jonathan, do less of the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|high-hat]] in the [[middle eight]], and more of a [[Fill (music)|fill]] towards the end. Guy, I want duck eggs <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Whole note|semibreves]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> on the end, and Chester, bring in your guitar on the second verse,\" she instructed.<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> The team checked the instructions once more, and did a final recording with vocals and one with the [[String instrument|string]]s. Gaitsch heard Madonna telling Leonard that no further recording was to be done for the song.<ref name=\"lucy5\"/> Leonard then gave the track to Bill Bottrell for the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] process.<ref name=\"fred\"/> But the producer felt that the [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and the [[Latin Percussion]] would sound really mismatched if Crouch's choir was added, so he removed them.<ref name=\"fred\"/> For the introduction, Leonard used some guitar recordings by musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], who had been asked by Madonna to contribute to the track. He recalled in 2014 that no other music by Prince was used on the release, but some effects around the choruses might have been his.<ref name=\"Madonna Producer Patrick Leonard Talks 'Like A Prayer' at 25\">{{cite web|last1=Caulfield|first1=Keith|last2=Leonard|first2=Patrick|title=Madonna Producer Patrick Leonard Talks 'Like A Prayer' at 25|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5944767/madonna-producer-patrick-leonard-talks-like-a-prayer-at-25|website=Billboard|date=March 21, 2014|accessdate=October 7, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007070541/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5944767/madonna-producer-patrick-leonard-talks-like-a-prayer-at-25|archivedate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> [[Junior Vasquez]] remixed the [[12-inch single|12\"]] version of the track, overlaying the choir sound with [[Fast Eddie (producer)|Fast Eddie]]'s single \"Let's Go\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.emusician.com/news/0766/junior-vasquez/141475|title=Junior Vasquez|last=Kleinfield|first=Justin|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=March 30, 2013|work=[[Electronic Musician]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022031200/http://www.emusician.com/news/0766/junior-vasquez/141475|archivedate=October 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\"Like a Prayer\" is a [[pop rock]] song that incorporates elements of [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[funk music]].<ref name=\"nmee\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-greatest-pop-songs-in-history-no-3-madonna-like-a-prayer-781320|title=The Greatest Pop Songs In History&nbsp;\u2013 No. 3: Madonna, 'Like A Prayer'|first=Priya|last=Elan|work=[[NME]]|date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=May 29, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810091905/http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-greatest-pop-songs-in-history-no-3-madonna-like-a-prayer-781320|archivedate=August 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"rikky31\"/> According to the sheet music published in Musicnotes.com, the song follows a time signature of [[time signature|common time]], and was composed in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[D minor]], with a moderate [[tempo]] of 120 [[beats per minute]].

Madonna sings the opening lines accompanied by light [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], as drums start during the first verse. The percussion and the choir sound are added interchangeably between the verses and the bridges, until the second chorus. At this point the guitars start [[Lick (music)|flickering]] from left to right, accompanied by a [[bassline]].<ref name=\"rikky31\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=31}}</ref> Rikky Rooksby, author of ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', commented that \"Like a Prayer\" was the most complex track that Madonna had ever attempted at that point.

This was achieved by the gospel choir, whose voice heightens the song's spiritual nature, while the rock guitar sound keeps it dark and mysterious.<ref name=\"tara2\"/> For O'Brien, the lyrics describe Madonna receiving a [[vocation]] from God.<ref name=\"lucy4\"/> Certain portions of the lyrics also alluded to Sean Penn and their failed marriage.

Both the hands show a small hole in the middle of the palm.]]\nScholars and academics have offered different interpretations of the music video and its story line. Allen Metz, one of the authors of ''The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary'', noted that when Madonna enters the church at the beginning of the clip, the line \"I hear you call my name, And it feels like.... Home\" is played. The women of Italian [[East Harlem]] in New York call their Church as ''la casa di momma'' (Momma's House). In that respect, Metz believed that Madonna alluded herself to be one from Harlem, but also refers herself as divinity returning to the Church.<ref name=\"metz1\"/> This divine aspect is further explored by [[Nicholas Dirks|Nicholas B. Dirks]], author of ''Culture/power/history'', who argued that Madonna falling into a dream is the most important point of the narrative as it signified that \"Madonna is really not putting herself in place of the redeemer, but imagining herself as one.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dirks|Eley|Ortner|1994|p=89}}</ref>\n\nSantiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez wrote in his book, ''Madonna's Drowned Worlds'', that the Black woman who catches Madonna when she is falling through heaven in her dream, is a symbol for the divinity, as she helps Madonna throughout the video to come to the correct decision. Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez explained how the physical similarity between Madonna and woman indicated that it was actually Madonna's inner divinity which was rescuing her.<ref name=\"fouz\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=112}}</ref> When the singer accidentally cuts her hand on the dagger, it was described as receiving [[stigmata]] by scholar [[Robert McQueen Grant]], who believed that the scene marked Madonna as having an important role to play in the narrative.<ref name=\"grant\">{{harvnb|Grant|Neupert|2003|p=32}}</ref> This was evident when the crime scene is shown in detail, and an identification is established between Madonna and the victim. Freya Jarman-Ivens, coauthor with Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez, noted that the woman cries out for help when Madonna sings the line \"When you call my name, It's like a little prayer\". However, Madonna could not do anything thus portraying failure of divinity to save.<ref name=\"fouz\"/> Jarman-Ivens also noted the look between the gang member and Madonna, which she thought was a [[complicity]] of \"White men rape/kill women, white men blame it on Black men; Women are raped/killed for being on the streets at night, Black men are nevertheless thrown in jail.\"<ref name=\"fouz\"/>\n\nOther themes noted by Metz include the burning crosses scene, which he felt evoked the [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|murder scene of three civil workers]], portrayed in the 1988 American crime drama film ''[[Mississippi Burning]]''.<ref name=\"metz2\"/> He also noted that when Madonna dances with the choir in the church altar, a young Black boy joins her. This was a reference to the only person who had protested against the Ku Klux Klan murders in ''Mississippi Burning'', a Black man. For the author, it was symbolic of his protest being transferred in Madonna.<ref name=\"metz2\">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=194}}</ref> Regarding the kissing scene between the saint and Madonna, Carol Benson observed that the \"numerous cut-scenes of burning crosses, shocked face of Madonna, bleeding eye of the icon etc\" made a point that multiple times in history, black men have been punished for kissing or desiring [[White people|white]] women.<ref name=\"metz2\"/> Grant believed this was where the racial equality message of the video came across as most poignant.<ref name=\"grant\"/> On the contrary, when the curtain falls and the scene shifts to a smiling Madonna among the burning crosses, professor [[Maury Dean]] felt that another explanation was inevitable. Madonna portrays a successful heroine and thus the whole video becomes about female empowerment.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=103}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:MDNA 7329247960 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Madonna, flanked by a choir, performs \"Like a Prayer\" on [[The MDNA Tour]] in 2012|alt=Madonna in the middle of a stage singing as a choir is present behind her.]]\nThe first live performance of \"Like a Prayer\" was on the 1990 [[Blond Ambition World Tour]].

The main topic discussed was the fact that there can be different metaphorical meanings of the song, as the word \"like\" can be taken in separate contexts.<ref name=\"metz179\">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=179}}</ref>\n\nTaraborrelli commented that \"in the end, the events surrounding 'Like a Prayer' only served to enhance Madonna's reputation as a shrewd businesswoman, someone who knows how to sell a concept.\"<ref name=\"tara7\"/> Before Madonna's deal with Pepsi, pop stars in general were not given much artistic freedom by sponsors. However, Madonna made it a point to have the commercial be dictated by her.<ref name=\"tara7\"/> While she said that it was never her intention for Pepsi to get entangled in the controversy of the music video, Taraborrelli observed that Madonna stayed true to herself. Although the commercial intended to promote Pepsi the [[soft drink]], she did not bother to hold even a can of the product, leading the author to comment that \"Madonna the pop star was going to do it her way, no matter what Madonna the businesswoman had agreed to do\".<ref name=\"tara7\"/> She maintained all along that the Pepsi commercial and the music video were two different commodities and she was right to stand her ground. Taraborrelli noted that after \"Like a Prayer\", the recruitment of pop stars and athletes to sell soft drinks became commonplace. However, none of them generated the level of excitement on par with Pepsi's failed deal with Madonna.<ref name=\"tara7\"/>\n\n==Track listings and formats==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*'''7\" single (US)'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Like a Prayer|others=Madonna|year=1989|type=US 7-inch Single liner notes|publisher=Sire Records|id=PROMO 348}}</ref>\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (7\" version)&nbsp;\u2013 5:19\n#\"Act of Contrition\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:19\n\n*'''3\" CD single (Japan)'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Like a Prayer|others=Madonna|year=1989|type=Japanese 3-inch Single liner notes|publisher=Sire Records|id=10SW-21}}</ref>\n#A. \"Like a Prayer\" (7\" version fade)&nbsp;\u2013 5:07\n#B. \"Act of Contrition\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:19\n\n*'''12\" single (US)'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Like a Prayer|others=Madonna|year=1989|type=US 12-inch Single liner notes|publisher=Sire Records|id=124790}}</ref>\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (12\" dance mix)&nbsp;\u2013 7:50\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (12\" extended remix)&nbsp;\u2013 7:21\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (Churchapella)&nbsp;\u2013 6:14\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (12\" club version)&nbsp;\u2013 6:35\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (7\" remix edit)&nbsp;\u2013 5:41\n#\"Act of Contrition\"&nbsp;\u2013 2:19\n\n{{col-2}}\n*'''12\" single (UK)'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Like a Prayer|others=Madonna|year=1989|type=UK 12-inch Single liner notes|publisher=Sire Records|id=5441}}</ref>\n#A. \"Like a Prayer\" (12\" dance mix)&nbsp;\u2013 7:50\n#B1. \"Like a Prayer\" (Churchapella)&nbsp;\u2013 6:14\n#B2. \"Like a Prayer\" (7\" remix edit)&nbsp;\u2013 5:41\n\n*'''Remixed Prayers CD Mini-album (Japan)'''<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Remixed Prayers|others=[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]|year=1989|type=Japanese CD Single liner notes|publisher=[[Sire Records]]|id=09P3-6147}}</ref>\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (12\" Dance Mix)&nbsp;\u2013 7:50\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (12\" Extended Mix)&nbsp;\u2013 7:21\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (Churchapella)&nbsp;\u2013 6:05\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (12\" Club Version)&nbsp;\u2013 6:35\n#\"Like a Prayer\" (7\" Remix Edit)&nbsp;\u2013 5:41\n#\"Express Yourself\" (Non-Stop Express Mix)&nbsp;\u2013 7:57\n#\"Express Yourself\" (Stop & Go Dubs)&nbsp;\u2013 10:49\n#\"Express Yourself\" (Local Mix)&nbsp;\u2013 6:26\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Credits and personnel==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]&nbsp;\u2013 songwriter, producer, lead vocals, background vocals\n*[[Patrick Leonard]]&nbsp;\u2013 songwriter, producer, arranger\n*[[Andra\u00e9 Crouch|The Andra\u00e9 Crouch Choir]]&nbsp;\u2013 background vocals\n*Bill Meyers&nbsp;\u2013 arranger\n*[[Bruce Gaitsch]]&nbsp;\u2013 acoustic guitar\n*Chester Kamen&nbsp;\u2013 guitar\n*[[Chuck Findley]]&nbsp;\u2013 arranger, [[Brass instrument|brass]]\n*[[Dann Huff]]&nbsp;\u2013 guitar\n*David Williams&nbsp;\u2013 guitar\n*Dick Hyde&nbsp;\u2013 brass\n*[[Donna De Lory]]&nbsp;\u2013 background vocals\n*[[Niki Haris]]&nbsp;\u2013 background vocals\n*Geary Lanier&nbsp;\u2013 [[clavinet]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Guy Pratt]]&nbsp;\u2013 bass, [[Drum machine|drum programming]]\n*[[Jonathan Moffett]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums<ref>[http://www.madonna-decade.co.uk/like-a-prayer2.html \"Like a Prayer\" @madonna-decade.co.uk] Retrieved February 9, 2020.</ref>\n*[[Paulinho da Costa]]&nbsp;\u2013 percussion\n*[[Herb Ritts]]&nbsp;\u2013 cover art photographer\n*Christopher Ciccone&nbsp;\u2013 12\" single cover designer\n*Bob Ludwig&nbsp;\u2013 [[audio mastering|mastering]]\n*[[Bill Bottrell]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]\n*[[Shep Pettibone]]&nbsp;\u2013 additional producer, remix, [[audio engineering]]\n*Michael Hutchinson&nbsp;\u2013 remix engineer\n*Dave Way&nbsp;\u2013 assistant engineer\n*[[Fred McFarlane]]&nbsp;\u2013 programming\n*[[Junior Vasquez]]&nbsp;\u2013 audio engineering\n*Bill Bottrell&nbsp;\u2013 additional producer, remix\n*[[Prince (musician)|Prince]]&nbsp;\u2013 guitar, uncredited\n{{col-end}}\nCredits adapted from the ''Like a Prayer'' album liner notes.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Like a Prayer|others=Madonna|year=1989|type=LP, Vinyl, CD|publisher=Sire Records.

An image depicting a village of Indigenous people in Brazil referred to as \"tapuyos,\" who have been described as a detribalized population.]]\n'''Detribalization''' is the process by which persons who belong to a particular [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or community are detached from that identity or community through the deliberate efforts of [[Colonization#Lexicology|colonizers]] and/or the larger effects of [[colonialism]]. Detribalization was systematically executed by detaching members from identifying with communities extrinsic to the colony so that they could be \"[[modernized]],\" [[Westernized]], and, in most circumstances, [[Christianized]], for the prosperity of the colonial state. Historical accounts illustrate several trends in detribalization, with the most prevalent being the role that Western colonial [[Capitalism|capitalists]] played in exploiting Indigenous people's labor, resources, and knowledge, the role that [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries and the colonial [[Christian mission]] system played in compelling Christian membership in place of Indigenous cultural and religious practices, instances of which were recorded in [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Oceania]], and the systemic conditioning of Indigenous peoples to internalize their own purported inferiority through direct and indirect methods.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 75.</ref><ref>Gonzalez 2012, p. 69.</ref><ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.</ref><ref>Rodriguez 2014, p. 18.</ref><ref name=\":7\">Stanner 2011, p. 158.</ref>\n\nIn the colonial worldview, \"civilization\" was exhibited through the development of permanent settlements, [[infrastructure]], [[Line of communication|lines of communication,]] churches, and the construction of a [[built environment]] structured on altering and extracting resources from the [[natural environment]]. The stated justification to detribalize Indigenous peoples throughout the world was most frequently a \"[[civilizing mission]]\" \u2013 to liberate them from, what colonizers perceived as, their inferior and \"uncivilized\" ways of living. Detribalization in many regions was commonly enacted by detaching Indigenous persons from their traditional territories, cultural practices, and communal identities, while subjugating them to an exploited and marginalized class position within colonial capitalist society, often as an enslaved or indentured labor force for colonial industry.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 68.</ref><ref>Hickel 2015, p. 91-94.</ref>\n\n'''De-Indianization''' has been used in scholarship as a variant of detribalization, particularly on work in the [[United States]] and [[Latin America|Latin American]] contexts, although the term detribalization is also similarly used to refer to this process of colonial transformation on subsets of the historical and contemporary [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous population of the Americas]].<ref>Moraga 2011, p. 220.</ref> De-Indianization has been defined by anthropologist [[Guillermo Bonfil Batalla]] as a process which occurs \"in the realm of ideology\" or [[Identity (social science)|identity]], and is fulfilled when \"the pressures of the dominant society succeed in breaking the ethnic identity of the Indian community,\" even if \"the lifeway may continue much as before.\"<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 46.</ref> '''De-Indigenization''' or '''deindigenization''' have also been used as variants of detribalization in academic scholarship.<ref>Rodriguez 2014, p. 18.</ref> For example, academic Patrisia Gonzalez has argued how ''mestizaje'' operated as the \"master narrative\" constructed by colonizers \"to ''de-Indigenize'' peoples\" throughout Latin America.<ref>Gonzalez 2012, p. 213.</ref> \n\nWhile, according to James F. Eder, initial colonial detribalization most often occurred as a result of \"land expropriation, habitat destruction, epidemic disease, or even genocide,\" contemporary cases may not involve such apparent or \"readily identified external factors.\" In a [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] framework, \"less visible forces associated with political economies of modern nation-states \u2013 market incentives, cultural pressures, new religious ideologies \u2013 permeate the fabric and ethos of tribal societies and motivate their members to think and behave in new ways.\"<ref>Eder 1992, p. 5-6.</ref>\n\n== Usage of term ==\n''Detribalize'' has been defined by [[Merriam-Webster]] as \"to cause to lose tribal identity,\" by [[Dictionary.com]] as \"to cause to lose tribal allegiances and customs, chiefly through contact with another culture,\" and by the [[Cambridge Dictionary]] as \"to make members of a tribe (a social group of people with the same language, customs, and history, and often a recognized leader) stop following their traditional customs or social structure.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/detribalize|title=Detribalize|website=Merriam-Webster|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/detribalization|title=Detribalize|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/detribalize|title=Detribalize|website=Cambridge Dictionary|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref> Detribalization incorporates the word ''tribal'', which has been recognized as an offensive and pejorative term when used in certain contexts.<ref>Mamdani 2018, p. 7.</ref> For this reason, ''detribalization'' is sometimes used in quotations when referring to the process being described to signpost for the reader the term's potentially offensive subtext.\n\nFrom its early uses to modern scholarship, ''detribalization'' has almost exclusively been applied in particular geographic, and therefore racialized, contexts. As the proceeding section on regional detribalized histories demonstrates, while historical discussion and academic research on \"detribalization\" and \"detribalized\" peoples can be found in the African, Asian, Oceanic, North American, and South American contexts, especially when referring to Indigenous histories of each of these regions, to locate instances in which the term has been applied to Europeans or in the European context is exceptionally rare. One of the few instances was by contemporary scholar Ronen Zeidel in a study on [[Gypsies in Iraq|Iraqi Gypsies]] in 2014, who stated \"whereas the Gypsies entered a ''detribalized'' Europe with a social organization that was different, contributing to their estrangement, that was not the case in [[Iraq]]. Iraqi society has never been detribalized.\"<ref>Parrs 2017, p. 65.</ref>\n\n=== Misapplication ===\nIn the twentieth century, criticisms regarding the usage of ''detribalization'' emerged among scholars, particularly in the African context, who recognized its misapplication as a consequence of [[racism]]. South African anthropologist [[Meyer Fortes]] noted how the term was commonly used in the European sociological context as a \"synonym for such words as 'pathological', 'disintegrated', 'demoralized', in a pejorative or deprecatory sense.\" [[Isaac Schapera]] recognized how the term was also being misapplied by Europeans who assumed that urbanization in colonial society implied detribalization: \"it is not correct to assume that all people who go to the [[Union of South Africa|Union]] [of South Africa] from [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] tend to become 'detribalized'.\"<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":14\">Bovenkerk 1975, p. 27.</ref> H. M. Robertson states that \"the urban native is classed as 'detribalized,' but this is not necessarily the case.\"<ref>Robertson 2015, p. 143.</ref> Ellen Hellmann similarly described in her sociological work \"that 'the process of detribalization has been exaggerated' among the urban African population, although 'the average European would unhesitatingly classify these Natives as detribalized'.\" In his sociological study, William Watson concludes that while \"under urban conditions, Africans rapidly assimilate European dress, material culture, and outward forms of behaviour, this assimilation does not necessarily imply detribalization. On the contrary, many attempts to organize African industrial workers on a common basis of economic interest have encountered great difficulties because of African tribal solidarities and inter-tribal hostilities.\"<ref name=\":10\">Watson 1958, p. 4-6.</ref>\n\nIn ''Africa's International Relations: The Diplomacy of Dependency and Change'' (1978), Kenyan academic [[Ali Mazrui|Ali A Mazrui]] provides a nuanced discussion of the misapplication of ''detribalization'', recognizing how \"there was often an assumption among analysts of the African colonial scene that nationalism made its recruits from the ranks of the detribalized.\" Since the leaders of anti-colonial movements were, in the majority of instances, \"Westernized or semi-Westernized,\" they were classed as \"detribalized\" by European colonial authorities. However, Mazrui notes that this employment of ''detribalization'' failed to differentiate between \"tribalism as a way of life and tribalism as loyalty to an ethnic group,\" noting that colonial analysts had only recognized instances of a \"weakening of cultural affiliation, though not necessarily of ethnic loyalty.\" In other words, \"a person could adopt an entirely Western way of life but still retain great love and loyalty to the ethnic group from which he sprang.\" As a result, Mazrui proposes the term ''detraditionalized'', recognizing that \"the erosion of tradition [does] not necessarily mean the dimunition of ethnicity.\"<ref>Mazrui 1978, p. 239-240.</ref>\n\n== Regional detribalized histories ==\n\n=== In Africa ===\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|318x318px|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\nFrom 1884 to 1885, European powers, along with the United States, convened at the [[Berlin Conference]] in order to settle colonial disputes throughout the [[Africa|African continent]] and protect the economic interests of their colonial empires. The conference was the primary occasion for partitioning, what Europeans commonly referred to as, \"the dark continent.\" Africa was to be partitioned by five primary European powers, Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, and Italy, along with [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] of [[Belgium]].<ref>Harlow 2003, p. 1.</ref> In 1898, Polish-British author [[Joseph Conrad]] remarked in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' on how Europeans used color swatches to denote their territorial claims over Africa, a common practice in the period:<blockquote>There was a vast amount of red [Britain] \u2013 good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work is done there, a deuce of a lot of blue [France], a little green [Portugal], smears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch [Germany], to show where the jolly pioneers drink the jolly [[Lager|lager beer]]. However, I wasn't going into any of these. I was going into the yellow [Belgium]. Dead in the center.<ref>Conrad [1902] 1990, p. 7.</ref></blockquote>An empire had to demonstrate effective occupation of the land they were claiming in order to justify their claims to it. Under these guidelines, scholar Kitty Millet has noted, that ''effective'' \"'connoted farms, gardens, roads, railways, [and] even [a] postal service.\" The only entities which could claim ownership \"over these diverse African spaces... had to be one of the powers at the conference. Local or Indigenous groups were neither imaginable as political powers nor visible as peers or subjects of European sovereigns.\" Not only were Indigenous peoples not physically represented at the Berlin Conference, they were also absent \"to the European powers' conceptualization of territory. They were not 'on the map'.\"<ref>Millet 2018, p. 80-81.</ref> Rather, Indigenous peoples were perceived by Europeans as property of the land living in an inferior [[state of nature]]. Prior to their consciousness of their own \"[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]],\" Millet notes that Europeans were first \"conscious of the superiority of their developmental 'progress' ... 'Savages' had temporary huts; they roamed the countryside. They were incapable of using nature appropriately. The colour of their skins condemned them.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBecause Indigenous nations were deemed to be \"uncivilized,\" European powers declared the territorial sovereignty of Africa as openly available, which initiated the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late nineteenth century. With the continent of Africa conceptualized as effectively \"ownerless\" territory, Europeans positioned themselves as its redeemers and rightful colonial rulers. In the European colonial mindset, Africans were inferior and incapable of being \"civilized\" because they had failed to properly manage or exploit the natural resources available to them. As a result, they were deemed to be obstacles to capitalist investment, extraction, and production of natural resources in the construction of a new colonial empire and built environment. The immense diversity of the [[Indigenous peoples of Africa]] was flattened by this colonial perception, which labeled them instead as an \"unrepresentable [[Nomad|nomadic]] horde of apprehensions that ran across European territories.\"<ref name=\":4\">Millet 2018, p. 82-84.</ref>\n\n[[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial authorities, who policed and controlled the majority of territory in Africa by the early twentieth century, were notably ambivalent towards \"modernizing\" African people. [[Donald Charles Cameron (colonial administrator)|Donald Cameron]], the British governor of [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] as well as, later, of [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]], stated in 1925: \"It is our duty to do everything in our power to develop the native on lines which will not Westernize him and turn him into a bad imitation of a European.\" Instead, Cameron argued that \"the task of 'native administration' was to make him into a 'good African.'\" While the French openly professed that their involvement in Africa was a \"civilizing mission,\" scholar Peter A. Blitstein notes that in practice they rejected African \"assimilation into French culture,\" excluded them \"from French citizenship,\" and emphasized \"how different Africans were from French, and how important it was to keep the two races separate.\" [[Mahmood Mamdani]] has contended that rather than a \"civilizing mission,\" as was often claimed by European powers to be the rationale for colonization, colonial policy instead sought to \"'stabilize racial domination by 'ground[ing] it in a politically enforced system of ethnic pluralism.'\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 285.</ref>\n\nIn the twentieth century, colonial authorities in Africa intentionally and actively worked to prevent the emergence of nationalist and [[Working class|working-class]] movements which could ultimately threaten their authority and colonial rule by preventing \"detribalization,\" which Europeans interpreted as occurring through the urbanization, [[liberal education]], and [[proletarianization]] of African people, regardless if they were actually detached from their ethnic identity or community or not.<ref name=\":10\" /> European powers adopted a policy of [[indirect rule]], which (1) relied on the use of \"traditional\" African leadership to maintain order, which was also understood by Europeans, according to historian [[Leroy Vail]], to be \"markedly less expensive than the employment of expensive European officials,\" and (2) was rooted in the belief that \"Africans were naturally 'tribal' people.\"<ref>Vail 1991, p. 13.</ref> As a result, \"detribalization was the ghost which haunted the system\" of indirect rule by threatening to undermine colonial capitalist [[hegemony]] in Africa. European perspectives of Africans were thoroughly infused with racism, which, according to [[John E. Flint]], \"served to justify European power over the 'native' and to keep western-educated Africans from contaminating the rest.\" Additionally, Alice Conklin has found that, in the post-[[World War I]] period, some officials in [[French West Africa]] may have \"discovered in 'primitive' Africa an idealized premodern and patriarchal world reminiscent of the one they had lost at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]],\" a [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] position which nonetheless may have served as a rationale for fears over detribalization and the \"consequences of modernity.\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 285-286.</ref> \n\nUnder indirect rule, universal [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] were not adopted in British or French colonies in Africa in order to avoid creating a class of \"unemployable and politically dangerous, 'pseudo-Europeanized' natives.\" A curriculum which instead directed Africans towards fulfilling subservient roles Europeans perceived them as \"destined\" to play, commonly as members of the colonial [[Peasant|peasantry]] and exploited laborers, was alternatively adopted. French and British fears over detribalization were also demonstrated via their attitudes toward the notion of African [[Wage labour|wage labor]] and proletarianization. For this reason, African wage labor was only determined necessary when it aided the advancement or progress of the colonial capitalist state, such as via the African colonial [[Mining|mining industry]]. According to Peter A. Blitstein, neither the British or the French were \"able to see wage workers as anything but 'detribalized' and, therefore, dangerous.\" As a result, the ideal model for African colonial society was one in which small-scale producers could be provided with temporary migrant labor as needed, since \"to recognize Africans as workers would ultimately equate them to Europeans, and, perhaps, require the kinds of welfare-state provisions that European workers were beginning to enjoy \u2013 trade union membership, insurance, a family wage.\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 286-287.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a study authored by four colonial functionaries and commissioned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] government's [[Ministry of the Colonies (France)|ministry of the colonies]] in 1944 entitled \"Condition of the detribalized natives\" called for \"the systematic and immediate expulsion of any native illegally entering metropolitan France.\" Historian Eric T. Jennings has commented how this policy was \"certainly not new\" and had been informed by \"a host of [[Reductionism|reductionist]] thinkers from [[Gustave Le Bon]] to [[\u00c9douard Drumont|Edouard Drumont]] or [[Alexis Carrel]]\" while also eerily foreshadowing arguments to be used by the modern [[French far right]]. Jean Paillard, an influential colonial theoriest in Vichy France feared \"native domination\" in which \"the colonizers would eventually come under the domination of the colonized.\" Similarly, the authors of the study maintained that \"the detribalized native becomes an immoral creature as soon as he reaches the city,\" reiterating European colonial viewpoints in the twentieth century by emphasizing that \"detribalization\" must be avoided above all measures. However, when detribalization becomes \"unavoidable\" it must \"be accompanied by a strict regimen\" of control. Since, according to the study, when \"left to their own devices,\" the \"detribalized\" person becomes a drunken failure in European society due to their innate inferiority. Jennings argues that this study attempted to invent a \"retribalization\" effort for the \"detribalized\" person and was hinged upon the larger \"apocalyptic fears of a world dominated by unruly and debauched 'natives,' uprooted from their 'natural environments.'\" This study reflected much of the European theoretical perception of detribalized peoples of the period, as further exemplified in [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]]'s ''Uprooted'' (1941).<ref>Jennings 2004, p. 27-29</ref>\n\nFollowing World War II, colonial policy began to shift from preventing \"detribalization\" to more widely promoting devices for economic and cultural development in African colonial societies and, eventually, in both the British and French case, self-government as a means of obtaining independence. European colonial empires in Africa increasingly opted for [[Nationalizing|nationalization]] rather than previous policies of indirect rule and forced contracted or temporary labor. However, according to historian Peter A. Blitstein, the ultimate objectives of the British and French for Westernizing colonized and \"detribalized\" Africans remained unclear by the mid-twentieth century, as colonizers struggled to articulate how Africans could be brought into congruence with their visions of \"modernity.\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 291-292.</ref> \n\nThroughout post-independence Africa, two different types of African states emerged, according to scholar Mahmood Mamdani, which he terms as \"the conservative and the radical\" African states. While the conservative African state adopted a decentralized form of [[Despotism|despotic]] authority which \"tended to bridge the urban-rural divide through a [[clientelism]] whose effect was to exacerbate ethnic divisions,\" the radical African state adopted a centralized form of despotic authority which contributed to detribalization by tightening control over local authorities. Mamdani theorizes that \"if the two-pronged division that the colonial state enforced on the colonized \u2013 between town and country, and between ethnicities \u2013 was its dual legacy at independence, each of the two versions of the postcolonial state tended to soften one part of the legacy while exacerbating the other.\"<ref>Mamdani 2018, p. 25-26.</ref>\n\n==== Southern Africa ====\n[[File:Nama copper VOC anonymous.jpg|thumb|295x295px|Undated anonymous mural located in South Africa House, London, portraying the [[Nama people|Nama]] presenting green copper-bearing rocks to the Dutch East India Company at the Cape, which initiated an expedition to extract the ore by the Dutch in 1685.]]\nIn the seventeenth century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] was importing shiploads of slaves to South Africa, transferring the former colonial station for passing ships into a slaveholding colony. In 1685, the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]]'s last company commander and first governor [[Simon van der Stel]] formed an exploration party to locate a copper reserve that the Indigenous [[Nama people]] had shown him. The Nama were reportedly described by the colonists as \"'very friendly'\" and, scholar Kitty Millet notes that, \"relations were so amenable between the Nama and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers that the Nama treated the colony to a musical 'exhibition' for the governor's birthday.\" However, shortly after Dutch settlers introduced slave labor to the region and arrived in increasingly greater numbers, conflicts from 1659 to 1660 and 1673 to 1677, followed by a smallpox outbreak caused the majority of the Nama people to flee from their traditional territory. Those who remained soon \"existed as 'detribalized indigenous peoples'.\"<ref>Millet 2018, p. 64.</ref>\n\nEarly maps created by European colonizers portrayed an image of southern Africa as a ''[[terra nullius]]'' of \"uncivilized\" Indigenous villages and \"wild beasts.\" As early as the 1760s, it was Europeans sought to organize Nama settlements in the region into \"'natural' preserves\" which would segregate colonists from Indigenous peoples. When the British first took over the colony in 1798, [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|John Barrow]], a British statesman, perceived himself as \"a reformer in comparison with the [[Boer]] [Dutch] 'burghers' and government officials whose embrace of slavery, and land grabs, had destroyed not only Nama tribes living near them, but also the land itself on which they staked their farms.\" The Nama tribes on the [[Namaqualand|Namaaqua plain]] had been absorbed into the South African colony as \"individual units of labour\" and reportedly lived \"in a state of 'detribalization.'\" As the Nama were increasingly exploited and brought into subservience to Europeans, many completely abandoned the territory of the expanding Cape Colony, choosing instead to settle along the [[Orange River]]. Many were also absorbed into [[Oorlam people|Orlam]] communities, where \"they existed as herders and 'outlaws,' conducting raids on Boer farms.\"<ref>Millet 2018, p. 65-67.</ref>\n\nFrom 1800 to 1925, over 1,030 [[Mission (station)|mission stations]] were established throughout southern Africa by approximately 60 missionary societies from Europe. A study on the location and role of these mission stations by Franco Frescura noted how throughout the nineteenth century there was a \"spreading geographical presence of missionaries over southern Africa\" which paralleled the restructuring of the social, economic, and political landscape of the region by colonial forces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/missionary-settlement-southern-africa-1800-1925|title=Missionary settlement in Southern Africa 1800-1925|last=Frescura|first=Franco|date=November 2003|website=South African History Online|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref> Despite their stated purpose, missionaries were reportedly unsuccessful in converting many Indingenous people. One study reported that only about \"12% of people on mission settlements were there for ''spiritual'' reasons\" and that the majority of people often remained either for a \"material advantage or psychological security.\" Throughout southern Africa, while \"some groups such as the [[BaSotho|Basotho]] and the [[Tswana people|Tswana]] openly welcomed missionaries, others like the [[Pedi people|Pedi]], the [[Zulu people|Zulu]], and the [[Pondo people|Pondo]] vehemently rejected their presence as a matter of national policy.\" In some cases, entire populations relocated away from the mission settlements and ostracized members of their community who had been converted or resided at the settlements, effectively removing them from their communities.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/european-missionaries-southern-africa-role-missionaries|title=European missionaries in southern Africa: the role of the missionaries|date=22 March 2011|website=South African History Online|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1806, [[Germans|German]] missionaries working under the [[London Missionary Society]] were reportedly the \"first white persons\" to arrive in what is now modern-day [[Namibia]]. They soon founded mission stations with surrounding fields and territories in an effort to Christianize and [[Sedentism|sedenteraize]] the Indigenous peoples. However, because of the harsh climate and severe drought, their attempts at maintaining the stations failed, although they converted one Orlam ''kaptein'', [[Jager Afrikaner]], the father of [[Jonker Afrikaner]], who would become an important Namibian politician. Missionaries struggled to indoctrinate the Indigenous peoples in the region with their ideologies due to outright opposition from the [[Herero people|Herero]], who were the most powerful Indigenous group and were unconvinced of the professed \"holy mission\" of the missionaries. The Herero, like other Indigenous people in the region, were perceived as \"uncivilized\" by European settlers because they did not practice sedentary farming nor openly accept [[Western world|Western]] ideologies. A German missionary illuminated this wider perspective regarding his encounters with the Nama people: \"The Nama does not want to work but to live a life of ease. But the Gospel says he must work in the sweat of his brows. He is therefore opposed to the Gospel.\"<ref>Millet 2018, p. 67-68.</ref> This was a common perception among missionaries in southern Africa, who \"sought to impose an alien morality and work ethos upon the local people without realizing that these undermined their most basic social and cultural tenets and were therefore largely resisted.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/european-missionaries-southern-africa-role-missionaries|title=European missionaries in southern Africa: the role of the missionaries|date=22 March 2011|website=South African History Online|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe status of detribalization was perceived by Dutch colonizers as a potential method of redemption, as noted by scholar Kitty Millet, so that \"the 'detribalized' African\" could learn \"his proper place\" as a member of an exploited class of laborers fueling colonial industry.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 68.</ref> Orlam people were understood as \"detribalized Namas\" who had now lived for several generations on the outskirts of colonial society as both indentured bonded servants and as enslaved people subjugated to a position of servitude to the Dutch, and later the British.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 74-75.</ref> In the nineteenth century, as Millet reports, there was a \"concerted effort\" by the Dutch [[Cape Colony]] government to \"detach individuals from the tribal group\" of the Orlam, \"to 'detribalize' them through labor, either through indenture or enslavement.\" In order to maintain the colonial capitalist order, the Dutch \"not only wanted to destroy the physical polities of indigenous tribes among or in proximity to them, substituting them with a docile class of labourers, but also wanted them to forget, completely, their prior existence as 'independent' peoples. The colony's 'health' depended on the removal of independent tribes and, in their stead, the visibility of the 'detribalized' servant.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> \n\nIn order to psychologically condition Orlam people to accept a subordinate role, the Dutch deliberately infantilized enslaved peoples to reinforce their status as inferior. In this regard, even if a slave escaped captivity and joined \"free\" Orlam communities as a fugitive, \"the slave brought with him the memory of this infantilization.\" This dehumanizing treatment collectively triggered widespread resistance to Dutch colonialism in Orlam communities, who formed an aware and active community in [[Cape Town]] by maintaining relationships with enslaved peoples who remained under Dutch control. The British, who reacquired control over the Cape Colony in 1806, similarly sought to continue this system of exploitation for the benefit of the British Empire. This pushed Orlam communities further to the margins, especially as Dutch Boer farmers themselves \"annexed more land, and moved closer to the 'fringes'\" as a response to the transference of colonial political power. This ongoing resistance within Orlam communities led to the formation of politically centralized leaders in the early nineteenth century, known as ''kapteins'', who functioned as authorities in the community unlike in any traditional Nama society.<ref name=\":02\">Millet 2018, p. 75-76.</ref> \n\nAs the Dutch and British targeted Orlam ''kapteins'', scholar Kitty Millet notes, \"even more 'detribalized' individuals [joined] the 'fugitives' already established at the margins\" of colonial society. However, either oblivious to or refusing to acknowledge their own role in generating this deeply entrenched resistance, the British credited Orlam resistance with what they perceived to be an \"ontological predisposition\" within the detribalized Orlam people, which allegedly reflected a \"primitive 'state of being'.\" They presumed that the Orlam's reestablishment as communities at the fringes of colonial society was an expression of their inherent nomadic disposition. As resistance continued to the colonial order, more and more groups with \"diverse origins\" also joined Orlam collectives, despite being notably \"unrelated to their ''kapteins''.\" Despite the heterogeneity of the Orlam collectives, they were able to fight their own subjugation and reestablish themselves as an Indigenous [[polity]].<ref name=\":0\">Millet 2018, p. 76-77.</ref>\n\nOver time, the burgeoning numbers of resistance groups could not be sustained by the surrounding region of the Cape Colony because of low rainfall and drought. As resources depleted, detribalized Orlam resistance groups moved northward and eventually crossed the Orange River to reunite with the Nama. Each of the Orlam resistance groups requested permission from the Nama [[confederation]] and reentered Nama land between 1815 and 1851. As they reintegrated into the Nama community, the Orlam groups quickly transformed how the Nama perceived themselves and their relationships with the neighboring Herero as well as colonial traders and missionaries who had accompanied the Orlam resistance groups in their reintegration. As a result of this reintegration, Kitty Millet notes that a new Nama leadership emerged under [[Kido Witbooi]]'s grandson, [[Hendrik Witbooi (Namaqua chief)|Hendrik Witbooi]]. Hendrik was a Christian who understood his leadership as a [[divine mandate]]. While traditional Nama tribes had preferred [[pacifism]] to armed conflict prior to the integration of the detribalized Orlam groups, Witbooi altered this understanding and believed it was his mission to continue the resistance effort among the Nama. Witbooi would later be killed in battle with German colonial military forces in 1905 and is now understood to be a national hero in Namibia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[German South West Africa]] was established in 1884 following decades of German settlers and missionaries occupying the region and conducting work through missionary societies such as the [[Rhenish Missionary Society]]. The [[German Empire]] officially claimed dominion and sovereignty over present-day Namibia, which included the traditional territories of the Herero and [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] of the northern region, bands of [[Khoisan]] ([[San people|San]] and [[Khoikhoi]]) in the central and southern regions, and the [[Damara people|Damara]] in the mountainous regions. German colonists unilaterally applied the category of \"bushmen\" to these groups, because they perceived them as primitive \"[[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherers]].\" Related to the Khoikhoi were the Nama, who by the nineteenth century had settled in the southwestern regions of Namibia and northern South Africa as a result of colonial displacement. The British similarly referred to Khoisan and Nama in the Cape Colony as \"[[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]],\" a name originally applied by the Germans in South West Africa. These labels demonstrated the European colonial perspective of Indigenous peoples, which flattened their complexities into a singular class of uniform colonized subjects.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 73-74.</ref>\nIn the nineteenth century, European missionaries sought to eradicate Indigenous ways of living and knowing through the process of Christianization to, as scholar [[Jason Hickel]] argues, mold them into \"the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] European model.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> As colonial German academic and [[theologian]] Gustav Warneck stated in 1888, \"without doubt it is a far more costly thing to kill the [Indigenous population] than to Christianise them.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> Contrary to the stated \"civilizing\" objectives of missionaries, colonial administrators sought to preserve \"traditional\" African structures in order to maintain their indirect rule, consistently pushing Africans to the margins of colonial society. According to Hickel, administrators even regarded \"the idea of a [[civilizing mission]] with suspicion, fearing that 'detribalization' would lead to social [[anomie]], mass unrest, and the rise of a politically conscious class that would eventually undermine minority rule altogether.\" The [[Native Affairs Department]], established by the [[British South Africa Company|British South African Company]] in 1894, sought to prop up African \"tradition\" for this reason:<blockquote>The idea was to prevent [[urbanization]] by keeping Africans confined to [[Bantustan|native reserves]], and to govern them according to a codified form of customary law through existing patriarchs and chiefs. Then, using an intricate network of influx controls, Africans were brought temporarily to the cities for work on fixed-term contracts, at the end of which they were expelled back to the reserves. The system was purposefully designed to prevent full proletarianization and forestall the rise of radical consciousness.<ref name=\":13\">Hickel 2015, p. 91.</ref></blockquote>However, by the early twentieth century, as a result of the \"insatiable appetite [of colonizers] for cheap labor,\" the previous colonial policy of indirect rule began to weaken considerably, which resulted in the emergence of numerous informal settlements on the peripheries of \"white cities\" in southern Africa. In response to the overwhelming \"unauthorized\" urbanization of Africans, European colonial administrators eventually adopted the moralizing approach of their missionary counterparts and sought to \"reform\" African shanties, which were regarded as undisciplined chaotic spaces that blurred the order of colonial society as a \"social-evolutionary misfire.\" Social scientists of the period upheld this perspective and disseminated these ideas widely, as represented in their perceptions of the \"detribalized\" African subjects who they perceived as inhabiting these peripheral informal settlements.<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 92-93.</ref>\n[[File:Zwelihle Township (Hermanus, South Africa) 09.jpg|left|thumb|266x266px|Zwelihle Township, in [[Hermanus]], South Africa. ca. 2008]]\nAustro-Hungarian philosopher [[Karl Polanyi]] referred to \"detribalized\" South Africans in highly racist and pathological terms, stating that the \"[[Kaffir (racial term)|''kaffir'']] of South Africa, a noble savage, whom none felt socially more secure in his native [[kraal]], has been transformed into a human variety of half-domesticated animal dressed in the 'unrelated, the filthy, the unsightly rags that not the most degenerated white man would wear,' a nondescript being, without self-respect or standards, veritable human refuse.\" Anthropologist [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Bronislaw Malinowski]] similarly \"decried 'detribalized' natives as 'sociologically unsound' monstrosities who had lost the regulated order of 'tribal' society \u2013 but given their lack of access to the necessary material resources \u2013 had failed to approximate the structure of 'European' society.\" The \"out-of-category\" status of \"detribalized\" urban South Africans was perceived as a threat to the European colonial order. In South Africa and Namibia, the colonial government soon \"forced [their] relocations into modernist [[Township (South Africa)|townships]] laid out along rectilinear grids\" with the stated intention of conditioning \"detribalized\" Africans to become \"happy, docile subjects\" who would \"internalize the values of European domesticity.\"<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 93-94.</ref>\n\nWhile Europeans and [[white South Africans]] during this period classed all urban Africans as \"detribalized,\" this was largely an extension of existing racism which had flattened all Africans into indistinguishable masses of \"disorderly\" racialized subjects and was not necessarily reflective of reality. In fact, many Indigenous people working on European-owned farms and in urban districts were not formally \"detribalized,\" or detached from their \"tribal\" identities or communities.<ref name=\":10\" /> Professor at [[Stellenbosch University]] J. F. W. Grosskopf recorded that \"many Europeans coming into touch with the native only in the bigger centres seem inclined to over-estimate the number of 'detribalized' natives... Such natives may have adopted a semi-European urban mode of life for several years, while it still remains a difficult matter for the white man to say how far tribal influence and connection has actually ceased.\" In 1914, Grosskopf documented an instance in which several urbanized [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Black South Africans]] who had \"never visited their tribe in [[Thaba 'Nchu|Thaba Nehu]]\" left their \"permanent and well-paid jobs in [[Bloemfontein|Bloomfontein]]\" after a [[Barolong|Baralong]] chief \"bought land for his followers in the southern part of [[Rhodesia]].\" They recorded in a notice to their employers that they were leaving \"'for our chief is calling us'.\"<ref>Robertson 2015, p. 143.</ref> British anthropologist Isaac Schapera similarly noted that urbanization did not necessarily imply detribalization, essentially regonizing the differences between assimilation in Western society and detribalization.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nYet, with increasingly racist perceptions of Black South Africans, scholar Jason Hickel notes that \"white South Africans saw detribalization as a process of decay, as the decomposition of tribal social order into a chaotic tangle of random persons and unmarried women.\" This was exemplified in their perceptions of townships, which were \"regarded as makeshift and transient, in between the traditional African homestead and the modern European house.\"<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 98.</ref> White South Africans adopted, what they considered to be, a \"civilizing mission\" with reluctance, conceding that \"urban Africans\" were \"needed as labor\" and \"could [thus] not be 'retribalized.'\" The first townships at Baumannville, [[Lamontville]], and [[Chesterville, KwaZulu-Natal|Chesterville]] were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s for this purpose. According to Hickel, the planners of these townships sought to \"reconcile two competing ideas: on the one hand a fear that 'detribalization' of Africans would engender immense social upheaval, and, on the other hand, a belief that 'civilizing' Africans into an established set of social norms would facilitate docility.\"<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 99-100.</ref> These conditions and perceptions continued throughout the [[apartheid]] era in South Africa and Namibia.<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 111.</ref> South African political theorist [[Aletta Norval]] notes that as the apartheid system expanded, \"the 'detribalized Native' had to be regarded as a 'visitor' in the cities until such time as the ideal of total apartheid could be reached\" through complete racial segregation.<ref>Norval 1996, p. 119.</ref>\n\nIn ''Sounds of a Cowhide Drum'' (1971), [[Soweto]] poet [[Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali]] authored a poem entitled \"The Detribalised\" in which he described the consequences of detribalization and township life in South Africa. In a review of his work by Doreen Anderson Wood, she acknowledges how \"sociologists and anthropologists have observed how detribalization and forcing mine workers into compound living [has] weakened family life in Africa, but few portray it with Mtshali's punch.\" Wood asserts that because they have been \"denied admittance into full twentieth-century life[,] the detribalized fall into a vacuum of surface sophistication with no values underpinning it.\" Mtshali's poem encapsulates the experience of an unnamed man who was \"born in [[Sophiatown]], or [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]], I am not sure, but certainly not in Soweto.\" This \"detribalized\" man, in Mtshali's perspective, did not care for politics or concern himself with the imprisonment of anti-apartheid figures like [[Robert Sobukwe]] or [[Nelson Mandela]] on [[Robben Island]], and was perhaps reflective, in Wood's words, of men who had been removed from the \"stabilizing influences of tribal life\" as a result of colonialism.<ref>Wood 1977, p. 559-560.</ref><ref>Boehmer 2010, p. 116-117.</ref>\n\n=== In the Americas ===\nRegarding the greater [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] region, scholar Roberto Cintli Rodr\u00edguez describes how the Spanish inflicted two forms of colonization upon Indigenous peoples. While the first conquest refers to the military conquest campaigns under the authority of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and other conquistadors, \"La Otra Conquista [or ''the Other Conquest''] included religiously motivated crusades to destroy all the temples, 'idols,' and books of Indigenous peoples.\" Coupled with centuries of violence, in which millions of Indigenous people were \"devastated by war, mass killings, rape, enslavement, land theft, starvation, famine, and disease,\" the Other Conquest was simultaneously facilitated by the Spanish from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries with the central objecive of destroying \"[[Maize|ma\u00edz]]-based beliefs and cultures of Indigenous peoples, ushering in a radical shift in the ''[[axis mundi]]'' or center of the universe from ma\u00edz to the Christian cross,\" with the threat of death, torture, and eternal damnation for a refusal to conform to the colonial order. Rodr\u00edguez illuminates that although outright usage of force from the church has faded, official church messages in [[Latin America]] still continue to reinforce this practice today.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez 2014, p. 6-7.</ref>\n\nSpanish colonizers established a system of \"''congregaciones'' (the congregation of peoples) and the project of ''[[Reductions|reducciones]]'' (spiritual 'reductions')\" in an effort \"to corrall Indians into missions or pueblos for the purpose of reducing or eliminating or 'killing' the souls of the Indians, creating Christians in their place.\" This method of \"spiritually reducing Indians also served to facilitate land theft,\" and was first implemented in 1546, only to be reaffirmed numerous times throughout the colonial period. In 1681, as part of the [[Laws of the Indies]], issued by the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown]] for the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|American]] and the Philippine possessions of its [[Spanish Empire|empire]], \"continued the reduction of the Indians (their instruction in the Holy Faith) 'so that they could forget the errors of their ancient rites and ceremonies'.\" The reduction policies instituted by the Spanish colonizers \"included the systemic demonization by Spanish friars of virtually all things Indigenous, particularly the people themselves, unless saved or baptized.\"<ref>Rodr\u00edguez 2014, p. 18.</ref>\n\nThe \"official Spanish practice regarding what language, indigenous or Castilian, should be employed in the evangelization effort [throughout New Spain] was often confused.\" The \"colonial aim\" was to [[Hispanicization|Hispanicize]] the Indigenous people and to forcibly separate them from identifying with their cultural practices; \"church and state officials intermittently used various decrees reiterating the official position and requiring that the Indians systematically be taught Spanish,\" such as one issued by the archbishop in [[Mexico City]] in 1717. At the same time, because many missionaries were \"more interested in trying to impart what they considered the basis of their faith to the native peoples as quickly as possible\" through Christianization, this led many to \"acquire the rudiments of the indigenous languages\" for the purposes of indoctrinating Indigenous people to become Christians.<ref>Beebe and Senkewicz 2015, p. 94.</ref>\n\n==== Brazil ====\n[[File:Caboclo by Jean-Baptiste Debret 1834.jpg|thumb|313x313px|\"Caboclo\" by Jean-Baptiste Debret ca. 1834.

Expeditions into the interior were carried out by Portuguese ''[[bandeirantes]]'', who often \"depended on Amerindians as rowers, collectors, and guides.\" Despite this relationship, ''bandeirantes'' frequently turned these exploratory crusades \"into [[Slavery in Brazil|slaving]] expeditions\" through abducting, detaining, and exploiting the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]].<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 147.</ref><ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.</ref> The expeditions also carried \"European diseases and death far into the interior\" of the region. In 1645, [[Jesuit priests]] under the leadership of [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira|Antonio Vieira]] \"began establishing missions along the major [[Amazon River]] tributaries,\" which forcibly relocated large subsets of the Indigenous population into new colonial settlements:<blockquote>Amerindian groups were relocated into large settlements, called ''aldeias'', where their daily activities could be closely supervised, their souls could be saved, and their labor could be put to new tasks, such as raising cattle. In the ''aldeias'', natives were deprived of their tribal identity under the homogenizing influence of the missionaries. Compelled to communicate with whites and other natives in the ''lingua geral'', tribal Amerindians were gradually transformed into 'generic Indians' or ''tapuios''.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.</ref></blockquote>The term ''tapuio'' \"originally meant 'slave',\" though soon after, referred to detribalized and [[Christianization|Christianized]] Indigenous people who had assimilated into \"colonial society,\" defined as such by their place of residence and proximity to colonial society.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 54.</ref><ref>Harris 2010, p. 42-43; 306.</ref> It has been used interchangeably with ''[[caboclo]]'', recognized as a [[derogatory term]] \"equivalent to [[half-breed]]\" or \"of mixed blood,\" as well as ''carij\u00f3'', which also referred to \"detribalized Indians.\"<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 69; 147.</ref> These labels differed from ''gentio'', a similarly derogatory term which referred to unconverted and non-assimilated Indigenous people.<ref>Harris 2010, 42-43; 306.</ref><ref>MacMillan 1995, 10-11.</ref> Slave expeditions by the ''bandeirantes'' continued throughout the eighteenth century with the intention of stealing precious metals, especially gold, from the interior, which further led to \"the acquisition of land grants, official appointments, and other rewards and honors\" for white male settlers. At the same time, \"Indians seized in confrontations with colonists were used as mining, agricultural, and domestic laborers,\" while others, and especially Indigenous women, faced [[rape]] and sexual assault.<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 146-148.</ref>\n\nWhile the expanding network of Jesuit missions \"provided a measure of protection from the slavers who made annual expeditions into the interior,\" they simultaneously altered \"the mental and material bases of Amerindian culture forever.\" While ''tapuios'' were \"nominally free\" (or free in name) at the missions, they were actually \"obliged to provide labor to royal authorities and to colonists, a practice that frequently deteriorated into forced work hardly distinguishable from outright slavery.\" The ''aldeias'' also proliferated the \"spread of European diseases, such as [[whooping cough]], [[influenza]], and [[smallpox]], against which native populations had no immunity,\" which \"killed tens of thousands of Amerindians\" and pressured others to retreat deeper into the interior.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.</ref>\n\nJesuit priests, who by the mid-eighteenth century controlled \"some twelve thousand Amerindians in sixty-three Amazonian missions,\" were expelled from Brazil in 1759. This increased opportunities for the enslavement, murder, and displacement of Indigenous people by \"colonial authorities, landowners, and merchants,\" which had already been ongoing.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40.</ref> While in the mid-seventeenth century \"the Amazonian population was mainly indigenous except in the urban centers... by the middle of the eighteenth century, except for native groups that fled to remote refuge areas, the region's population consisted mostly of detribalized, subjugated ''tapuios''\"<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40.</ref> who were inserted \"into a civilized, [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] world under the auspices of their masters, resulting in the indiscriminate appropriation of native labor.\"<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 149-151.</ref> The detibalized population of Indigenous people \"were survivors or captives of raids\" for over a century and \"now lived in [[Mineiro]] towns and other localities under the tutelage of colonists.\" They were \"detribalized for diverse reasons, of various ethnic and/or geographic origins, brought to live in or born into colonial society and thereby incorporated in the social and cultural life of [[Minas Gerais]] during the eighteenth century.\"<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 150-152.</ref>\n\nNew legislation in the 1750s, sought to affirm \"the freedom of Brazil's Indians,\" which was articulated \"in a series of royal laws.\" This was only extended to Indigenous people who had been Christianized and somewhat assimilated: \"once the state 'conveyed the law of God to the barbarous nations, reducing them to the Catholic faith and to the true knowledge of His Holy Name'.\" However, it \"provided a mechanism by which Indians who migrated to towns and villages could defy colonists' attempts to keep them in bondage.\"<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 150-152.</ref> A key aspect of this was \"proving their Indigenous ancestry,\" which many detribalized people found difficult. At the same time, \"administrators sought to conceal the ethnic origin of these Indians, labeling them with names that corresponded with generic mixed-race categories like ''caboclo'' (detribalized Indian rustic), ''curiboca'' (Afro-native mestizo), and ''cabra de terra'' ('goat'; i.e. mestizo of this land), among many others.\"<blockquote>By thus engendering the \u201cinvisibility\u201d of these peoples, they created a loophole in royal legislation, since the crown did not prohibit the captivity of [[Mesti\u00e7o|mesti\u00e7os]] whose racial mixture derived in part from enslaved mothers of African descent. With this tactic, they legitimized indigenous slavery. Had it not been for the insistence of colonial Indians, resolute in setting the justice system in motion in order to guarantee the recognition of their indigenous origins, these individuals surely would have remained enslaved... That said, attempts to turn Indians back into slaves were not uncommon, and many Indians failed to evade the schemes of the most stubborn colonists.<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 154-155.</ref> </blockquote>While revolts by detribalized Indigenous people were common, following the relocation of the [[Portuguese crown|Portuguese Crown]] to Brazil in 1808, \"mission villages were destroyed, their resources seized, and inhabitants [were] pressed into forced labor.\" As the size of the white population reportedly grew, \"a new wave of military action\" was carried out against \"remaining tribal groups.\"<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40.</ref> Once forcibly congregated into centralized colonial settlements, by the turn of the nineteenth century, detribalized Indigenous people \"became scattered along the rivers, streams, and lakes of the [[Amazon basin]] where they lived primarily in small family groups\" and developed sustenance strategies which \"drew heavily from the indigenous groups from whom they were descended.\" However, while \"preconquest Amerindian populations labored only for subsistence and occasional trade with neighboring tribes, the Jesuits taught the ''tapuios'' to produce commodities,\" which continued to link them into the global market by way of river traders, who \"would deliver the goods to distant world markets.\"<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42.</ref> Many ''tapuios'' or ''caboclos'' inhabited \"the same flood plains from which their ancestors had been displaced by the Portuguese\" while culturally intact and \"remaining Indian groups [had] confined themselves largely to managing inaccessible upland areas.\"<ref>MacMillan 1995, 10-11.</ref>\n\nIn 1822, as [[Independence of Brazil|Brazil declared independence]] from Portuguese colonial rule, Amazonia was integrated into the newly unstable Brazilian state. Political tensions erupted into full-scale rebellions, the largest of which was the ''[[Cabanagem]]'' revolt in [[Par\u00e1]], in which \"rebels turned with a vengeance on their landlords and patrons,\" resulting in an estimated death rate of at least thirty thousand, or one quarter of the province's population.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42.</ref> ''Tapuios'' had been continually exploited as a \"great reserve labor force in Amazonia\" and \"as such played an important role\" in the revolt.<ref>Treece 2000, p. 79-80.</ref> Many t''apuios'' as well as \"black slaves, and other workers fled\" following the revolt \"because they were ''cabanos'' [rebels] or to escape forced labor.\"<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42.</ref> Prior to the revolt, detribalized people had been \"transformed into a dispersed propertyless mass alienated both from the intact, isolated tribal groups of the interior and from the rural white population.\" European ethnographers documented the effects of detribalization on the ''tapuios'', who cited their poor treatment and lack of belonging as socially and psychologically damaging. Occupying an \"ambiguous\" social category between intact tribal groups and the white population, the \"claims and interests\" of the ''tapuios'' could not be effectively addressed by the Brazilian state, meaning they were faced with immediate \"extermination or integration. Between these two alternatives there could exist no gray area questioning the value of assimilation into white society.\"<ref>Treece 2000, p. 79-80.</ref>\n\nThe exploitation of the ''tapuios'' was documented in travel journals of European and American colonizers in the mid-nineteenth century. In ''[[Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon]]'' by [[United States Navy|US Navy]] lieutenants [[William Lewis Herndon]] and Lardner Gibbon, ''tapuios'' are referred to as \"peons\" and were described in 1849, along with \"negroes\" and \"mestizos\" by the President of the province of Par\u00e1, Jeronimo Francisco Coelho, as \"people void of civilization and education, and who exceeded in number the worthy, laborious, and industrious part of the population by more than three-quarters.\" Herndon and Gibbon affirmed that \"a better description of the origin and character of these bodies of laborers cannot be given.\" These [[Racism|racist]] perceptions held by colonizers seemingly rationalized their right to exploit the labor of these groups, which was also entwined with Christianization and the role of the colonial church: \"All the christianized Indians of the province of Par\u00e1 are registered and compelled to serve the State, either as soldiers of the ''Guarda Policial'' or as a member of 'Bodies of Laborers,' distributed among the different territorial divisions of the province.\"<ref>Herndon and Gibbon 1854, p. 256.</ref>\n\nRegarding the Brazilian province of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], Herndon and Gibbon recorded that the Brazilian government continued to fear the power of the ''tapuios'' to revolt against \"the foreigners,\" given their greater numbers as well as \"the terrible revolution of the ''Cabanos'' (serfs, people who lived in cabins) in the years from 1836 to 1840, when many [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were killed and expelled.\" As such, the President and government asserted \"that laws must be made for the control and government of the sixty-thousand ''tapuios'', who so far outnumbered the property-holders, and who are always open to the influence of the designing, the ambitious, and the wicked.\" The population of the province was recorded at \"thirty thousand inhabitants \u2013 whites and civilized Indians,\" yet Herndon and Gibbon admitted that \"no estimate can be made of the number of '''Gentios'',' or savages.\" The American lieutenants expressed their support for further colonizing the region, even advocating for United States [[Slaveholder|slaveholders]] to do so:<blockquote>I presume that the Brazilian government would impose no obstacles to the settlement of this country by any of the citizens of the United States who would choose to go there and carry their slaves; and I know that the thinking people on the Amazon would be glad to see them. The President, who is laboring for the good of the province, and sending for the chiefs of the Indian tribes for the purpose of engaging them in settlement and systematic labor, said to me, at parting 'How much I wish you could bring me a thousand of your active, industrious, and intelligent population, to set and example of labor to these people;' and others told me that they had no doubt that Brazil would give titles to vacant lands to as many as came.<ref>Herndon and Gibbon 1854, p. 268.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Mexico ====\n[[File:Cabrera 15 Coyote.jpg|thumb|292x292px|''\"De Mestizo y de India, Coyote''\" by Miguel Cabrera, ca. 1763.

Indigenous women, and in particular [[Midwife|midwives]], were targeted by the Inquisition; \"Europeans feared that women could control men, which contributed to many women being tried as [[Witch-hunts in Early Modern Europe|witches in Europe]].\" Female healers and midwives were identified by European men and the church as a threat to their power, both in Europe and in the Americas. In order to indoctrinate within Indigenous people the inferiority and \"evil\" nature of their own practices, the Inquisition \"used repression of entire families and communities, torture, death, indentured servitude, and even prison\" as well as \"public displays of power to repress Indigenous worldviews.\" As this continued throughout Spanish colonial rule \"over time, many Indigenous practices became associated with acts of the devil,\" which conditioned Mexican people to reject Indigenous ways of knowing. \"Some Native leaders argue that such a conditioning occurs via sermons and faith activities,\" which continue today, and eventually led \"to the de-Indianization of Mexicans.\"<ref>Gonzalez 2012, p. 76-78.</ref>\n\nIn urban centers, spatial segregation between \"Indians\" and Spaniards, or ''peninsulares'', was instituted by the colonial order, to separate the colonized from the colonizers.''<ref name=\":1\">Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 42-48.</ref>'' Because the colony of [[New Spain]] was \"built upon the exploitation of the work force and the agricultural production of the Indians, particularly in the regions of Mesoamerica,\" it became \"fundamental for the Colonial regime to define clear ethnic boundaries between Indians and non-Indians.\" However, the boundaries between the ethnic categories of the colonized in colonial Mexico were \"relatively flexible in practice\" as the colonial structure was primarily concentrated on maintaining the \"hierarchical superiority of the Spaniards\" above all else.<ref>Linares 2009, p. 54-55.</ref> There were important distinctions between \"rich mestizos,\" who held structural power in Mexico historically<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 94.</ref> and upheld the Westernization plan introduced by European invaders, from poor or working-class rural and urban mestizos.<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. xv-xvi.</ref> <blockquote>In spite of the elaborate attempts to classify the ''castas'' and assign to each one [individual] a clear position in the stratified order of colonial society, those who were neither Spaniards (''[[Peninsulars|penninsulares]]'' or ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'') nor Indians never found precise placement in a society that rested on the rigid dual order of colonized and colonizers. Even though the ''castas'' were formally defined by the percentage of different blood they carried \u2013 American, African, and European \u2013 in reality it was social criteria, not biological, that defined the different groups. Undoubtedly, a large number of racial mestizos who were born and grew up in Indian communities were considered Indians. In the same way, many racially pure Indians passed for Mestizos when they left their communities of origin and became serfs or free laborers. Some mestizos were taken for [[Creoles of color|creoles]], and the passage from one group to the other had less to do with relative \"purity of blood\" than with other social factors, among which wealth was especially important.<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 79.</ref></blockquote>After the successful [[Mexican War of Independence]] in 1821, \"ethnic inequality continued, as the ''[[Criollo people#In Mexico|criollos]]'', i.e. persons of Spanish descent born in the Americas, became the dominant group of the new nation.\" At the time, a minority of the country spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]], yet it was established as \"the [[official language]] of the nation.\" Citizenship in Mexico became \"synonymous with [[Western culture]] and thus excluded Indians, [[Black people|Blacks]], and other non-European groups unless they renounced their supposedly 'backward' and 'inferior' cultures.\" Through the implementation of these homogenizing practices, \"''criollos'' hoped that the majority of Indians and Blacks in Mexico would eventually be dissolved by European immigrants and the nation would be adequately whitened.\" The ''criollo'' elite of the new Mexican nation also instituted a widespread [[Land grabbing|land grab]] of Indigenous territory throughout the country. While during the Spanish colonial period, the government had \"recognized the collective property of Indigenous communities, since it was interested in extracting the surplus produced by Indian peasants,\" following independence, \"individual property became the only legally recognized form of [[land tenure]], according to the supposedly universal principle of [[Individualism|Liberal individualism]], and therefore Indigenous communities thus lost legal title to their holdings.\"<ref>Linares 2009, p. 55-56.</ref>\n\nThe Mexican government \"used armed force to suppress Indian resistance, and in cases where it was successful, Indian lands were distributed and their communities were destroyed.\" In the 1820s, the government instituted a [[General Colonization Law]] which \"paid non-Indians to take up residence in Indian country and work the land... based on the assumption that Indians would recognize and choose to emulate the virtues of 'civilization' once they had been exposed to them.\" This method was implemented throughout the entire country. When armed force and colonization failed, \"the Mexican government used a policy of deportation from tribal homelands to other parts of Mexico.\" While these methods were devastating to maintaining the identities and communities of Indigenous peoples in Mexico, \"it was not governmental policy that led to the detribalization and assimilation of most Mexican Indians.\" While \"some Indian communities were able to maintain their existence, most were broken up as hundreds of Indians were slowly forced off their land and into Mexican towns, mining communities, and ranches as laborers.\"<ref>Griffin-Pierce 2015, p. 25-26.</ref>\n\nIn 1883, the Mexican government passed the Land Law Act, which \"affected thousands of small-scale and detribalized Indian communities,\" as noted by legal scholar Martha Menchaca. A few years after the law's passage, which required \"all public lands be surveyed for the purpose of development,\" the ruling class of Mexico and foreign corporations owned approximately \"one-fifth of Mexico's total land mass, or 68 million acres of land.\" Once the land was \"surveyed,\" \"Mexican farmers had to prove legal ownership\" and the courts often \"upheld the corporations' surveys,\" which caused \"many poor farmers... to migrate north into Texas, a task made easier by the railroad infrastructure.\" The [[Lerdo law|Lerdo Law]] of 1856, which planned to provide \"each family... part of the tribe's communal holdings\" through privatization, had \"stripped the tribal councils of their legal authority over their community's land,\" and since [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] died in the midst of its implementation, judges now \"held the power to interpret property law and decide to support the surveying companies or recognize that the Lerdo Law had been improperly executed.\" As a result, \"Indians who heeded President Ju\u00e1rez's orders and privatized their holdings but failed to disband their tribal councils could argue in court that although they were not given deeds, the Spanish land grant titles [from the colonial period] were still valid since they were not detribalized communities.\" On the other hand, \"Indians who had disbanded their councils had no legal recourse because they were detribalized Indians.\" In the latter case, if detribalized peoples \"managed not to get evicted from their lands, the main option left was to remain in their homes and become [[Tenant farmer|tenant farmers]].\" However, many people \"chose to join the northern migration\" and \"some detribalized Indians began a journey that would eventually transform them into U.S. citizens\" as a result.<ref>Menchaca 2011, p. 91-93.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, well-over 100,000 Mexicans had migrated north into the southwestern United States, both as a result of the Mexican government's land theft through the Land Law Act and the labor shortage in the United States following the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 and the unofficial \"[[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Gentlemen's Agreement]]\" with [[Japan]] in 1907. As a result, many employers in the southwest opened contracting opportunities in border cities such as [[El Paso, Texas]]. Although the official U.S. immigration policy at the time prohibited contractual labor outside the United States, employers hired agents to travel to the interior of Mexico and convince rural and urban Mexican citizens that high wages and new job opportunities were available in the United States. Following the loss of land, low wages, and instability throughout the Mexican countryside, many poor Mexican people, particularly from the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Zacatecas]], and [[Michoac\u00e1n]], migrated north to initially become railroad workers, laying track for low pay. A 1909 report concluded that Mexican laborers did the majority of the railway work in Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, and [[southern California]]. Following the railway work, the majority of Mexican laborers were employed in the agricultural sector, working on cotton fields in Texas, sugar beet farms in northern Colorado, and citrus orchards in California, as well as mines throughout the southwest. By 1920, the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States was over 222,000, the majority of whom had previously been made landless by the Mexican government or worked on rural ranches.<ref>Werner 2001, p. 447.</ref>\n\nThis massive land grab in the nineteenth century soon sparked a series of peasant revolts throughout Mexico \"from the 1840s to the [[Mexican Revolution|Mexican revolution of 1910]].\" Scholar [[Florencia Mallon]] has proposed that, in response, Indigenous communities developed \"their own popular Liberalism, one that recognized communal institutions and property, and that defined citizenship in terms that did not exclude culturally different groups.\" In the latter half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, with the increasing development of the national capitalist economy and [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], \"Indigenous communities were forced to migrate to the cities\" and \"large farms.\" As a result of that process, many became detribalized as they \"adopted Spanish as their main language and abandoned their traditional sense of ethnic identity, shifting their allegiance to the national identity being constructed by the [Mexican] state.\" It was in this process that \"entire [Indigenous] communities also changed their language, and their ethnic self-identification, from Indian to Mestizo.\" This is reflective in statistics of the era. While in 1808, Indians and Mestizos were estimated to comprise 60% and 23% of the population respectively, by 1885 this was 38% and 43%, and by 1921 this was 29% and 59%. From 1808 to 1921, it is estimated that approximately 3 million people experienced this cultural and ethnic transformation from Indian to Mestizo, which was about 1/3rd or 1/4th of the entire population of the country at the time.<ref>Linares 2009, p. 56-57.</ref>\n\nIn the midst of this detribalization and de-Indianization process in Mexico, the nationalist ideology of \"mestizaje\" was formulated \"by intellectuals closely linked to the State\" in the late nineteenth century.<ref>Linares 2009, p. 58.</ref> The Mexican government instituted national policies \"aimed at achieving the racial and cultural homogenization of the population under the Mestizo category.\"<ref>Linares 2009, p. 53.</ref> Mexican nationalist ideologies now asserted that the country was a \"mestizo society\" which harmoniously combined the cultures of Indigenous peoples and Europeans. In reality, while the majority of \"popular classes and sectors,\" including traditional rural communities and urban ''barrios'', neighborhoods, and towns throughout Mexico, had \"Indian origins\" which were \"often very recent,\" the \"upper-class sectors\" were \"derived more or less directly from the Spanish colonizers\" and tended \"to conserve non-Indian cultural forms.\"''<ref name=\":1\" />'' Through mestizaje and [[Indigenismo in Mexico|Indigenismo]], mestizos were \"supposed to be proud of their Indian 'past', embodied in the massive constructions and the works of art of their [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] 'ancestors', while embracing the forward-looking and Modern culture of the White races of the world\" \u2013 \"a process of whitening the Indians, but not of darkening the Whites.\"<ref>Linares 2009, p. 58.</ref> Throughout the twentieth century, there remained a concerted effort by the Mexican government to integrate Indigenous people into Mestizo society.

While acknowledging the diversity of \"mestizo\" and \"Indian\" realities, Bonfil Batalla also emphasizes the \"fundamental, determining characteristics\" present throughout Mesoamerican cultures<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 39.</ref> to demonstrate how there is an \"effective presence of that which is Indian... in almost every social and cultural aspect of the country,\" that \"the presence of Indian culture is, in some aspects, so commonplace and omnipresent that one rarely stops to think about its profound significance, or about the long historical process that made possible its persistence in social sectors that assume a non-Indian identity today.\"<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 41.</ref> \n\nMembers of the privileged elite classes in contemporary Mexico, who are largely descendants of European colonizers have been noted to still regard \"anything that is Indian, any trait that recalls the original ancestry of Mexican culture and society\" as backward, grotesque, and inferior, by using derogatory and racist language such as \"''naco''.\"<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 52-53.</ref> There remains \"many Mestizos living in traditional peasant communities whose culture is closer to that of the Indigenous peoples than to that of the modernized urban elites, despite the fact that they no longer speak an Indian language.\" This segment of the population \"could very well 're-Indianze' itself\" and in many communities throughout Mexico \"such processes of re-Indianization are already well under way.\"<ref>Linares 2009, p. 61.</ref> In 2000, the ethnic composition of Mexico was recorded as 18% Amerindian, 10.5% of which openly identified as detribalized.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica Almanac 2010|last=|first=|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=359}}</ref> There is also evidence that increasing numbers of the detribalized Mexican population may be openly identifying as Indigenous, given the rapid increase in [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico#Population statistics|population size]] in recent national census figures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Villarreal|first=Andr\u00e9s|date=August 2014|title=Ethnic Identification and its Consequences for Measuring Inequality in Mexico|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=79|issue=4|pages=775\u2013806|pmc=4437246|pmid=25999600|doi=10.1177/0003122414541960}}</ref>\n\n==== Peru ====\nDe-Indianization has been cited as an essential element to the formation of the colonial [[Peru|Peruvian]] nation-state, \"which was and in many ways continues to premised on the ''overcoming'' of indigeneity, that is to say on the de-Indianization of Peru.\"<ref>Drinot 2011, p. 15.</ref> [[Indigenous peoples in Peru]] could therefore be \"redeemed\" through the process of de-Indianization or assimilation into the colonial order of Western \"progress.\"<ref>Drinot 2011, p. 224.</ref> De-Indianization was implemented through various efforts of the state, such as through \"education,\" yet \"those who did not de-Indianize, because they refused to do so or because resources to implement the process of de-Indianization were lacking, could be, and indeed came to be seen as in need of being, erased from the purview of the nation-state.

As historian Helen C. Rountree documents, \"the English wished to detribalize the [[Powhatan|Powhatans]]\" and implemented various methods to \"civilize\" them and otherwise incorporate detribalized persons into colonial society. Until 1691, detribalized Indigenous people could \"enter the middle- or lower- levels of English society\" through interracial marriage. Following the prohibition of interracial marriage, \"Indians were expected to join the lowest, non-white ranks.\" There is evidence that an Indigenous person who was perceived as detribalized had greater claims to land rights, exemplified via the case of Edward Gunstocker, whose land rights were perceived as valid by American colonial courts because he was detribalized.<ref name=\":15\">Rountree 1996, p. 135-136.</ref>\n\nBy the second half of the seventeenth century, the English in the Virginia colony attempted to \"convert the Powhatans culturally\" through permitting them to engage in a form of waged labor under the watchful eyes of English employers with the intention of \"civilizing them and making them Christians.\" Indigenous children were also taken from parents to become \"servants\" for the English, who assured parents that they would be treated well and not as slaves. However, as noted by Rountree, \"the English did not draw a clear distinction between 'servants' (i.e., domestic employees) and slaves, either for Indians or for Africans.\" While few Indigenous people accepted these offers willingly in the early part of the seventeenth century, pressures from colonists increased, especially after Indigenous people were progressively impoverished following the stealing of land and effects of the emerging colonial economic system.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nDetribalization was used by the state governments in the northeastern region of [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Rhode Island]] in the nineteenth century to refer to the deliberate process of terminating relationships between Indigenous peoples and their Indian nations in the debate over [[List of federally recognized tribes in the United States|federal recognition]]. At the time, the process of detribalization \"carried the notion of 'liberating' Indians from the perceived shackles of tribalism.\"<ref>Den Ouden and O'Brien 2013, p. 149.</ref>\n\nIn 1889, the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] published a report of a \"special committee\" which \"asked for a solution of the 'Indian problem' from men living in nearly every section of the state.\" In answer to the question \"What can be done for the good of the Indian?\" relating to the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], the consensus was determined as follows: \"exterminate the tribe and preserve the individual; make citizens of them and divide their lands in severalty.\" Chancellor of [[Syracuse University]] [[Charles N. Sims]] replied: \"Obliterate the whole tribe; make them citizens; divide all the lands among them and put them under the laws of citizenship in the State. It is the merest farce in the world to treat them as a nation.\" Dr. Johnathan Kneelant of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], who was for several years a physician to the tribe said: \"I have recommended that they be detribalized and made citizens.\" Much of the responses throughout the report indicate similar attitudes towards various Indigenous nations throughout the state of New York.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=koe-YjW7mQgC |title=Report of Special Committee to Investigate the Indian Problem of the State of New York: Appointed by the Assembly of 1888, Transmitted to the Legislature, February 1, 1889 |last= |first= |publisher=Troy Press Company |year=1889 |isbn= |location= |pages=68\u201370}}</ref> This rhetoric indicates how detribalization was perceived as unquestionably necessary for the progress of the American [[Settler colonialism|settler colony]] by colonizers.\n\n====== Southwestern ======\n[[File:Composition, Taos Pueblo.jpg|thumb|278x278px|[[Taos Pueblo, New Mexico|Taos Pueblo]] in New Mexico.]]\nThe Spanish colonial period began under Jose de Onate in 1598, who inflicted genocide on [[Acoma Pueblo]], killing \"hundreds of Acomas, and burned houses and [[Kiva|kivas]].\" Ongoing resistance by Pueblo religious leaders propelled the Spanish to use missionaries in order to \"convert the Indians to Catholicism\" and thus encourage them to disidentify from their Pueblo community and cultural practices. Historians Deborah Lawrence and Jon Lawrence note that a new \"form of slavery developed whereby Indians who were obtained by Hispanics through war or trade were taken into Spanish households as servants.\" These \"detribalized Indian captives\" were referred to as [[Gen\u00edzaro|''gen\u00edzaros'']]  and eventually \"managed to merge into the larger society over generations.\"<ref>Lawrence and Lawrence 2016, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the population of detribalized people in [[New Mexico]] increased, particularly of the ''gen\u00edzaros'', who were now commonly held in servitude throughout before being released upon Christianization or adulthood. This increase was largely due to the prevailing \"trade of human captives\" which was carried out throughout the region. As noted by historian [[Lisbeth Haas]], the Spanish had \"granted ''gen\u00edzaros'' and lower-status settlers land throughout the eighteenth century in order to create buffer zones between nomadic raiding and the colonial towns, including those of Pueblo Indians, such as [[Santo Domingo Pueblo|Santo Domingo]] and [[Ysleta, El Paso, Texas|Ysleta]].\" Neighboring tribes including the [[Navajo]] and [[Comanche]] participated in the servant and slave trade of detribalized people and others at trade fairs in [[Abiqui\u00fa, New Mexico|Abiquiu]] and Taos Pueblo until the mid-nineteenth century.<ref>Haas 2014, p. 174.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] and the ratification of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|Treaty of Guadalupe]], the U.S. government quickly violated its agreement and failed to acknowledge the citizenship stipulation it had agreed to under the treaty. As noted by scholar [[Martha Menchaca]], the U.S. government instead began a process of [[racialization]] which ascribed to Mexicans different legal rights on the basis of race.\" While \"Mexicans who were [[Mexicans of European descent|white]] were given full citizenship,\" mestizos, Christianized Indians, and ''[[Afro-Mexicans|afromexicanos]]'' (mixed race people of African descent) were accorded inferior legal rights.\" While prior to the Mexican-American War, \"Mexico had extended citizenship to all people living in Mexican territory irrespective of race,\" including the \"right to vote, run for office, enter any profession, transact business with whomever one chose, marry freely with no racial restrictions, and obtain title to land grants,\" following American occupation, a new racial system was imposed upon the conquered territories of the Southwest.<ref name=\":2\">Menchaca 2011, p. 19-20.</ref>\n\nThe federal government provided the various state governments of the ceded territories \"the right to decide which Mexicans would be given citizenship.\" In Texas, citizenship was only extended to Mexicans \"as long as they were not of black descent.\" At the same time, \"detribalized Christian Indians who paid taxes and had adopted the lifestyle of Mexicans were also given citizenship but with limited rights,\" being excluded from the right to vote, and conditional property rights, only \"if they could prove that they spoke Spanish and that their ancestors had been legally emancipated from the Spanish missions.\" However, while the Mexican-controlled [[New Mexico Legislature|New Mexico legislature]] (which had authority over the territory of Arizona at the time) \"extended citizenship to all former citizens of Mexico\" in 1851, the United States congress quickly \"rescinded this decree\" and denied Black and Indigenous people citizenship in 1853. Soon after Arizona was established as a separate entity in 1863, \"its first legislative assembly voted to reserve citizenship for white males.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> When deciding whether to grant Mexicans of ''mestizo'' ancestry rights afforded to white or Indigenous peoples, \"most government officials argued that Mexicans of predominately Indian descent should be extended the same legal status as the detribalized American Indians.\" [[Anglo-Americans|Anglo-American]] legislatures disenfranchised many Mexican people throughout the Southwest by arguing that they were of Indigenous descent and should therefore not be granted the rights and privileges of white American citizens.<ref>Menchaca 1998, p. 388.</ref>\n\nPeople of Indigenous descent were also discriminated against based on their affiliations, as \"Spanish-speaking ''mestizos'' who resided in the main colonial towns\" were \"assumed to be Mexican,\" making them \"exempt from Indian policies.\" Indigenous groups who managed to not be displaced or \"subdued by the Spanish and Mexican governments were placed on reservations or forcibly driven out of the Southwest\" by American settlers and the military. If any Indigenous people refused to submit to the American occupiers, they would be \"politically-labeled [as] warlike\" which could serve as a justification for their imprisonment or murder by the state. Those groups who were considered peaceful \"were visited by an agent of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) to determine if they should be extended the legal rights of Mexican ''mestizos''\" in central colonial settlements. Ultimately, the BIA granted these rights to \"the [[Coahuiltecan]] and [[Apache]] in Texas, the [[Puebloans|Pueblos in New Mexico]], [[Pima people|Pima Indians]] of the Santa Cruz and San Pedro valleys in [[Arizona]], and [[Chumash people|Chumash]], [[Tongva|Garbieleno]], [[Luise\u00f1o|Luiseno]], and groups of [[Quechan|Yuma Indians]] in [[California]].\"<ref name=\":3\">Menchaca 2011, p. 20-21.</ref><blockquote>Once the legislature had made their decisions, many Indian villages were relocated onto reservations and some were allowed to remain in their village with their property respected (e.g. the Pueblo), but the majority had their lands confiscated and were forced to move.

With the \"final [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist]] conquest of the 'Kazakh' steppe, and the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolishment of serfdom]] in the Empire in 1861,\" the scale of \"Russian peasant migration into northern Central Asia increased dramatically.\" Newly emancipated [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Slavs|Slavic]] serfs sought territory in [[Siberia]] and Central Asia in hopes \"of acquiring a free plot of land\" to escape their previous condition of \"extreme poverty and starvation.\" Upper class Tsarist officials sought to prevent this migration, \"concerned with a possible decrease in the labour force in European Russia,\" but did so with little success. By the 1890s, in order to alleviate \"rising peasant unrest\" in European Russian cities such as [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], officials encouraged \"hundreds of thousands of Slavic peasants to resettle in Central Asia, especially on the territories of present-day [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\"<ref>Ubiria 2015, p. 58.</ref>\n\nIn the 1890s and early 1900s, the Russian Empire sent \"several government commissions\" to survey the \"quantity of [[arable land]]\" for \"prospective settlers,\" which concluded that \"the steppe nomads possessed surplus land, which could be allocated to Slavic settlers.\" The \"appropriation of 'Kazakh' surplus land\" was perceived by officials as \"legally justifiable\" following \"the [[Kazakh Khanate|'Kazakh' Khans]] submission to the Russian throne\" which transferred control over their land to \"the property of the Russian monarch.\" The migration of Slavic settlers into Central Asia peaked between 1906 and 1912, \"when approximately 1.5 million new Slav migrants poured into the region.\" By 1916, it was estimated that there were 3 million European settlers in the region. Since settlers were privileged by the Russian Empire, they were \"given larger and more fertile tracts of land\" while \"farming plots allocated to [Kazakhs] were often useless for cultivation.\" The loss of access to the fertile lands was \"a devastating blow to the 'Kazakh' nomadic economy\" and forced many Kazakhs \"to adapt to the [[sedentary lifestyle]], or to move southward in search of new grazing lands for their herds.\"<ref>Ubiria 2015, p. 58-59.</ref>\n\nHowever, \"the sedentarization of some 'Kazakhs' ... did not always necessarily lead to their detribalization, since most of the newly established 'Kazakh' villages were settled by ex-nomads deriving from the same clan and tribal origin.\" As such, many Kazakhs were able to retain their immediate clan and tribal identities. At the same time, the \"pan-horde identities,\" which had previously existed prior to Russian colonization, were \"significantly weakened with the abolition of the hordes, since no alternative institution remained to sustain them.\" Overall, the influx of Slavic settlers changed \"the demographic structure of the region,\" resulting in the \"emergence of two broad and distinct cultural groups,\" the Slavic settlers who were \"primarily followers of the [[Orthodox Christians|Orthodox Christian]] faith\" and the [[Muslims|Muslim]] Kazakhs, which included both \"pastoral nomads and newly sedentarized farmers\" and the related [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]] ethnic groups, who were speakers of Kazakh dialects and \"physically exhibit[ed] [[Mongoloid]] features.\"<ref>Ubiria 2015, p. 59.</ref>\n\nTsarist colonial policies \"privileged the Slavic settlers over the steppe nomads\" and segregated the Kazakhs and other steppe peoples as \"belonging to the inferior ''[[inorodtsy]]'' [\"uncivilized\"] category.\" This exacerbated sociocultural tensions between the two groups, as the Slav population became viewed as \"agents of the Tsarist colonialism, and hence equally responsible for their socio-economic problems.\" These tensions and oppression by the Russian Empire eventually culminated in the [[Central Asian revolt of 1916|1916 revolt in Central Asia]].<ref>Ubiria 2015, p. 59-60.</ref> Following the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, the Kazakhs were widely dispersed and had been \"battered in the civil war\" with the Slavic settlers which had preceded \"the establishment of [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] control.\" The \"surviving clans, villages, and ''auls'' (migratory groups) reconstituted themselves as Soviets and tried to carry on as before,\" although new policies were quickly imposed upon them.<ref name=\":6\">Findley 2004, p. 192.</ref>\n\nSimilar to European colonial efforts in Africa, Soviet nationality policy initially \"emphasized '[[indigenization]]' of the institutions of local government.\" However, while in Africa, European powers instituted these policies to prevent working-class consciousness and to control the majority of Africans as peasant laborers for their empires, the fundamental purpose of Soviet indigenization policies were \"precisely the opposite of the European policy of colonial indigenization in Africa.\" In this sense, \"Soviet policy was not designed to preserve 'traditional' content, but to replace it.\" The goal was not to ensure that a \"good [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]]\" remained a \"good Uzbek,\" as European powers had believed of the \"good African,\" but to \"make him a good 'European' in the sense that Europeans were modern and most Uzbeks were not.\" As a result of this Soviet ideology toward the colonized peoples of Central Asia, \"plenty of smashing of traditional institutions was done by the Soviet state in the name of [[Socialism|socialist]] transformation,\" which resulted in detribalization.<ref name=\":5\">Blitstein 2006, p. 288.</ref>\n\nThis was done through education policies, which were implemented through a \"universal Soviet curriculum\" instituted in the same manner \"regardless of the pupil's ethnic identity.\" The \"economic and political logic\" of this curriculum was to create \"a loyal, modern, interchangeable population suitable for rapid industrial development.\" While colonial governmental policy in Africa did not seek to employ a \"civilizing mission\" for fear of creating an urbanized \"detribalized\" population of workers who may rebel against the colonial order, the Soviets attempted to \"ultimately transform and integrate all peoples into one political community.\" Progress was notably perceived as slow by the Soviets in Central Asia, as \"[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] authorities consistently bemoaned the slow process of working-class formation among the Central Asian peoples\" and \"relatively low numbers of Central Asians in institutions of higher education in the late 1930s and 1940s\" was a \"sore point for a regime preoccupied with training 'nationality cadres.'\"<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nBy the \"mid-to-late 1930s,\" the Soviets had abandoned these nationality policies as a response to \"Russian resentment and rising non-Russian nationalism, itself a consequence of the indigenization policies.\" This resulted in new policies which asserted \"the reemergence of the Russians\" and curtailed the usage of \"non-Russian languages in administration\" while simultaneously increasing \"repression of ethnic diasporas and the adoption of mandatory [[Russian language|Russian]]-language instruction,\" exemplifying how \"new elements in Soviet nationality policy moved in the direction along the lines of its neighbors to the west\" during the [[interwar period]]. Resistance to these new policies emerged \"in [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Germans|German]] villages in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] and [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belorussian]] border regions and [the Soviets] took violent measures against those communities,\" such as through \"selective deportation targeting entire villages of Germans and Poles\"; the \"deportation of the [[Koryo-saram|Soviet Korean]] population to Central Asia would soon follow.\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 288-289.</ref>\n\nFollowing decades of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] control in the twentieth century, \"the party had still failed to undermine indigenous religious and clan authority\" throughout much of Central Asia. While other \"Turkic nationalities emerged through a processes of detribalization [over centuries], the modern Kazakhs emerged instead through expansion and adaptation\" under the weight of external authority.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== In the Middle East ===\n\n==== Jordan ====\nThe tribal groups of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] were detribalized in the 20th century after [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Emir Abdallah]], who had a political alliance with the [[British Empire|British]], assumed power. During the construction of the [[Hijaz Railway]], \"the tribes in the area refused to pay taxes or to contribute conscripts to the army, and at times, came out in open rebellion against central authorities.\" The alliance \"brought political recognition\" to Abdallah's regime and \"helped in detribalization\" of the region through colonial military control: \"to centralize authority, Transjordan had to create a viable bureaucracy and army, build infrastructure, quell internal revolts, repel external aggression, and detribalize the desert.\"<ref>Piro 1998, p. 95.</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\nAs an extension of European colonialism and Westernization, towns and urban centers in [[Saudi Arabia]] housed two different worlds, in which \"the 'native' town exists alongside a 'Western' town.\" In former colonies throughout the [[greater Middle East]], a second colonial city was often simply constructed next to the \"old town\" as part of the colonial order. Cities in Saudi Arabia such as [[Riyadh]], [[Jeddah]], and [[Dammam]] exemplified this type of colonial configuration in the 20th century. Westerners segregated themselves from those in the \"native\" town centers and lived together \"in more or less discreet and hermetically sealed compounds.\" It was in this urbanized setting that \"the modernization and individualization of Saudi society unfolded\" at a rapid pace, which broke down \"traditional social structures\" and \"served to detribalize society, to make the family cell its basic unit, and finally to split the family itself into conjugal micro-elements.\" The [[unification of Saudi Arabia]], \"was in every respect not only a victory of town over desert but ''a victory of the family over the tribe''.\" The increasing \"urbanization of Arabia therefore also corresponded to a sedentarization or detribalization of the [[Nomad|nomads]],\" accompanied by the Western family-centered model. Many nomadic families soon after became \"detached from their tribal history and sense of belonging.\"<ref>M\u00e9noret 2005, p. 160-162.</ref>\n\n=== In Oceania ===\n\n==== Australia ====\n{{Further information|List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|Australian frontier wars}}\n[[File:Aboriginal Australian women and children, Maloga, N.S.W.jpg|thumb|299x299px|Postcard showing a group of Aboriginal women in European dress at [[Maloga Mission]], Qld {{circa}}1900]]\nIn 1788, there was estimated to be approximately 251,000 [[Indigenous Australians]] (including [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] people) in what is now referred to in the [[Western world|Western]] context as Australia. By 1901, it was estimated that the population had declined to 67,000 as a result of European invasion and occupation. Indigenous groups which had survived were \"either institutionalized on [[Aboriginal reserve|government]] or [[:Category:Australian Aboriginal missions|mission settlements]] or allowed to form camps on the fringes of upcountry towns, pastoral properties, farms, and mines, which were usually tucked away well out of sight of the busier centers of colonial life.\" By the 1880s, \"the European populace became predominantly urban\", which increasingly divided most European settlers from the Indigenous people.<ref name=\":03\">Stanner 2011, p. 151-152.</ref>\n\nRacist perceptions of the Indigenous people were rampant throughout the [[European Australian]] population by the end of the nineteenth century as \"derision and contempt expressed in the mid-century years deepened toward a malevolent vilification\".

Those who were categorized as \"semicivilized\" and \"uncivilized\" were deemed to be unfit for integration into colonial society without detribalization. For the \"semicivilized\" and \"uncivilized\", the Australian government \"appeared to favor something like [[apartheid]] in inviolable reserves as an appropriate way of dealing with [them] but suggested that this should be done as far as possible without damage to the needs of employers of Aboriginal labor\".

According to Australian anthropologist [[A. P. Elkin]], \"European society was endeavoring to turn Aboriginal people into individualists\" by teaching them the \"''moral'' value of work\". He notes how European-Australian pastoralists forced \"Aboriginals living on their stations to perform some sort of token labor before they hand them their government social welfare check,\" viewed Indigenous children as undisciplined, and perceived their ownership over the land as justifiable based on their alleged superior morality.

As many people throughout the world have been detached through the historical and contemporary efforts of colonizers and the effects of colonialism, the current role and relationship of detribalized peoples as they relate to their communities of origin is complex. Reconnection with Indigenous knowledge systems can be an important element \"for Indigenous or detribalized people who were interrupted from the knowledge contained within\" their culture(s) of origin.<ref>Gonzalez 2012, p. 87.</ref> \n\nCentral to this relationship is protecting traditional ways of being, since \"what distinguishes the Indigenous struggle for self-determination from others is their collective effort to protect the rights of their peoples to live in accordance with traditional ways.\" Indigenous communities simultaneously \"resist the kind of essentialism that recognizes only one way of being\" while also working \"to retain a vast constellation of distinct traditions that serve as the defining characteristics of tribal life.\" Therefore, \"regardless of how any individual Indigenous person chooses\" to live their life, it is known in Indigenous communities that \"they are responsible for protecting the right to live according to ancestral ways,\" since, according to scholars such as [[Vine Deloria Jr.]], it has been \"the allegiance to traditional knowledge that has protected American Indians from annihilation and absorption in the democratic mainstream.\"<ref name=\":8\">Grande 2015, p. 240.</ref><blockquote>This connection to \"tradition\" determines that while the project of decolonization requires the histories and experiences of nontribal, detribalized, and \"mixed-blood\" peoples to be theorized as an integral part of the Indigenous diaspora, it must also operate to sustain and reinvigorate the life-ways of tribal peoples still among us.

As scholar [[Kim TallBear]] notes, the tribal or ethnic groups which are often targeted by \"race shifters\" or \"whites seeking Native American identity\" are those which have acknowledged \"histories of extensive '[[Admixture (genetics)|admixture]],' as geneticists would call it, with non-Native peoples,\" which has left these groups vulnerable \"because 'Cherokeenees seems open to whiteness in ways that Navajoness [for example] does not. ... Cherokeeness is an ideal destination for race-shifting because the tribe has a history of cultural adoption, tribal [[exogamy]], and relatively open standards of tribal citizenship.'\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 132-133.</ref> The \"Cherokee princess\" phenomenon exemplifies an aspect of this form of [[Ethnic fraud#Passing as indigenous Americans|ethnic fraud]]. [[Lakota people|Lakota]] journalist [[Tim Giago]] has humorously reflected on this matter as follows:<blockquote>Good heavens! We (Indians) have heard it so many times in our lives. A white man or woman approaches (this usually happens after I have given a speech) and says, \"My great grandmother was a Cherokee princess.\" Never a Cherokee prince, but always a princess. I suppose that is because none of these descendants of royalty wish to admit that their great grandmothers had an affair with a Cherokee male. Heaven forbid that a nice young white lady would ever cast an eye about an Indian man.<ref>Justice 2006, p. 222.</ref></blockquote>Because of federally-imposed qualifications of tribal enrollment, in the form of [[Blood quantum laws|blood-quantum laws]], tribal citizenship since the 20th century has been complicated by \"dominant cultural notions of race,\" which have \"pushed or been pushed against tribal peoples' own ideas of belonging and citizenship.\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 63-64.</ref> DNA tests or \"[[Genetic ancestry test|genetic-ancestry tests]]\" are increasingly becoming an issue for tribes as well. In 2010, several tribes reported at a \"national tribal enrollment conference\" that \"they had received enrollment applications with commercially purchased genetic-ancestry test results included,\" despite the fact that \"federally recognized tribes do not accept genetic-ancestry results as appropriate documentation for enrollment and do not advise applicants to submit such documentation.\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 65-66.</ref>\n\nSome individuals have used DNA tests in this manner to claim [[Minority group|minority]] status in the United States for their own personal benefit. There is \"anecdotal evidence\" that some \"applicants to [[Ivy League]] and other top-ranked schools who want an affirmative-action leg up in competitive admissions processes have used DNA tests to back up their personal decisions to self-identify as racial or ethnic minorities.\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 68.</ref> In 2019, \"contractors with white ancestry got $300 million\" for claiming to be Cherokee despite nonexistent evidence supporting their claims. \"12 of the 14 business owners involved claimed membership in one of three self-described Cherokee groups,\" the Northern Cherokee Nation, the Western Cherokee Nation of Arkansas and Missouri, and the [[Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory]], all of which remain federally unrecognized and openly opposed by the Cherokee Nation and the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-na-cherokee-minority-contracts-20190626-story.html|title=Claiming to be Cherokee, contractors with white ancestry got $300 million|last=Elmahrek|first=Adam|last2=Pringle|first2=Paul|date=26 June 2019|website=LA Times|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, \"tribal communities sometimes feel they are under assault by people with tenuous or nonexistent connections to their communities yet who want access to cultural knowledge or to cultural sites for personal identity exploration and sometimes for profit.\" Some have called for \"a more '[[decolonized]]' tribal enrollment based on social- and cultural-competence criteria (such as doing community service on [[Indian reservation|reservations]] or in historic homelands; knowing the tribal history, culture, and politics; knowing the tribal language; taking an oath of allegiance to the tribal nation; and proving that one is of 'good character according to the tribe's traditional code of morality'), used alone or in conjunction with more liberal blood rules.\" However, these solutions have also been criticized by some as \"overly idealistic\" \u2013 \"the fear is that the floodgates would fly open with the possibility of cultural conversion.\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 60-61.</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n*Anzald\u00faa, Gloria E.

Detribalization was systematically executed by detaching members from identifying with communities extrinsic to the colony so that they could be \"[[modernized]],\" [[Westernized]], and, in most circumstances, [[Christianized]], for the prosperity of the colonial state. Historical accounts illustrate several trends in detribalization, with the most prevalent being the role that Western colonial [[Capitalism|capitalists]] played in exploiting Indigenous people's labor, resources, and knowledge, the role that [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries and the colonial [[Christian mission]] system played in compelling Christian membership in place of Indigenous cultural and religious practices, instances of which were recorded in [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Oceania]], and the systemic conditioning of Indigenous peoples to internalize their own purported inferiority through direct and indirect methods.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 75.</ref><ref>Gonzalez 2012, p. 69.</ref><ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.</ref><ref>Rodriguez 2014, p. 18.</ref><ref name=\":7\">Stanner 2011, p. 158.</ref>\n\nIn the colonial worldview, \"civilization\" was exhibited through the development of permanent settlements, [[infrastructure]], [[Line of communication|lines of communication,]] churches, and the construction of a [[built environment]] structured on altering and extracting resources from the [[natural environment]]. The stated justification to detribalize Indigenous peoples throughout the world was most frequently a \"[[civilizing mission]]\" \u2013 to liberate them from, what colonizers perceived as, their inferior and \"uncivilized\" ways of living. Detribalization in many regions was commonly enacted by detaching Indigenous persons from their traditional territories, cultural practices, and communal identities, while subjugating them to an exploited and marginalized class position within colonial capitalist society, often as an enslaved or indentured labor force for colonial industry.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 68.</ref><ref>Hickel 2015, p. 91-94.</ref>\n\n'''De-Indianization''' has been used in scholarship as a variant of detribalization, particularly on work in the [[United States]] and [[Latin America|Latin American]] contexts, although the term detribalization is also similarly used to refer to this process of colonial transformation on subsets of the historical and contemporary [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous population of the Americas]].<ref>Moraga 2011, p. 220.</ref> De-Indianization has been defined by anthropologist [[Guillermo Bonfil Batalla]] as a process which occurs \"in the realm of ideology\" or [[Identity (social science)|identity]], and is fulfilled when \"the pressures of the dominant society succeed in breaking the ethnic identity of the Indian community,\" even if \"the lifeway may continue much as before.\"<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 46.</ref> '''De-Indigenization''' or '''deindigenization''' have also been used as variants of detribalization in academic scholarship.<ref>Rodriguez 2014, p. 18.</ref> For example, academic Patrisia Gonzalez has argued how ''mestizaje'' operated as the \"master narrative\" constructed by colonizers \"to ''de-Indigenize'' peoples\" throughout Latin America.<ref>Gonzalez 2012, p. 213.</ref> \n\nWhile, according to James F. Eder, initial colonial detribalization most often occurred as a result of \"land expropriation, habitat destruction, epidemic disease, or even genocide,\" contemporary cases may not involve such apparent or \"readily identified external factors.\" In a [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] framework, \"less visible forces associated with political economies of modern nation-states \u2013 market incentives, cultural pressures, new religious ideologies \u2013 permeate the fabric and ethos of tribal societies and motivate their members to think and behave in new ways.\"<ref>Eder 1992, p. 5-6.</ref>\n\n== Usage of term ==\n''Detribalize'' has been defined by [[Merriam-Webster]] as \"to cause to lose tribal identity,\" by [[Dictionary.com]] as \"to cause to lose tribal allegiances and customs, chiefly through contact with another culture,\" and by the [[Cambridge Dictionary]] as \"to make members of a tribe (a social group of people with the same language, customs, and history, and often a recognized leader) stop following their traditional customs or social structure.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/detribalize|title=Detribalize|website=Merriam-Webster|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/detribalization|title=Detribalize|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/detribalize|title=Detribalize|website=Cambridge Dictionary|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref> Detribalization incorporates the word ''tribal'', which has been recognized as an offensive and pejorative term when used in certain contexts.<ref>Mamdani 2018, p. 7.</ref> For this reason, ''detribalization'' is sometimes used in quotations when referring to the process being described to signpost for the reader the term's potentially offensive subtext.\n\nFrom its early uses to modern scholarship, ''detribalization'' has almost exclusively been applied in particular geographic, and therefore racialized, contexts. As the proceeding section on regional detribalized histories demonstrates, while historical discussion and academic research on \"detribalization\" and \"detribalized\" peoples can be found in the African, Asian, Oceanic, North American, and South American contexts, especially when referring to Indigenous histories of each of these regions, to locate instances in which the term has been applied to Europeans or in the European context is exceptionally rare. One of the few instances was by contemporary scholar Ronen Zeidel in a study on [[Gypsies in Iraq|Iraqi Gypsies]] in 2014, who stated \"whereas the Gypsies entered a ''detribalized'' Europe with a social organization that was different, contributing to their estrangement, that was not the case in [[Iraq]]. Iraqi society has never been detribalized.\"<ref>Parrs 2017, p. 65.</ref>\n\n=== Misapplication ===\nIn the twentieth century, criticisms regarding the usage of ''detribalization'' emerged among scholars, particularly in the African context, who recognized its misapplication as a consequence of [[racism]]. South African anthropologist [[Meyer Fortes]] noted how the term was commonly used in the European sociological context as a \"synonym for such words as 'pathological', 'disintegrated', 'demoralized', in a pejorative or deprecatory sense.\" [[Isaac Schapera]] recognized how the term was also being misapplied by Europeans who assumed that urbanization in colonial society implied detribalization: \"it is not correct to assume that all people who go to the [[Union of South Africa|Union]] [of South Africa] from [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] tend to become 'detribalized'.\"<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":14\">Bovenkerk 1975, p. 27.</ref> H. M. Robertson states that \"the urban native is classed as 'detribalized,' but this is not necessarily the case.\"<ref>Robertson 2015, p. 143.</ref> Ellen Hellmann similarly described in her sociological work \"that 'the process of detribalization has been exaggerated' among the urban African population, although 'the average European would unhesitatingly classify these Natives as detribalized'.\" In his sociological study, William Watson concludes that while \"under urban conditions, Africans rapidly assimilate European dress, material culture, and outward forms of behaviour, this assimilation does not necessarily imply detribalization. On the contrary, many attempts to organize African industrial workers on a common basis of economic interest have encountered great difficulties because of African tribal solidarities and inter-tribal hostilities.\"<ref name=\":10\">Watson 1958, p. 4-6.</ref>\n\nIn ''Africa's International Relations: The Diplomacy of Dependency and Change'' (1978), Kenyan academic [[Ali Mazrui|Ali A Mazrui]] provides a nuanced discussion of the misapplication of ''detribalization'', recognizing how \"there was often an assumption among analysts of the African colonial scene that nationalism made its recruits from the ranks of the detribalized.\" Since the leaders of anti-colonial movements were, in the majority of instances, \"Westernized or semi-Westernized,\" they were classed as \"detribalized\" by European colonial authorities. However, Mazrui notes that this employment of ''detribalization'' failed to differentiate between \"tribalism as a way of life and tribalism as loyalty to an ethnic group,\" noting that colonial analysts had only recognized instances of a \"weakening of cultural affiliation, though not necessarily of ethnic loyalty.\" In other words, \"a person could adopt an entirely Western way of life but still retain great love and loyalty to the ethnic group from which he sprang.\" As a result, Mazrui proposes the term ''detraditionalized'', recognizing that \"the erosion of tradition [does] not necessarily mean the dimunition of ethnicity.\"<ref>Mazrui 1978, p. 239-240.</ref>\n\n== Regional detribalized histories ==\n\n=== In Africa ===\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|318x318px|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\nFrom 1884 to 1885, European powers, along with the United States, convened at the [[Berlin Conference]] in order to settle colonial disputes throughout the [[Africa|African continent]] and protect the economic interests of their colonial empires. The conference was the primary occasion for partitioning, what Europeans commonly referred to as, \"the dark continent.\" Africa was to be partitioned by five primary European powers, Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, and Italy, along with [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] of [[Belgium]].<ref>Harlow 2003, p. 1.</ref> In 1898, Polish-British author [[Joseph Conrad]] remarked in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' on how Europeans used color swatches to denote their territorial claims over Africa, a common practice in the period:<blockquote>There was a vast amount of red [Britain] \u2013 good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work is done there, a deuce of a lot of blue [France], a little green [Portugal], smears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch [Germany], to show where the jolly pioneers drink the jolly [[Lager|lager beer]]. However, I wasn't going into any of these. I was going into the yellow [Belgium]. Dead in the center.<ref>Conrad [1902] 1990, p. 7.</ref></blockquote>An empire had to demonstrate effective occupation of the land they were claiming in order to justify their claims to it. Under these guidelines, scholar Kitty Millet has noted, that ''effective'' \"'connoted farms, gardens, roads, railways, [and] even [a] postal service.\" The only entities which could claim ownership \"over these diverse African spaces... had to be one of the powers at the conference. Local or Indigenous groups were neither imaginable as political powers nor visible as peers or subjects of European sovereigns.\" Not only were Indigenous peoples not physically represented at the Berlin Conference, they were also absent \"to the European powers' conceptualization of territory. They were not 'on the map'.\"<ref>Millet 2018, p. 80-81.</ref> Rather, Indigenous peoples were perceived by Europeans as property of the land living in an inferior [[state of nature]]. Prior to their consciousness of their own \"[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]],\" Millet notes that Europeans were first \"conscious of the superiority of their developmental 'progress' ... 'Savages' had temporary huts; they roamed the countryside. They were incapable of using nature appropriately. The colour of their skins condemned them.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBecause Indigenous nations were deemed to be \"uncivilized,\" European powers declared the territorial sovereignty of Africa as openly available, which initiated the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late nineteenth century. With the continent of Africa conceptualized as effectively \"ownerless\" territory, Europeans positioned themselves as its redeemers and rightful colonial rulers. In the European colonial mindset, Africans were inferior and incapable of being \"civilized\" because they had failed to properly manage or exploit the natural resources available to them. As a result, they were deemed to be obstacles to capitalist investment, extraction, and production of natural resources in the construction of a new colonial empire and built environment. The immense diversity of the [[Indigenous peoples of Africa]] was flattened by this colonial perception, which labeled them instead as an \"unrepresentable [[Nomad|nomadic]] horde of apprehensions that ran across European territories.\"<ref name=\":4\">Millet 2018, p. 82-84.</ref>\n\n[[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial authorities, who policed and controlled the majority of territory in Africa by the early twentieth century, were notably ambivalent towards \"modernizing\" African people. [[Donald Charles Cameron (colonial administrator)|Donald Cameron]], the British governor of [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] as well as, later, of [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]], stated in 1925: \"It is our duty to do everything in our power to develop the native on lines which will not Westernize him and turn him into a bad imitation of a European.\" Instead, Cameron argued that \"the task of 'native administration' was to make him into a 'good African.'\" While the French openly professed that their involvement in Africa was a \"civilizing mission,\" scholar Peter A. Blitstein notes that in practice they rejected African \"assimilation into French culture,\" excluded them \"from French citizenship,\" and emphasized \"how different Africans were from French, and how important it was to keep the two races separate.\" [[Mahmood Mamdani]] has contended that rather than a \"civilizing mission,\" as was often claimed by European powers to be the rationale for colonization, colonial policy instead sought to \"'stabilize racial domination by 'ground[ing] it in a politically enforced system of ethnic pluralism.'\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 285.</ref>\n\nIn the twentieth century, colonial authorities in Africa intentionally and actively worked to prevent the emergence of nationalist and [[Working class|working-class]] movements which could ultimately threaten their authority and colonial rule by preventing \"detribalization,\" which Europeans interpreted as occurring through the urbanization, [[liberal education]], and [[proletarianization]] of African people, regardless if they were actually detached from their ethnic identity or community or not.<ref name=\":10\" /> European powers adopted a policy of [[indirect rule]], which (1) relied on the use of \"traditional\" African leadership to maintain order, which was also understood by Europeans, according to historian [[Leroy Vail]], to be \"markedly less expensive than the employment of expensive European officials,\" and (2) was rooted in the belief that \"Africans were naturally 'tribal' people.\"<ref>Vail 1991, p. 13.</ref> As a result, \"detribalization was the ghost which haunted the system\" of indirect rule by threatening to undermine colonial capitalist [[hegemony]] in Africa. European perspectives of Africans were thoroughly infused with racism, which, according to [[John E. Flint]], \"served to justify European power over the 'native' and to keep western-educated Africans from contaminating the rest.\" Additionally, Alice Conklin has found that, in the post-[[World War I]] period, some officials in [[French West Africa]] may have \"discovered in 'primitive' Africa an idealized premodern and patriarchal world reminiscent of the one they had lost at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]],\" a [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] position which nonetheless may have served as a rationale for fears over detribalization and the \"consequences of modernity.\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 285-286.</ref> \n\nUnder indirect rule, universal [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] were not adopted in British or French colonies in Africa in order to avoid creating a class of \"unemployable and politically dangerous, 'pseudo-Europeanized' natives.\" A curriculum which instead directed Africans towards fulfilling subservient roles Europeans perceived them as \"destined\" to play, commonly as members of the colonial [[Peasant|peasantry]] and exploited laborers, was alternatively adopted. French and British fears over detribalization were also demonstrated via their attitudes toward the notion of African [[Wage labour|wage labor]] and proletarianization. For this reason, African wage labor was only determined necessary when it aided the advancement or progress of the colonial capitalist state, such as via the African colonial [[Mining|mining industry]]. According to Peter A. Blitstein, neither the British or the French were \"able to see wage workers as anything but 'detribalized' and, therefore, dangerous.\" As a result, the ideal model for African colonial society was one in which small-scale producers could be provided with temporary migrant labor as needed, since \"to recognize Africans as workers would ultimately equate them to Europeans, and, perhaps, require the kinds of welfare-state provisions that European workers were beginning to enjoy \u2013 trade union membership, insurance, a family wage.\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 286-287.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a study authored by four colonial functionaries and commissioned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] government's [[Ministry of the Colonies (France)|ministry of the colonies]] in 1944 entitled \"Condition of the detribalized natives\" called for \"the systematic and immediate expulsion of any native illegally entering metropolitan France.\" Historian Eric T. Jennings has commented how this policy was \"certainly not new\" and had been informed by \"a host of [[Reductionism|reductionist]] thinkers from [[Gustave Le Bon]] to [[\u00c9douard Drumont|Edouard Drumont]] or [[Alexis Carrel]]\" while also eerily foreshadowing arguments to be used by the modern [[French far right]]. Jean Paillard, an influential colonial theoriest in Vichy France feared \"native domination\" in which \"the colonizers would eventually come under the domination of the colonized.\" Similarly, the authors of the study maintained that \"the detribalized native becomes an immoral creature as soon as he reaches the city,\" reiterating European colonial viewpoints in the twentieth century by emphasizing that \"detribalization\" must be avoided above all measures. However, when detribalization becomes \"unavoidable\" it must \"be accompanied by a strict regimen\" of control. Since, according to the study, when \"left to their own devices,\" the \"detribalized\" person becomes a drunken failure in European society due to their innate inferiority. Jennings argues that this study attempted to invent a \"retribalization\" effort for the \"detribalized\" person and was hinged upon the larger \"apocalyptic fears of a world dominated by unruly and debauched 'natives,' uprooted from their 'natural environments.'\" This study reflected much of the European theoretical perception of detribalized peoples of the period, as further exemplified in [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]]'s ''Uprooted'' (1941).<ref>Jennings 2004, p. 27-29</ref>\n\nFollowing World War II, colonial policy began to shift from preventing \"detribalization\" to more widely promoting devices for economic and cultural development in African colonial societies and, eventually, in both the British and French case, self-government as a means of obtaining independence. European colonial empires in Africa increasingly opted for [[Nationalizing|nationalization]] rather than previous policies of indirect rule and forced contracted or temporary labor. However, according to historian Peter A. Blitstein, the ultimate objectives of the British and French for Westernizing colonized and \"detribalized\" Africans remained unclear by the mid-twentieth century, as colonizers struggled to articulate how Africans could be brought into congruence with their visions of \"modernity.\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 291-292.</ref> \n\nThroughout post-independence Africa, two different types of African states emerged, according to scholar Mahmood Mamdani, which he terms as \"the conservative and the radical\" African states. While the conservative African state adopted a decentralized form of [[Despotism|despotic]] authority which \"tended to bridge the urban-rural divide through a [[clientelism]] whose effect was to exacerbate ethnic divisions,\" the radical African state adopted a centralized form of despotic authority which contributed to detribalization by tightening control over local authorities. Mamdani theorizes that \"if the two-pronged division that the colonial state enforced on the colonized \u2013 between town and country, and between ethnicities \u2013 was its dual legacy at independence, each of the two versions of the postcolonial state tended to soften one part of the legacy while exacerbating the other.\"<ref>Mamdani 2018, p. 25-26.</ref>\n\n==== Southern Africa ====\n[[File:Nama copper VOC anonymous.jpg|thumb|295x295px|Undated anonymous mural located in South Africa House, London, portraying the [[Nama people|Nama]] presenting green copper-bearing rocks to the Dutch East India Company at the Cape, which initiated an expedition to extract the ore by the Dutch in 1685.]]\nIn the seventeenth century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] was importing shiploads of slaves to South Africa, transferring the former colonial station for passing ships into a slaveholding colony. In 1685, the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]]'s last company commander and first governor [[Simon van der Stel]] formed an exploration party to locate a copper reserve that the Indigenous [[Nama people]] had shown him. The Nama were reportedly described by the colonists as \"'very friendly'\" and, scholar Kitty Millet notes that, \"relations were so amenable between the Nama and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers that the Nama treated the colony to a musical 'exhibition' for the governor's birthday.\" However, shortly after Dutch settlers introduced slave labor to the region and arrived in increasingly greater numbers, conflicts from 1659 to 1660 and 1673 to 1677, followed by a smallpox outbreak caused the majority of the Nama people to flee from their traditional territory. Those who remained soon \"existed as 'detribalized indigenous peoples'.\"<ref>Millet 2018, p. 64.</ref>\n\nEarly maps created by European colonizers portrayed an image of southern Africa as a ''[[terra nullius]]'' of \"uncivilized\" Indigenous villages and \"wild beasts.\" As early as the 1760s, it was Europeans sought to organize Nama settlements in the region into \"'natural' preserves\" which would segregate colonists from Indigenous peoples. When the British first took over the colony in 1798, [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|John Barrow]], a British statesman, perceived himself as \"a reformer in comparison with the [[Boer]] [Dutch] 'burghers' and government officials whose embrace of slavery, and land grabs, had destroyed not only Nama tribes living near them, but also the land itself on which they staked their farms.\" The Nama tribes on the [[Namaqualand|Namaaqua plain]] had been absorbed into the South African colony as \"individual units of labour\" and reportedly lived \"in a state of 'detribalization.'\" As the Nama were increasingly exploited and brought into subservience to Europeans, many completely abandoned the territory of the expanding Cape Colony, choosing instead to settle along the [[Orange River]]. Many were also absorbed into [[Oorlam people|Orlam]] communities, where \"they existed as herders and 'outlaws,' conducting raids on Boer farms.\"<ref>Millet 2018, p. 65-67.</ref>\n\nFrom 1800 to 1925, over 1,030 [[Mission (station)|mission stations]] were established throughout southern Africa by approximately 60 missionary societies from Europe. A study on the location and role of these mission stations by Franco Frescura noted how throughout the nineteenth century there was a \"spreading geographical presence of missionaries over southern Africa\" which paralleled the restructuring of the social, economic, and political landscape of the region by colonial forces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/missionary-settlement-southern-africa-1800-1925|title=Missionary settlement in Southern Africa 1800-1925|last=Frescura|first=Franco|date=November 2003|website=South African History Online|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref> Despite their stated purpose, missionaries were reportedly unsuccessful in converting many Indingenous people. One study reported that only about \"12% of people on mission settlements were there for ''spiritual'' reasons\" and that the majority of people often remained either for a \"material advantage or psychological security.\" Throughout southern Africa, while \"some groups such as the [[BaSotho|Basotho]] and the [[Tswana people|Tswana]] openly welcomed missionaries, others like the [[Pedi people|Pedi]], the [[Zulu people|Zulu]], and the [[Pondo people|Pondo]] vehemently rejected their presence as a matter of national policy.\" In some cases, entire populations relocated away from the mission settlements and ostracized members of their community who had been converted or resided at the settlements, effectively removing them from their communities.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/european-missionaries-southern-africa-role-missionaries|title=European missionaries in southern Africa: the role of the missionaries|date=22 March 2011|website=South African History Online|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1806, [[Germans|German]] missionaries working under the [[London Missionary Society]] were reportedly the \"first white persons\" to arrive in what is now modern-day [[Namibia]]. They soon founded mission stations with surrounding fields and territories in an effort to Christianize and [[Sedentism|sedenteraize]] the Indigenous peoples. However, because of the harsh climate and severe drought, their attempts at maintaining the stations failed, although they converted one Orlam ''kaptein'', [[Jager Afrikaner]], the father of [[Jonker Afrikaner]], who would become an important Namibian politician. Missionaries struggled to indoctrinate the Indigenous peoples in the region with their ideologies due to outright opposition from the [[Herero people|Herero]], who were the most powerful Indigenous group and were unconvinced of the professed \"holy mission\" of the missionaries. The Herero, like other Indigenous people in the region, were perceived as \"uncivilized\" by European settlers because they did not practice sedentary farming nor openly accept [[Western world|Western]] ideologies. A German missionary illuminated this wider perspective regarding his encounters with the Nama people: \"The Nama does not want to work but to live a life of ease. But the Gospel says he must work in the sweat of his brows. He is therefore opposed to the Gospel.\"<ref>Millet 2018, p. 67-68.</ref> This was a common perception among missionaries in southern Africa, who \"sought to impose an alien morality and work ethos upon the local people without realizing that these undermined their most basic social and cultural tenets and were therefore largely resisted.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/european-missionaries-southern-africa-role-missionaries|title=European missionaries in southern Africa: the role of the missionaries|date=22 March 2011|website=South African History Online|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe status of detribalization was perceived by Dutch colonizers as a potential method of redemption, as noted by scholar Kitty Millet, so that \"the 'detribalized' African\" could learn \"his proper place\" as a member of an exploited class of laborers fueling colonial industry.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 68.</ref> Orlam people were understood as \"detribalized Namas\" who had now lived for several generations on the outskirts of colonial society as both indentured bonded servants and as enslaved people subjugated to a position of servitude to the Dutch, and later the British.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 74-75.</ref> In the nineteenth century, as Millet reports, there was a \"concerted effort\" by the Dutch [[Cape Colony]] government to \"detach individuals from the tribal group\" of the Orlam, \"to 'detribalize' them through labor, either through indenture or enslavement.\" In order to maintain the colonial capitalist order, the Dutch \"not only wanted to destroy the physical polities of indigenous tribes among or in proximity to them, substituting them with a docile class of labourers, but also wanted them to forget, completely, their prior existence as 'independent' peoples. The colony's 'health' depended on the removal of independent tribes and, in their stead, the visibility of the 'detribalized' servant.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> \n\nIn order to psychologically condition Orlam people to accept a subordinate role, the Dutch deliberately infantilized enslaved peoples to reinforce their status as inferior. In this regard, even if a slave escaped captivity and joined \"free\" Orlam communities as a fugitive, \"the slave brought with him the memory of this infantilization.\" This dehumanizing treatment collectively triggered widespread resistance to Dutch colonialism in Orlam communities, who formed an aware and active community in [[Cape Town]] by maintaining relationships with enslaved peoples who remained under Dutch control. The British, who reacquired control over the Cape Colony in 1806, similarly sought to continue this system of exploitation for the benefit of the British Empire. This pushed Orlam communities further to the margins, especially as Dutch Boer farmers themselves \"annexed more land, and moved closer to the 'fringes'\" as a response to the transference of colonial political power. This ongoing resistance within Orlam communities led to the formation of politically centralized leaders in the early nineteenth century, known as ''kapteins'', who functioned as authorities in the community unlike in any traditional Nama society.<ref name=\":02\">Millet 2018, p. 75-76.</ref> \n\nAs the Dutch and British targeted Orlam ''kapteins'', scholar Kitty Millet notes, \"even more 'detribalized' individuals [joined] the 'fugitives' already established at the margins\" of colonial society. However, either oblivious to or refusing to acknowledge their own role in generating this deeply entrenched resistance, the British credited Orlam resistance with what they perceived to be an \"ontological predisposition\" within the detribalized Orlam people, which allegedly reflected a \"primitive 'state of being'.\" They presumed that the Orlam's reestablishment as communities at the fringes of colonial society was an expression of their inherent nomadic disposition. As resistance continued to the colonial order, more and more groups with \"diverse origins\" also joined Orlam collectives, despite being notably \"unrelated to their ''kapteins''.\" Despite the heterogeneity of the Orlam collectives, they were able to fight their own subjugation and reestablish themselves as an Indigenous [[polity]].<ref name=\":0\">Millet 2018, p. 76-77.</ref>\n\nOver time, the burgeoning numbers of resistance groups could not be sustained by the surrounding region of the Cape Colony because of low rainfall and drought. As resources depleted, detribalized Orlam resistance groups moved northward and eventually crossed the Orange River to reunite with the Nama. Each of the Orlam resistance groups requested permission from the Nama [[confederation]] and reentered Nama land between 1815 and 1851. As they reintegrated into the Nama community, the Orlam groups quickly transformed how the Nama perceived themselves and their relationships with the neighboring Herero as well as colonial traders and missionaries who had accompanied the Orlam resistance groups in their reintegration. As a result of this reintegration, Kitty Millet notes that a new Nama leadership emerged under [[Kido Witbooi]]'s grandson, [[Hendrik Witbooi (Namaqua chief)|Hendrik Witbooi]]. Hendrik was a Christian who understood his leadership as a [[divine mandate]]. While traditional Nama tribes had preferred [[pacifism]] to armed conflict prior to the integration of the detribalized Orlam groups, Witbooi altered this understanding and believed it was his mission to continue the resistance effort among the Nama. Witbooi would later be killed in battle with German colonial military forces in 1905 and is now understood to be a national hero in Namibia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[German South West Africa]] was established in 1884 following decades of German settlers and missionaries occupying the region and conducting work through missionary societies such as the [[Rhenish Missionary Society]]. The [[German Empire]] officially claimed dominion and sovereignty over present-day Namibia, which included the traditional territories of the Herero and [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] of the northern region, bands of [[Khoisan]] ([[San people|San]] and [[Khoikhoi]]) in the central and southern regions, and the [[Damara people|Damara]] in the mountainous regions. German colonists unilaterally applied the category of \"bushmen\" to these groups, because they perceived them as primitive \"[[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherers]].\" Related to the Khoikhoi were the Nama, who by the nineteenth century had settled in the southwestern regions of Namibia and northern South Africa as a result of colonial displacement. The British similarly referred to Khoisan and Nama in the Cape Colony as \"[[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]],\" a name originally applied by the Germans in South West Africa. These labels demonstrated the European colonial perspective of Indigenous peoples, which flattened their complexities into a singular class of uniform colonized subjects.<ref>Millet 2018, p. 73-74.</ref>\nIn the nineteenth century, European missionaries sought to eradicate Indigenous ways of living and knowing through the process of Christianization to, as scholar [[Jason Hickel]] argues, mold them into \"the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] European model.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> As colonial German academic and [[theologian]] Gustav Warneck stated in 1888, \"without doubt it is a far more costly thing to kill the [Indigenous population] than to Christianise them.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> Contrary to the stated \"civilizing\" objectives of missionaries, colonial administrators sought to preserve \"traditional\" African structures in order to maintain their indirect rule, consistently pushing Africans to the margins of colonial society. According to Hickel, administrators even regarded \"the idea of a [[civilizing mission]] with suspicion, fearing that 'detribalization' would lead to social [[anomie]], mass unrest, and the rise of a politically conscious class that would eventually undermine minority rule altogether.\" The [[Native Affairs Department]], established by the [[British South Africa Company|British South African Company]] in 1894, sought to prop up African \"tradition\" for this reason:<blockquote>The idea was to prevent [[urbanization]] by keeping Africans confined to [[Bantustan|native reserves]], and to govern them according to a codified form of customary law through existing patriarchs and chiefs. Then, using an intricate network of influx controls, Africans were brought temporarily to the cities for work on fixed-term contracts, at the end of which they were expelled back to the reserves. The system was purposefully designed to prevent full proletarianization and forestall the rise of radical consciousness.<ref name=\":13\">Hickel 2015, p. 91.</ref></blockquote>However, by the early twentieth century, as a result of the \"insatiable appetite [of colonizers] for cheap labor,\" the previous colonial policy of indirect rule began to weaken considerably, which resulted in the emergence of numerous informal settlements on the peripheries of \"white cities\" in southern Africa. In response to the overwhelming \"unauthorized\" urbanization of Africans, European colonial administrators eventually adopted the moralizing approach of their missionary counterparts and sought to \"reform\" African shanties, which were regarded as undisciplined chaotic spaces that blurred the order of colonial society as a \"social-evolutionary misfire.\" Social scientists of the period upheld this perspective and disseminated these ideas widely, as represented in their perceptions of the \"detribalized\" African subjects who they perceived as inhabiting these peripheral informal settlements.<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 92-93.</ref>\n[[File:Zwelihle Township (Hermanus, South Africa) 09.jpg|left|thumb|266x266px|Zwelihle Township, in [[Hermanus]], South Africa. ca. 2008]]\nAustro-Hungarian philosopher [[Karl Polanyi]] referred to \"detribalized\" South Africans in highly racist and pathological terms, stating that the \"[[Kaffir (racial term)|''kaffir'']] of South Africa, a noble savage, whom none felt socially more secure in his native [[kraal]], has been transformed into a human variety of half-domesticated animal dressed in the 'unrelated, the filthy, the unsightly rags that not the most degenerated white man would wear,' a nondescript being, without self-respect or standards, veritable human refuse.\" Anthropologist [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Bronislaw Malinowski]] similarly \"decried 'detribalized' natives as 'sociologically unsound' monstrosities who had lost the regulated order of 'tribal' society \u2013 but given their lack of access to the necessary material resources \u2013 had failed to approximate the structure of 'European' society.\" The \"out-of-category\" status of \"detribalized\" urban South Africans was perceived as a threat to the European colonial order. In South Africa and Namibia, the colonial government soon \"forced [their] relocations into modernist [[Township (South Africa)|townships]] laid out along rectilinear grids\" with the stated intention of conditioning \"detribalized\" Africans to become \"happy, docile subjects\" who would \"internalize the values of European domesticity.\"<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 93-94.</ref>\n\nWhile Europeans and [[white South Africans]] during this period classed all urban Africans as \"detribalized,\" this was largely an extension of existing racism which had flattened all Africans into indistinguishable masses of \"disorderly\" racialized subjects and was not necessarily reflective of reality. In fact, many Indigenous people working on European-owned farms and in urban districts were not formally \"detribalized,\" or detached from their \"tribal\" identities or communities.<ref name=\":10\" /> Professor at [[Stellenbosch University]] J. F. W. Grosskopf recorded that \"many Europeans coming into touch with the native only in the bigger centres seem inclined to over-estimate the number of 'detribalized' natives... Such natives may have adopted a semi-European urban mode of life for several years, while it still remains a difficult matter for the white man to say how far tribal influence and connection has actually ceased.\" In 1914, Grosskopf documented an instance in which several urbanized [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Black South Africans]] who had \"never visited their tribe in [[Thaba 'Nchu|Thaba Nehu]]\" left their \"permanent and well-paid jobs in [[Bloemfontein|Bloomfontein]]\" after a [[Barolong|Baralong]] chief \"bought land for his followers in the southern part of [[Rhodesia]].\" They recorded in a notice to their employers that they were leaving \"'for our chief is calling us'.\"<ref>Robertson 2015, p. 143.</ref> British anthropologist Isaac Schapera similarly noted that urbanization did not necessarily imply detribalization, essentially regonizing the differences between assimilation in Western society and detribalization.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nYet, with increasingly racist perceptions of Black South Africans, scholar Jason Hickel notes that \"white South Africans saw detribalization as a process of decay, as the decomposition of tribal social order into a chaotic tangle of random persons and unmarried women.\" This was exemplified in their perceptions of townships, which were \"regarded as makeshift and transient, in between the traditional African homestead and the modern European house.\"<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 98.</ref> White South Africans adopted, what they considered to be, a \"civilizing mission\" with reluctance, conceding that \"urban Africans\" were \"needed as labor\" and \"could [thus] not be 'retribalized.'\" The first townships at Baumannville, [[Lamontville]], and [[Chesterville, KwaZulu-Natal|Chesterville]] were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s for this purpose. According to Hickel, the planners of these townships sought to \"reconcile two competing ideas: on the one hand a fear that 'detribalization' of Africans would engender immense social upheaval, and, on the other hand, a belief that 'civilizing' Africans into an established set of social norms would facilitate docility.\"<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 99-100.</ref> These conditions and perceptions continued throughout the [[apartheid]] era in South Africa and Namibia.<ref>Hickel 2015, p. 111.</ref> South African political theorist [[Aletta Norval]] notes that as the apartheid system expanded, \"the 'detribalized Native' had to be regarded as a 'visitor' in the cities until such time as the ideal of total apartheid could be reached\" through complete racial segregation.<ref>Norval 1996, p. 119.</ref>\n\nIn ''Sounds of a Cowhide Drum'' (1971), [[Soweto]] poet [[Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali]] authored a poem entitled \"The Detribalised\" in which he described the consequences of detribalization and township life in South Africa. In a review of his work by Doreen Anderson Wood, she acknowledges how \"sociologists and anthropologists have observed how detribalization and forcing mine workers into compound living [has] weakened family life in Africa, but few portray it with Mtshali's punch.\" Wood asserts that because they have been \"denied admittance into full twentieth-century life[,] the detribalized fall into a vacuum of surface sophistication with no values underpinning it.\" Mtshali's poem encapsulates the experience of an unnamed man who was \"born in [[Sophiatown]], or [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]], I am not sure, but certainly not in Soweto.\" This \"detribalized\" man, in Mtshali's perspective, did not care for politics or concern himself with the imprisonment of anti-apartheid figures like [[Robert Sobukwe]] or [[Nelson Mandela]] on [[Robben Island]], and was perhaps reflective, in Wood's words, of men who had been removed from the \"stabilizing influences of tribal life\" as a result of colonialism.<ref>Wood 1977, p. 559-560.</ref><ref>Boehmer 2010, p. 116-117.</ref>\n\n=== In the Americas ===\nRegarding the greater [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] region, scholar Roberto Cintli Rodr\u00edguez describes how the Spanish inflicted two forms of colonization upon Indigenous peoples. While the first conquest refers to the military conquest campaigns under the authority of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and other conquistadors, \"La Otra Conquista [or ''the Other Conquest''] included religiously motivated crusades to destroy all the temples, 'idols,' and books of Indigenous peoples.\" Coupled with centuries of violence, in which millions of Indigenous people were \"devastated by war, mass killings, rape, enslavement, land theft, starvation, famine, and disease,\" the Other Conquest was simultaneously facilitated by the Spanish from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries with the central objecive of destroying \"[[Maize|ma\u00edz]]-based beliefs and cultures of Indigenous peoples, ushering in a radical shift in the ''[[axis mundi]]'' or center of the universe from ma\u00edz to the Christian cross,\" with the threat of death, torture, and eternal damnation for a refusal to conform to the colonial order. Rodr\u00edguez illuminates that although outright usage of force from the church has faded, official church messages in [[Latin America]] still continue to reinforce this practice today.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez 2014, p. 6-7.</ref>\n\nSpanish colonizers established a system of \"''congregaciones'' (the congregation of peoples) and the project of ''[[Reductions|reducciones]]'' (spiritual 'reductions')\" in an effort \"to corrall Indians into missions or pueblos for the purpose of reducing or eliminating or 'killing' the souls of the Indians, creating Christians in their place.\" This method of \"spiritually reducing Indians also served to facilitate land theft,\" and was first implemented in 1546, only to be reaffirmed numerous times throughout the colonial period. In 1681, as part of the [[Laws of the Indies]], issued by the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown]] for the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|American]] and the Philippine possessions of its [[Spanish Empire|empire]], \"continued the reduction of the Indians (their instruction in the Holy Faith) 'so that they could forget the errors of their ancient rites and ceremonies'.\" The reduction policies instituted by the Spanish colonizers \"included the systemic demonization by Spanish friars of virtually all things Indigenous, particularly the people themselves, unless saved or baptized.\"<ref>Rodr\u00edguez 2014, p. 18.</ref>\n\nThe \"official Spanish practice regarding what language, indigenous or Castilian, should be employed in the evangelization effort [throughout New Spain] was often confused.\" The \"colonial aim\" was to [[Hispanicization|Hispanicize]] the Indigenous people and to forcibly separate them from identifying with their cultural practices; \"church and state officials intermittently used various decrees reiterating the official position and requiring that the Indians systematically be taught Spanish,\" such as one issued by the archbishop in [[Mexico City]] in 1717. At the same time, because many missionaries were \"more interested in trying to impart what they considered the basis of their faith to the native peoples as quickly as possible\" through Christianization, this led many to \"acquire the rudiments of the indigenous languages\" for the purposes of indoctrinating Indigenous people to become Christians.<ref>Beebe and Senkewicz 2015, p. 94.</ref>\n\n==== Brazil ====\n[[File:Caboclo by Jean-Baptiste Debret 1834.jpg|thumb|313x313px|\"Caboclo\" by Jean-Baptiste Debret ca. 1834.

Expeditions into the interior were carried out by Portuguese ''[[bandeirantes]]'', who often \"depended on Amerindians as rowers, collectors, and guides.\" Despite this relationship, ''bandeirantes'' frequently turned these exploratory crusades \"into [[Slavery in Brazil|slaving]] expeditions\" through abducting, detaining, and exploiting the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]].<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 147.</ref><ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.</ref> The expeditions also carried \"European diseases and death far into the interior\" of the region. In 1645, [[Jesuit priests]] under the leadership of [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira|Antonio Vieira]] had \"began establishing missions along the major [[Amazon River]] tributaries,\" which forcibly relocated large subsets of the Indigenous population into new colonial settlements:<blockquote>Amerindian groups were relocated into large settlements, called ''aldeias'', where their daily activities could be closely supervised, their souls could be saved, and their labor could be put to new tasks, such as raising cattle. In the ''aldeias'', natives were deprived of their tribal identity under the homogenizing influence of the missionaries. Compelled to communicate with whites and other natives in the ''lingua geral'', tribal Amerindians were gradually transformed into 'generic Indians' or ''tapuios''.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.</ref></blockquote>The term ''tapuio'' \"originally meant 'slave',\" though soon after, referred to detribalized and [[Christianization|Christianized]] Indigenous people who had assimilated into \"colonial society,\" defined as such by their place of residence and proximity to colonial society.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 54.</ref><ref>Harris 2010, p. 42-43; 306.</ref> It has been used interchangeably with ''[[caboclo]]'', recognized as a [[derogatory term]] \"equivalent to [[half-breed]]\" or \"of mixed blood,\" as well as ''carij\u00f3'', which also referred to \"detribalized Indians.\"<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 69; 147.</ref> These labels differed from ''gentio'', a similarly derogatory term which referred to unconverted and non-assimilated Indigenous people.<ref>Harris 2010, 42-43; 306.</ref><ref>MacMillan 1995, 10-11.</ref> Slave expeditions by the ''bandeirantes'' continued throughout the eighteenth century with the intention of stealing precious metals, especially gold, from the interior, which further led to \"the acquisition of land grants, official appointments, and other rewards and honors\" for white male settlers. At the same time, \"Indians seized in confrontations with colonists were used as mining, agricultural, and domestic laborers,\" while others, and especially Indigenous women, faced [[rape]] and sexual assault.<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 146-148.</ref>\n\nWhile the expanding network of Jesuit missions \"provided a measure of protection from the slavers who made annual expeditions into the interior,\" they simultaneously altered \"the mental and material bases of Amerindian culture forever.\" While ''tapuios'' were \"nominally free\" (or free in name) at the missions, they were actually \"obliged to provide labor to royal authorities and to colonists, a practice that frequently deteriorated into forced work hardly distinguishable from outright slavery.\" The ''aldeias'' also proliferated the \"spread of European diseases, such as [[whooping cough]], [[influenza]], and [[smallpox]], against which native populations had no immunity,\" which \"killed tens of thousands of Amerindians\" and pressured others to retreat deeper into the interior.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 37-39.</ref>\n\nJesuit priests, who by the mid-eighteenth century controlled \"some twelve thousand Amerindians in sixty-three Amazonian missions,\" were expelled from Brazil in 1759. This increased opportunities for the enslavement, murder, and displacement of Indigenous people by \"colonial authorities, landowners, and merchants,\" which had already been ongoing.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40.</ref> While in the mid-seventeenth century \"the Amazonian population was mainly indigenous except in the urban centers... by the middle of the eighteenth century, except for native groups that fled to remote refuge areas, the region's population consisted mostly of detribalized, subjugated ''tapuios''\"<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40.</ref> who were inserted \"into a civilized, [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] world under the auspices of their masters, resulting in the indiscriminate appropriation of native labor.\"<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 149-151.</ref> The detibalized population of Indigenous people \"were survivors or captives of raids\" for over a century and \"now lived in [[Mineiro]] towns and other localities under the tutelage of colonists.\" They were \"detribalized for diverse reasons, of various ethnic and/or geographic origins, brought to live in or born into colonial society and thereby incorporated in the social and cultural life of [[Minas Gerais]] during the eighteenth century.\"<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 150-152.</ref>\n\nNew legislation in the 1750s, sought to affirm \"the freedom of Brazil's Indians,\" which was articulated \"in a series of royal laws.\" This was only extended to Indigenous people who had been Christianized and somewhat assimilated: \"once the state 'conveyed the law of God to the barbarous nations, reducing them to the Catholic faith and to the true knowledge of His Holy Name'.\" However, it \"provided a mechanism by which Indians who migrated to towns and villages could defy colonists' attempts to keep them in bondage.\"<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 150-152.</ref> A key aspect of this was \"proving their Indigenous ancestry,\" which many detribalized people found difficult. At the same time, \"administrators sought to conceal the ethnic origin of these Indians, labeling them with names that corresponded with generic mixed-race categories like ''caboclo'' (detribalized Indian rustic), ''curiboca'' (Afro-native mestizo), and ''cabra de terra'' ('goat'; i.e. mestizo of this land), among many others.\"<blockquote>By thus engendering the \u201cinvisibility\u201d of these peoples, they created a loophole in royal legislation, since the crown did not prohibit the captivity of [[Mesti\u00e7o|mesti\u00e7os]] whose racial mixture derived in part from enslaved mothers of African descent. With this tactic, they legitimized indigenous slavery. Had it not been for the insistence of colonial Indians, resolute in setting the justice system in motion in order to guarantee the recognition of their indigenous origins, these individuals surely would have remained enslaved... That said, attempts to turn Indians back into slaves were not uncommon, and many Indians failed to evade the schemes of the most stubborn colonists.<ref>Langfur 2014, p. 154-155.</ref> </blockquote>While revolts by detribalized Indigenous people were common, following the relocation of the [[Portuguese crown|Portuguese Crown]] to Brazil in 1808, \"mission villages were destroyed, their resources seized, and inhabitants [were] pressed into forced labor.\" As the size of the white population reportedly grew, \"a new wave of military action\" was carried out against \"remaining tribal groups.\"<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 39-40.</ref> Once forcibly congregated into centralized colonial settlements, by the turn of the nineteenth century, detribalized Indigenous people \"became scattered along the rivers, streams, and lakes of the [[Amazon basin]] where they lived primarily in small family groups\" and developed sustenance strategies which \"drew heavily from the indigenous groups from whom they were descended.\" However, while \"preconquest Amerindian populations labored only for subsistence and occasional trade with neighboring tribes, the Jesuits taught the ''tapuios'' to produce commodities,\" which continued to link them into the global market by way of river traders, who \"would deliver the goods to distant world markets.\"<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42.</ref> Many ''tapuios'' or ''caboclos'' inhabited \"the same flood plains from which their ancestors had been displaced by the Portuguese\" while culturally intact and \"remaining Indian groups [had] confined themselves largely to managing inaccessible upland areas.\"<ref>MacMillan 1995, 10-11.</ref>\n\nIn 1822, as [[Independence of Brazil|Brazil declared independence]] from Portuguese colonial rule, Amazonia was integrated into the newly unstable Brazilian state. Political tensions erupted into full-scale rebellions, the largest of which was the ''[[Cabanagem]]'' revolt in [[Par\u00e1]], in which \"rebels turned with a vengeance on their landlords and patrons,\" resulting in an estimated death rate of at least thirty thousand, or one quarter of the province's population.<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42.</ref> ''Tapuios'' had been continually exploited as a \"great reserve labor force in Amazonia\" and \"as such played an important role\" in the revolt.<ref>Treece 2000, p. 79-80.</ref> Many t''apuios'' as well as \"black slaves, and other workers fled\" following the revolt \"because they were ''cabanos'' [rebels] or to escape forced labor.\"<ref>Schmink and Wood 1992, p. 41-42.</ref> Prior to the revolt, detribalized people had been \"transformed into a dispersed propertyless mass alienated both from the intact, isolated tribal groups of the interior and from the rural white population.\" European ethnographers documented the effects of detribalization on the ''tapuios'', who cited their poor treatment and lack of belonging as socially and psychologically damaging. Occupying an \"ambiguous\" social category between intact tribal groups and the white population, the \"claims and interests\" of the ''tapuios'' could not be effectively addressed by the Brazilian state, meaning they were faced with immediate \"extermination or integration. Between these two alternatives there could exist no gray area questioning the value of assimilation into white society.\"<ref>Treece 2000, p. 79-80.</ref>\n\nThe exploitation of the ''tapuios'' was documented in travel journals of European and American colonizers in the mid-nineteenth century. In ''[[Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon]]'' by [[United States Navy|US Navy]] lieutenants [[William Lewis Herndon]] and Lardner Gibbon, ''tapuios'' are referred to as \"peons\" and were described in 1849, along with \"negroes\" and \"mestizos\" by the President of the province of Par\u00e1, Jeronimo Francisco Coelho, as \"people void of civilization and education, and who exceeded in number the worthy, laborious, and industrious part of the population by more than three-quarters.\" Herndon and Gibbon affirmed that \"a better description of the origin and character of these bodies of laborers cannot be given.\" These [[Racism|racist]] perceptions held by colonizers seemingly rationalized their right to exploit the labor of these groups, which was also entwined with Christianization and the role of the colonial church: \"All the christianized Indians of the province of Par\u00e1 are registered and compelled to serve the State, either as soldiers of the ''Guarda Policial'' or as a member of 'Bodies of Laborers,' distributed among the different territorial divisions of the province.\"<ref>Herndon and Gibbon 1854, p. 256.</ref>\n\nRegarding the Brazilian province of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], Herndon and Gibbon recorded that the Brazilian government continued to fear the power of the ''tapuios'' to revolt against \"the foreigners,\" given their greater numbers as well as \"the terrible revolution of the ''Cabanos'' (serfs, people who lived in cabins) in the years from 1836 to 1840, when many [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were killed and expelled.\" As such, the President and government asserted \"that laws must be made for the control and government of the sixty-thousand ''tapuios'', who so far outnumbered the property-holders, and who are always open to the influence of the designing, the ambitious, and the wicked.\" The population of the province was recorded at \"thirty thousand inhabitants \u2013 whites and civilized Indians,\" yet Herndon and Gibbon admitted that \"no estimate can be made of the number of '''Gentios'',' or savages.\" The American lieutenants expressed their support for further colonizing the region, even advocating for United States [[Slaveholder|slaveholders]] to do so:<blockquote>I presume that the Brazilian government would impose no obstacles to the settlement of this country by any of the citizens of the United States who would choose to go there and carry their slaves; and I know that the thinking people on the Amazon would be glad to see them. The President, who is laboring for the good of the province, and sending for the chiefs of the Indian tribes for the purpose of engaging them in settlement and systematic labor, said to me, at parting 'How much I wish you could bring me a thousand of your active, industrious, and intelligent population, to set and example of labor to these people;' and others told me that they had no doubt that Brazil would give titles to vacant lands to as many as came.<ref>Herndon and Gibbon 1854, p. 268.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Mexico ====\n[[File:Cabrera 15 Coyote.jpg|thumb|292x292px|''\"De Mestizo y de India, Coyote''\" by Miguel Cabrera, ca. 1763.

Indigenous women, and in particular [[Midwife|midwives]], were targeted by the Inquisition; \"Europeans feared that women could control men, which contributed to many women being tried as [[Witch-hunts in Early Modern Europe|witches in Europe]].\" Female healers and midwives were identified by European men and the church as a threat to their power, both in Europe and in the Americas. In order to indoctrinate within Indigenous people the inferiority and \"evil\" nature of their own practices, the Inquisition \"used repression of entire families and communities, torture, death, indentured servitude, and even prison\" as well as \"public displays of power to repress Indigenous worldviews.\" As this continued throughout Spanish colonial rule \"over time, many Indigenous practices became associated with acts of the devil,\" which conditioned Mexican people to reject Indigenous ways of knowing. \"Some Native leaders argue that such a conditioning occurs via sermons and faith activities,\" which continue today, and eventually led \"to the de-Indianization of Mexicans.\"<ref>Gonzalez 2012, p. 76-78.</ref>\n\nIn urban centers, spatial segregation between \"Indians\" and Spaniards, or ''peninsulares'', was instituted by the colonial order, to separate the colonized from the colonizers.''<ref name=\":1\">Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 42-48.</ref>'' Because the colony of [[New Spain]] was \"built upon the exploitation of the work force and the agricultural production of the Indians, particularly in the regions of Mesoamerica,\" it became \"fundamental for the Colonial regime to define clear ethnic boundaries between Indians and non-Indians.\" However, the boundaries between the ethnic categories of the colonized in colonial Mexico were \"relatively flexible in practice\" as the colonial structure was primarily concentrated on maintaining the \"hierarchical superiority of the Spaniards\" above all else.<ref>Linares 2009, p. 54-55.</ref> There were important distinctions between \"rich mestizos,\" who held structural power in Mexico historically<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 94.</ref> and upheld the Westernization plan introduced by European invaders, from poor or working-class rural and urban mestizos.<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. xv-xvi.</ref> <blockquote>In spite of the elaborate attempts to classify the ''castas'' and assign to each one [individual] a clear position in the stratified order of colonial society, those who were neither Spaniards (''[[Peninsulars|penninsulares]]'' or ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'') nor Indians never found precise placement in a society that rested on the rigid dual order of colonized and colonizers. Even though the ''castas'' were formally defined by the percentage of different blood they carried \u2013 American, African, and European \u2013 in reality it was social criteria, not biological, that defined the different groups. Undoubtedly, a large number of racial mestizos who were born and grew up in Indian communities were considered Indians. In the same way, many racially pure Indians passed for Mestizos when they left their communities of origin and became serfs or free laborers. Some mestizos were taken for [[Creoles of color|creoles]], and the passage from one group to the other had less to do with relative \"purity of blood\" than with other social factors, among which wealth was especially important.<ref>Bonfil Batalla 1996, p. 79.</ref></blockquote>After the successful [[Mexican War of Independence]] in 1821, \"ethnic inequality continued, as the ''[[Criollo people#In Mexico|criollos]]'', i.e. persons of Spanish descent born in the Americas, became the dominant group of the new nation.\" At the time, a minority of the country spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]], yet it was established as \"the [[official language]] of the nation.\" Citizenship in Mexico became \"synonymous with [[Western culture]] and thus excluded Indians, [[Black people|Blacks]], and other non-European groups unless they renounced their supposedly 'backward' and 'inferior' cultures.\" Through the implementation of these homogenizing practices, \"''criollos'' hoped that the majority of Indians and Blacks in Mexico would eventually be dissolved by European immigrants and the nation would be adequately whitened.\" The ''criollo'' elite of the new Mexican nation also instituted a widespread [[Land grabbing|land grab]] of Indigenous territory throughout the country. While during the Spanish colonial period, the government had \"recognized the collective property of Indigenous communities, since it was interested in extracting the surplus produced by Indian peasants,\" following independence, \"individual property became the only legally recognized form of [[land tenure]], according to the supposedly universal principle of [[Individualism|Liberal individualism]], and therefore Indigenous communities thus lost legal title to their holdings.\"<ref>Linares 2009, p. 55-56.</ref>\n\nThe Mexican government \"used armed force to suppress Indian resistance, and in cases where it was successful, Indian lands were distributed and their communities were destroyed.\" In the 1820s, the government instituted a [[General Colonization Law]] which \"paid non-Indians to take up residence in Indian country and work the land... based on the assumption that Indians would recognize and choose to emulate the virtues of 'civilization' once they had been exposed to them.\" This method was implemented throughout the entire country. When armed force and colonization failed, \"the Mexican government used a policy of deportation from tribal homelands to other parts of Mexico.\" While these methods were devastating to maintaining the identities and communities of Indigenous peoples in Mexico, \"it was not governmental policy that led to the detribalization and assimilation of most Mexican Indians.\" While \"some Indian communities were able to maintain their existence, most were broken up as hundreds of Indians were slowly forced off their land and into Mexican towns, mining communities, and ranches as laborers.\"<ref>Griffin-Pierce 2015, p. 25-26.</ref>\n\nIn 1883, the Mexican government passed the Land Law Act, which \"affected thousands of small-scale and detribalized Indian communities,\" as noted by legal scholar Martha Menchaca. A few years after the law's passage, which required \"all public lands be surveyed for the purpose of development,\" the ruling class of Mexico and foreign corporations owned approximately \"one-fifth of Mexico's total land mass, or 68 million acres of land.\" Once the land was \"surveyed,\" \"Mexican farmers had to prove legal ownership\" and the courts often \"upheld the corporations' surveys,\" which caused \"many poor farmers... to migrate north into Texas, a task made easier by the railroad infrastructure.\" The [[Lerdo law|Lerdo Law]] of 1856, which planned to provide \"each family... part of the tribe's communal holdings\" through privatization, had \"stripped the tribal councils of their legal authority over their community's land,\" and since [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] died in the midst of its implementation, judges now \"held the power to interpret property law and decide to support the surveying companies or recognize that the Lerdo Law had been improperly executed.\" As a result, \"Indians who heeded President Ju\u00e1rez's orders and privatized their holdings but failed to disband their tribal councils could argue in court that although they were not given deeds, the Spanish land grant titles [from the colonial period] were still valid since they were not detribalized communities.\" On the other hand, \"Indians who had disbanded their councils had no legal recourse because they were detribalized Indians.\" In the latter case, if detribalized peoples \"managed not to get evicted from their lands, the main option left was to remain in their homes and become [[Tenant farmer|tenant farmers]].\" However, many people \"chose to join the northern migration\" and \"some detribalized Indians began a journey that would eventually transform them into U.S. citizens\" as a result.<ref>Menchaca 2011, p. 91-93.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, well-over 100,000 Mexicans had migrated north into the southwestern United States, both as a result of the Mexican government's land theft through the Land Law Act and the labor shortage in the United States following the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 and the unoffocial \"[[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Gentlemen's Agreement]]\" with [[Japan]] in 1907. As a result, many employers in the southwest opened contracting opportunities in border cities such as [[El Paso, Texas]]. Although the official U.S. immigration policy at the time prohibited contractual labor outside the United States, employers hired agents to travel to the interior of Mexico and convince rural and urban Mexican citizens that high wages and new job opportunities were available in the United States. Following the loss of land, low wages, and instability throughout the Mexican countryside, many poor Mexican people, particularly from the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Zacatecas]], and [[Michoac\u00e1n]], migrated north to initially become railroad workers, laying track for low pay. A 1909 report concluded that Mexican laborers did the majority of the railway work in Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, and [[southern California]]. Following the railway work, the majority of Mexican laborers were employed in the agricultural sector, working on cotton fields in Texas, sugar beet farms in northern Colorado, and citrus orchards in California, as well as mines throughout the southwest. By 1920, the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States was over 222,000, the majority of whom had previously been made landless by the Mexican government or worked on rural ranches.<ref>Werner 2001, p. 447.</ref>\n\nThis massive land grab in the nineteenth century soon sparked a series of peasant revolts throughout Mexico \"from the 1840s to the [[Mexican Revolution|Mexican revolution of 1910]].\" Scholar [[Florencia Mallon]] has proposed that, in response, Indigenous communities developed \"their own popular Liberalism, one that recognized communal institutions and property, and that defined citizenship in terms that did not exclude culturally different groups.\" In the latter half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, with the increasing development of the national capitalist economy and [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], \"Indigenous communities were forced to migrate to the cities\" and \"large farms.\" As a result of that process, many became detribalized as they \"adopted Spanish as their main language and abandoned their traditional sense of ethnic identity, shifting their allegiance to the national identity being constructed by the [Mexican] state.\" It was in this process that \"entire [Indigenous] communities also changed their language, and their ethnic self-identification, from Indian to Mestizo.\" This is reflective in statistics of the era. While in 1808, Indians and Mestizos were estimated to comprise 60% and 23% of the population respectively, by 1885 this was 38% and 43%, and by 1921 this was 29% and 59%. From 1808 to 1921, it is estimated that approximately 3 million people experienced this cultural and ethnic transformation from Indian to Mestizo, which was about 1/3rd or 1/4th of the entire population of the country at the time.<ref>Linares 2009, p. 56-57.</ref>\n\nIn the midst of this detribalization and de-Indianization process in Mexico, the nationalist ideology of \"mestizaje\" was formulated \"by intellectuals closely linked to the State\" in the late nineteenth century.<ref>Linares 2009, p. 58.</ref> The Mexican government instituted national policies \"aimed at achieving the racial and cultural homogenization of the population under the Mestizo category.\"<ref>Linares 2009, p. 53.</ref> Mexican nationalist ideologies now asserted that the country was a \"mestizo society\" which harmoniously combined the cultures of Indigenous peoples and Europeans. In reality, while the majority of \"popular classes and sectors,\" including traditional rural communities and urban ''barrios'', neighborhoods, and towns throughout Mexico, had \"Indian origins\" which were \"often very recent,\" the \"upper-class sectors\" were \"derived more or less directly from the Spanish colonizers\" and tended \"to conserve non-Indian cultural forms.\"''<ref name=\":1\" />'' Through mestizaje and [[Indigenismo in Mexico|Indigenismo]], mestizos were \"supposed to be proud of their Indian 'past', embodied in the massive constructions and the works of art of their [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] 'ancestors', while embracing the forward-looking and Modern culture of the White races of the world\" \u2013 \"a process of whitening the Indians, but not of darkening the Whites.\"<ref>Linares 2009, p. 58.</ref> Throughout the twentieth century, there remained a concerted effort by the Mexican government to integrate Indigenous people into Mestizo society.

As historian Helen C. Rountree documents, \"the English wished to detribalize the [[Powhatan|Powhatans]]\" and implemented various methods to \"civilize\" them and otherwise incorporate detribalized persons into colonial society. Until 1691, detribalized Indigenous people could \"enter the middle- or lower- levels of English society\" through interracial marriage. Following the prohibition of interracial marriage, \"Indians were expected to join the lowest, non-white ranks.\" There is evidence that an Indigenous person who was perceived as detribalized had greater claims to land rights, exemplified via the case of Edward Gunstocker, whose land rights were perceived as valid by American colonial courts because he was detribalized.<ref name=\":15\">Rountree 1996, p. 135-136.</ref>\n\nBy the second half of the seventeenth century, the English in the Virginia colony attempted to \"convert the Powhatans culturally\" through permitting them to engage in a form of waged labor under the watchful eyes of English employers with the intention of \"civilizing them and making them Christians.\" Indigenous children were also taken from parents to become \"servants\" for the English, who assured parents that they would be treated well and not as slaves. However, as noted by Rountree, \"the English did not draw a clear distinction between 'servants' (i.e., domestic employees) and slaves, either for Indians or for Africans.\" While few Indigenous people accepted these offers willingly in the early part of the seventeenth century, pressures from colonists increased, especially after Indigenous people were progressively impoverished following the stealing of land and effects of the emerging colonial economic system.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nDetribalization was used by the state governments in the northeastern region of [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Rhode Island]] in the nineteenth century to refer to the deliberate process of terminating relationships between Indigenous peoples and their Indian nations in the debate over [[List of federally recognized tribes in the United States|federal recognition]].

Historians Deborah Lawrence and Jon Lawrence note that a new \"form of slavery developed whereby Indians who were obtained by Hispanics through war or trade were taken into Spanish households as servants.\" These \"detribalized Indian captives\" were referred to as [[Gen\u00edzaro|''gen\u00edzaros'']]  and eventually \"managed to merge into the larger society over generations.\"<ref>Lawrence and Lawrence 2016, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the population of detribalized people in [[New Mexico]] increased, particularly of the ''gen\u00edzaros'', who were now commonly held in servitude throughout before being released upon Christianization or adulthood. This increase was largely due to the prevailing \"trade of human captives\" which was carried out throughout the region. As noted by historian [[Lisbeth Haas]], the Spanish had \"granted ''gen\u00edzaros'' and lower-status settlers land throughout the eighteenth century in order to create buffer zones between nomadic raiding and the colonial towns, including those of Pueblo Indians, such as [[Santo Domingo Pueblo|Santo Domingo]] and [[Ysleta, El Paso, Texas|Ysleta]].\" Neighboring tribes including the [[Navajo]] and [[Comanche]] participated in the servant and slave trade of detribalized people and others at trade fairs in [[Abiqui\u00fa, New Mexico|Abiquiu]] and Taos Pueblo until the mid-nineteenth century.<ref>Haas 2014, p. 174.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] and the ratification of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|Treaty of Guadalupe]], the U.S. government quickly violated its agreement and failed to acknowledge the citizenship stipulation it had agreed to under the treaty. As noted by scholar [[Martha Menchaca]], the U.S. government instead began a process of [[racialization]] which ascribed to Mexicans different legal rights on the basis of race.\" While \"Mexicans who were [[Mexicans of European descent|white]] were given full citizenship,\" mestizos, Christianized Indians, and ''[[Afro-Mexicans|afromexicanos]]'' (mixed race people of African descent) were accorded inferior legal rights.\" While prior to the Mexican-American War, \"Mexico had extended citizenship to all people living in Mexican territory irrespective of race,\" including the \"right to vote, run for office, enter any profession, transact business with whomever one chose, marry freely with no racial restrictions, and obtain title to land grants,\" following American occupation, a new racial system was imposed upon the conquered territories of the Southwest.<ref name=\":2\">Menchaca 2011, p. 19-20.</ref>\n\nThe federal government provided the various state governments of the ceded territories \"the right to decide which Mexicans would be given citizenship.\" In Texas, citizenship was only extended to Mexicans \"as long as they were not of black descent.\" At the same time, \"detribalized Christian Indians who paid taxes and had adopted the lifestyle of Mexicans were also given citizenship but with limited rights,\" being excluded from the right to vote, and conditional property rights, only \"if they could prove that they spoke Spanish and that their ancestors had been legally emancipated from the Spanish missions.\" However, while the Mexican-controlled [[New Mexico Legislature|New Mexico legislature]] (which had authority over the territory of Arizona at the time) \"extended citizenship to all former citizens of Mexico\" in 1851, the United States congress quickly \"rescinded this decree\" and denied Black and Indigenous people citizenship in 1853. Soon after Arizona was established as a separate entity in 1863, \"its first legislative assembly voted to reserve citizenship for white males.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> When deciding whether to grant Mexicans of ''mestizo'' ancestry rights afforded to white or Indigenous peoples, \"most government officials argued that Mexicans of predominately Indian descent should be extended the same legal status as the detribalized American Indians.\" [[Anglo-Americans|Anglo-American]] legislatures disenfranchised many Mexican people throughout the Southwest by arguing that they were of Indigenous descent and should therefore not be granted the rights and privileges of white American citizens.<ref>Menchaca 1998, p. 388.</ref>\n\nPeople of Indigenous descent were also discriminated against based on their affiliations, as \"Spanish-speaking ''mestizos'' who resided in the main colonial towns\" were \"assumed to be Mexican,\" making them \"exempt from Indian policies.\" Indigenous groups who managed to not be displaced or \"subdued by the Spanish and Mexican governments were placed on reservations or forcibly driven out of the Southwest\" by American settlers and the military. If any Indigenous people refused to submit to the American occupiers, they would be \"politically-labeled [as] warlike\" which could serve as a justification for their imprisonment or murder by the state. Those groups who were considered peaceful \"were visited by an agent of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) to determine if they should be extended the legal rights of Mexican ''mestizos''\" in central colonial settlements. Ultimately, the BIA granted these rights to \"the [[Coahuiltecan]] and [[Apache]] in Texas, the [[Puebloans|Pueblos in New Mexico]], [[Pima people|Pima Indians]] of the Santa Cruz and San Pedro valleys in [[Arizona]], and [[Chumash people|Chumash]], [[Tongva|Garbieleno]], [[Luise\u00f1o|Luiseno]], and groups of [[Quechan|Yuma Indians]] in [[California]].\"<ref name=\":3\">Menchaca 2011, p. 20-21.</ref><blockquote>Once the legislature had made their decisions, many Indian villages were relocated onto reservations and some were allowed to remain in their village with their property respected (e.g. the Pueblo), but the majority had their lands confiscated and were forced to move.

With the \"final [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist]] conquest of the 'Kazakh' steppe, and the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolishment of serfdom]] in the Empire in 1861,\" the scale of \"Russian peasant migration into northern Central Asia increased dramatically.\" Newly emancipated [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Slavs|Slavic]] serfs sought territory in [[Siberia]] and Central Asia in hopes \"of acquiring a free plot of land\" to escape their previous condition of \"extreme poverty and starvation.\" Upper class Tsarist officials sought to prevent this migration, \"concerned with a possible decrease in the labour force in European Russia,\" but did so with little success. By the 1890s, in order to alleviate \"rising peasant unrest\" in European Russian cities such as [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], officials encouraged \"hundreds of thousands of Slavic peasants to resettle in Central Asia, especially on the territories of present-day [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\"<ref>Ubiria 2015, p. 58.</ref>\n\nIn the 1890s and early 1900s, the Russian Empire sent \"several government commissions\" to survey the \"quantity of [[arable land]]\" for \"prospective settlers,\" which concluded that \"the steppe nomads possessed surplus land, which could be allocated to Slavic settlers.\" The \"appropriation of 'Kazakh' surplus land\" was perceived by officials as \"legally justifiable\" following \"the [[Kazakh Khanate|'Kazakh' Khans]] submission to the Russian throne\" which transferred control over their land to \"the property of the Russian monarch.\" The migration of Slavic settlers into Central Asia peaked between 1906 and 1912, \"when approximately 1.5 million new Slav migrants poured into the region.\" By 1916, it was estimated that there were 3 million European settlers in the region. Since settlers were privileged by the Russian Empire, they were \"given larger and more fertile tracts of land\" while \"farming plots allocated to [Kazakhs] were often useless for cultivation.\" The loss of access to the fertile lands was \"a devastating blow to the 'Kazakh' nomadic economy\" and forced many Kazakhs \"to adapt to the [[sedentary lifestyle]], or to move southward in search of new grazing lands for their herds.\"<ref>Ubiria 2015, p. 58-59.</ref>\n\nHowever, \"the sedentarization of some 'Kazakhs' ... did not always necessarily lead to their detribalization, since most of the newly established 'Kazakh' villages were settled by ex-nomads deriving from the same clan and tribal origin.\" As such, many Kazakhs were able to retain their immediate clan and tribal identities. At the same time, the \"pan-horde identities,\" which had previously existed prior to Russian colonization, were \"significantly weakened with the abolition of the hordes, since no alternative institution remained to sustain them.\" Overall, the influx of Slavic settlers changed \"the demographic structure of the region,\" resulting in the \"emergence of two broad and distinct cultural groups,\" the Slavic settlers who were \"primarily followers of the [[Orthodox Christians|Orthodox Christian]] faith\" and the [[Muslims|Muslim]] Kazakhs, which included both \"pastoral nomads and newly sedentarized farmers\" and the related [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]] ethnic groups, who were speakers of Kazakh dialects and \"physically exhibit[ed] [[Mongoloid]] features.\"<ref>Ubiria 2015, p. 59.</ref>\n\nTsarist colonial policies \"privileged the Slavic settlers over the steppe nomads\" and segregated the Kazakhs and other steppe peoples as \"belonging to the inferior ''[[inorodtsy]]'' [\"uncivilized\"] category.\" This exacerbated sociocultural tensions between the two groups, as the Slav population became viewed as \"agents of the Tsarist colonialism, and hence equally responsible for their socio-economic problems.\" These tensions and oppression by the Russian Empire eventually culminated in the [[Central Asian revolt of 1916|1916 revolt in Central Asia]].<ref>Ubiria 2015, p. 59-60.</ref> Following the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, the Kazakhs were widely dispersed and had been \"battered in the civil war\" with the Slavic settlers which had preceded \"the establishment of [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] control.\" The \"surviving clans, villages, and ''auls'' (migratory groups) reconstituted themselves as Soviets and tried to carry on as before,\" although new policies were quickly imposed upon them.<ref name=\":6\">Findley 2004, p. 192.</ref>\n\nSimilar to European colonial efforts in Africa, Soviet nationality policy initially \"emphasized '[[indigenization]]' of the institutions of local government.\" However, while in Africa, European powers instituted these policies to prevent working-class consciousness and to control the majority of Africans as peasant laborers for their empires, the fundamental purpose of Soviet indigenization policies were \"precisely the opposite of the European policy of colonial indigenization in Africa.\" In this sense, \"Soviet policy was not designed to preserve 'traditional' content, but to replace it.\" The goal was not to ensure that a \"good [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]]\" remained a \"good Uzbek,\" as European powers had believed of the \"good African,\" but to \"make him a good 'European' in the sense that Europeans were modern and most Uzbeks were not.\" As a result of this Soviet ideology toward the colonized peoples of Central Asia, \"plenty of smashing of traditional institutions was done by the Soviet state in the name of [[Socialism|socialist]] transformation,\" which resulted in detribalization.<ref name=\":5\">Blitstein 2006, p. 288.</ref>\n\nThis was done through education policies, which were implemented through a \"universal Soviet curriculum\" instituted in the same manner \"regardless of the pupil's ethnic identity.\" The \"economic and political logic\" of this curriculum was to create \"a loyal, modern, interchangeable population suitable for rapid industrial development.\" While colonial governmental policy in Africa did not seek to employ a \"civilizing mission\" for fear of creating an urbanized \"detribalized\" population of workers who may rebel against the colonial order, the Soviets attempted to \"ultimately transform and integrate all peoples into one political community.\" Progress was notably perceived as slow by the Soviets in Central Asia, as \"[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] authorities consistently bemoaned the slow process of working-class formation among the Central Asian peoples\" and \"relatively low numbers of Central Asians in institutions of higher education in the late 1930s and 1940s\" was a \"sore point for a regime preoccupied with training 'nationality cadres.'\"<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nBy the \"mid-to-late 1930s,\" the Soviets had abandoned these nationality policies as a response to \"Russian resentment and rising non-Russian nationalism, itself a consequence of the indigenization policies.\" This resulted in new policies which asserted \"the reemergence of the Russians\" and curtailed the usage of \"non-Russian languages in administration\" while simultaneously increasing \"repression of ethnic diasporas and the adoption of mandatory [[Russian language|Russian]]-language instruction,\" exemplifying how \"new elements in Soviet nationality policy moved in the direction along the lines of its neighbors to the west\" during the [[interwar period]]. Resistance to these new policies emerged \"in [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Germans|German]] villages in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] and [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belorussian]] border regions and [the Soviets] took violent measures against those communities,\" such as through \"selective deportation targeting entire villages of Germans and Poles\"; the \"deportation of the [[Koryo-saram|Soviet Korean]] population to Central Asia would soon follow.\"<ref>Blitstein 2006, p. 288-289.</ref>\n\nFollowing decades of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] control in the twentieth century, \"the party had still failed to undermine indigenous religious and clan authority\" throughout much of Central Asia.

During the construction of the [[Hijaz Railway]], \"the tribes in the area refused to pay taxes or to contribute conscripts to the army, and at times, came out in open rebellion against central authorities.\" The alliance \"brought political recognition\" to Abdallah's regime and \"helped in detribalization\" of the region through colonial military control: \"to centralize authority, Transjordan had to create a viable bureaucracy and army, build infrastructure, quell internal revolts, repel external aggression, and detribalize the desert.\"<ref>Piro 1998, p. 95.</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\nAs an extension of European colonialism and Westernization, towns and urban centers in [[Saudi Arabia]] housed two different worlds, in which \"the 'native' town exists alongside a 'Western' town.\" In former colonies throughout the [[greater Middle East]], a second colonial city was often simply constructed next to the \"old town\" as part of the colonial order. Cities in Saudi Arabia such as [[Riyadh]], [[Jeddah]], and [[Dammam]] exemplified this type of colonial configuration in the 20th century. Westerners segregated themselves from those in the \"native\" town centers and lived together \"in more or less discreet and hermetically sealed compounds.\" It was in this urbanized setting that \"the modernization and individualization of Saudi society unfolded\" at a rapid pace, which broke down \"traditional social structures\" and \"served to detribalize society, to make the family cell its basic unit, and finally to split the family itself into conjugal micro-elements.\" The [[unification of Saudi Arabia]], \"was in every respect not only a victory of town over desert but ''a victory of the family over the tribe''.\" The increasing \"urbanization of Arabia therefore also corresponded to a sedentarization or detribalization of the [[Nomad|nomads]],\" accompanied by the Western family-centered model.

Indigenous groups which had survived were \"either institutionalized on [[Aboriginal reserve|government]] or [[:Category:Australian Aboriginal missions|mission settlements]] or allowed to form camps on the fringes of upcountry towns, pastoral properties, farms, and mines, which were usually tucked away well out of sight of the busier centers of colonial life.\" By the 1880s, \"the European populace became predominantly urban\", which increasingly divided most European settlers from the Indigenous people.<ref name=\":03\">Stanner 2011, p. 151-152.</ref>\n\nRacist perceptions of the Indigenous people were rampant throughout the [[European Australian]] population by the end of the nineteenth century as \"derision and contempt expressed in the mid-century years deepened toward a malevolent vilification\".

Those who were categorized as \"semicivilized\" and \"uncivilized\" were deemed to be unfit for integration into colonial society without detribalization. For the \"semicivilized\" and \"uncivilized\", the Australian government \"appeared to favor something like [[apartheid]] in inviolable reserves as an appropriate way of dealing with [them] but suggested that this should be done as far as possible without damage to the needs of employers of Aboriginal labor\".

According to Australian anthropologist [[A. P. Elkin]], \"European society was endeavoring to turn Aboriginal people into individualists\" by teaching them the \"''moral'' value of work\". He notes how European-Australian pastoralists forced \"Aboriginals living on their stations to perform some sort of token labor before they hand them their government social welfare check,\" viewed Indigenous children as undisciplined, and perceived their ownership over the land as justifiable based on their alleged superior morality.

As many people throughout the world have been detached through the historical and contemporary efforts of colonizers and the effects of colonialism, the current role and relationship of detribalized peoples as they relate to their communities of origin is complex. Reconnection with Indigenous knowledge systems can be an important element \"for Indigenous or detribalized people who were interrupted from the knowledge contained within\" their culture(s) of origin.<ref>Gonzalez 2012, p. 87.</ref> \n\nCentral to this relationship is protecting traditional ways of being, since \"what distinguishes the Indigenous struggle for self-determination from others is their collective effort to protect the rights of their peoples to live in accordance with traditional ways.\" Indigenous communities simultaneously \"resist the kind of essentialism that recognizes only one way of being\" while also working \"to retain a vast constellation of distinct traditions that serve as the defining characteristics of tribal life.\" Therefore, \"regardless of how any individual Indigenous person chooses\" to live their life, it is known in Indigenous communities that \"they are responsible for protecting the right to live according to ancestral ways,\" since, according to scholars such as [[Vine Deloria Jr.]], it has been \"the allegiance to traditional knowledge that has protected American Indians from annihilation and absorption in the democratic mainstream.\"<ref name=\":8\">Grande 2015, p. 240.</ref><blockquote>This connection to \"tradition\" determines that while the project of decolonization requires the histories and experiences of nontribal, detribalized, and \"mixed-blood\" peoples to be theorized as an integral part of the Indigenous diaspora, it must also operate to sustain and reinvigorate the life-ways of tribal peoples still among us.

Estrada has discussed how \"the overarching structures of capitalist white (hetero)sexism,\" including higher levels of [[criminalization]] directed toward Chicanos, has proliferated \"further homophobia as Mexican Indian youth increasingly battle the myths and realities of rape by adopting [[hypermasculine]] personas that can include sexual violence directed at others.\" Not only does this constrict \"the formation of a balanced Indigenous sexuality for anyone[,] but especially... for those who do identify themselves as gay, queer, ''joto'', bisexual, [or] two-spiritied, [etc.]\" to reject the \"[[Judeo-Christian]] mandates against homosexuality that are not native to their own ways,\" recognzing that many precolonial Indigenous societies accepted homosexuality openly.<ref>Estrada 2002, p. 43.</ref>\n\nRoberto Cintli Rodr\u00edguez questions how and why \"peoples who are clearly red or brown and undeniably Indigenous to this continent have allowed ourselves, historically, to be framed by beaurecrats and the courts, by politicians, scholars, and the media as alien, illegal, and less than human.\"<ref>Rodr\u00edguez 2014, p. xx-xxi.</ref> Academic In\u00e9s Hern\u00e1ndez-\u00c1vila has reflected on the potential for Chicanx people to reconnect with their ancestry as a source of power for creating global change: \"The day each mestiza/[[mestizo]] truly searches for and finds her/his roots, respectfully and humbly, and furthermore validates those peoples who still maintain their identity as original peoples of this continent of America, North, Central, and South- on that day we will be radical and much more capable of transforming our world, our universe, and our lives.\"<ref>Estrada 2002, p. 55.</ref>\n\n=== Native Americans ===\n{{Main articles|Urban Native American|Pan-Indianism}}\n[[File:LLTC 2009 NSTI Aerial Shot.jpg|thumb|269x269px|[[Leech Lake Tribal College]]]]\n[[American Indian boarding schools]], which were operational throughout the United States from the late nineteenth century until 1973, attempted to compel detribalization by forcibly instructing Indigenous children to abandon their \"tribal languages and traditions,\" which resulted in cross-generational trauma and detachment from community;<ref name=\":9\">Leforestier 2016, p. 59-61.</ref> \"detribalization was achieved in many ways like cutting the children's hair, giving them clothes typically worn by white people, forbidding them to speak their native languae, giving them a new American name, and, most of all, requiring them to speak English only.\"<ref>Leforestier 2016, p. 66.</ref> \n\nSince \"the relationship between parents and children was often broken because of long separation\" forced upon Indigenous families, so was the \"transmission of cultural and traditional knowledge.\" However, while the boarding schools were undeniably detrimental to Native Americans, their efforts to assimilate and erase tribal identities through forced \"education\" were unfulfilled, since \"instead of replacing their students' Indian identity with an American one as planned, the schools reinforced it while creating a [[Pan-Indianism|pan-Indian]] identity alongside other tribal identities.\" The emergence of pan-Indianism as an effect of the off-reservation boarding schools unified Native American resistance to colonialism and served as an important \"tool for future unity and cohesion among Indians.\"<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nNative Americans have since resisted further detribalization through the institution of [[Tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges]] and vocational education programs which do not adopt \"an assimilationist or a detribalization approach\" but rather function in encouraging \"revitalization, as a retribalization process serving Indian communities and their members.\" Retribalization may function as a means of perpetuating \"the development, and the revitalization of tribal linguistic and cultural specificities through educational programs.\" Education at tribal colleges has meant that Native Americans are able to retribalize by learning \"about their culture and reacquire their tribal identity, which had been lost, repressed, or put aside\" while also reconnecting with their communities of origin.<ref>Leforestier 2016, p. 66-67.</ref>\n\n[[Urban Indian|Urban Native Americans]] have been increasingly re-identifying with their nation(s) of origin as a form of empowerment and self-understanding. Transferring from a \"generic\" or pan-Indian identification to their tribal identification of origin encapsulates this process; In this instance, \"Indian identity\" may operate as a \"necessary antecedent\" to \"tribal identity and involvement.\" It is common in \"urban Indian communities\" to take an ideological path \"from [[anomie]] to community and from community to tribe.\" In this sense and in the contemporary context, \"Indian people growing up in a city, always aware and respectful of tribal affiliation, may look first to a positive Indian identity, supported by connection with Indian organizations and community, and, from that base, move forward to a real connection with a tribe, often selecting among the several which comprise their heritage.\"<ref>Straus and Valentino 1998, p. 103-115.</ref>\n\n=== \"Ethnic Fraud\" controversy ===\n{{further|Native American identity|Symbolic ethnicity|Ethnic option}}\nIn the United States, primarily white [[European Americans]] have claimed distant, usually, [[Cherokee]] ancestry, despite nonexistent, uncertain, or \"thin\" connections, sometimes via [[Cherokee heritage groups]], which has been a subject of controversy. As scholar [[Kim TallBear]] notes, the tribal or ethnic groups which are often targeted by \"race shifters\" or \"whites seeking Native American identity\" are those which have acknowledged \"histories of extensive '[[Admixture (genetics)|admixture]],' as geneticists would call it, with non-Native peoples,\" which has left these groups vulnerable \"because 'Cherokeenees seems open to whiteness in ways that Navajoness [for example] does not. ... Cherokeeness is an ideal destination for race-shifting because the tribe has a history of cultural adoption, tribal [[exogamy]], and relatively open standards of tribal citizenship.'\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 132-133.</ref> The \"Cherokee princess\" phenomenon exemplifies an aspect of this form of [[Ethnic fraud#Passing as indigenous Americans|ethnic fraud]]. [[Lakota people|Lakota]] journalist [[Tim Giago]] has humorously reflected on this matter as follows:<blockquote>Good heavens! We (Indians) have heard it so many times in our lives. A white man or woman approaches (this usually happens after I have given a speech) and says, \"My great grandmother was a Cherokee princess.\" Never a Cherokee prince, but always a princess. I suppose that is because none of these descendants of royalty wish to admit that their great grandmothers had an affair with a Cherokee male. Heaven forbid that a nice young white lady would ever cast an eye about an Indian man.<ref>Justice 2006, p. 222.</ref></blockquote>Because of federally-imposed qualifications of tribal enrollment, in the form of [[Blood quantum laws|blood-quantum laws]], tribal citizenship since the 20th century has been complicated by \"dominant cultural notions of race,\" which have \"pushed or been pushed against tribal peoples' own ideas of belonging and citizenship.\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 63-64.</ref> DNA tests or \"[[Genetic ancestry test|genetic-ancestry tests]]\" are increasingly becoming an issue for tribes as well. In 2010, several tribes reported at a \"national tribal enrollment conference\" that \"they had received enrollment applications with commercially purchased genetic-ancestry test results included,\" despite the fact that \"federally recognized tribes do not accept genetic-ancestry results as appropriate documentation for enrollment and do not advise applicants to submit such documentation.\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 65-66.</ref>\n\nSome individuals have used DNA tests in this manner to claim [[Minority group|minority]] status in the United States for their own personal benefit. There is \"anecdotal evidence\" that some \"applicants to [[Ivy League]] and other top-ranked schools who want an affirmative-action leg up in competitive admissions processes have used DNA tests to back up their personal decisions to self-identify as racial or ethnic minorities.\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 68.</ref> In 2019, \"contractors with white ancestry got $300 million\" for claiming to be Cherokee despite nonexistent evidence supporting their claims. \"12 of the 14 business owners involved claimed membership in one of three self-described Cherokee groups,\" the Northern Cherokee Nation, the Western Cherokee Nation of Arkansas and Missouri, and the [[Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory]], all of which remain federally unrecognized and openly opposed by the Cherokee Nation and the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-na-cherokee-minority-contracts-20190626-story.html|title=Claiming to be Cherokee, contractors with white ancestry got $300 million|last=Elmahrek|first=Adam|last2=Pringle|first2=Paul|date=26 June 2019|website=LA Times|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, \"tribal communities sometimes feel they are under assault by people with tenuous or nonexistent connections to their communities yet who want access to cultural knowledge or to cultural sites for personal identity exploration and sometimes for profit.\" Some have called for \"a more '[[decolonized]]' tribal enrollment based on social- and cultural-competence criteria (such as doing community service on [[Indian reservation|reservations]] or in historic homelands; knowing the tribal history, culture, and politics; knowing the tribal language; taking an oath of allegiance to the tribal nation; and proving that one is of 'good character according to the tribe's traditional code of morality'), used alone or in conjunction with more liberal blood rules.\" However, these solutions have also been criticized by some as \"overly idealistic\" \u2013 \"the fear is that the floodgates would fly open with the possibility of cultural conversion.\"<ref>TallBear 2013, p. 60-61.</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n*Anzald\u00faa, Gloria E.

This is in contrast to delivery through traditional [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]], [[Satellite television|satellite]], and [[Cable television|cable]] television formats. Unlike [[download]]ed media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as [[streaming media]].\n\nAlthough IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to [[streaming television|television streamed]] from the [[Internet]] ([[Internet television]]). IPTV is widely deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed access channels into end-user premises via [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]]. IPTV is also used for media delivery around corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., [[ETSI|European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\nIPTV services may be classified into [[live television]] and live media, with or without related interactivity; [[time shifting]] of media, e.g., [[catch-up TV]] (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning); and [[video on demand]] (VOD) which involves browsing and viewing items of a media catalogue.\n\n==Definition==\nHistorically, many different definitions of IPTV have appeared, including elementary streams{{clarify|date=February 2018}} over IP networks, [[MPEG transport stream]]s over IP networks and a number of proprietary systems. One official definition approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] focus group on IPTV (ITU-T FG IPTV) is:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as multimedia services such as television/video/audio/text/graphics/data delivered over IP based networks managed to provide the required level of quality of service and experience, security, interactivity and reliability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |work=ITU-T Newslog |date=27 October 2006 |title=IPTV Standardization on Track Say Industry Experts |access-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916031736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |archive-date=16 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother definition of IPTV, relating to the telecommunications industry, is the one given by [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) IPTV Exploratory Group in 2005:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as the secure and reliable delivery to subscribers of entertainment video and related services.  These services may include, for example, Live TV, Video On Demand (VOD) and [[Interactive television|Interactive TV (iTV)]]. These services are delivered across an access agnostic, packet switched network that employs the IP protocol to transport the audio, video and control signals. In contrast to video over the public Internet, with IPTV deployments, network security and performance are tightly managed to ensure a superior entertainment experience, resulting in a compelling business environment for content providers, advertisers and customers alike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |access-date=17 January 2012 |title=ATIS IPTV Exploratory Group Report and Recommendation to the TOPS Council |date=July 2006 |publisher=Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118031705/http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nUp until the early 1990s, it was not thought possible that a [[television show|television programme]] could be squeezed into the limited [[telecommunication]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a [[copper]] [[telephone cable]] to provide a [[video-on-demand]] (VOD) television service of acceptable quality, as the required bandwidth of a [[digital television]] signal was around 200{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]], which was 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper [[telephone wire]].

Examples of types of commercial users include airports, schools, offices, hotels, and sports stadiums, to name just a few.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IPTVnet.png|thumbnail|A simplified network diagram for IPTV]]\n\n===Elements===\n* IPTV head-end: where live TV channels and AV sources are encoded, encrypted and delivered in the form of [[IP multicast]] streams.\n* Video on Demand (VOD) platform: where on-demand video assets are stored and served as IP unicast streams when a user makes a request. The VOD platform may sometimes be located with, and considered part of, the IPTV headend.\n* Interactive portal: allows the user to navigate within the different IPTV services, such as the VOD catalogue.\n* Delivery network: the packet switched network that carries IP packets (unicast and multicast).\n* Endpoints: User equipment that can request, decode and deliver IPTV streams for display to the user. This can include computers and mobile devices as well as [[set-top box]]es.\n* Home [[TV gateway]]: the piece of equipment at a residential IPTV user's home that terminates the access link from the delivery network.\n* User [[set-top box]]: the piece of endpoint equipment that decodes and decrypts TV and VOD streams for display on the TV screen.\n\n===Architecture of a video server network===\nDepending on the network architecture of the service provider, there are two main types of video server architecture that can be considered for IPTV deployment: centralised and distributed.\n\nThe centralised architecture model is a relatively simple and easy to manage solution. Because all media content is stored in centralised servers, it does not require a comprehensive content distribution system. Centralised architecture is generally good for a network that provides relatively small VOD service deployment, has adequate core and edge bandwidth and has an efficient [[content delivery network]] (CDN).\n\nDistributed architecture is just as scalable as the centralised model, however it has bandwidth usage advantages and inherent system management features that are essential for managing a larger server network. Operators who plan to deploy a relatively large system should therefore consider implementing a distributed architecture model right from the start. Distributed architecture requires intelligent and sophisticated content distribution technologies to augment effective delivery of multimedia contents over service provider's network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|title=inwf.com|author=|date=|website=www.inwf.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222175000/http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|archive-date=22 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Residential IPTV home networks===\nIn many cases, the [[residential gateway]] that provides connectivity with the [[Internet access]] network is not located close to the IPTV set-top box.

Playback requires a broadband device connected to either a fixed or wireless IP network in the form of either a standalone [[personal computer]] or limited embedded [[Operating system|OS]] device such as a [[smartphone]], [[Internet tablet|touch screen tablet]], [[game console]], [[connected TV]] or [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top box]].  Video compression is provided by either a [[H.263]] or [[H.264]] derived codec, audio is compressed via a [[MDCT]] based codec and then encapsulated in either an [[MPEG transport stream]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] packets or [[Flash Video]] packets for live or VoD streaming.  IP multicasting allows for live data to be sent to multiple receivers using a single multicast group address. [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]]/MPEG-4 AVC is commonly used for internet streaming over higher bit rate standards such as [[H.261]] and [[H.263]] which were more designed for [[ISDN]] video conferencing. [[H.262]]/MPEG-1/2 is generally not used as the bandwidth required would quite easily saturate a network which is why they are only used in single link broadcast or storage applications.\n\nIn standards-based IPTV systems, the primary underlying protocols used are:\n* Service provider-based streaming:\n** [[IGMP]] for subscribing to a live multicast stream (TV channel) and for changing from one live multicast stream to another (TV channel change). IP multicast operates within LANs (including VLANs) and across WANs also. IP multicast is usually routed in the network core by [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] (PIM), setting up correct distribution of multicast streams (TV channels) from their source all the way to the customers who wants to view them, duplicating received packets as needed.  On-demand content uses a negotiated unicast connection. [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or the lower overhead [[H.222]] transport stream over [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) are generally the preferred methods of encapsulation.\n* [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[unicast]] only live and VoD streaming:\n** [[Adobe Flash Player]] prefers [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] over TCP with setup and control via either [[Action Message Format|AMF]] or [[XML]] or [[JSON]] transactions.\n** Apple iOS uses [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]] [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] with setup and control via an embedded [[M3U]] playlist file.\n** Microsoft Silverlight uses [[Smooth Streaming|smooth streaming]] ([[adaptive bitrate streaming]]) over HTTP.\n* Web-based multicast live and unicast VoD streaming:\n** The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) recommends RTP over UDP or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] transports with setup and control using [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] over TCP.\n* [[Connected TV]]s, [[game console]]s, [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top boxes]] and [[network personal video recorder]]s:\n** local network content uses [[Universal Plug and Play#UPnP AV standards|UPnP AV]] for [[unicast]] via HTTP over TCP or for multicast live RTP over UDP.\n** Web-based content is provided through either inline Web plug-ins or a television broadcast-based application that uses a [[middleware]] language such as [[MHEG-5]] that triggers an event such as loading an inline Web browser using an [[Adobe Flash Player]] plug-in.\n\nA telecommunications company IPTV service is usually delivered over an investment-heavy [[Walled garden (technology)|walled garden network]].\n\nLocal IPTV, as used by businesses for [[audio visual]] AV distribution on their company networks is typically based on a mixture of:\n# Conventional TV reception equipment and IPTV encoders\n# IP[[TV gateway]]s that take broadcast MPEG channels and IP wrap them to create multicast streams.\n\n==Via satellite==\nAlthough IPTV and conventional [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] distribution have been seen as complementary technologies, they are likely to be increasingly used together in hybrid IPTV networks that deliver the highest levels of performance and reliability. IPTV is largely neutral to the transmission medium, and IP traffic is already routinely carried by satellite for [[Internet backbone]] trunking and corporate [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] networks.<ref>Berlocher, Greg and Freyer, Dan. \"IP And Satellite: Communications Worlds Merging\" ''Via Satellite'' January 2009 p 24\u201328</ref> The use of satellite to carry IP is fundamental to overcoming the greatest shortcoming of IPTV over terrestrial cables \u2013 the speed/bandwidth of the connection, as well as availability.\n\nThe copper twisted pair cabling that forms the [[last mile]] of the telephone and broadband network in many countries is not able to provide a sizeable proportion of the population with an IPTV service that matches even existing terrestrial or satellite digital TV distribution. For a competitive multi-channel TV service, a connection speed of 20&nbsp;Mbit/s is likely to be required, but unavailable to most potential customers.<ref>Taga, Karim. \"Hybrid delivery of content for IPTV\" ''InterComms'' Issue 11 August 2008 p 13\u201314</ref> The increasing popularity of [[high-definition television]] (with twice the data rate of [[Standard-definition television|SD video]]) increases connection speed requirements, or limits IPTV service quality and connection eligibility even further.\n\nHowever, satellites are capable of delivering in excess of 100&nbsp;Gbit/s via multi-spot beam technologies, making satellite a clear emerging technology for implementing IPTV networks. Satellite distribution can be included in an IPTV network architecture in several ways. The simplest to implement is an IPTV-[[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct to home]] (DTH) architecture, in which hybrid DVB-broadband [[set-top box]]es in subscriber homes integrate satellite and IP reception to give near-infinite bandwidth with return channel capabilities. In such a system, many live TV channels may be multicast via satellite (IP-encapsulated or as conventional [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] digital TV) with stored video-on-demand transmission via the broadband connection. [[Arqiva]]\u2019s Satellite Media Solutions Division suggests \"IPTV works best in a hybrid format.

Since the emergence of online video aggregation sites, like [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]] in the mid-2000s, traditional [[pay TV]] operators have come under increasing pressure to provide their subscribers with a means of viewing [[Internet]]-based video [both professional and user-generated] on their televisions. At the same time, specialist [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-based operators [often telecommunications providers] have looked for ways to offer [[Analog television|analogue]] and [[digital terrestrial]] services to their operations, without adding either additional cost or complexity to their transmission operations. [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] is a valuable asset for operators, so many have looked for alternative ways to deliver these new services without investing in additional network infrastructures.\n\nA hybrid set-top allows content from a range of sources, including [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast, satellite, and cable, to be brought together with video delivered over the Internet via an Ethernet connection on the device. This enables television viewers to access a greater variety of content on their TV sets, without the need for a separate box for each service.\n\nHybrid IPTV set-top boxes also enable users to access a range of advanced interactive services, such as [[Video on demand|VOD]] / catch-up TV, as well as Internet applications, including [[Videotelephony|video telephony]], surveillance, gaming, shopping, [[E-Government|e-government]] accessed via a [[television set]].\n\nFrom a [[pay-TV]] operator's perspective, a hybrid IPTV set-top box gives them greater long-term flexibility by enabling them to deploy new services and applications as and when consumers require, most often without the need to upgrade equipment or for a technician to visit and reconfigure or swap out the device. This reduces the cost of launching new services, increases speed to market and limits disruption for consumers.<ref>[http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405064453/http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5 |date=5 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies is currently{{When|date=January 2012}} promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital TV and multimedia applications with a single user interface.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Consortium |date=27 August 2009 |url=http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |title=New European initiative merges television with the power of the Internet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125549/http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2009 }}</ref> These trends led to the development of [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] set-top boxes that included both a [[ATSC tuner|broadcast tuner]] and an [[Internet access|Internet connection]]&nbsp;\u2013 usually an [[Ethernet]] port. The first commercially available hybrid IPTV set-top box was developed by [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]], a developer of digital television hardware and software, in 2005. The platform was developed for Spanish pay TV operator [[Telefonica]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |title=ADB Delivers World's First Hybrid, Single-Chip, Advanced Video Coding, High Definition IPTV Set-Top Boxes To TELEF\u00d3NICA |publisher=Digitaltvnews.net |date= |access-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227141252/http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |archive-date=27 February 2012 }}</ref> and used as part of its Movistar TV service, launched to subscribers at the end of 2005.\n\nAn alternative approach is the IPTV version of the [[Headend in the Sky]] cable TV solution. Here, multiple TV channels are distributed via satellite to the ISP or IPTV provider's [[point of presence]] (POP) for IP-encapsulated distribution to individual subscribers as required by each subscriber.\n\nThis can provide a huge selection of channels to subscribers without overburdening Internet trunking to the POP, and enables an IPTV service to be offered to small or remote operators outside the reach of terrestrial high speed broadband connection. An example is a network combining fibre and satellite distribution via an [[SES New Skies]] satellite of 95 channels to Latin America and the Caribbean, operated by IPTV Americas.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=IPTV Americas |date=13 January 2009 |url=http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |title=IPTV Americas Launches First IPTV Satellite Distribution Platform for Latin America and The Caribbean via SES NEW SKIES' NSS-806 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016015125/http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |archive-date=16 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWhile the future development of IPTV probably lies with a number of coexisting architectures and implementations, it is clear{{According to whom|date=January 2012}} that broadcasting of high bandwidth applications such as IPTV is accomplished more efficiently and cost-effectively using satellite<ref>International Datacasting Corporation [http://www.datacast.com/pg_SolutionIndex.php \"Why IP Over Satellite?\"].

Retrieved 18 January 2009.</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nThe Internet protocol-based platform offers significant advantages, including the ability to integrate television with other IP-based services like high speed Internet access and VoIP.\n\nA switched IP network also allows for the delivery of significantly more content and functionality. In a typical TV or satellite network, using broadcast video technology, all the content constantly flows downstream to each customer, and the customer switches the content at the set-top box. The customer can select from as many choices as the telecomms, cable or satellite company can stuff into the \"pipe\" flowing into the home. A switched IP network works differently. Content remains in the network, and only the content the customer selects is sent into the customer's home. That frees up bandwidth, and the customer's choice is less restricted by the size of the \"pipe\" into the home. This also implies that the customer's privacy could be compromised to a greater extent than is possible with traditional TV or satellite networks. It may also provide a means to hack into, or at least disrupt (see [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial of service]]) the private network.\n\n===Economics===\nThe cable industry's expenditures of approximately $1 billion per year are based on network updates to accommodate higher data speeds. Most operators use 2\u20133 channels to support maximum data speeds of 50&nbsp;Mbit/s to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. However, because video streams require a high bit rate for much longer periods of time, the expenditures to support high amounts of video traffic will be much greater. This phenomenon is called persistency. Data persistency is routinely 5% while video persistency can easily reach 50%. As video traffic continues to grow, this means that significantly more [[Cable modem termination system|CMTS]] downstream channels will be required to carry this video content. Based on today's market, it is likely that industry expenditures for CMTS expansion could exceed $2 billion a year, virtually all of that expenditure being driven by video traffic. Adoption of IPTV for carrying the majority of this traffic could save the industry approximately 75% of this capital expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|title=The Economics of IPTV|date=2 February 2015|language=en-US|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920030343/http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Interactivity===\nAn IP-based platform also allows significant opportunities to make the TV viewing experience more interactive and personalised.\nThe supplier may, for example, include an interactive programme guide that allows viewers to search for content by title or actor's name, or a [[picture-in-picture]] functionality that allows them to \"channel surf\" without leaving the programme they're watching. Viewers may be able to look up a player's stats while watching a sports game, or control the camera angle. They also may be able to access photos or music from their PC on their television, use a wireless phone to schedule a recording of their favourite show, or even adjust parental controls so their child can watch a documentary for a school report, while they're away from home.\n\nIn order that there can take place an interaction between the receiver and the transmitter, a feedback channel is needed. Due to this, terrestrial, satellite, and cable networks for television do not allow interactivity. However, interactivity with those networks can be possible by combining TV networks with data networks such as the [[Internet]] or a mobile communication network.\n\n===Video-on-demand===\nIPTV technology is bringing [[video on demand]] (VoD) to television,<ref>[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ Broadband Users Control What They Watch and When] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420143608/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ |date=20 April 2010 }}</ref> which permits a customer to browse an online programme or film catalogue, to watch trailers and to then select a selected recording. The [[playout]] of the selected item starts nearly instantaneously on the customer's TV or PC.\n\nTechnically, when the customer selects the movie, a [[Point-to-Point Protocol|point-to-point]] unicast connection is set up between the customer's decoder (set-top box or PC) and the delivering streaming server. The signalling for the trick play functionality (pause, slow-motion, wind/rewind etc.) is assured by RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol).\n\nThe most common codecs used for VoD are [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4]] and [[VC-1]].\n\nIn an attempt to avoid content piracy, the VoD content is usually encrypted. Whilst [[encryption]] of satellite and cable TV broadcasts is an old practice, with IPTV technology it can effectively be thought of as a form of [[Digital rights management]]. A film that is chosen, for example, may be playable for 24 hours following payment, after which time it becomes unavailable.\n\n===IPTV-based converged services===\nAnother advantage is the opportunity for integration and convergence. This opportunity is amplified when using IMS-based solutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Session and Media Signalling for IPTV via IMS|url=http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625075612/http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2008|website=MobileWare'08|authors=Riede, Christian & Al-Hezmi, Adel & Magedanz, Thomas||location= Innsbruck, Austria||isbn=|date=12 February 2008 }}</ref> Converged services implies interaction of existing services in a seamless manner to create new value added services. One example is on-screen [[Caller ID]], getting Caller ID on a TV, and the ability to handle it (send it to voice mail, etc.). IP-based services help to enable efforts to provide consumers anytime-anywhere access to content over their televisions, PCs, and mobile device, and to integrate services and content to tie them together. Within businesses and institutions, IPTV eliminates the need to run a parallel infrastructure to deliver live and stored video services.\n\n==Limitations==\nIPTV is sensitive to packet loss and delays if the streamed data is unreliable. IPTV has strict minimum speed requirements in order to facilitate the right number of frames per second to deliver moving pictures. This means that the limited connection speed and bandwidth available for a large IPTV customer base can reduce the service quality delivered.\n\nAlthough a few countries have very high-speed broadband-enabled populations, such as [[South Korea]] with 6 million homes benefiting from a minimum connection speed of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, in other countries (such as the UK) legacy networks struggle to provide 3\u20135&nbsp;Mbit/s<ref>Bulkley, Kate. \"IPTV\u2019s Eastern Promise\" ''Digital TV Europe'' October 2008 p 48</ref>{{Update after|2013|8|13}} and so simultaneous provision to the home of TV channels, VOIP and Internet access may not be viable. The last-mile delivery for IPTV usually has a bandwidth restriction that only allows a small number of simultaneous TV channel streams&nbsp;\u2013 typically from one to three&nbsp;\u2013 to be delivered.<ref>Brown, Peter J. \"Super Headends And High Expectations\" ''Via Satellite'' April 2006 p 18\u201330</ref>\n\nStreaming IPTV across wireless links within the home has proved troublesome; not due to bandwidth limitations as many{{Who|date=January 2012}} assume, but due to issues with multipath and reflections of the RF signal carrying the IP data packets. An IPTV stream is sensitive to packets arriving at the right time and in the right order. Improvements in wireless technology are now{{When|date=January 2012}} starting to provide equipment to solve the problem.<ref>Market Wire [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001092108/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200806/ai_n26682515 \"ZyXEL Announces Industry's First ADSL2/2+ 802.11n Gateway and New IPTV Product Offerings\"] June 2008</ref>\n\nDue to the limitations of wireless, most IPTV service providers today use wired home networking technologies instead of wireless technologies like [[IEEE 802.11]]. Service providers such as AT&T (which makes extensive use of wireline home networking as part of its [[AT&T U-verse]] IPTV service) have expressed support for the work done in this direction by [[ITU-T]], which has adopted Recommendation [[G.hn]] (also known as G.9960), which is a next-generation home networking standard that specifies a common PHY/MAC that can operate over any home wiring (power lines, phone lines or coaxial cables).<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/homepna-homegrid-sign-liaison-agreement/story.aspx?guid={C8E4BB07-375A-41E5-8B05-2E33222E44C2}&dist=msr_9 HomePNA and HomeGrid Sign Liaison Agreement]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}, Groups Work to Promote New ITU G.hn Global Wired Home Networking Standard</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|title=AT&T Participating in G.hn Standard Development|author=|date=|website=everywire.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810051112/http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|archive-date=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Latency===\nThe [[latency (engineering)|latency]] inherent in the use of [[Satellite Internet access|satellite Internet]] is often held up as reason why satellites cannot be successfully used for IPTV. In practice, however, latency is not an important factor for IPTV, since it is a service that does not require real-time transmission, as is the case with telephony or videoconferencing services.\n\nIt is the latency of response to requests to change channel, display an EPG, etc. that most affects customers\u2019 perceived quality of service, and these problems affect satellite IPTV no more than terrestrial IPTV. Command latency problems, faced by terrestrial IPTV networks with insufficient bandwidth as their customer base grows, may be solved by the high capacity of satellite distribution.\n\nSatellite distribution does suffer from latency&nbsp;\u2013 the time for the signal to travel up from the hub to the satellite and back down to the user is around 0.25 seconds, and cannot be reduced. However, the effects of this delay are mitigated in real-life systems using data compression, TCP-acceleration, and HTTP pre-fetching.<ref>Newtec Productions NV [http://www.newtec.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/product_leaflets/sat3Play/Sat3Play_Ku-band_Terminal_TP210_R1.pdf \"TP210 Sat3Play Broadband Terminal\"] (Version R2/06.2010).

Existing [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] TV channels that [[simulcast]] by both terrestrial and satellite transmissions experience the same 0.25-second delay difference between the two services with no detrimental effect, and it goes unnoticed by viewers.\n\n==Bandwidth requirements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Figure2a.jpg|thumb|400px|Bandwidth capacity for simultaneously two HDTV streams, two SD streams, additional to HSD and voice]]\n\nDigital video is a combination of sequence of digital images, and they are made up of [[pixel]]s or picture elements. Each pixel has two values, which are [[luminance]] and [[chrominance]]. Luminance is representing intensity of the pixel; chrominance represents the colour of the pixel. Three bytes would be used to represent the colour of the high quality image for a true colour technique. A sequence of images is creating the digital video, in that case, images are called as frames.\n\nMovies use 24 frames per second; however, the rate of the frames can change according to territories' electrical systems so that there are different kinds of frame rates, for instance, North America is using approximately 30 frames per second where the Europe television frame rate is 25 frames per second. Each digital video has dimensions width and height; when referred to analogue television, the dimension for SDTV is 720\u00d7480 pixels, on the other hand, numerous HDTV requires 1920\u00d71080 pixels. Moreover, whilst for SDTV, two bytes (16 bits) is enough to create the colour depth, HDTV requires three bytes (24 bits) to create the colour depth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThereby, with a rate of 30 frames/second, the uncompressed data rate for SDTV becomes 30\u00d7720\u00d7480\u00d716,{{vague|date=July 2017}} in other words, 147,456,000 bits per second. Moreover, for HDTV, at the same frame rate, uncompressed date rate becomes 30\u00d71920\u00d71080\u00d724 or 1,492,992,000 bits per second. Using that simple calculation, a service provider's service delivery to the subscribers is limited unless a lossy compression method is used.\n\nThere is no absolute answer for the bandwidth requirement for the IPTV service because the bandwidth requirement is increasing due to the devices inside the household. Thus, currently compressed HDTV content can be delivered at a data rate between 8 and 10&nbsp;Mbit/s, but if the home of the consumer equipped with several HDTV outputs, this rate will be multiplied respectively.\n\nThe high-speed data transfer will increase the needed bandwidth for the viewer, at least 2&nbsp;Mbit/s is needed to use web-based applications on the computer. Additionally to that, 64&nbsp;kbit/s is required to use landline telephone for the property. In minimal usage, to receive an IPTV triple-play service requires 13&nbsp;Mbit/s to process in a household.\n\n==Privacy implications==\nDue to limitations in bandwidth, an IPTV channel is delivered to the user one at a time, as opposed to the traditional multiplexed delivery. Changing a channel requires requesting the head-end server to provide a different broadcast stream, much like [[Video on demand|VOD]] (For VOD the stream is delivered using [[unicast]], for the normal TV signal multicast is used). This could enable the service provider to accurately track each and every programme watched and the duration of watching for each viewer; broadcasters and advertisers could then understand their audience and programming better with accurate data and [[targeted advertising]].\n\nIn conjunction with regulatory differences between IPTV and cable TV, this tracking could pose a threat to privacy according to critics.<ref>[http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx IPTV privacy risks<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105172921/http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx |date=5 January 2010 }}</ref>  For IP multicast scenarios, since a particular multicast group (TV channel) needs to be requested before it can be viewed, the same privacy concerns apply.\n\n==Vendors==\nGlobal sales of IPTV systems exceeded US$2 billion in 2007, although only a small number of companies supply most current IPTV system solutions. Some, such as [[Movistar TV]], were formed by telecoms operators themselves, to minimise external costs, a tactic also used by [[PCCW]] of [[Hong Kong]]. Some major telecoms vendors are also active in this space, notably [[Accenture]] (Accenture Video Solution), [[Alcatel-Lucent]] (sometimes working with Movistar TV), [[Ericsson]] (notably since acquiring [[Tandberg Television]]), [[Huawei]], [[NEC]], [[PTCL Smart TV]], [[Sri Lanka Telecom]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[ZTE]], as are some IT houses, led by [[Microsoft]]. Delaware-based AlphaOTT Tokyo-based The New Media Group, Malaysian-based [[Select-TV]], Oslo/Norway-based SnapTV, and California-based [[UTStarcom]], Inc. also offer end-to-end networking infrastructure for IPTV-based services, and Hong Kong-based BNS Ltd. provides turnkey open platform IPTV technology solutions. \n\nChannel PEAR is a \"collaborative, cloud-based media platform\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Channel PEAR |title=Login|url=https://channelpear.com/login/}}</ref> that allows users to create a private channel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thestreamingadvisor.com/add-channel-pear-back-to-roku/|website=The Streaming Advisor|title= HOW TO PLEX: What Happened To Channel Pear On Roku How to Get It Back| author=Downey, Ryan|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> on which they can discover, share, and view video files, MRSS feeds, and live IPTV streams from around the world, through devices such as [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Addictive Tips|url=https://www.addictivetips.com/media-streaming/channel-pear-kodi-addon/|title=Channel Pear Kodi Add-on, Installation Tutorial and Discovery| author=Larue-Langlois, Renaud Larue-Langlois|date= September 16, 2017}}</ref> [[Plex (software)|Plex]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Plex TV Forums|url=https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-channel-pear-live-stream-discovery-iptv/113612|title=Channel Pear Live Stream Discovery}}</ref> and [[Roku]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Roku Guide|url=https://www.rokuguide.com/private-channels/channel-pear|title=Private Channels: Channel PEAR}}</ref>\n\nHospitality IPTV Ltd, having established many closed network IPTV systems, expanded in 2013 to OTT delivery platforms for markets in New Zealand, Australia, and Asia Pacific region.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Google Fiber]] offers an IPTV service in various US cities which includes up to 1 Gigabit-speed internet and over 290 channels depending on package via the fiber optic network being built out in Kansas City Kansas and Kansas City Missouri.\n\nPEAR IPTV self-declares as \"the leading IPTV provider in the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peariptv.com/|website= PEAR IPTV|title =Home Page}}</ref>\n\nMany of these IPTV solution vendors participated in the biennial Multiservice Switching Forum Interoperability 2008 (GMI) event which was coordinated by the [[MultiService Forum]] (MSF) at five sites worldwide from 20 to 31 October 2008.

When these three are offered with cellular service, the combined service may be referred to as ''[[quadruple play]]''.\n\n==Regulation==\nHistorically, broadcast television has been regulated differently from telecommunications.

This is in contrast to delivery through traditional [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]], [[Satellite television|satellite]], and [[Cable television|cable]] television formats. Unlike [[download]]ed media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as [[streaming media]].\n\nAlthough IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to [[streaming television|television streamed]] from the [[Internet]] ([[Internet television]]). IPTV is widely deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed access channels into end-user premises via [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]]. IPTV is also used for media delivery around corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., [[ETSI|European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\nIPTV services may be classified into [[live television]] and live media, with or without related interactivity; [[time shifting]] of media, e.g., [[catch-up TV]] (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning); and [[video on demand]] (VOD) which involves browsing and viewing items of a media catalogue.\n\n==Definition==\nHistorically, many different definitions of IPTV have appeared, including elementary streams{{clarify|date=February 2018}} over IP networks, [[MPEG transport stream]]s over IP networks and a number of proprietary systems. One official definition approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] focus group on IPTV (ITU-T FG IPTV) is:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as multimedia services such as television/video/audio/text/graphics/data delivered over IP based networks managed to provide the required level of quality of service and experience, security, interactivity and reliability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |work=ITU-T Newslog |date=27 October 2006 |title=IPTV Standardization on Track Say Industry Experts |access-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916031736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |archive-date=16 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother definition of IPTV, relating to the telecommunications industry, is the one given by [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) IPTV Exploratory Group in 2005:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as the secure and reliable delivery to subscribers of entertainment video and related services.  These services may include, for example, Live TV, Video On Demand (VOD) and [[Interactive television|Interactive TV (iTV)]]. These services are delivered across an access agnostic, packet switched network that employs the IP protocol to transport the audio, video and control signals. In contrast to video over the public Internet, with IPTV deployments, network security and performance are tightly managed to ensure a superior entertainment experience, resulting in a compelling business environment for content providers, advertisers and customers alike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |access-date=17 January 2012 |title=ATIS IPTV Exploratory Group Report and Recommendation to the TOPS Council |date=July 2006 |publisher=Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118031705/http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nUp until the early 1990s, it was not thought possible that a [[television show|television programme]] could be squeezed into the limited [[telecommunication]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a [[copper]] [[telephone cable]] to provide a [[video-on-demand]] (VOD) television service of acceptable quality, as the required bandwidth of a [[digital television]] signal was around 200{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]], which was 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper [[telephone wire]].

Examples of types of commercial users include airports, schools, offices, hotels, and sports stadiums, to name just a few.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IPTVnet.png|thumbnail|A simplified network diagram for IPTV]]\n\n===Elements===\n* IPTV head-end: where live TV channels and AV sources are encoded, encrypted and delivered in the form of [[IP multicast]] streams.\n* Video on Demand (VOD) platform: where on-demand video assets are stored and served as IP unicast streams when a user makes a request. The VOD platform may sometimes be located with, and considered part of, the IPTV headend.\n* Interactive portal: allows the user to navigate within the different IPTV services, such as the VOD catalogue.\n* Delivery network: the packet switched network that carries IP packets (unicast and multicast).\n* Endpoints: User equipment that can request, decode and deliver IPTV streams for display to the user. This can include computers and mobile devices as well as [[set-top box]]es.\n* Home [[TV gateway]]: the piece of equipment at a residential IPTV user's home that terminates the access link from the delivery network.\n* User [[set-top box]]: the piece of endpoint equipment that decodes and decrypts TV and VOD streams for display on the TV screen.\n\n===Architecture of a video server network===\nDepending on the network architecture of the service provider, there are two main types of video server architecture that can be considered for IPTV deployment: centralised and distributed.\n\nThe centralised architecture model is a relatively simple and easy to manage solution. Because all media content is stored in centralised servers, it does not require a comprehensive content distribution system. Centralised architecture is generally good for a network that provides relatively small VOD service deployment, has adequate core and edge bandwidth and has an efficient [[content delivery network]] (CDN).\n\nDistributed architecture is just as scalable as the centralised model, however it has bandwidth usage advantages and inherent system management features that are essential for managing a larger server network. Operators who plan to deploy a relatively large system should therefore consider implementing a distributed architecture model right from the start. Distributed architecture requires intelligent and sophisticated content distribution technologies to augment effective delivery of multimedia contents over service provider's network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|title=inwf.com|author=|date=|website=www.inwf.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222175000/http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|archive-date=22 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Residential IPTV home networks===\nIn many cases, the [[residential gateway]] that provides connectivity with the [[Internet access]] network is not located close to the IPTV set-top box.

Playback requires a broadband device connected to either a fixed or wireless IP network in the form of either a standalone [[personal computer]] or limited embedded [[Operating system|OS]] device such as a [[smartphone]], [[Internet tablet|touch screen tablet]], [[game console]], [[connected TV]] or [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top box]].  Video compression is provided by either a [[H.263]] or [[H.264]] derived codec, audio is compressed via a [[MDCT]] based codec and then encapsulated in either an [[MPEG transport stream]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] packets or [[Flash Video]] packets for live or VoD streaming.  IP multicasting allows for live data to be sent to multiple receivers using a single multicast group address. [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]]/MPEG-4 AVC is commonly used for internet streaming over higher bit rate standards such as [[H.261]] and [[H.263]] which were more designed for [[ISDN]] video conferencing. [[H.262]]/MPEG-1/2 is generally not used as the bandwidth required would quite easily saturate a network which is why they are only used in single link broadcast or storage applications.\n\nIn standards-based IPTV systems, the primary underlying protocols used are:\n* Service provider-based streaming:\n** [[IGMP]] for subscribing to a live multicast stream (TV channel) and for changing from one live multicast stream to another (TV channel change). IP multicast operates within LANs (including VLANs) and across WANs also. IP multicast is usually routed in the network core by [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] (PIM), setting up correct distribution of multicast streams (TV channels) from their source all the way to the customers who wants to view them, duplicating received packets as needed.  On-demand content uses a negotiated unicast connection. [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or the lower overhead [[H.222]] transport stream over [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) are generally the preferred methods of encapsulation.\n* [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[unicast]] only live and VoD streaming:\n** [[Adobe Flash Player]] prefers [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] over TCP with setup and control via either [[Action Message Format|AMF]] or [[XML]] or [[JSON]] transactions.\n** Apple iOS uses [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]] [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] with setup and control via an embedded [[M3U]] playlist file.\n** Microsoft Silverlight uses [[Smooth Streaming|smooth streaming]] ([[adaptive bitrate streaming]]) over HTTP.\n* Web-based multicast live and unicast VoD streaming:\n** The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) recommends RTP over UDP or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] transports with setup and control using [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] over TCP.\n* [[Connected TV]]s, [[game console]]s, [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top boxes]] and [[network personal video recorder]]s:\n** local network content uses [[Universal Plug and Play#UPnP AV standards|UPnP AV]] for [[unicast]] via HTTP over TCP or for multicast live RTP over UDP.\n** Web-based content is provided through either inline Web plug-ins or a television broadcast-based application that uses a [[middleware]] language such as [[MHEG-5]] that triggers an event such as loading an inline Web browser using an [[Adobe Flash Player]] plug-in.\n\nA telecommunications company IPTV service is usually delivered over an investment-heavy [[Walled garden (technology)|walled garden network]].\n\nLocal IPTV, as used by businesses for [[audio visual]] AV distribution on their company networks is typically based on a mixture of:\n# Conventional TV reception equipment and IPTV encoders\n# IP[[TV gateway]]s that take broadcast MPEG channels and IP wrap them to create multicast streams.\n\n==Via satellite==\nAlthough IPTV and conventional [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] distribution have been seen as complementary technologies, they are likely to be increasingly used together in hybrid IPTV networks that deliver the highest levels of performance and reliability. IPTV is largely neutral to the transmission medium, and IP traffic is already routinely carried by satellite for [[Internet backbone]] trunking and corporate [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] networks.<ref>Berlocher, Greg and Freyer, Dan. \"IP And Satellite: Communications Worlds Merging\" ''Via Satellite'' January 2009 p 24\u201328</ref> The use of satellite to carry IP is fundamental to overcoming the greatest shortcoming of IPTV over terrestrial cables \u2013 the speed/bandwidth of the connection, as well as availability.\n\nThe copper twisted pair cabling that forms the [[last mile]] of the telephone and broadband network in many countries is not able to provide a sizeable proportion of the population with an IPTV service that matches even existing terrestrial or satellite digital TV distribution. For a competitive multi-channel TV service, a connection speed of 20&nbsp;Mbit/s is likely to be required, but unavailable to most potential customers.<ref>Taga, Karim. \"Hybrid delivery of content for IPTV\" ''InterComms'' Issue 11 August 2008 p 13\u201314</ref> The increasing popularity of [[high-definition television]] (with twice the data rate of [[Standard-definition television|SD video]]) increases connection speed requirements, or limits IPTV service quality and connection eligibility even further.\n\nHowever, satellites are capable of delivering in excess of 100&nbsp;Gbit/s via multi-spot beam technologies, making satellite a clear emerging technology for implementing IPTV networks. Satellite distribution can be included in an IPTV network architecture in several ways. The simplest to implement is an IPTV-[[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct to home]] (DTH) architecture, in which hybrid DVB-broadband [[set-top box]]es in subscriber homes integrate satellite and IP reception to give near-infinite bandwidth with return channel capabilities. In such a system, many live TV channels may be multicast via satellite (IP-encapsulated or as conventional [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] digital TV) with stored video-on-demand transmission via the broadband connection.

Since the emergence of online video aggregation sites, like [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]] in the mid-2000s, traditional [[pay TV]] operators have come under increasing pressure to provide their subscribers with a means of viewing [[Internet]]-based video [both professional and user-generated] on their televisions. At the same time, specialist [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-based operators [often telecommunications providers] have looked for ways to offer [[Analog television|analogue]] and [[digital terrestrial]] services to their operations, without adding either additional cost or complexity to their transmission operations. [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] is a valuable asset for operators, so many have looked for alternative ways to deliver these new services without investing in additional network infrastructures.\n\nA hybrid set-top allows content from a range of sources, including [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast, satellite, and cable, to be brought together with video delivered over the Internet via an Ethernet connection on the device. This enables television viewers to access a greater variety of content on their TV sets, without the need for a separate box for each service.\n\nHybrid IPTV set-top boxes also enable users to access a range of advanced interactive services, such as [[Video on demand|VOD]] / catch-up TV, as well as Internet applications, including [[Videotelephony|video telephony]], surveillance, gaming, shopping, [[E-Government|e-government]] accessed via a [[television set]].\n\nFrom a [[pay-TV]] operator's perspective, a hybrid IPTV set-top box gives them greater long-term flexibility by enabling them to deploy new services and applications as and when consumers require, most often without the need to upgrade equipment or for a technician to visit and reconfigure or swap out the device. This reduces the cost of launching new services, increases speed to market and limits disruption for consumers.<ref>[http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405064453/http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5 |date=5 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies is currently{{When|date=January 2012}} promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital TV and multimedia applications with a single user interface.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Consortium |date=27 August 2009 |url=http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |title=New European initiative merges television with the power of the Internet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125549/http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2009 }}</ref> These trends led to the development of [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] set-top boxes that included both a [[ATSC tuner|broadcast tuner]] and an [[Internet access|Internet connection]]&nbsp;\u2013 usually an [[Ethernet]] port. The first commercially available hybrid IPTV set-top box was developed by [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]], a developer of digital television hardware and software, in 2005. The platform was developed for Spanish pay TV operator [[Telefonica]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |title=ADB Delivers World's First Hybrid, Single-Chip, Advanced Video Coding, High Definition IPTV Set-Top Boxes To TELEF\u00d3NICA |publisher=Digitaltvnews.net |date= |access-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227141252/http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |archive-date=27 February 2012 }}</ref> and used as part of its Movistar TV service, launched to subscribers at the end of 2005.\n\nAn alternative approach is the IPTV version of the [[Headend in the Sky]] cable TV solution. Here, multiple TV channels are distributed via satellite to the ISP or IPTV provider's [[point of presence]] (POP) for IP-encapsulated distribution to individual subscribers as required by each subscriber.\n\nThis can provide a huge selection of channels to subscribers without overburdening Internet trunking to the POP, and enables an IPTV service to be offered to small or remote operators outside the reach of terrestrial high speed broadband connection. An example is a network combining fibre and satellite distribution via an [[SES New Skies]] satellite of 95 channels to Latin America and the Caribbean, operated by IPTV Americas.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=IPTV Americas |date=13 January 2009 |url=http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |title=IPTV Americas Launches First IPTV Satellite Distribution Platform for Latin America and The Caribbean via SES NEW SKIES' NSS-806 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016015125/http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |archive-date=16 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWhile the future development of IPTV probably lies with a number of coexisting architectures and implementations, it is clear{{According to whom|date=January 2012}} that broadcasting of high bandwidth applications such as IPTV is accomplished more efficiently and cost-effectively using satellite<ref>International Datacasting Corporation [http://www.datacast.com/pg_SolutionIndex.php \"Why IP Over Satellite?\"]. Accessed 18 January 2009. Company factsheet {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119143024/http://www.datacast.com/pg_SolutionIndex.php |date=19 November 2008 }}</ref> and it is predicted that the majority of global IPTV growth will be fuelled by hybrid networks.<ref>[http://www.satellitetoday.com/via/ednote/140.html \"Future Looks Bright For IPTV\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306174653/http://www.satellitetoday.com/via/ednote/140.html |date=6 March 2009 }} ''Satellite Today''. Retrieved 18 January 2009.</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nThe Internet protocol-based platform offers significant advantages, including the ability to integrate television with other IP-based services like high speed Internet access and VoIP.\n\nA switched IP network also allows for the delivery of significantly more content and functionality. In a typical TV or satellite network, using broadcast video technology, all the content constantly flows downstream to each customer, and the customer switches the content at the set-top box. The customer can select from as many choices as the telecomms, cable or satellite company can stuff into the \"pipe\" flowing into the home. A switched IP network works differently. Content remains in the network, and only the content the customer selects is sent into the customer's home. That frees up bandwidth, and the customer's choice is less restricted by the size of the \"pipe\" into the home. This also implies that the customer's privacy could be compromised to a greater extent than is possible with traditional TV or satellite networks. It may also provide a means to hack into, or at least disrupt (see [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial of service]]) the private network.\n\n===Economics===\nThe cable industry's expenditures of approximately $1 billion per year are based on network updates to accommodate higher data speeds. Most operators use 2\u20133 channels to support maximum data speeds of 50&nbsp;Mbit/s to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. However, because video streams require a high bit rate for much longer periods of time, the expenditures to support high amounts of video traffic will be much greater. This phenomenon is called persistency. Data persistency is routinely 5% while video persistency can easily reach 50%. As video traffic continues to grow, this means that significantly more [[Cable modem termination system|CMTS]] downstream channels will be required to carry this video content. Based on today's market, it is likely that industry expenditures for CMTS expansion could exceed $2 billion a year, virtually all of that expenditure being driven by video traffic. Adoption of IPTV for carrying the majority of this traffic could save the industry approximately 75% of this capital expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|title=The Economics of IPTV|date=2 February 2015|language=en-US|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920030343/http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Interactivity===\nAn IP-based platform also allows significant opportunities to make the TV viewing experience more interactive and personalised.\nThe supplier may, for example, include an interactive programme guide that allows viewers to search for content by title or actor's name, or a [[picture-in-picture]] functionality that allows them to \"channel surf\" without leaving the programme they're watching. Viewers may be able to look up a player's stats while watching a sports game, or control the camera angle. They also may be able to access photos or music from their PC on their television, use a wireless phone to schedule a recording of their favourite show, or even adjust parental controls so their child can watch a documentary for a school report, while they're away from home.\n\nIn order that there can take place an interaction between the receiver and the transmitter, a feedback channel is needed. Due to this, terrestrial, satellite, and cable networks for television do not allow interactivity. However, interactivity with those networks can be possible by combining TV networks with data networks such as the [[Internet]] or a mobile communication network.\n\n===Video-on-demand===\nIPTV technology is bringing [[video on demand]] (VoD) to television,<ref>[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ Broadband Users Control What They Watch and When] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420143608/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ |date=20 April 2010 }}</ref> which permits a customer to browse an online programme or film catalogue, to watch trailers and to then select a selected recording. The [[playout]] of the selected item starts nearly instantaneously on the customer's TV or PC.\n\nTechnically, when the customer selects the movie, a [[Point-to-Point Protocol|point-to-point]] unicast connection is set up between the customer's decoder (set-top box or PC) and the delivering streaming server. The signalling for the trick play functionality (pause, slow-motion, wind/rewind etc.) is assured by RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol).\n\nThe most common codecs used for VoD are [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4]] and [[VC-1]].\n\nIn an attempt to avoid content piracy, the VoD content is usually encrypted. Whilst [[encryption]] of satellite and cable TV broadcasts is an old practice, with IPTV technology it can effectively be thought of as a form of [[Digital rights management]]. A film that is chosen, for example, may be playable for 24 hours following payment, after which time it becomes unavailable.\n\n===IPTV-based converged services===\nAnother advantage is the opportunity for integration and convergence. This opportunity is amplified when using IMS-based solutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Session and Media Signalling for IPTV via IMS|url=http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625075612/http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2008|website=MobileWare'08|authors=Riede, Christian & Al-Hezmi, Adel & Magedanz, Thomas||location= Innsbruck, Austria||isbn=|date=12 February 2008 }}</ref> Converged services implies interaction of existing services in a seamless manner to create new value added services. One example is on-screen [[Caller ID]], getting Caller ID on a TV, and the ability to handle it (send it to voice mail, etc.). IP-based services help to enable efforts to provide consumers anytime-anywhere access to content over their televisions, PCs, and mobile device, and to integrate services and content to tie them together. Within businesses and institutions, IPTV eliminates the need to run a parallel infrastructure to deliver live and stored video services.\n\n==Limitations==\nIPTV is sensitive to packet loss and delays if the streamed data is unreliable. IPTV has strict minimum speed requirements in order to facilitate the right number of frames per second to deliver moving pictures. This means that the limited connection speed and bandwidth available for a large IPTV customer base can reduce the service quality delivered.\n\nAlthough a few countries have very high-speed broadband-enabled populations, such as [[South Korea]] with 6 million homes benefiting from a minimum connection speed of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, in other countries (such as the UK) legacy networks struggle to provide 3\u20135&nbsp;Mbit/s<ref>Bulkley, Kate. \"IPTV\u2019s Eastern Promise\" ''Digital TV Europe'' October 2008 p 48</ref>{{Update after|2013|8|13}} and so simultaneous provision to the home of TV channels, VOIP and Internet access may not be viable. The last-mile delivery for IPTV usually has a bandwidth restriction that only allows a small number of simultaneous TV channel streams&nbsp;\u2013 typically from one to three&nbsp;\u2013 to be delivered.<ref>Brown, Peter J. \"Super Headends And High Expectations\" ''Via Satellite'' April 2006 p 18\u201330</ref>\n\nStreaming IPTV across wireless links within the home has proved troublesome; not due to bandwidth limitations as many{{Who|date=January 2012}} assume, but due to issues with multipath and reflections of the RF signal carrying the IP data packets. An IPTV stream is sensitive to packets arriving at the right time and in the right order. Improvements in wireless technology are now{{When|date=January 2012}} starting to provide equipment to solve the problem.<ref>Market Wire [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001092108/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200806/ai_n26682515 \"ZyXEL Announces Industry's First ADSL2/2+ 802.11n Gateway and New IPTV Product Offerings\"] June 2008</ref>\n\nDue to the limitations of wireless, most IPTV service providers today use wired home networking technologies instead of wireless technologies like [[IEEE 802.11]]. Service providers such as AT&T (which makes extensive use of wireline home networking as part of its [[AT&T U-verse]] IPTV service) have expressed support for the work done in this direction by [[ITU-T]], which has adopted Recommendation [[G.hn]] (also known as G.9960), which is a next-generation home networking standard that specifies a common PHY/MAC that can operate over any home wiring (power lines, phone lines or coaxial cables).<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/homepna-homegrid-sign-liaison-agreement/story.aspx?guid={C8E4BB07-375A-41E5-8B05-2E33222E44C2}&dist=msr_9 HomePNA and HomeGrid Sign Liaison Agreement]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}, Groups Work to Promote New ITU G.hn Global Wired Home Networking Standard</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|title=AT&T Participating in G.hn Standard Development|author=|date=|website=everywire.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810051112/http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|archive-date=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Latency===\nThe [[latency (engineering)|latency]] inherent in the use of [[Satellite Internet access|satellite Internet]] is often held up as reason why satellites cannot be successfully used for IPTV. In practice, however, latency is not an important factor for IPTV, since it is a service that does not require real-time transmission, as is the case with telephony or videoconferencing services.\n\nIt is the latency of response to requests to change channel, display an EPG, etc. that most affects customers\u2019 perceived quality of service, and these problems affect satellite IPTV no more than terrestrial IPTV. Command latency problems, faced by terrestrial IPTV networks with insufficient bandwidth as their customer base grows, may be solved by the high capacity of satellite distribution.\n\nSatellite distribution does suffer from latency&nbsp;\u2013 the time for the signal to travel up from the hub to the satellite and back down to the user is around 0.25 seconds, and cannot be reduced. However, the effects of this delay are mitigated in real-life systems using data compression, TCP-acceleration, and HTTP pre-fetching.<ref>Newtec Productions NV [http://www.newtec.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/product_leaflets/sat3Play/Sat3Play_Ku-band_Terminal_TP210_R1.pdf \"TP210 Sat3Play Broadband Terminal\"] (Version R2/06.2010).

Existing [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] TV channels that [[simulcast]] by both terrestrial and satellite transmissions experience the same 0.25-second delay difference between the two services with no detrimental effect, and it goes unnoticed by viewers.\n\n==Bandwidth requirements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Figure2a.jpg|thumb|400px|Bandwidth capacity for simultaneously two HDTV streams, two SD streams, additional to HSD and voice]]\n\nDigital video is a combination of sequence of digital images, and they are made up of [[pixel]]s or picture elements. Each pixel has two values, which are [[luminance]] and [[chrominance]]. Luminance is representing intensity of the pixel; chrominance represents the colour of the pixel. Three bytes would be used to represent the colour of the high quality image for a true colour technique. A sequence of images is creating the digital video, in that case, images are called as frames.\n\nMovies use 24 frames per second; however, the rate of the frames can change according to territories' electrical systems so that there are different kinds of frame rates, for instance, North America is using approximately 30 frames per second where the Europe television frame rate is 25 frames per second. Each digital video has dimensions width and height; when referred to analogue television, the dimension for SDTV is 720\u00d7480 pixels, on the other hand, numerous HDTV requires 1920\u00d71080 pixels. Moreover, whilst for SDTV, two bytes (16 bits) is enough to create the colour depth, HDTV requires three bytes (24 bits) to create the colour depth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThereby, with a rate of 30 frames/second, the uncompressed data rate for SDTV becomes 30\u00d7720\u00d7480\u00d716,{{vague|date=July 2017}} in other words, 147,456,000 bits per second. Moreover, for HDTV, at the same frame rate, uncompressed date rate becomes 30\u00d71920\u00d71080\u00d724 or 1,492,992,000 bits per second. Using that simple calculation, a service provider's service delivery to the subscribers is limited unless a lossy compression method is used.\n\nThere is no absolute answer for the bandwidth requirement for the IPTV service because the bandwidth requirement is increasing due to the devices inside the household. Thus, currently compressed HDTV content can be delivered at a data rate between 8 and 10&nbsp;Mbit/s, but if the home of the consumer equipped with several HDTV outputs, this rate will be multiplied respectively.\n\nThe high-speed data transfer will increase the needed bandwidth for the viewer, at least 2&nbsp;Mbit/s is needed to use web-based applications on the computer. Additionally to that, 64&nbsp;kbit/s is required to use landline telephone for the property. In minimal usage, to receive an IPTV triple-play service requires 13&nbsp;Mbit/s to process in a household.\n\n==Privacy implications==\nDue to limitations in bandwidth, an IPTV channel is delivered to the user one at a time, as opposed to the traditional multiplexed delivery. Changing a channel requires requesting the head-end server to provide a different broadcast stream, much like [[Video on demand|VOD]] (For VOD the stream is delivered using [[unicast]], for the normal TV signal multicast is used). This could enable the service provider to accurately track each and every programme watched and the duration of watching for each viewer; broadcasters and advertisers could then understand their audience and programming better with accurate data and [[targeted advertising]].\n\nIn conjunction with regulatory differences between IPTV and cable TV, this tracking could pose a threat to privacy according to critics.<ref>[http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx IPTV privacy risks<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105172921/http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx |date=5 January 2010 }}</ref>  For IP multicast scenarios, since a particular multicast group (TV channel) needs to be requested before it can be viewed, the same privacy concerns apply.\n\n==Vendors==\nGlobal sales of IPTV systems exceeded US$2 billion in 2007, although only a small number of companies supply most current IPTV system solutions. Some, such as [[Movistar TV]], were formed by telecoms operators themselves, to minimise external costs, a tactic also used by [[PCCW]] of [[Hong Kong]]. Some major telecoms vendors are also active in this space, notably [[Accenture]] (Accenture Video Solution), [[Alcatel-Lucent]] (sometimes working with Movistar TV), [[Ericsson]] (notably since acquiring [[Tandberg Television]]), [[Huawei]], [[NEC]], [[PTCL Smart TV]], [[Sri Lanka Telecom]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[ZTE]], as are some IT houses, led by [[Microsoft]]. Delaware-based AlphaOTT Tokyo-based The New Media Group, Malaysian-based [[Select-TV]], Oslo/Norway-based SnapTV, and California-based [[UTStarcom]], Inc. also offer end-to-end networking infrastructure for IPTV-based services, and Hong Kong-based BNS Ltd. provides turnkey open platform IPTV technology solutions. \n\nChannel PEAR is a \"collaborative, cloud-based media platform\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Channel PEAR |title=Login|url=https://channelpear.com/login/}}</ref> that allows users to create a private channel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thestreamingadvisor.com/add-channel-pear-back-to-roku/|website=The Streaming Advisor|title= HOW TO PLEX: What Happened To Channel Pear On Roku How to Get It Back| author=Downey, Ryan|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> on which they can discover, share, and view video files, MRSS feeds, and live IPTV streams from around the world, through devices such as [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Addictive Tips|url=https://www.addictivetips.com/media-streaming/channel-pear-kodi-addon/|title=Channel Pear Kodi Add-on, Installation Tutorial and Discovery| author=Larue-Langlois, Renaud Larue-Langlois|date= September 16, 2017}}</ref> [[Plex (software)|Plex]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Plex TV Forums|url=https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-channel-pear-live-stream-discovery-iptv/113612|title=Channel Pear Live Stream Discovery}}</ref> and [[Roku]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Roku Guide|url=https://www.rokuguide.com/private-channels/channel-pear|title=Private Channels: Channel PEAR}}</ref>\n\nHospitality IPTV Ltd, having established many closed network IPTV systems, expanded in 2013 to OTT delivery platforms for markets in New Zealand, Australia, and Asia Pacific region.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Google Fiber]] offers an IPTV service in various US cities which includes up to 1 Gigabit-speed internet and over 290 channels depending on package via the fiber optic network being built out in Kansas City Kansas and Kansas City Missouri.\n\nPEAR IPTV self-declares as \"the leading IPTV provider in the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peariptv.com/|website= PEAR IPTV|title =Home Page}}</ref>\n\nMany of these IPTV solution vendors participated in the biennial Multiservice Switching Forum Interoperability 2008 (GMI) event which was coordinated by the [[MultiService Forum]] (MSF) at five sites worldwide from 20 to 31 October 2008.

Commercial bundling of IPTV, VoIP and Internet access is sometimes referred to in marketing as ''[[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]'' service.

It is a concept of \"unity without uniformity and diversity without fragmentation\"{{Sfn|Lalonde|1994}} that shifts focus from unity based on a mere tolerance of physical, cultural, linguistic, social, religious, political, ideological and/or [[Psychology|psychological]] differences towards a more complex unity based on an understanding that difference enriches human interactions. The idea and related phrase is very old and dates back to ancient times in both Western and Eastern Old World cultures.  It has applications in many fields, including [[ecology]],{{Sfn|Lalonde|1994}} [[cosmology]], [[philosophy]],{{Sfn|Kalin|2004|page=430}} [[religion]]{{Sfn|Effendi|1938}} and [[politics]].{{Sfn|Eurominority|2004}} \n\nThe concept of unity in diversity was used by both the [[indigenous peoples of North America]] and [[Taoist]] societies in 400\u2013500 [[Before common era|B.C.]] In premodern Western culture, it has existed in an implicit form in certain organic conceptions of the universe that developed in the civilizations of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].{{Sfn|Lalonde|1994}} The phrase is a deliberate [[oxymoron]], the rhetorical combination of two antonyms, ''unitas'' \"unity, oneness\" and ''varietas'' \"variety, variousness\". When used in a political context, it is often used to advocate [[federalism]] and [[multiculturalism]].\n\n==Origins==\n\nThe diversity is a permanent human condition.\nThe concept of unity in diversity can be traced back to [[Sufism|Sufi]] philosopher [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-'Arabi]] (1165\u20131240), who advanced the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] concept of the \"oneness of being\" (''wahdat al-wujud''), namely, that reality is one, and that God's is the only true existence; all other beings are merely shadows, or reflections of God's qualities.{{Sfn|Kalin|2004|pages=385\u2013386}} [[Abd al-Kar\u012bm al-J\u012bl\u012b]] (1366\u20131424) expanded on Al-'Arabi's work, using it to describe a holistic view of the universe which reflects \"unity in diversity and diversity in unity\" (''al-wahdah fi'l-kathrah wa'l-kathrah fi'l-wahdah'').{{Sfn|Kalin|2004|page=430}}\n\n[[Leibniz]] used the phrase as a definition of \"[[harmony]]\" (''Harmonia est unitas in varietate'')  in his ''Elementa verae pietatis, sive de amore dei 948) I.12/A VI.4.1358. Leibniz glosses the definition with ''Harmonia est cum multa ad quandam unitatem revocantur'' \"'Harmony' is when many [things] are restored to some kind of unity\".</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n'', written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the [[Majapahit]] empire sometime in the 14th century, contains the phrase\n''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'', translated as \"unity in diversity\" or \"out of many, one\".

The idea and related phrase is very old and dates back to ancient times in both Western and Eastern Old World cultures.

When used in a political context, it is often used to advocate [[federalism]] and [[multiculturalism]].\n\n==Origins==\n\nThe diversity is a permanent human condition.\nThe concept of unity in diversity can be traced back to [[Sufism|Sufi]] philosopher [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-'Arabi]] (1165\u20131240), who advanced the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] concept of the \"oneness of being\" (''wahdat al-wujud''), namely, that reality is one, and that God's is the only true existence; all other beings are merely shadows, or reflections of God's qualities.{{Sfn|Kalin|2004|pages=385\u2013386}} [[Abd al-Kar\u012bm al-J\u012bl\u012b]] (1366\u20131424) expanded on Al-'Arabi's work, using it to describe a holistic view of the universe which reflects \"unity in diversity and diversity in unity\" (''al-wahdah fi'l-kathrah wa'l-kathrah fi'l-wahdah'').{{Sfn|Kalin|2004|page=430}}\n\n[[Leibniz]] used the phrase as a definition of \"[[harmony]]\" (''Harmonia est unitas in varietate'')  in his ''Elementa verae pietatis, sive de amore dei 948) I.12/A VI.4.1358. Leibniz glosses the definition with ''Harmonia est cum multa ad quandam unitatem revocantur'' \"'Harmony' is when many [things] are restored to some kind of unity\".</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n'', written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the [[Majapahit]] empire sometime in the 14th century, contains the phrase\n''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'', translated as \"unity in diversity\" or \"out of many, one\".

It is based on the homonymous novel by [[Almudena Grandes]]. The film is about the title character's life and sexual awakening in [[Madrid]], which leads to her involvement in increasingly dangerous sexual experimentation.\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe fifteen-year-old Lul\u00fa is seduced by Pablo, her brother Marcelo's best friend, who then leaves to work in the United States.  Lul\u00fa is sustained for years by the belief that Pablo will come back into her life.  When he returns he proposes to her and they are married.  Pablo and Lul\u00fa have a passionate relationship, developing a taste for sexual games.  \n\nOn one nocturnal expedition they join up with a transgender prostitute called Ely who becomes their friend.  The couple have a daughter, Ines.  Pablo convinces Lul\u00fa to participate blindfolded in a threesome; when Lul\u00fa discovers that the third person was Marcelo, her brother, she leaves Pablo in disgust, taking their daughter with her.  However, her own desire to play increasingly dangerous sex games now comes to consume her. \n\nAfter becoming aroused watching a [[gay porn]] movie, she seeks out [[gay]] men and pays them to join in orgies, or watch them having sex.  Unable to pay enough to satisfy her desires, she meets a pimp called Remy who runs a secret [[sadomasochism|S&M]] club.  Ely tries to warn Lul\u00fa that Remy is dangerous, but Lul\u00fa ignores her, so Ely goes to warn Pablo.  Remy tells Lul\u00fa to go to a club, where she is tied up by Jimmy, a gay man she had previously paid for sex. \n\nShe is forced to endure violent sex while gagged and bound.  Ely tells Pablo that Lul\u00fa is in danger.  She goes to the club to rescue her, but is attacked by Jimmy and killed when her head hits a metal bar.  Pablo calls the police, who arrest Jimmy and the others.  Lul\u00fa and Pablo are reunited.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Francesca Neri]] as Lul\u00fa\n* \u00d3scar Ladoire as Pablo\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Ely\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Jimmy\n* [[Fernando Guill\u00e9n Cuervo]] as Marcelo\n* [[Rosana Pastor]] as Chelo\n* Juan Graell as Remy\n* Rodrigo Valverde as Pablito\n* [[Pilar Bardem]] as Encarna\n* [[Marta May]] as Lul\u00fa's mother\n* Gloria Rodriquez as Cristina\n* \u00c1ngel Jov\u00e8 as Alicantino\n* Ainara P\u00e9rez as Lul\u00fa as a child\n* Juan Sala as Lul\u00fa's father\n* Pepa Serrano as Flamenca\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is an adaptation of the international best-selling novel with the same name written by [[Almudena Grandes]]. [[\u00c1ngela Molina]], who was originally cast in the lead role, withdrew when she learned how explicit the sex scenes were to be.\n\n[[Javier Bardem]] has a small, uncredited role as a corrupt [[gay]] man, one of his first roles on screen.\n\nNeri is dubbed into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by another actress.\n\n== Cuts in UK version ==\nThe film was cut in the [[UK]] by two minutes and 55 seconds by the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]. These cuts include an [[Sadomasochism|S&M]] orgy at a gay club being shortened, a man sexually touching Lulu and a sex scene; these scenes were restored for the 2002 DVD release.

It is based on the homonymous novel by [[Almudena Grandes]]. The film is about the title character's life and sexual awakening in [[Madrid]], which leads to her involvement in increasingly dangerous sexual experimentation.\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe fifteen-year-old Lul\u00fa is seduced by Pablo, her brother Marcelo's best friend, who then leaves to work in the United States.  Lul\u00fa is sustained for years by the belief that Pablo will come back into her life.  When he returns he proposes to her and they are married.  Pablo and Lul\u00fa have a passionate relationship, developing a taste for sexual games.  \n\nOn one nocturnal expedition they join up with a transgender prostitute called Ely who becomes their friend.  The couple have a daughter, Ines.  Pablo convinces Lul\u00fa to participate blindfolded in a threesome; when Lul\u00fa discovers that the third person was Marcelo, her brother, she leaves Pablo in disgust, taking their daughter with her.  However, her own desire to play increasingly dangerous sex games now comes to consume her. \n\nAfter becoming aroused watching a [[gay porn]] movie, she seeks out [[gay]] men and pays them to join in orgies, or watch them having sex.  Unable to pay enough to satisfy her desires, she meets a pimp called Remy who runs a secret [[sadomasochism|S&M]] club.  Ely tries to warn Lul\u00fa that Remy is dangerous, but Lul\u00fa ignores her, so Ely goes to warn Pablo.  Remy tells Lul\u00fa to go to a club, where she is tied up by Jimmy, a gay man she had previously paid for sex. \n\nShe is forced to endure violent sex while gagged and bound.  Ely tells Pablo that Lul\u00fa is in danger.  She goes to the club to rescue her, but is attacked by Jimmy and killed when her head hits a metal bar.  Pablo calls the police, who arrest Jimmy and the others.  Lul\u00fa and Pablo are reunited.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Francesca Neri]] as Lul\u00fa\n* [[\u00d3scar Ladoire]] as Pablo\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Ely\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Jimmy\n* [[Fernando Guill\u00e9n Cuervo]] as Marcelo\n* [[Rosana Pastor]] as Chelo\n* [[Juan Graell]] as Remy\n* [[Rodrigo Valverde]] as Pablito\n* [[Pilar Bardem]] as Encarna\n* [[Marta May]] as Lul\u00fa's mother\n* Gloria Rodriquez as Cristina\n* \u00c1ngel Jov\u00e8 as Alicantino\n* Ainara P\u00e9rez as Lul\u00fa as a child\n* Juan Sala as Lul\u00fa's father\n* Pepa Serrano as Flamenca\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is an adaptation of the international best-selling novel with the same name written by [[Almudena Grandes]]. [[\u00c1ngela Molina]], who was originally cast in the lead role, withdrew when she learned how explicit the sex scenes were to be.\n\n[[Javier Bardem]] has a small, uncredited role as a corrupt [[gay]] man, one of his first roles on screen.\n\nNeri is dubbed into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by another actress.\n\n== Cuts in UK version ==\nThe film was cut in the [[UK]] by two minutes and 55 seconds by the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]. These cuts include an [[Sadomasochism|S&M]] orgy at a gay club being shortened, a man sexually touching Lulu and a sex scene; these scenes were restored for the 2002 DVD release. In addition to these cuts an opening scene in which Lulu is [[Baptism|baptised]] as a baby was cut as the child's genitalia is exposed to camera; this shot is considered to be in breach of the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]].

After the [[A320neo]] launch in December 2010 and its commercial success, [[Air Asia]]'s boss [[Tony Fernandes]] said he would like Airbus to [[re-engine]] the A330.<ref name=Challenges2011/> New engines like the [[GEnx]] or [[Rolls-Royce Trent 1000]] developed for the 787 could offer a 12%\u201315% fuel burn improvement, and [[Wingtip device#Blended winglets|sharklets]] at least 2%.<ref name=AI110718/>\n\nAirbus sales chief [[John Leahy (executive)|John Leahy]]'s argument was that the lower purchase price of an A330 even without new engines make the economics of buying an A330 competitive at midrange routes with that of the Boeing 787.<ref name=AW120709/> An A330neo would accelerate the demise of the similarly-sized [[A350-800]].<ref name=reuters140110/> Airbus also considered re-engining the [[Airbus A380|A380]] but was wary of having two major modification programs simultaneously.<ref name=AW140217/>\n\nIn March 2014, [[Delta Air Lines]] expressed an interest in the A330neo to replace its aging, 20+-year-old [[Boeing 767-300ER]] jets.<ref name=AW140311/> In the 250-300-seat market, [[CIT Group]] believes an A330neo enables profitability on shorter ranges where the longer-range A350 and Boeing 787 aren't optimized. Steve Mason, CIT vice president for aircraft analysis, said: \"The A350-800 is not as efficient as they'd like\". Steven Udvar-Hazy, chairman and CEO of [[Air Lease Corporation|Air Lease Corp]]., said, \"We don't believe it is rational for us to take the A350-800 and the A330neo [...] I don't see the A350-800 surviving if they do the A330neo\".<ref name=AW140324/>\n\n[[AirAsia X]] ended flights to London and Paris from Kuala Lumpur in 2012 because their Airbus A340s weren't fuel-efficient enough; AirAsiaX will try again with A330s.<ref name=WSJ140529/> As Airbus gradually increases output of the new A350, prolonging the production run of the A330 could help to maintain profitability.<ref name=reuters140610/> As [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] cancelled 70 orders for the A350, Airbus said it continued to work on re-engining the smaller A330.<ref name=reuters140611/>\n\n===Launch===\n[[File:Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 tested at Arnold Air Force Base Engineering Development Complex.jpg|thumb|The [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]] being tested at [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]]]]\n\n<!--14 July 2014 -->\nOn 14 July 2014 at the [[Farnborough Airshow]], Airbus launched the A330neo programme, to be powered by the new [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]]. It would improve the [[Fuel economy in aircraft|fuel burn per seat]] by 14%. Airbus hoped to sell 1,000 A330neo aircraft. Its range would increase by {{convert|400|nmi|km}} and although 95% of the parts would be common with the A330ceo, maintenance costs would be lower. New [[winglet]]s, 3.7 metres wider and similar to those of the [[A350 XWB]], still within [[ICAO]] category E airport requirements, along with new engine pylons, would improve aerodynamics by 4%.<ref name=140714PR-living/>\n\nIts development costs were expected to have an impact of around \u22120.7% on Airbus's [[return on sales]] target from 2015 to 2017,<ref name=140714PR-launch/> an estimated $2 billion (\u00a31.18 billion).<ref name=reuters140610/><!-- this estimation is consistent with airbus' 0.7% of its \u20ac64.45Bn 2015 revenue = \u20ac451 million * 3 years = \u20ac1.35Bn --> Airbus stated that lower [[capital cost]] would make the A330neo the most cost-efficient medium-range [[wide-body aircraft]] in the market.<ref name=140714PR-powering/> Airbus said that it could pursue demand for 4,000 aircraft and that there was an open market for 2,600 jets not already addressed by backlogs with operators already using A330s. Aerodynamic modifications would include a re-twisted wing and optimised slats.<ref name=FG140714/>\n\nIn 2014, ''[[The Airline Monitor]]'''s Ed Greenslet stated that the A330neo would have the advantage of not being designed to fly 8,000 nmi, unlike the A350 and Boeing 787 which were thus less economical on shorter routes, although \"the vast majority of long-haul markets is 4,000 nmi or less\".<!--<ref name=AW140714/>--> \nHe also believed that an \"A330neo would enjoy a monopoly in its segment instantly\", with the [[Boeing 767]] \"essentially out of production\", the [[Boeing 757]] not replaced while the [[A321neo]] and the [[737-9]] are smaller and had less range, <!--<ref name=AW140714/>--> and that launching the A330neo would probably kill the smallest A350-800.<ref name=AW140714/>\n\nJohn Leahy estimated that the A330-900 would have operating costs on par with the [[787-9]], but would be available at 25% lower capital costs and could reach a production rate of 10 per month after a 7/8 per month rate at the production start.<ref name=AW140716/> Both A330neo variants were expected to have a maximum take-off weight of 242 t. The type design was frozen in late 2015.<ref name=WSJ140716/>\n\n[[Boeing]] Vice Chairman and Commercial Airplanes CEO [[Ray Conner]] dismissed the A330neo as a 2004 revamp which cannot match the 787's direct [[operating costs]], being {{cvt|20,000|lb|t}} heavier and having a wing only slightly improved from the 1980s design, and claimed the 787-10 was almost 30% more [[fuel economy in aircraft|efficient]] per-seat than the previous A330-300 and that a new engine would not close the gap \u2013 but he acknowledged that it could be a threat as it put pressure on Boeing as it sought to

After the [[A320neo]] launch in December 2010 and its commercial success, [[Air Asia]]'s boss [[Tony Fernandes]] said he would like Airbus to [[re-engine]] the A330.<ref name=Challenges2011/> New engines like the [[GEnx]] or [[Rolls-Royce Trent 1000]] developed for the 787 could offer a 12%\u201315% fuel burn improvement, and [[Wingtip device#Blended winglets|sharklets]] at least 2%.<ref name=AI110718/>\n\nAirbus sales chief [[John Leahy (executive)|John Leahy]]'s argument was that the lower purchase price of an A330 even without new engines make the economics of buying an A330 competitive at midrange routes with that of the Boeing 787.<ref name=AW120709/> An A330neo would accelerate the demise of the similarly-sized [[A350-800]].<ref name=reuters140110/> Airbus also considered re-engining the [[Airbus A380|A380]] but was wary of having two major modification programs simultaneously.<ref name=AW140217/>\n\nIn March 2014, [[Delta Air Lines]] expressed an interest in the A330neo to replace its aging, 20+-year-old [[Boeing 767-300ER]] jets.<ref name=AW140311/> In the 250-300-seat market, [[CIT Group]] believes an A330neo enables profitability on shorter ranges where the longer-range A350 and Boeing 787 aren't optimized. Steve Mason, CIT vice president for aircraft analysis, said: \"The A350-800 is not as efficient as they'd like\". Steven Udvar-Hazy, chairman and CEO of [[Air Lease Corporation|Air Lease Corp]]., said, \"We don't believe it is rational for us to take the A350-800 and the A330neo [...] I don't see the A350-800 surviving if they do the A330neo\".<ref name=AW140324/>\n\n[[AirAsia X]] ended flights to London and Paris from Kuala Lumpur in 2012 because their Airbus A340s weren't fuel-efficient enough; AirAsiaX will try again with A330s.<ref name=WSJ140529/> As Airbus gradually increases output of the new A350, prolonging the production run of the A330 could help to maintain profitability.<ref name=reuters140610/> As [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] cancelled 70 orders for the A350, Airbus said it continued to work on re-engining the smaller A330.<ref name=reuters140611/>\n\n===Launch===\n[[File:Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 tested at Arnold Air Force Base Engineering Development Complex.jpg|thumb|The [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]] being tested at [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]]]]\n\n<!--14 July 2014 -->\nOn 14 July 2014 at the [[Farnborough Airshow]], Airbus launched the A330neo programme, to be powered by the new [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]]. It would improve the [[Fuel economy in aircraft|fuel burn per seat]] by 14%. Airbus hoped to sell 1,000 A330neo aircraft. Its range would increase by {{convert|400|nmi|km}} and although 95% of the parts would be common with the A330ceo, maintenance costs would be lower. New [[winglet]]s, 3.7 metres wider and similar to those of the [[A350 XWB]], still within [[ICAO]] category E airport requirements, along with new engine pylons, would improve aerodynamics by 4%.<ref name=140714PR-living/>\n\nIts development costs were expected to have an impact of around \u22120.7% on Airbus's [[return on sales]] target from 2015 to 2017,<ref name=140714PR-launch/> an estimated $2 billion (\u00a31.18 billion).<ref name=reuters140610/><!-- this estimation is consistent with airbus' 0.7% of its \u20ac64.45Bn 2015 revenue = \u20ac451 million * 3 years = \u20ac1.35Bn --> Airbus stated that lower [[capital cost]] would make the A330neo the most cost-efficient medium-range [[wide-body aircraft]] in the market.<ref name=140714PR-powering/> Airbus said that it could pursue demand for 4,000 aircraft and that there was an open market for 2,600 jets not already addressed by backlogs with operators already using A330s. Aerodynamic modifications would include a re-twisted wing and optimised slats.<ref name=FG140714/>\n\nIn 2014, ''[[The Airline Monitor]]'''s Ed Greenslet stated that the A330neo would have the advantage of not being designed to fly 8,000 nmi, unlike the A350 and Boeing 787 which were thus less economical on shorter routes, although \"the vast majority of long-haul markets is 4,000 nmi or less\".<!--<ref name=AW140714/>--> \nHe also believed that an \"A330neo would enjoy a monopoly in its segment instantly\", with the [[Boeing 767]] \"essentially out of production\", the [[Boeing 757]] not replaced while the [[A321neo]] and the [[737-9]] are smaller and had less range, <!--<ref name=AW140714/>--> and that launching the A330neo would probably kill the smallest A350-800.<ref name=AW140714/>\n\nJohn Leahy estimated that the A330-900 would have operating costs on par with the [[787-9]], but would be available at 25% lower capital costs and could reach a production rate of 10 per month after a 7/8 per month rate at the production start.<ref name=AW140716/> Both A330neo variants were expected to have a maximum take-off weight of 242 t. The type design was frozen in late 2015.<ref name=WSJ140716/>\n\n[[Boeing]] Vice Chairman and Commercial Airplanes CEO [[Ray Conner]] dismissed the A330neo as a 2004 revamp which cannot match the 787's direct [[operating costs]], being {{cvt|20,000|lb|t}} heavier and having a wing only slightly improved from the 1980s design, and claimed the 787-10 was almost 30% more [[fuel economy in aircraft|efficient]] per-seat than the previous A330-300 and that a new engine would not close the gap \u2013 but he acknowledged that it could be a threat as it put pressure on Boeing as it sought to [[break even]] after 850\u20131,000 787 deliveries.<ref name=AW140721/>\n\n=== Production ===\n[[File:TAP Portugal A330neo interior ITB 2017.JPG|thumb|TAP Air Portugal interior mockup at [[ITB

A group of reformers, united around the young Ivan and known as the \"Chosen Council\", declared him Tsar (Emperor) of [[Kievan Rus'|All Rus']] in 1547 at the age of sixteen, establishing the [[Tsardom of Russia]] with Moscow as the predominant state. Ivan's reign was characterized by Russia's transformation from a [[medieval]] state into an [[empire]] under the Tsar, though at immense cost to its people and its broader, long-term economy. In the young years of Ivan, there was a conquest of the [[Khanate]]s of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Khanate of Astrakhan|Astrakhan]]. After consolidating his power, Ivan got rid of the advisers from the \"Chosen Council\" and triggered the [[Livonian War]], which ravaged Russia and resulted in the loss of [[Livonia]] and [[Ingria]], but allowed him to establish greater [[Autocracy|autocratic control]] over [[Russian nobility|Russia's nobility]], whom he violently purged in the ''[[Oprichnina]]''. The later years of Ivan's reign were also marked by the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] and the [[Russo-Crimean Wars#Russo\u2013Crimean War (1570\u20131572)|burning of Moscow by Tatars]].  Ivan was a patron of [[trade]] (he gave monopoly to [[Muscovy Company]]), and the founder of Russia's first [[publishing house]], the [[Moscow Print Yard]].\n\nHistoric sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality: he was described as intelligent and devout, but also prone to [[paranoia]], [[Rage (emotion)|rages]], and episodic outbreaks of [[mental instability]] that increased with age.<ref>Shvidkovski\u012d, Dmitri\u012d Olegovich (2007) ''Russian Architecture and the West''.

He was the first to be crowned as \"Tsar of All the Russias\", imitating in part his grandfather, [[Ivan III the Great]], who had title Grand Prince of all Rus'. Prior to that, rulers of [[Muscovy]] were crowned as Grand Princes, although [[Ivan III the Great]],  styled himself \"[[tsar]]\" in his correspondence. Two weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife [[Anastasia Romanovna]], a member of the [[Romanov family]], who became the first Russian [[tsaritsa]].\n\nBy being crowned Tsar, Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia: he was now the only supreme ruler of the country, and his will was not to be questioned. \"The new title symbolized an assumption of powers equivalent and parallel to those held by former Byzantine Emperor and the Tatar Khan, both known in Russian sources as Tsar. The political effect was to elevate Ivan's position.\"<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 377</ref> The new title not only secured the throne, but it also granted Ivan a new dimension of power, one intimately tied to religion. He was now a \"divine\" leader appointed to enact God's will, as \"church texts described Old Testament kings as 'Tsars' and Christ as the Heavenly Tsar.\"<ref>[[#Bogatyrev|Bogatyrev]], p. 245</ref> The newly appointed title was then passed on from generation to generation: \"succeeding Muscovite rulers ... benefited from the divine nature of the power of the Russian monarch ... crystallized during Ivan's reign.\"<ref name=\"Bogatyrev, Sergei 1584\" />\n\n==Domestic policy==\n[[File:Vasnetsov Ioann 4.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Ivan IV by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], 1897 ([[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow)]]\n\nDespite calamities triggered by the [[Fire of Moscow (1547)|Great Fire of 1547]], the early part of Ivan's reign was one of peaceful reforms and modernization.

He introduced local self-government to rural regions, mainly in the northeast of Russia, populated by the state peasantry.\n\nBy Ivan's order in 1553 the [[Moscow Print Yard]] was established and the first [[printing press]] was introduced to Russia. Several religious books in Russian were printed during the 1550s and 1560s. The new technology provoked discontent among traditional scribes, leading to the Print Yard being burned in an arson attack. The first Russian printers, [[Ivan Fedorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]] and [[Pyotr Mstislavets]], were forced to flee from Moscow to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Nevertheless, printing of books resumed from 1568 onwards, with Andronik Timofeevich Nevezha and his son Ivan now heading the Print Yard.\n\nIvan had [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of [[Kazan]]. There is a false legend that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architect, [[Postnik Yakovlev]], blinded so that he could never design anything as beautiful again. In reality, Postnik Yakovlev went on to design more churches for Ivan and the walls of the [[Kazan Kremlin]] in the early 1560s, as well as the chapel over St. Basil's grave that was added to St. Basil's Cathedral in 1588, several years after Ivan's death. Although more than one architect was associated with this name and constructions, it is believed that the principal architect is one and the same person.<ref>[https://slovar.cc/enc/bse/2031865.html \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a].

While on his presumed deathbed, Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused, deeming the Tsar's health too hopeless for him to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and assassinations, including those of [[Metropolitan Philip]] and Prince [[Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} -->\n\n===Oprichnina===\n{{Main|Oprichnina}}\n\nThe 1560s brought to Russia hardships that led to a dramatic change of Ivan's policies. Russia was devastated by a combination of drought and famine, unsuccessful wars against the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Tatar invasions]] and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, Poles and the [[Hanseatic League]]. His first wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna]], died in 1560, and her death was suspected to be a poisoning. This personal tragedy deeply hurt Ivan and it is thought to have affected his personality, if not his mental health. At the same time, one of Ivan's advisors, Prince [[Andrei Kurbsky]], defected to the Lithuanians, took command of the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of [[Velikiye Luki]]. This series of treasons made Ivan paranoically suspicious of nobility.\n\n[[File:0NevrevNV Oprichniki BISH.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''The Oprichniki'' by [[Nikolai Nevrev]].

From there he sent two letters in which he announced his [[abdication]] because of the alleged embezzlement and treason of the aristocracy and clergy. The [[boyar]] court was unable to rule in Ivan's absence and feared the wrath of the Muscovite citizenry. A boyar envoy departed for Aleksandrova Sloboda to beg Ivan to return to the throne.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 176\u2013178</ref><ref name=\"Pavlov\">Pavlov, Andrei and Perrie, Maureen (2003) ''Ivan the Terrible (Profiles in Power)''.

He demanded that he should be able to execute and confiscate the estates of traitors without interference from the boyar council or church. Upon this, Ivan decreed the creation of the oprichnina.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\nThe oprichnina consisted of a separate territory within the borders of Russia, mostly in the territory of the former [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north. Ivan held exclusive power over the oprichnina territory. The Boyar Council ruled the zemshchina ('land'), the second division of the state. Ivan also recruited a personal guard known as the [[Oprichniki]]. Originally it was a thousand strong.<ref name=Pavlov/><ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 182\u2013183</ref> The oprichniki were headed by [[Malyuta Skuratov]]. One known oprichnik was the German adventurer [[Heinrich von Staden (author)|Heinrich von Staden]]. The oprichniki enjoyed social and economic privileges under the oprichnina. They owed their allegiance and status to Ivan, not to heredity or local bonds.<ref name=Pavlov/>\n\nThe first wave of persecutions targeted primarily the princely clans of Russia, notably the influential families of Suzdal. Ivan executed, exiled or forcibly [[tonsure]]d prominent members of the boyar clans on questionable accusations of conspiracy. Among those executed were the [[Metropolitan Philip]] and the prominent warlord [[Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky]]. In 1566 Ivan extended the oprichnina to eight central districts. Of the 12,000 nobles there, 570 became oprichniks, and the rest were expelled.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], p. 183; as the tonsure was the distinctive hairstyle of monastic orders, a forcibly \"tonsured\" boyar was effectively exiled from power by being made to enter a monastic life.</ref>\n\nUnder the new political system, the Oprichniki were given large estates, but unlike the previous landlords, could not be held accountable for their actions. These men \"took virtually all the peasants possessed, forcing them to pay 'in one year as much as [they] used to pay in ten.{{' \"}}<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 410</ref> This degree of oppression resulted in increasing cases of peasants fleeing, which in turn led to a drop in the overall production. The price of grain increased by a factor of ten.\n\n===Sack of Novgorod===\n{{Main|Massacre of Novgorod}}\n\nConditions under the Oprichnina were worsened by the 1570 epidemic, a plague that killed 10,000 people in Novgorod, and 600\u20131,000 daily in Moscow. During the grim conditions of the epidemic, and a famine along with the ongoing [[Livonian War]], Ivan grew suspicious that noblemen of the wealthy city of Novgorod were planning to defect, placing the city itself into the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A Novgorod citizen Petr Volynets warned the tsar about the alleged conspiracy (though modern historians believe that his report was false). In 1570 Ivan ordered the Oprichniki to raid the city. The Oprichniki burned and pillaged Novgorod and the surrounding villages, and the city was never to regain its former prominence.<ref name=\"Novgorod1911\">{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Novgorod (town) |display=Novgorod |volume=19 |pages=839\u2013840 |first1=Peter |last1=Kropotkin |first2=John Thomas |last2=Bealby}}</ref>\n\nCasualty figures vary greatly from different sources.

During the [[Russo-Crimean War (1571)|1571\u201372 Russo-Crimean war]], oprichniks failed to prove themselves worthy against a regular army. In 1572, Ivan abolished the Oprichnina and disbanded his oprichniks.\n\n===Pretended resignation===\nIn 1575, Ivan once again pretended to resign from his title and proclaimed [[Simeon Bekbulatovich]], his statesman of Tatar origin, the new Tsar. Simeon reigned as a figurehead leader for a year. According to English envoy [[Giles Fletcher, the Elder]], under Ivan's instructions Simeon confiscated all of the lands that belonged to monasteries, while Ivan pretended to disagree with the decision. When the throne was returned to Ivan in 1576, he returned some of the confiscated land, keeping the rest.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n\n===Diplomacy and trade===\n[[File:Ivan the Terrible and Harsey.jpg|thumb|300px|''Ivan the Terrible Showing His Treasures to [[Jerome Horsey]]'' by [[Alexander Litovchenko]] (1875)]]\n\nIn 1547, Hans Schlitte, the agent of Ivan, recruited craftsmen in Germany for work in Russia. However, all these craftsmen were arrested in [[L\u00fcbeck]] at the request of Poland and [[Livonia]]. The German merchant companies ignored the new [[Ivangorod|port built by Ivan]] on the [[Narva River|River Narva]] in 1550 and continued to deliver goods in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] ports owned by Livonia. Russia remained isolated from sea trade.\n\nIvan established close ties with the [[Kingdom of England]]. Russo-English relations can be traced to 1551, when the [[Muscovy Company]] was formed by [[Richard Chancellor]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]] and several London merchants. In 1553, [[Richard Chancellor]] sailed to the [[White Sea]] and continued overland to Moscow, where he visited Ivan's court. Ivan opened up the White Sea and the port of [[Arkhangelsk]] to the Company and granted the Company privilege of trading throughout his reign without paying the standard customs fees.<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 407.</ref> Muscovy Company retained the monopoly in Russo-English trade until 1698.\n\nWith the use of English merchants, Ivan engaged in a long correspondence with [[Elizabeth I of England]]. While the queen focused on commerce, Ivan was more interested in a military alliance. During his troubled relations with the boyars, the tsar even asked her for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardized. Elizabeth agreed on condition that he provided for himself during his stay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russians in London: Government in exile|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21692934-new-generation-migr-s-has-plans-homeland-they-never-wanted-flee-government|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIvan IV corresponded with overseas Orthodox leaders. In response to a letter of [[Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria]] asking the Tsar for financial assistance for the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which had suffered from the Turks, Ivan IV sent in 1558 a delegation to [[Egypt Eyalet]]  by archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in [[Constantinople]] before he could reach Egypt. From then on the embassy was headed by [[Smolensk]] merchant Vasily Poznyakov.

In 1521 the combined forces of Khan [[Mehmed I Giray|Mehmed Giray]] and his Crimean allies attacked Russia, captured more than 150,000 slaves ''The Full Collection of the Russian Annals'', vol.13, SPb, 1904</ref> In the 1530s the Crimean khan formed an offensive alliance with [[Safa Giray of Kazan]], his relative. When Safa Giray invaded [[Muscovy]] in December 1540, the Russians used [[Qasim Tatars]] to contain him. After his advance was stalled near Murom, Safa Giray was forced to withdraw to his own borders.\n\nThese reverses undermined Safa Giray's authority in Kazan. A pro-Russian party, represented by [[Shahgali]], gained enough popular support to make several attempts to take over the Kazan throne. In 1545 Ivan IV mounted an expedition to the [[River Volga]] to show his support for pro-Russian factions.\n\nIn 1551 the tsar sent his envoy to the [[Nogai Horde]] and they promised to maintain neutrality during the impending war. The [[Ar begs]] and [[Udmurts]] submitted to Russian authority as well. In 1551 the wooden fort of [[Sviyazhsk]] was transported down the Volga from [[Uglich]] all the way to Kazan. It was used as the Russian ''place d'armes'' during the decisive campaign of 1552.\n\nOn 16 June 1552 Ivan IV led a strong Russian army towards Kazan. The last siege of the Tatar capital commenced on 30 August. Under the supervision of Prince [[Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky]], the Russians used [[battering ram]]s and a [[siege tower]], [[Mining (military)|undermining]] and 150 cannons. The Russians also had the advantage of efficient [[military engineer]]s. The city's water supply was blocked and the walls were breached. Kazan finally fell on 2 October, its fortifications were razed, and much of the population massacred. Many Russian prisoners and slaves were released. The Tsar celebrated his victory over Kazan by building several churches with oriental features, most famously [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on [[Red Square]] in Moscow. The fall of Kazan was only the beginning of a series of so-called \"Cheremis wars\". The attempts of the Moscow government to gain a foothold on the Middle Volga over and over again provoked uprisings of local peoples, which it was possible to suppress only with great difficulty. In 1557, the [[Kazan rebellion of 1552\u20131556|First Cheremis War]] ended and also the [[Bashkirs]] accepted Ivan IV's authority.\n\nIn two campaigns of 1554 and 1556, Russian troops conquered the [[Astrakhan Khanate]] at the base of the Volga River, and the new [[Astrakhan]] fortress was built in 1558 by [[Ivan Vyrodkov]] instead of the old Tatar capital. The annexation of the Tatar khanates meant the conquest of vast territories, access to large markets and control of the entire length of the Volga River.

The results presaged the many disasters to come. A plan to unite the Volga and Don by a canal was detailed in [[Constantinople]].

The war ultimately proved unsuccessful, stretching on for 24 years and engaging the [[History of Sweden (1523\u20131611)|Kingdom of Sweden]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Teutonic Knights]] of [[Livonia]]. The prolonged war had nearly destroyed the economy, while the ''Oprichnina'' had thoroughly disrupted the government. Meanwhile, the [[Union of Lublin]] had united the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], and the Commonwealth acquired an energetic leader, [[Stefan Batory]], who was supported by Russia's southern enemy, the Ottoman Empire. Ivan's realm was being squeezed by two of the great powers of the time.\n\nAfter rejected peace proposals from his enemies, Ivan IV found himself in a difficult position by 1579. The displaced refugees fleeing the war compounded the effects of the simultaneous drought, and exacerbated war engendered epidemics, causing much loss of life.\n\nBatory then launched a series of offensives against Muscovy in the campaign seasons of 1579\u201381, trying to cut the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Muscovite territories. During his first offensive in 1579, he retook [[Polotsk]] with 22,000 men. During the second, in 1580, he took [[Velikie Luki]] with a 29,000-strong force. Finally, he began the [[Siege of Pskov]] in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army. [[Narva]] in [[Estonia]] was reconquered by Sweden in 1581.\n\nUnlike Sweden and Poland, Denmark under [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden]], in 1580, transferring the Danish titles of Livonia to John III. Muscovy recognized Polish\u2013Lithuanian control of Livonia only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]], brother of Fredrick II and former ally of Ivan, died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the [[Duchy of Courland]], and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance.

Khan [[Devlet I Giray]] of Crimea repeatedly raided the Moscow region. In 1571, the 40,000-strong Crimean and Turkish army launched a large-scale raid. Due to the ongoing Livonian War, Moscow's garrison was as small as 6,000, and could not even delay the Tatar approach. Unresisted, Devlet devastated unprotected towns and villages around Moscow and caused the [[Fire of Moscow (1571)|1571 Fire of Moscow]]. Historians estimate the number of casualties of the fire from 10,000 to as many 80,000 people.\n\nTo buy peace from Devlet Giray, Ivan was forced to relinquish his claims on [[Astrakhan]] in favor of the Crimean Khanate (although this proposed transfer was only a diplomatic maneuver and was never actually completed). This defeat angered Ivan. Between 1571 and 1572, preparations were made upon his orders. In addition to [[Zasechnaya cherta]], innovative fortifications were set beyond the [[Oka River|River Oka]] that defined the border.\n\nThe following year, Devlet launched another raid on Moscow, now with a numerous horde,<ref>120,000-strong, according to Russian cronicles // \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c. \u0413\u043e\u0434 7080(1572). \u041f\u0421\u0420\u041b \u0442.

The Russian army, led by Prince [[Mikhail Vorotynsky]], was half the size; yet it was an experienced army, supported by [[streltsy]] equipped with modern firearms and [[gulyay-gorod]]s. In addition, this time it was not artificially divided into two parts (the \"oprichnina\" and \"zemsky\") as it was during the defeat of 1571.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=427}} On 27 July the horde broke through the defensive line along the [[Oka River]] and moved towards Moscow. The Russian troops did not have time to intercept it, but the regiment of Prince Khvorostinin vigorously attacked the Tatars from the rear. The Khan stopped only 30&nbsp;km from Moscow and brought down his entire army back on the Russians, who managed to take up defense near the [[Battle of Molodi|village of Molodi]]. After several days of heavy fighting, on 2 August Mikhail Vorotynsky with the main part of the army flanked the Tatars and dealt a sudden blow, while Khvorostinin made a [[Sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] from the fortifications. Tatars were completely defeated and fled.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=417-421}} The next year Ivan the Terrible, who was sitting out in distant Novgorod during the battle, killed Mikhail Vorotynsky.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=439-441}}\n\n===Conquest of Siberia===\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia}}\n\nDuring Ivan's reign, Russia started a large-scale exploration and colonization of [[Siberia]]. In 1555, shortly after the conquest of Kazan, the Siberian khan Yadegar and the [[Nogai Horde]] under Khan Ismail pledged their allegiance to Ivan, in hope that he would help them against their opponents. However, Yadegar failed to gather the full sum of tribute he proposed to the tsar, so Ivan did nothing to save his inefficient vassal. In 1563 Yadegar was overthrown and killed by [[Khan Kuchum]], who denied any tribute to Moscow.\n\nIn 1558 Ivan gave the [[Stroganov family|Stroganov merchant family]] the patent for colonising \"the abundant region along the Kama River\", and in 1574, lands over the [[Ural Mountains]] along the rivers [[Tura River|Tura]] and [[Tobol]]. They also received permission to build forts along the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] rivers. Around 1577, the Stroganovs engaged the Cossack leader [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] to protect their lands from attacks of the Siberian [[Khan Kuchum]].\n\nIn 1580 Yermak started his conquest of Siberia. With some 540 [[Cossack]]s, he started to penetrate territories that were tributary to Kuchum. Yermak pressured and persuaded the various family-based tribes to change their loyalties and become tributaries of Russia. Some agreed voluntarily, under better terms than with Kuchum; others were forced. He also established distant forts in the newly conquered lands. The campaign was successful, and the Cossacks managed to defeat the Siberian army in the [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]], but Yermak was still in need for reinforcements. He sent an envoy to Ivan the Terrible, with a message that proclaimed Yermak-conquered Siberia a part of Russia, to the dismay of the Stroganovs, who had planned to keep Siberia for themselves. Ivan agreed to reinforce the Cossacks with his streltsy, but the detachment sent to Siberia died of starvation without any benefit. Cossacks were defeated by the local peoples, Ermak died and the survivors immediately left Siberia. Only in 1586 (two years after the death of Ivan) did the Russians manage to gain a foothold in Siberia by founding the city of [[Tyumen]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages and children===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Grigory Sedov - Ivan the Terrible admiring Vasilisa Melentieva.jpg|thumb|280px|Tsar Ivan IV admires his sixth wife [[Vasilisa Melentyeva]]. 1875 painting by [[Grigory Sedov]].]]\n[[File:Iv\u00e1n el Terrible y su hijo, por Ili\u00e1 Repin.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan|Ivan the Terrible with his dying son]]; painting by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\nIvan the Terrible had four legitimate wives, three of them were poisoned, presumably, by his enemies or the royal families, who wanted to promote their daughters to the tzar's brides.<ref name=rbth>{{cite web\n |author      =Manaev, G.\n |url         = https://www.rbth.com/history/329825-madness-of-3-russian-tsars\n |title       = The madness of 3 Russian tsars, and the truth behind it\n |publisher   = Russia Beyond the Headlines\n |date        = 2019-01-07\n |accessdate  = 2020-01-29\n}}</ref>\n\n# [[Anastasia Romanovna]] (in 1547\u20131560, death):\n#* Tsarevna Anna Ivanovna (10 August 1548{{spaced ndash}}20 July 1550)\n#* Tsarevna Maria Ivanovna (17 March 1551{{spaced ndash}}young)\n#* [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (1552\u20131553)|Tsarevich Dmitri Ivanovich]] (October 1552{{spaced ndash}}26 June 1553)\n#* [[Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich of Russia|Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich]] (28 March 1554{{spaced ndash}}19 November 1581)\n#* Tsarevna Eudoxia Ivanovna (26 February 1556{{spaced ndash}}June 1558)\n#* Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia]] (31 May 1557{{spaced ndash}}6 January 1598)\n# [[Maria Temryukovna]] (in 1561\u20131569, death):\n#* Tsarevich Vasili Ivanovich (21 March 1563{{spaced ndash}}3 May 1563)\n# [[Marfa Sobakina]] (28 October \u2013 13 November 1571, death)\n# [[Anna Koltovskaya]] (in 1572, sent to monastery).

A group of reformers, united around the young Ivan and known as the \"Chosen Council\", declared him Tsar (Emperor) of [[Kievan Rus'|All Rus']] in 1547 at the age of sixteen, establishing the [[Tsardom of Russia]] with Moscow as the predominant state. Ivan's reign was characterized by Russia's transformation from a [[medieval]] state into an [[empire]] under the Tsar, though at immense cost to its people and its broader, long-term economy. In the young years of Ivan, there was a conquest of the [[Khanate]]s of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Khanate of Astrakhan|Astrakhan]]. After consolidating his power, Ivan got rid of the advisers from the \"Chosen Council\" and triggered the [[Livonian War]], which ravaged Russia and resulted in the loss of [[Livonia]] and [[Ingria]], but allowed him to establish greater [[Autocracy|autocratic control]] over [[Russian nobility|Russia's nobility]], whom he violently purged in the ''[[Oprichnina]]''. The later years of Ivan's reign were also marked by the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] and the [[Russo-Crimean Wars#Russo\u2013Crimean War (1570\u20131572)|burning of Moscow by Tatars]].  Ivan was a patron of [[trade]] (he gave monopoly to [[Muscovy Company]]), and the founder of Russia's first [[publishing house]], the [[Moscow Print Yard]].\n\nHistoric sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality: he was described as intelligent and devout, but also prone to [[paranoia]], [[Rage (emotion)|rages]], and episodic outbreaks of [[mental instability]] that increased with age.<ref>Shvidkovski\u012d, Dmitri\u012d Olegovich (2007) ''Russian Architecture and the West''.

He was the first to be crowned as \"Tsar of All the Russias\", imitating in part his grandfather, [[Ivan III the Great]], who had title Grand Prince of all Rus'. Prior to that, rulers of [[Muscovy]] were crowned as Grand Princes, although [[Ivan III the Great]],  styled himself \"[[tsar]]\" in his correspondence. Two weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife [[Anastasia Romanovna]], a member of the [[Romanov family]], who became the first Russian [[tsaritsa]].\n\nBy being crowned Tsar, Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia: he was now the only supreme ruler of the country, and his will was not to be questioned. \"The new title symbolized an assumption of powers equivalent and parallel to those held by former Byzantine Emperor and the Tatar Khan, both known in Russian sources as Tsar.

He introduced local self-government to rural regions, mainly in the northeast of Russia, populated by the state peasantry.\n\nBy Ivan's order in 1553 the [[Moscow Print Yard]] was established and the first [[printing press]] was introduced to Russia. Several religious books in Russian were printed during the 1550s and 1560s. The new technology provoked discontent among traditional scribes, leading to the Print Yard being burned in an arson attack. The first Russian printers, [[Ivan Fedorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]] and [[Pyotr Mstislavets]], were forced to flee from Moscow to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Nevertheless, printing of books resumed from 1568 onwards, with Andronik Timofeevich Nevezha and his son Ivan now heading the Print Yard.\n\nIvan had [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of [[Kazan]]. There is a false legend that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architect, [[Postnik Yakovlev]], blinded so that he could never design anything as beautiful again. In reality, Postnik Yakovlev went on to design more churches for Ivan and the walls of the [[Kazan Kremlin]] in the early 1560s, as well as the chapel over St. Basil's grave that was added to St. Basil's Cathedral in 1588, several years after Ivan's death. Although more than one architect was associated with this name and constructions, it is believed that the principal architect is one and the same person.<ref>[https://slovar.cc/enc/bse/2031865.html \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a].

While on his presumed deathbed, Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused, deeming the Tsar's health too hopeless for him to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and assassinations, including those of [[Metropolitan Philip]] and Prince [[Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} -->\n\n===Oprichnina===\n{{Main|Oprichnina}}\n\nThe 1560s brought to Russia hardships that led to a dramatic change of Ivan's policies. Russia was devastated by a combination of drought and famine, unsuccessful wars against the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Tatar invasions]] and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, Poles and the [[Hanseatic League]]. His first wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna]], died in 1560, and her death was suspected to be a poisoning. This personal tragedy deeply hurt Ivan and it is thought to have affected his personality, if not his mental health. At the same time, one of Ivan's advisors, Prince [[Andrei Kurbsky]], defected to the Lithuanians, took command of the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of [[Velikiye Luki]]. This series of treasons made Ivan paranoically suspicious of nobility.\n\n[[File:0NevrevNV Oprichniki BISH.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''The Oprichniki'' by [[Nikolai Nevrev]].

From there he sent two letters in which he announced his [[abdication]] because of the alleged embezzlement and treason of the aristocracy and clergy. The [[boyar]] court was unable to rule in Ivan's absence and feared the wrath of the Muscovite citizenry. A boyar envoy departed for Aleksandrova Sloboda to beg Ivan to return to the throne.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 176\u2013178</ref><ref name=\"Pavlov\">Pavlov, Andrei and Perrie, Maureen (2003) ''Ivan the Terrible (Profiles in Power)''.

He demanded that he should be able to execute and confiscate the estates of traitors without interference from the boyar council or church. Upon this, Ivan decreed the creation of the oprichnina.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\nThe oprichnina consisted of a separate territory within the borders of Russia, mostly in the territory of the former [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north. Ivan held exclusive power over the oprichnina territory. The Boyar Council ruled the zemshchina ('land'), the second division of the state. Ivan also recruited a personal guard known as the [[Oprichniki]]. Originally it was a thousand strong.<ref name=Pavlov/><ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 182\u2013183</ref> The oprichniki were headed by [[Malyuta Skuratov]]. One known oprichnik was the German adventurer [[Heinrich von Staden (author)|Heinrich von Staden]]. The oprichniki enjoyed social and economic privileges under the oprichnina. They owed their allegiance and status to Ivan, not to heredity or local bonds.<ref name=Pavlov/>\n\nThe first wave of persecutions targeted primarily the princely clans of Russia, notably the influential families of Suzdal. Ivan executed, exiled or forcibly [[tonsure]]d prominent members of the boyar clans on questionable accusations of conspiracy. Among those executed were the [[Metropolitan Philip]] and the prominent warlord [[Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky]]. In 1566 Ivan extended the oprichnina to eight central districts. Of the 12,000 nobles there, 570 became oprichniks, and the rest were expelled.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], p. 183; as the tonsure was the distinctive hairstyle of monastic orders, a forcibly \"tonsured\" boyar was effectively exiled from power by being made to enter a monastic life.</ref>\n\nUnder the new political system, the Oprichniki were given large estates, but unlike the previous landlords, could not be held accountable for their actions. These men \"took virtually all the peasants possessed, forcing them to pay 'in one year as much as [they] used to pay in ten.{{' \"}}<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 410</ref> This degree of oppression resulted in increasing cases of peasants fleeing, which in turn led to a drop in the overall production. The price of grain increased by a factor of ten.\n\n===Sack of Novgorod===\n{{Main|Massacre of Novgorod}}\n\nConditions under the Oprichnina were worsened by the 1570 epidemic, a plague that killed 10,000 people in Novgorod, and 600\u20131,000 daily in Moscow. During the grim conditions of the epidemic, and a famine along with the ongoing [[Livonian War]], Ivan grew suspicious that noblemen of the wealthy city of Novgorod were planning to defect, placing the city itself into the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A Novgorod citizen Petr Volynets warned the tsar about the alleged conspiracy (though modern historians believe that his report was false). In 1570 Ivan ordered the Oprichniki to raid the city. The Oprichniki burned and pillaged Novgorod and the surrounding villages, and the city was never to regain its former prominence.<ref name=\"Novgorod1911\">{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Novgorod (town) |display=Novgorod |volume=19 |pages=839\u2013840 |first1=Peter |last1=Kropotkin |first2=John Thomas |last2=Bealby}}</ref>\n\nCasualty figures vary greatly from different sources.

During the [[Russo-Crimean War (1571)|1571\u201372 Russo-Crimean war]], oprichniks failed to prove themselves worthy against a regular army. In 1572, Ivan abolished the Oprichnina and disbanded his oprichniks.\n\n===Pretended resignation===\nIn 1575, Ivan once again pretended to resign from his title and proclaimed [[Simeon Bekbulatovich]], his statesman of Tatar origin, the new Tsar. Simeon reigned as a figurehead leader for a year. According to English envoy [[Giles Fletcher, the Elder]], under Ivan's instructions Simeon confiscated all of the lands that belonged to monasteries, while Ivan pretended to disagree with the decision. When the throne was returned to Ivan in 1576, he returned some of the confiscated land, keeping the rest.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n\n===Diplomacy and trade===\n[[File:Ivan the Terrible and Harsey.jpg|thumb|300px|''Ivan the Terrible Showing His Treasures to [[Jerome Horsey]]'' by [[Alexander Litovchenko]] (1875)]]\n\nIn 1547, Hans Schlitte, the agent of Ivan, recruited craftsmen in Germany for work in Russia. However, all these craftsmen were arrested in [[L\u00fcbeck]] at the request of Poland and [[Livonia]]. The German merchant companies ignored the new [[Ivangorod|port built by Ivan]] on the [[Narva River|River Narva]] in 1550 and continued to deliver goods in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] ports owned by Livonia. Russia remained isolated from sea trade.\n\nIvan established close ties with the [[Kingdom of England]]. Russo-English relations can be traced to 1551, when the [[Muscovy Company]] was formed by [[Richard Chancellor]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]] and several London merchants. In 1553, [[Richard Chancellor]] sailed to the [[White Sea]] and continued overland to Moscow, where he visited Ivan's court. Ivan opened up the White Sea and the port of [[Arkhangelsk]] to the Company and granted the Company privilege of trading throughout his reign without paying the standard customs fees.<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 407.</ref> Muscovy Company retained the monopoly in Russo-English trade until 1698.\n\nWith the use of English merchants, Ivan engaged in a long correspondence with [[Elizabeth I of England]]. While the queen focused on commerce, Ivan was more interested in a military alliance. During his troubled relations with the boyars, the tsar even asked her for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardized. Elizabeth agreed on condition that he provided for himself during his stay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russians in London: Government in exile|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21692934-new-generation-migr-s-has-plans-homeland-they-never-wanted-flee-government|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIvan IV corresponded with overseas Orthodox leaders.

From then on the embassy was headed by [[Smolensk]] merchant Vasily Poznyakov.

In 1521 the combined forces of Khan [[Mehmed I Giray|Mehmed Giray]] and his Crimean allies attacked Russia, captured more than 150,000 slaves ''The Full Collection of the Russian Annals'', vol.13, SPb, 1904</ref> In the 1530s the Crimean khan formed an offensive alliance with [[Safa Giray of Kazan]], his relative. When Safa Giray invaded [[Muscovy]] in December 1540, the Russians used [[Qasim Tatars]] to contain him. After his advance was stalled near Murom, Safa Giray was forced to withdraw to his own borders.\n\nThese reverses undermined Safa Giray's authority in Kazan. A pro-Russian party, represented by [[Shahgali]], gained enough popular support to make several attempts to take over the Kazan throne. In 1545 Ivan IV mounted an expedition to the [[River Volga]] to show his support for pro-Russian factions.\n\nIn 1551 the tsar sent his envoy to the [[Nogai Horde]] and they promised to maintain neutrality during the impending war. The [[Ar begs]] and [[Udmurts]] submitted to Russian authority as well. In 1551 the wooden fort of [[Sviyazhsk]] was transported down the Volga from [[Uglich]] all the way to Kazan. It was used as the Russian ''place d'armes'' during the decisive campaign of 1552.\n\nOn 16 June 1552 Ivan IV led a strong Russian army towards Kazan. The last siege of the Tatar capital commenced on 30 August. Under the supervision of Prince [[Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky]], the Russians used [[battering ram]]s and a [[siege tower]], [[Mining (military)|undermining]] and 150 cannons. The Russians also had the advantage of efficient [[military engineer]]s. The city's water supply was blocked and the walls were breached. Kazan finally fell on 2 October, its fortifications were razed, and much of the population massacred. Many Russian prisoners and slaves were released. The Tsar celebrated his victory over Kazan by building several churches with oriental features, most famously [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on [[Red Square]] in Moscow. The fall of Kazan was only the beginning of a series of so-called \"Cheremis wars\". The attempts of the Moscow government to gain a foothold on the Middle Volga over and over again provoked uprisings of local peoples, which it was possible to suppress only with great difficulty. In 1557, the [[Kazan rebellion of 1552\u20131556|First Cheremis War]] ended and also the [[Bashkirs]] accepted Ivan IV's authority.\n\nIn two campaigns of 1554 and 1556, Russian troops conquered the [[Astrakhan Khanate]] at the base of the Volga River, and the new [[Astrakhan]] fortress was built in 1558 by [[Ivan Vyrodkov]] instead of the old Tatar capital. The annexation of the Tatar khanates meant the conquest of vast territories, access to large markets and control of the entire length of the Volga River.

The results presaged the many disasters to come. A plan to unite the Volga and Don by a canal was detailed in [[Constantinople]]. In the summer of 1569 a large force under Kasim Pa\u015fa of 1,500 [[Janissaries]], 2,000 Spakhs, and few thousand [[Azap]]s and [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131s]] were sent to lay siege to [[Astrakhan]] and begin the canal works, while an Ottoman fleet besieged [[Azov]].\n\nEarly in 1570, Ivan's ambassadors concluded a treaty at Constantinople that restored friendly relations between the Sultan and the Tsar.\n\n===Livonian War===\n{{Main|Livonian War}}\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Ivan IV Ortelius 1574.JPG|thumb|''Ioannes Basilius Magnus Imperator Russiae, Dux Moscoviae'', by [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1574)]]\n\nIn 1558, Ivan launched the [[Livonian War]] in an attempt to gain access to the [[Baltic Sea]] and its major trade routes. The war ultimately proved unsuccessful, stretching on for 24 years and engaging the [[History of Sweden (1523\u20131611)|Kingdom of Sweden]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Teutonic Knights]] of [[Livonia]]. The prolonged war had nearly destroyed the economy, while the ''Oprichnina'' had thoroughly disrupted the government. Meanwhile, the [[Union of Lublin]] had united the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], and the Commonwealth acquired an energetic leader, [[Stefan Batory]], who was supported by Russia's southern enemy, the Ottoman Empire. Ivan's realm was being squeezed by two of the great powers of the time.\n\nAfter rejected peace proposals from his enemies, Ivan IV found himself in a difficult position by 1579. The displaced refugees fleeing the war compounded the effects of the simultaneous drought, and exacerbated war engendered epidemics, causing much loss of life.\n\nBatory then launched a series of offensives against Muscovy in the campaign seasons of 1579\u201381, trying to cut the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Muscovite territories. During his first offensive in 1579, he retook [[Polotsk]] with 22,000 men. During the second, in 1580, he took [[Velikie Luki]] with a 29,000-strong force. Finally, he began the [[Siege of Pskov]] in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army. [[Narva]] in [[Estonia]] was reconquered by Sweden in 1581.\n\nUnlike Sweden and Poland, Denmark under [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden]], in 1580, transferring the Danish titles of Livonia to John III. Muscovy recognized Polish\u2013Lithuanian control of Livonia only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]], brother of Fredrick II and former ally of Ivan, died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the [[Duchy of Courland]], and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of [[Saaremaa]], Denmark was out of the Livonia by 1585.\n\n===Crimean raids===\n{{Main|Russo-Crimean Wars|Crimean-Nogai raids into East Slavic lands}}\n[[File:Ivans ivory throne.jpg|thumb|Ivan's throne (ivory, metal, wood)]]\n\nIn the later years of Ivan's reign, the southern borders of Muscovy were disturbed by Crimean Tatars.

Khan [[Devlet I Giray]] of Crimea repeatedly raided the Moscow region. In 1571, the 40,000-strong Crimean and Turkish army launched a large-scale raid. Due to the ongoing Livonian War, Moscow's garrison was as small as 6,000, and could not even delay the Tatar approach. Unresisted, Devlet devastated unprotected towns and villages around Moscow and caused the [[Fire of Moscow (1571)|1571 Fire of Moscow]]. Historians estimate the number of casualties of the fire from 10,000 to as many 80,000 people.\n\nTo buy peace from Devlet Giray, Ivan was forced to relinquish his claims on [[Astrakhan]] in favor of the Crimean Khanate (although this proposed transfer was only a diplomatic maneuver and was never actually completed). This defeat angered Ivan. Between 1571 and 1572, preparations were made upon his orders. In addition to [[Zasechnaya cherta]], innovative fortifications were set beyond the [[Oka River|River Oka]] that defined the border.\n\nThe following year, Devlet launched another raid on Moscow, now with a numerous horde,<ref>120,000-strong, according to Russian cronicles // \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c. \u0413\u043e\u0434 7080(1572). \u041f\u0421\u0420\u041b \u0442.

In addition, this time it was not artificially divided into two parts (the \"oprichnina\" and \"zemsky\") as it was during the defeat of 1571.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=427}} On 27 July the horde broke through the defensive line along the [[Oka River]] and moved towards Moscow. The Russian troops did not have time to intercept it, but the regiment of Prince Khvorostinin vigorously attacked the Tatars from the rear. The Khan stopped only 30&nbsp;km from Moscow and brought down his entire army back on the Russians, who managed to take up defense near the [[Battle of Molodi|village of Molodi]]. After several days of heavy fighting, on 2 August Mikhail Vorotynsky with the main part of the army flanked the Tatars and dealt a sudden blow, while Khvorostinin made a [[Sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] from the fortifications.

In 1555, shortly after the conquest of Kazan, the Siberian khan Yadegar and the [[Nogai Horde]] under Khan Ismail pledged their allegiance to Ivan, in hope that he would help them against their opponents. However, Yadegar failed to gather the full sum of tribute he proposed to the tsar, so Ivan did nothing to save his inefficient vassal. In 1563 Yadegar was overthrown and killed by [[Khan Kuchum]], who denied any tribute to Moscow.\n\nIn 1558 Ivan gave the [[Stroganov family|Stroganov merchant family]] the patent for colonising \"the abundant region along the Kama River\", and in 1574, lands over the [[Ural Mountains]] along the rivers [[Tura River|Tura]] and [[Tobol]]. They also received permission to build forts along the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] rivers. Around 1577, the Stroganovs engaged the Cossack leader [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] to protect their lands from attacks of the Siberian [[Khan Kuchum]].\n\nIn 1580 Yermak started his conquest of Siberia. With some 540 [[Cossack]]s, he started to penetrate territories that were tributary to Kuchum. Yermak pressured and persuaded the various family-based tribes to change their loyalties and become tributaries of Russia. Some agreed voluntarily, under better terms than with Kuchum; others were forced. He also established distant forts in the newly conquered lands. The campaign was successful, and the Cossacks managed to defeat the Siberian army in the [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]], but Yermak was still in need for reinforcements. He sent an envoy to Ivan the Terrible, with a message that proclaimed Yermak-conquered Siberia a part of Russia, to the dismay of the Stroganovs, who had planned to keep Siberia for themselves. Ivan agreed to reinforce the Cossacks with his streltsy, but the detachment sent to Siberia died of starvation without any benefit. Cossacks were defeated by the local peoples, Ermak died and the survivors immediately left Siberia. Only in 1586 (two years after the death of Ivan) did the Russians manage to gain a foothold in Siberia by founding the city of [[Tyumen]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages and children===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Grigory Sedov - Ivan the Terrible admiring Vasilisa Melentieva.jpg|thumb|280px|Tsar Ivan IV admires his sixth wife [[Vasilisa Melentyeva]]. 1875 painting by [[Grigory Sedov]].]]\n[[File:Iv\u00e1n el Terrible y su hijo, por Ili\u00e1 Repin.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan|Ivan the Terrible killing his son]]; painting by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\nIvan the Terrible had four legitimate wives, three of them were poisoned, presumably, by his enemies or the royal families, who wanted to promote their daughters to the tzar's brides.<ref name=rbth>{{cite web\n |author      =Manaev, G.\n |url         = https://www.rbth.com/history/329825-madness-of-3-russian-tsars\n |title       = The madness of 3 Russian tsars, and the truth behind it\n |publisher   = Russia Beyond the Headlines\n |date        = 2019-01-07\n |accessdate  = 2020-01-29\n}}</ref>\n\n# [[Anastasia Romanovna]] (in 1547\u20131560, death):\n#* Tsarevna Anna Ivanovna (10 August 1548{{spaced ndash}}20 July 1550)\n#* Tsarevna Maria Ivanovna (17 March 1551{{spaced ndash}}young)\n#* [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (1552\u20131553)|Tsarevich Dmitri Ivanovich]] (October 1552{{spaced ndash}}26 June 1553)\n#* [[Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich of Russia|Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich]] (28 March 1554{{spaced ndash}}19 November 1581)\n#* Tsarevna Eudoxia Ivanovna (26 February 1556{{spaced ndash}}June 1558)\n#* Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia]] (31 May 1557{{spaced ndash}}6 January 1598)\n# [[Maria Temryukovna]] (in 1561\u20131569, death):\n#* Tsarevich Vasili Ivanovich (21 March 1563{{spaced ndash}}3 May 1563)\n# [[Marfa Sobakina]] (28 October \u2013 13 November 1571, death)\n# [[Anna Koltovskaya]] (in 1572, sent to monastery).
