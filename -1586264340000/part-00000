''Finn'' (or variants, such as {{lang|non|skridfinn}}, 'striding Finn') was the name originally used by Norse speakers (and their proto-Norse speaking ancestors) to refer to the S\u00e1mi, as attested in the Icelandic [[Eddas]] and [[Norse sagas]] (11th to 14th centuries). The etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the consensus seems to be that it is related to [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|finna}}, from proto-Germanic {{lang|gem|*finthanan}} ('to find'),<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary |year= |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=find&allowed_in_frame=0}}</ref> the logic being that the S\u00e1mi, as [[hunter-gatherers]] \"found\" their food, rather than grew it. As Old Norse gradually developed into the separate Scandinavian languages, Swedes apparently took to using ''Finn'' to refer to inhabitants of what is now Finland, while the S\u00e1mi came to be called ''Lapps''. In Norway, however, S\u00e1mi were still called ''Finns'' at least until the modern era (reflected in toponyms like {{lang|no|[[Finnmark]]}}, {{lang|no|[[Finnsnes]]}}, {{lang|no|Finnfjord}} and {{lang|no|Finn\u00f8y}}), and some northern Norwegians will still occasionally use ''Finn'' to refer to S\u00e1mi people, although the S\u00e1mi themselves now consider this to be an inappropriate term. Finnish immigrants to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries were referred to as [[Kven people|Kvens]] to distinguish them from the S\u00e1mi \"Finns\".

Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the Sami cultural element was strengthened, since the Sami were mostly independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the pressure of [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization]] of the Sami increased, with some Sami adopting [[Laestadianism]]. With the introduction of seven compulsory years of school in 1889, the Sami language and traditional way of life came increasingly under pressure from forced cultural normalization. Sami people were occasionally subjected to eugenics through forced sterilization from 1934, during the reign of the social democrat [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]. Strong economic development of the north also ensued, giving Norwegian culture and language higher status.\n\nOn the Swedish and Finnish sides, the authorities were less militant, although the Sami language was forbidden in schools and strong economic development in the north led to weakened cultural and economic status for the Sami. From 1913 to 1920, the Swedish race-segregation political movement created a race-based biological institute that collected research material from living people and graves, and sterilized Sami women. Throughout history, Swedish settlers were encouraged to move to the northern regions through incentives such as land and water rights, tax allowances, and military exemptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/sami-west.htm |title=The Sami vs. Outsiders |last= Woodard |first=K\u00e1re (Kimmi) |website=[[University of Texas]] |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out Sami culture. Anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]] had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language and had to register with a Norwegian name. This caused the [[dislocation of Sami people]] in the 1920s, which increased the gap between local Sami groups (something still present today) that sometimes has the character of an internal Sami ethnic conflict. In 1913, the Norwegian parliament passed a bill on \"native act land\" to allocate the best and most useful lands to Norwegian settlers. Another factor was the [[scorched earth]] policy conducted by the German army, resulting in heavy [[Lapland War|war destruction]] in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944\u201345, destroying all existing houses, or ''kota'', and visible traces of Sami culture. After [[World War II]], the pressure was relaxed, though the legacy was evident into recent times, such as the 1970s law limiting the size of any house Sami people were allowed to build. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe [[Alta controversy|controversy]] over the construction of the hydro-electric power station in [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] in 1979 brought Sami rights onto the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem (\"[[S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla]]\") and flag ([[Sami flag]]) of the Sami people were created. In 1989, the first Sami parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the [[Finnmark Act]] was passed in the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] giving the Sami parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the Sami, now belong officially to the people of the province, whether Sami or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.\n\n====Contemporary====\nThe indigenous S\u00e1mi population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high arctic.

The failure to protect indigenous ways, however, stems not from inadequacy of the written law, but rather from the failure to implement existing laws. Violations of the rights of indigenous peoples continue, and oil, gas, and mineral development and other activities, (mining, timber cutting, commercial fishing, and tourism) that bring foreign currency into the Russian economy.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n[[File:Chibini massif and lake imandra.jpg|left|thumb|Chibini massif, [[Kola Peninsula]]]]\n\nThe life ways and economy of indigenous peoples of the Russian North are based upon reindeer herding, fishing, terrestrial and sea mammal hunting, and trapping. Many groups in the Russian Arctic are semi-nomadic, moving seasonally to different hunting and fishing camps.

S\u00e1mi are not only forbidden to fish in the eighty-kilometer stretch leased to the Ponoi River Company but are also required by regional laws to pay for licenses to catch a limited number of fish outside the lease area. Residents of remote communities have neither the power nor the resources to demand enforcement of their rights. Here and elsewhere in the circumpolar north, the failure to apply laws for the protection of indigenous peoples leads to \"criminalization\" of local indigenous populations who cannot survive without \"poaching\" resources that should be accessible to them legally.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n\nAlthough indigenous leaders in Russia have occasionally asserted indigenous rights to land and resources, to date there has been no serious or sustained discussion of indigenous group rights to ownership of land.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n\n====Nordic====\nOn 16 November 2005 in [[Helsinki]], a group of experts, led by former [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway]] Professor [[Carsten Smith]], submitted a proposal for a Nordic S\u00e1mi Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for S\u00e1mi affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three S\u00e1mi Parliaments from the respective countries.

Men mostly use wood, bone, and antlers to make items such as antler-handled [[scrimshaw]]ed [[sami knife|sami knives]], [[sami drum|drums]], and [[guksi]] (burl cups). Women used leather and roots to make items such as [[g\u00e1kti]] (clothing), and birch- and spruce-root woven baskets.\n\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|G\u00e1kti}}\n{{See also|Four Winds hat|Beaska|Luhkka}}\n[[File:Sami clothing 3.JPG|thumb|S\u00e1mi hats]]\nGakti are the traditional clothing worn by the S\u00e1mi people. The g\u00e1kti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer.\n\nTraditionally, the g\u00e1kti was made from reindeer leather and sinews, but nowadays, it is more common to use wool, cotton, or silk. Women's g\u00e1kti typically consist of a dress, a fringed shawl that is fastened with 1\u20133 silver brooches, and boots/shoes made of reindeer fur or leather. Boots can have pointed or curled toes and often have band-woven ankle wraps. Eastern S\u00e1mi boots have a rounded toe on reindeer-fur boots, lined with felt and with beaded details. There are different g\u00e1kti for women and men; men's g\u00e1kti have a shorter \"jacket-skirt\" than a women's long dress. Traditional g\u00e1kti are most commonly in variations of red, blue, green, white, medium-brown tanned leather, or reindeer fur. In winter, there is the addition of a reindeer fur coat and leggings, and sometimes a poncho (luhkka) and rope/lasso.\n\nThe colours, patterns and the jewellery of the g\u00e1kti indicate where a person is from, if a person is single or married, and sometimes can even be specific to their family. The collar, sleeves and hem usually have appliqu\u00e9s in the form of geometric shapes. Some regions have ribbonwork, others have tin embroidery, and some Eastern S\u00e1mi have beading on clothing or collar. Hats vary by sex, season, and region. They can be wool, leather, or fur. They can be embroidered, or in the East, they are more like a beaded cloth crown with a shawl. Some traditional shamanic headgear had animal hides, plaits, and feathers, particularly in East Sapmi.\n\nThe g\u00e1kti can be worn with a belt; these are sometimes band-woven belts, woven, or beaded. Leather belts can have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassles, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts can also have beaded leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved and/or scrimshawed antler handled knife. Some Eastern S\u00e1mi also have a hooded jumper (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.\n\n===Media and literature===\n{{Main|S\u00e1mi media}}\n[[File:Johan Turi, Muitalus s\u00e1miid birra.jpg|thumb|''Muitalus s\u00e1miid birra'' by [[Johan Turi]]]]\n* There are short daily news bulletins in Northern S\u00e1mi on national TV in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]].

Yoiks are song-chants and are traditionally sung ''[[a cappella]]'', usually sung slowly and deep in the throat with apparent emotional content of sorrow or anger. Yoiks can be dedicated to animals and birds in nature, special people or special occasions, and they can be joyous, sad or melancholic. They often are based on syllablic improvisation. In recent years, musical instruments frequently accompany yoiks. The only traditional S\u00e1mi instruments that were sometimes used to accompany yoik are the \"fadno\" flute (made from reed-like ''[[Garden Angelica|Angelica archangelica]]'' stems) and hand drums (frame drums and bowl drums).\n\n===Education===\n* Education with S\u00e1mi as the first language is available in all four countries, and also outside the S\u00e1mi area.\n* [[S\u00e1mi University College]] is located in Kautokeino.

The larger part of S\u00e1pmi is not covered by the term \"Lapland\". ''Lapland'' can be either misleading or offensive, or both, depending on the context and where this word is used, to the Sami.

S\u00e1mi languages, and S\u00e1mi song-chants, called yoiks, were illegal in Norway from 1773 until 1958. Then, access to S\u00e1mi instruction as part of schooling was not available until 1988. Special residential schools that would assimilate the S\u00e1mi into the dominant culture were established. These were originally run by missionaries, but later, controlled by the government. For example, in Russia, S\u00e1mi children were taken away when aged 1\u20132 and returned when aged 15\u201317 with no knowledge of their language and traditional communities. Not all S\u00e1mi viewed the schools negatively, and not all of the schools were brutal. However, being taken from home and prohibited from speaking S\u00e1mi has resulted in cultural alienation, loss of language, and lowered self-esteem.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Survivance in Sami and First Nations Boarding School Narratives |last=Kuokkanen |first=Rauna |year=2003 |publisher=[[American Indian Quarterly]] |volume=27 |pages=697\u2013726}}</ref>\n\nThe S\u00e1mi languages belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family, linguistically related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

The majority of the S\u00e1mi now speak the majority languages of the countries they live in, i.e., Swedish, Russian, Finnish and Norwegian. Efforts are being made to further the use of S\u00e1mi languages among S\u00e1mi and persons of S\u00e1mi origin. Despite these changes, the legacy of cultural repression still exists.

In all three countries, they act as an institution of cultural autonomy for the indigenous Sami people. The parliaments have very weak political influence, far from autonomy. They are formally public authorities, ruled by the Scandinavian governments, but have democratically elected parliamentarians, whose mission is to work for the Sami people and culture. Candidates' election promises often get into conflict with the institutions' submission under their governments, but as authorities, they have some influence over the government.\n\n===Norwegian organizations===\nThe main organisations for Sami representation in Norway are the ''siidas''.

They cover northern and central Sweden.\n\n===Finnish organizations===\nIn contrast to Norway and Sweden, in Finland, a ''siida'' (''paliskunta'' in Finnish) is a reindeer-herding corporation that is not restricted by ethnicity. There are indeed some ethnic Finns who practice reindeer herding, and in principle, all residents of the reindeer herding area (most of Finnish Lapland and parts of Oulu province) who are citizens of [[European Economic Area|EEA]] countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1990/19900848 |title=FINLEX \u00ae \u2013 Ajantasainen lains\u00e4\u00e4d\u00e4nt\u00f6: 14.9.1990/848 |publisher=Finlex.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> i.e., the [[European Union]] and Norway, [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], are allowed to join a ''paliskunta''.\n\n===Russian organizations===\nIn 2010, the Sami Council supported the establishment of a cultural center in Russia for Arctic peoples. The Center for Northern Peoples aims to promote artistic and cultural cooperation between the Arctic peoples of Russia and the Nordic countries, with particular focus on indigenous peoples and minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senterfornordligefolk.no/frontpage.146031.en.html|title=Frontpage \u2013 Senter for Nordlige Folk AS|publisher = senterfornordligefolk.no}}</ref>\n\n===Border conflicts===\n[[File:Glen1 Sweden.jpg|thumb|Land rights for grazing [[reindeer]]]]\nS\u00e1pmi, the Sami traditional lands, cross four national borders. Traditional summer and winter pastures sometimes lie on different sides of the borders of the nation-states. In addition to that, there is a border drawn for modern-day [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|S\u00e1pmi]]. Some state that the rights (for reindeer herding and, in some parts, even for fishing and hunting) include not only modern S\u00e1pmi but areas that are beyond today's S\u00e1pmi that reflect older territories. Today's \"borders\" originate from the 14th to 16th centuries when land-owning conflicts occurred. The establishment of more stable dwelling places and larger towns originates from the 16th century and was performed for strategic defence and economic reasons, both by peoples from Sami groups themselves and more southern immigrants.\n\nOwning land within the borders or being a member of a ''[[siida]]'' (Sami corporation) gives rights. A different law enacted in Sweden in the mid-1990s gave the right to anyone to fish and hunt in the region, something that was met with skepticism and anger amongst the ''siidas''.\n\nCourt proceedings have been common throughout history, and the aim from the Sami viewpoint is to reclaim territories used earlier in history. Due to a major defeat in 1996, one ''siida'' has introduced a sponsorship \"Reindeer Godfather\" concept to raise funds for further battles in courts. These \"internal conflicts\" are usually conflicts between non-Sami land owners and reindeer owners. Cases question the Sami ancient rights to reindeer pastures.

During the 1980s and 1990s, a flag was created, a national song was written, and the date of a national day was settled.\n\n===Flag===\n{{Main|Sami flag}}\n[[File:Sami flag.svg|thumb|Sami flag]]\nThe Sami flag was inaugurated during the Sami Conference in [[\u00c5re]], Sweden, on 15 August 1986. It was the result of a competition for which many suggestions were entered. The winning design was submitted by the artist [[Astrid B\u00e5hl]] from [[Skibotn]], Norway.\n\nThe motif (shown right) was derived from the shaman's drum and the poem \"Paiven parneh\" (\"Sons of the Sun\") by the South Sami [[Anders Fjellner]] describing the Sami as sons and daughters of the sun. The flag has the Sami colours, red, green, yellow and blue, and the circle represents the sun (red) and the moon (blue).\n\n===The Sami People's Day===\n{{Main|Sami National Day}}\nThe Sami National Day falls on February 6 as this date was when the [[The Sami assembly of 1917|first Sami congress]] was held in 1917 in [[Trondheim]], Norway. This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish Sami came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. The resolution for celebrating on 6 February was passed in 1992 at the 15th Sami congress in Helsinki. Since 1993, Norway, Sweden and Finland have recognized February 6 as Sami National Day.\n\n===\"Song of the Sami People\"===\n{{Main|S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla}}\n\"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\" (\"Song of the Sami People\", lit. \"Song of the Sami Family\") was originally a poem written by [[Isak Saba]] that was published in the newspaper ''[[Sagai Muittal\u00e6gje]]'' for the first time on 1 April 1906. In August 1986, it became the [[national anthem]] of the Sami. Arne S\u00f8rli set the poem to music, which was then approved at the 15th Sami Conference in [[Helsinki]] in 1992. \"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\" has been translated into all of the [[Sami languages]].\n\n===Coats of Arms of Sami Communities===\n<gallery class=\"center\" perrow=\"12\" widths=\"50px\" heights=\"60px\" caption=\"Coats of Arms\">\nFile:Finnmark v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Finnmark|Finnm\u00e1rku]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Troms v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Troms|Romsa]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Nordland v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Nordland|Nordl\u00e1nda]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Tr\u00f8ndelag v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Tr\u00f8ndelag|Tr\u00f8ndel\u00e1ga]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Lappland vapen.svg|[[Lapland (Sweden)|Lappl\u00e1nda]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:Norrbottens vapen.svg|[[Norrbotten]]a<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:V\u00e4sterbottens vapen.svg|[[V\u00e4sterbotten]]a<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:J\u00e4mtlands vapen.svg|[[J\u00e4mtland|J\u00e4mtl\u00e1ndda]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:H\u00e4rjedalens vapen.svg|[[H\u00e4rjedalen|H\u00e4rjedaelie]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:Lapin maakunnan vaakuna.svg|[[Lapland (Finland)|Lappi]]<br/>(Finland)\nFile:\u0413\u0435\u0440\u0431 \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438.svg|[[Murmansk Oblast|Murm\u00e1nska]]<br/>(Russia)\n</gallery>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Sami religion}}\n[[File:Shaman.jpg|thumb|Copper etching (1767) by O.H. von Lode showing a [[noaidi]] with his meavrresg\u00e1rri [[drum]]]]\nWidespread [[Shamanism]] persisted among the Sami up until the 18th century.

Through a mainly French initiative from [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]] as part of his [[La Recherche Expedition (1838\u20131840)|La Recherche Expedition]], [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius]] began research on Sami mythology. His work resulted in [[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]], since by his own admission, they contained only a small percentage of what had existed. The fragments were termed ''Theory of Gods'', ''Theory of Sacrifice'', ''Theory of Prophecy, or short reports about rumorous Sami magic'' and ''Sami sagas''. Generally, he claims to have filtered out the Norse influence and derived common elements between the South, North, and Eastern Sami groups. The mythology has common elements with other traditional indigenous religions as well\u2014such as those in [[Siberia]] and North America.\n\n===Missionary efforts===\n[[File:Tore Johnsen, samiske kirkedager.JPG|thumb|A sermon at the 2004 ''Samiske kirkedager'']]\nThe term ''Sami religion'' usually refers to the traditional religion, practiced by most S\u00e1mi until approximately the 18th century. [[Christianity]] was introduced by [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries as early as the 13th century. Increased pressure came after the [[Protestant Reformation]], and [[rune drum]]s were burned or sent to museums abroad. In this period, many Sami practiced their traditional religion at home, while going to church on Sunday. Since the Sami were considered to possess \"witchcraft\" powers, they were often accused of sorcery during the 17th century and were the subjects of witchcraft trials and burnings.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Witches of the high north: The Finnmark witchcraft trials in the seventeenth century |journal=Scandinavian Journal of History |volume=22 |issue=3 |last=Willumsen |first=L.H. |year=1997 |pages=199\u2013221| url=|doi=10.1080/03468759708579352 }}</ref>\n\nIn Norway, a major effort to convert the Sami was made around 1720, when [[Thomas von Westen]], the \"Apostle of the Sami\", burned drums, burned sacred objects, and converted people.<ref name=\"Holloway\">{{cite web|title=The Decline of the S\u00e1mi People's Indigenous Religion |last= Holloway|first= Alan \"Ivv\u00e1r\"|authorlink= |year= |publisher= TexasU|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm}}</ref> Out of the estimated thousands of drums prior to this period, only about 70 are known to remain today, scattered in museums around Europe.<ref name=\"Gusto\"/> Sacred sites were destroyed, such as sieidi (stones in natural or human-built formations), \u00e1lda and s\u00e1ivu (sacred hills), springs, caves and other natural formations where offerings were made.\n\nIn the far east of the Sami area, the Russian monk Trifon converted the Sami in the 16th century.

The spiritual understanding Laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons \"filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sami that they could understand,&nbsp;... about a God who cared about the lives of the people\" had a profound positive effect on both problems.  One account from a Sami cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the Sami to learn to read and a \"bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness&nbsp;...

While they practice a religion based on that of their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan [[discrimination against Neopagans|prejudice]] has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken Sami religious tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs are composed of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism, and polytheism. S\u00e1mi animism is manifested in the S\u00e1mi's belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul; and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs include a multitude of spirits.<ref name=\"Holloway\"/> Many contemporary practitioners are compared to practitioners of [[neo-paganism]], as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations, but others feel they are attempting to revive or reconstruct indigenous Sami religions as found in historic, folkloric sources and oral traditions.\n\nIn 2012, County Governor of Troms approved Shamanic Association of Troms\u00f8 as a new religion.<ref>denominationhttp://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/2792-shamanism-approved-as-a-religion-in-norway</ref>\n\nA very different religious idea is represented by the numerous \"wise men\" and \"wise women\" found throughout the Sami area. They often offer to heal the sick through rituals and traditional medicines and may also combine traditional elements, such as older Sami teachings, with newer monotheistic inventions that Christian missionaries taught their ancestors, such as readings from the Bible.\n\n==Genetic studies==\n{{Main|Population genetics of the Sami}}\n[[File:Lapland Mother NGM-v31-p556.jpg|thumb|left|Sami mother with her children]]\n[[Anthropologist]]s have been studying the Sami people for hundreds of years for their assumed physical and cultural differences from the rest of the Europeans.

''Finn'' (or variants, such as {{lang|non|skridfinn}}, 'striding Finn') was the name originally used by Norse speakers (and their proto-Norse speaking ancestors) to refer to the S\u00e1mi, as attested in the Icelandic [[Eddas]] and [[Norse sagas]] (11th to 14th centuries). The etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the consensus seems to be that it is related to [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|finna}}, from proto-Germanic {{lang|gem|*finthanan}} ('to find'),<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary |year= |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=find&allowed_in_frame=0}}</ref> the logic being that the S\u00e1mi, as [[hunter-gatherers]] \"found\" their food, rather than grew it. As Old Norse gradually developed into the separate Scandinavian languages, Swedes apparently took to using ''Finn'' to refer to inhabitants of what is now Finland, while the S\u00e1mi came to be called ''Lapps''. In Norway, however, S\u00e1mi were still called ''Finns'' at least until the modern era (reflected in toponyms like {{lang|no|[[Finnmark]]}}, {{lang|no|[[Finnsnes]]}}, {{lang|no|Finnfjord}} and {{lang|no|Finn\u00f8y}}), and some northern Norwegians will still occasionally use ''Finn'' to refer to S\u00e1mi people, although the S\u00e1mi themselves now consider this to be an inappropriate term. Finnish immigrants to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries were referred to as [[Kven people|Kvens]] to distinguish them from the S\u00e1mi \"Finns\".

Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the Sami cultural element was strengthened, since the Sami were mostly independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the pressure of [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization]] of the Sami increased, with some Sami adopting [[Laestadianism]]. With the introduction of seven compulsory years of school in 1889, the Sami language and traditional way of life came increasingly under pressure from forced cultural normalization. Sami people were occasionally subjected to eugenics through forced sterilization from 1934, during the reign of the social democrat [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]. Strong economic development of the north also ensued, giving Norwegian culture and language higher status.\n\nOn the Swedish and Finnish sides, the authorities were less militant, although the Sami language was forbidden in schools and strong economic development in the north led to weakened cultural and economic status for the Sami. From 1913 to 1920, the Swedish race-segregation political movement created a race-based biological institute that collected research material from living people and graves, and sterilized Sami women. Throughout history, Swedish settlers were encouraged to move to the northern regions through incentives such as land and water rights, tax allowances, and military exemptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/sami-west.htm |title=The Sami vs. Outsiders |last= Woodard |first=K\u00e1re (Kimmi) |website=[[University of Texas]] |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out Sami culture. Anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]] had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language and had to register with a Norwegian name. This caused the [[dislocation of Sami people]] in the 1920s, which increased the gap between local Sami groups (something still present today) that sometimes has the character of an internal Sami ethnic conflict. In 1913, the Norwegian parliament passed a bill on \"native act land\" to allocate the best and most useful lands to Norwegian settlers. Another factor was the [[scorched earth]] policy conducted by the German army, resulting in heavy [[Lapland War|war destruction]] in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944\u201345, destroying all existing houses, or ''kota'', and visible traces of Sami culture. After [[World War II]], the pressure was relaxed, though the legacy was evident into recent times, such as the 1970s law limiting the size of any house Sami people were allowed to build. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe [[Alta controversy|controversy]] over the construction of the hydro-electric power station in [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] in 1979 brought Sami rights onto the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem (\"[[S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla]]\") and flag ([[Sami flag]]) of the Sami people were created. In 1989, the first Sami parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the [[Finnmark Act]] was passed in the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] giving the Sami parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the Sami, now belong officially to the people of the province, whether Sami or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.\n\n====Contemporary====\nThe indigenous S\u00e1mi population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high arctic.

The failure to protect indigenous ways, however, stems not from inadequacy of the written law, but rather from the failure to implement existing laws. Violations of the rights of indigenous peoples continue, and oil, gas, and mineral development and other activities, (mining, timber cutting, commercial fishing, and tourism) that bring foreign currency into the Russian economy.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n[[File:Chibini massif and lake imandra.jpg|left|thumb|Chibini massif, [[Kola Peninsula]]]]\n\nThe life ways and economy of indigenous peoples of the Russian North are based upon reindeer herding, fishing, terrestrial and sea mammal hunting, and trapping. Many groups in the Russian Arctic are semi-nomadic, moving seasonally to different hunting and fishing camps.

S\u00e1mi are not only forbidden to fish in the eighty-kilometer stretch leased to the Ponoi River Company but are also required by regional laws to pay for licenses to catch a limited number of fish outside the lease area. Residents of remote communities have neither the power nor the resources to demand enforcement of their rights. Here and elsewhere in the circumpolar north, the failure to apply laws for the protection of indigenous peoples leads to \"criminalization\" of local indigenous populations who cannot survive without \"poaching\" resources that should be accessible to them legally.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n\nAlthough indigenous leaders in Russia have occasionally asserted indigenous rights to land and resources, to date there has been no serious or sustained discussion of indigenous group rights to ownership of land.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n\n====Nordic====\nOn 16 November 2005 in [[Helsinki]], a group of experts, led by former [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway]] Professor [[Carsten Smith]], submitted a proposal for a Nordic S\u00e1mi Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for S\u00e1mi affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three S\u00e1mi Parliaments from the respective countries.

Men mostly use wood, bone, and antlers to make items such as antler-handled [[scrimshaw]]ed [[sami knife|sami knives]], [[sami drum|drums]], and [[guksi]] (burl cups). Women used leather and roots to make items such as [[g\u00e1kti]] (clothing), and birch- and spruce-root woven baskets.\n\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|G\u00e1kti}}\n{{See also|Four Winds hat|Beaska|Luhkka}}\n[[File:Sami clothing 3.JPG|thumb|S\u00e1mi hats]]\nGakti are the traditional clothing worn by the S\u00e1mi people. The g\u00e1kti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer.\n\nTraditionally, the g\u00e1kti was made from reindeer leather and sinews, but nowadays, it is more common to use wool, cotton, or silk. Women's g\u00e1kti typically consist of a dress, a fringed shawl that is fastened with 1\u20133 silver brooches, and boots/shoes made of reindeer fur or leather. Boots can have pointed or curled toes and often have band-woven ankle wraps. Eastern S\u00e1mi boots have a rounded toe on reindeer-fur boots, lined with felt and with beaded details. There are different g\u00e1kti for women and men; men's g\u00e1kti have a shorter \"jacket-skirt\" than a women's long dress. Traditional g\u00e1kti are most commonly in variations of red, blue, green, white, medium-brown tanned leather, or reindeer fur. In winter, there is the addition of a reindeer fur coat and leggings, and sometimes a poncho (luhkka) and rope/lasso.\n\nThe colours, patterns and the jewellery of the g\u00e1kti indicate where a person is from, if a person is single or married, and sometimes can even be specific to their family. The collar, sleeves and hem usually have appliqu\u00e9s in the form of geometric shapes. Some regions have ribbonwork, others have tin embroidery, and some Eastern S\u00e1mi have beading on clothing or collar. Hats vary by sex, season, and region. They can be wool, leather, or fur. They can be embroidered, or in the East, they are more like a beaded cloth crown with a shawl. Some traditional shamanic headgear had animal hides, plaits, and feathers, particularly in East Sapmi.\n\nThe g\u00e1kti can be worn with a belt; these are sometimes band-woven belts, woven, or beaded. Leather belts can have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassles, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts can also have beaded leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved and/or scrimshawed antler handled knife. Some Eastern S\u00e1mi also have a hooded jumper (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.\n\n===Media and literature===\n{{Main|S\u00e1mi media}}\n[[File:Johan Turi, Muitalus s\u00e1miid birra.jpg|thumb|''Muitalus s\u00e1miid birra'' by [[Johan Turi]]]]\n* There are short daily news bulletins in Northern S\u00e1mi on national TV in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]].

Yoiks are song-chants and are traditionally sung ''[[a cappella]]'', usually sung slowly and deep in the throat with apparent emotional content of sorrow or anger. Yoiks can be dedicated to animals and birds in nature, special people or special occasions, and they can be joyous, sad or melancholic. They often are based on syllablic improvisation. In recent years, musical instruments frequently accompany yoiks. The only traditional S\u00e1mi instruments that were sometimes used to accompany yoik are the \"fadno\" flute (made from reed-like Angelica archangelica stems) and hand drums (frame drums and bowl drums).\n\n===Education===\n* Education with S\u00e1mi as the first language is available in all four countries, and also outside the S\u00e1mi area.\n* [[S\u00e1mi University College]] is located in Kautokeino.

The larger part of S\u00e1pmi is not covered by the term \"Lapland\". ''Lapland'' can be either misleading or offensive, or both, depending on the context and where this word is used, to the Sami.

S\u00e1mi languages, and S\u00e1mi song-chants, called yoiks, were illegal in Norway from 1773 until 1958. Then, access to S\u00e1mi instruction as part of schooling was not available until 1988. Special residential schools that would assimilate the S\u00e1mi into the dominant culture were established. These were originally run by missionaries, but later, controlled by the government. For example, in Russia, S\u00e1mi children were taken away when aged 1\u20132 and returned when aged 15\u201317 with no knowledge of their language and traditional communities. Not all S\u00e1mi viewed the schools negatively, and not all of the schools were brutal. However, being taken from home and prohibited from speaking S\u00e1mi has resulted in cultural alienation, loss of language, and lowered self-esteem.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Survivance in Sami and First Nations Boarding School Narratives |last=Kuokkanen |first=Rauna |year=2003 |publisher=[[American Indian Quarterly]] |volume=27 |pages=697\u2013726}}</ref>\n\nThe S\u00e1mi languages belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family, linguistically related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

The majority of the S\u00e1mi now speak the majority languages of the countries they live in, i.e., Swedish, Russian, Finnish and Norwegian. Efforts are being made to further the use of S\u00e1mi languages among S\u00e1mi and persons of S\u00e1mi origin. Despite these changes, the legacy of cultural repression still exists.

In all three countries, they act as an institution of cultural autonomy for the indigenous Sami people. The parliaments have very weak political influence, far from autonomy. They are formally public authorities, ruled by the Scandinavian governments, but have democratically elected parliamentarians, whose mission is to work for the Sami people and culture. Candidates' election promises often get into conflict with the institutions' submission under their governments, but as authorities, they have some influence over the government.\n\n===Norwegian organizations===\nThe main organisations for Sami representation in Norway are the ''siidas''.

They cover northern and central Sweden.\n\n===Finnish organizations===\nIn contrast to Norway and Sweden, in Finland, a ''siida'' (''paliskunta'' in Finnish) is a reindeer-herding corporation that is not restricted by ethnicity. There are indeed some ethnic Finns who practice reindeer herding, and in principle, all residents of the reindeer herding area (most of Finnish Lapland and parts of Oulu province) who are citizens of [[European Economic Area|EEA]] countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1990/19900848 |title=FINLEX \u00ae \u2013 Ajantasainen lains\u00e4\u00e4d\u00e4nt\u00f6: 14.9.1990/848 |publisher=Finlex.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> i.e., the [[European Union]] and Norway, [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], are allowed to join a ''paliskunta''.\n\n===Russian organizations===\nIn 2010, the Sami Council supported the establishment of a cultural center in Russia for Arctic peoples. The Center for Northern Peoples aims to promote artistic and cultural cooperation between the Arctic peoples of Russia and the Nordic countries, with particular focus on indigenous peoples and minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senterfornordligefolk.no/frontpage.146031.en.html|title=Frontpage \u2013 Senter for Nordlige Folk AS|publisher = senterfornordligefolk.no}}</ref>\n\n===Border conflicts===\n[[File:Glen1 Sweden.jpg|thumb|Land rights for grazing [[reindeer]]]]\nS\u00e1pmi, the Sami traditional lands, cross four national borders. Traditional summer and winter pastures sometimes lie on different sides of the borders of the nation-states. In addition to that, there is a border drawn for modern-day [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|S\u00e1pmi]]. Some state that the rights (for reindeer herding and, in some parts, even for fishing and hunting) include not only modern S\u00e1pmi but areas that are beyond today's S\u00e1pmi that reflect older territories. Today's \"borders\" originate from the 14th to 16th centuries when land-owning conflicts occurred. The establishment of more stable dwelling places and larger towns originates from the 16th century and was performed for strategic defence and economic reasons, both by peoples from Sami groups themselves and more southern immigrants.\n\nOwning land within the borders or being a member of a ''[[siida]]'' (Sami corporation) gives rights. A different law enacted in Sweden in the mid-1990s gave the right to anyone to fish and hunt in the region, something that was met with skepticism and anger amongst the ''siidas''.\n\nCourt proceedings have been common throughout history, and the aim from the Sami viewpoint is to reclaim territories used earlier in history. Due to a major defeat in 1996, one ''siida'' has introduced a sponsorship \"Reindeer Godfather\" concept to raise funds for further battles in courts. These \"internal conflicts\" are usually conflicts between non-Sami land owners and reindeer owners. Cases question the Sami ancient rights to reindeer pastures.

During the 1980s and 1990s, a flag was created, a national song was written, and the date of a national day was settled.\n\n===Flag===\n{{Main|Sami flag}}\n[[File:Sami flag.svg|thumb|Sami flag]]\nThe Sami flag was inaugurated during the Sami Conference in [[\u00c5re]], Sweden, on 15 August 1986. It was the result of a competition for which many suggestions were entered. The winning design was submitted by the artist [[Astrid B\u00e5hl]] from [[Skibotn]], Norway.\n\nThe motif (shown right) was derived from the shaman's drum and the poem \"Paiven parneh\" (\"Sons of the Sun\") by the South Sami [[Anders Fjellner]] describing the Sami as sons and daughters of the sun. The flag has the Sami colours, red, green, yellow and blue, and the circle represents the sun (red) and the moon (blue).\n\n===The Sami People's Day===\n{{Main|Sami National Day}}\nThe Sami National Day falls on February 6 as this date was when the [[The Sami assembly of 1917|first Sami congress]] was held in 1917 in [[Trondheim]], Norway. This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish Sami came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. The resolution for celebrating on 6 February was passed in 1992 at the 15th Sami congress in Helsinki. Since 1993, Norway, Sweden and Finland have recognized February 6 as Sami National Day.\n\n===\"Song of the Sami People\"===\n{{Main|S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla}}\n\"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\" (\"Song of the Sami People\", lit. \"Song of the Sami Family\") was originally a poem written by [[Isak Saba]] that was published in the newspaper ''[[Sagai Muittal\u00e6gje]]'' for the first time on 1 April 1906. In August 1986, it became the [[national anthem]] of the Sami. Arne S\u00f8rli set the poem to music, which was then approved at the 15th Sami Conference in [[Helsinki]] in 1992. \"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\" has been translated into all of the [[Sami languages]].\n\n===Coats of Arms of Sami Communities===\n<gallery class=\"center\" perrow=\"12\" widths=\"50px\" heights=\"60px\" caption=\"Coats of Arms\">\nFile:Finnmark v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Finnmark|Finnm\u00e1rku]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Troms v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Troms|Romsa]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Nordland v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Nordland|Nordl\u00e1nda]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Tr\u00f8ndelag v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Tr\u00f8ndelag|Tr\u00f8ndel\u00e1ga]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Lappland vapen.svg|[[Lapland (Sweden)|Lappl\u00e1nda]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:Norrbottens vapen.svg|[[Norrbotten]]a<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:V\u00e4sterbottens vapen.svg|[[V\u00e4sterbotten]]a<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:J\u00e4mtlands vapen.svg|[[J\u00e4mtland|J\u00e4mtl\u00e1ndda]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:H\u00e4rjedalens vapen.svg|[[H\u00e4rjedalen|H\u00e4rjedaelie]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:Lapin maakunnan vaakuna.svg|[[Lapland (Finland)|Lappi]]<br/>(Finland)\nFile:\u0413\u0435\u0440\u0431 \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438.svg|[[Murmansk Oblast|Murm\u00e1nska]]<br/>(Russia)\n</gallery>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Sami religion}}\n[[File:Shaman.jpg|thumb|Copper etching (1767) by O.H. von Lode showing a [[noaidi]] with his meavrresg\u00e1rri [[drum]]]]\nWidespread [[Shamanism]] persisted among the Sami up until the 18th century.

Through a mainly French initiative from [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]] as part of his [[La Recherche Expedition (1838\u20131840)|La Recherche Expedition]], [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius]] began research on Sami mythology. His work resulted in [[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]], since by his own admission, they contained only a small percentage of what had existed. The fragments were termed ''Theory of Gods'', ''Theory of Sacrifice'', ''Theory of Prophecy, or short reports about rumorous Sami magic'' and ''Sami sagas''. Generally, he claims to have filtered out the Norse influence and derived common elements between the South, North, and Eastern Sami groups. The mythology has common elements with other traditional indigenous religions as well\u2014such as those in [[Siberia]] and North America.\n\n===Missionary efforts===\n[[File:Tore Johnsen, samiske kirkedager.JPG|thumb|A sermon at the 2004 ''Samiske kirkedager'']]\nThe term ''Sami religion'' usually refers to the traditional religion, practiced by most S\u00e1mi until approximately the 18th century. [[Christianity]] was introduced by [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries as early as the 13th century. Increased pressure came after the [[Protestant Reformation]], and [[rune drum]]s were burned or sent to museums abroad. In this period, many Sami practiced their traditional religion at home, while going to church on Sunday. Since the Sami were considered to possess \"witchcraft\" powers, they were often accused of sorcery during the 17th century and were the subjects of witchcraft trials and burnings.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Witches of the high north: The Finnmark witchcraft trials in the seventeenth century |journal=Scandinavian Journal of History |volume=22 |issue=3 |last=Willumsen |first=L.H. |year=1997 |pages=199\u2013221| url=|doi=10.1080/03468759708579352 }}</ref>\n\nIn Norway, a major effort to convert the Sami was made around 1720, when [[Thomas von Westen]], the \"Apostle of the Sami\", burned drums, burned sacred objects, and converted people.<ref name=\"Holloway\">{{cite web|title=The Decline of the S\u00e1mi People's Indigenous Religion |last= Holloway|first= Alan \"Ivv\u00e1r\"|authorlink= |year= |publisher= TexasU|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm}}</ref> Out of the estimated thousands of drums prior to this period, only about 70 are known to remain today, scattered in museums around Europe.<ref name=\"Gusto\"/> Sacred sites were destroyed, such as sieidi (stones in natural or human-built formations), \u00e1lda and s\u00e1ivu (sacred hills), springs, caves and other natural formations where offerings were made.\n\nIn the far east of the Sami area, the Russian monk Trifon converted the Sami in the 16th century.

The spiritual understanding Laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons \"filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sami that they could understand,&nbsp;... about a God who cared about the lives of the people\" had a profound positive effect on both problems.  One account from a Sami cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the Sami to learn to read and a \"bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness&nbsp;...

While they practice a religion based on that of their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan [[discrimination against Neopagans|prejudice]] has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken Sami religious tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs are composed of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism, and polytheism. S\u00e1mi animism is manifested in the S\u00e1mi's belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul; and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs include a multitude of spirits.<ref name=\"Holloway\"/> Many contemporary practitioners are compared to practitioners of [[neo-paganism]], as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations, but others feel they are attempting to revive or reconstruct indigenous Sami religions as found in historic, folkloric sources and oral traditions.\n\nIn 2012, County Governor of Troms approved Shamanic Association of Troms\u00f8 as a new religion.<ref>denominationhttp://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/2792-shamanism-approved-as-a-religion-in-norway</ref>\n\nA very different religious idea is represented by the numerous \"wise men\" and \"wise women\" found throughout the Sami area. They often offer to heal the sick through rituals and traditional medicines and may also combine traditional elements, such as older Sami teachings, with newer monotheistic inventions that Christian missionaries taught their ancestors, such as readings from the Bible.\n\n==Genetic studies==\n{{Main|Population genetics of the Sami}}\n[[File:Lapland Mother NGM-v31-p556.jpg|thumb|left|Sami mother with her children]]\n[[Anthropologist]]s have been studying the Sami people for hundreds of years for their assumed physical and cultural differences from the rest of the Europeans.

Wings are dark grey with varying levels of yellow highlighting. The ventral feathering is light grey to white with light grey scalloping on the chest. The feathering surrounding the eye is black. The beak and bare skin-patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak, on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.

It was directed by [[Colin Trevorrow]], written by [[Derek Connolly]] and Trevorrow, produced by [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] and Patrick Crowley, and stars [[Chris Pratt]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Ty Simpkins]], [[Nick Robinson (American actor)|Nick Robinson]], [[Omar Sy]], [[BD Wong]], and [[Irrfan Khan]].\n\nSet 22 years after the events of ''Jurassic Park'', ''Jurassic World'' takes place on the same fictional [[Central American]] island of [[Isla Nublar]], which is located off the Pacific coast of [[Costa Rica]], where a [[Animal theme park|theme park]] of [[Cloning|cloned]] [[dinosaur]]s has operated for nearly a decade. The park plunges into chaos when a [[Transgene|transgenic]] dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage.\n\n[[Universal Pictures]] intended to begin production of a fourth ''Jurassic Park'' film in 2004 for a mid-2005 release but development stalled while the script underwent several revisions. Following a suggestion from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], writers [[Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver]] explored the idea of a functional dinosaur park. Once Trevorrow was hired as director in 2013, he followed the same idea while developing a new script with Connolly. Filming lasted from April to August 2014 in [[Louisiana]] and [[Hawaii]]. The dinosaurs were created by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] using [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and by [[Legacy Effects]] using life-sized [[animatronics]].\n\nProduction was completed in May 2015,<ref name=SC-2015/> and ''Jurassic World'' was released in over 60 countries beginning on June 10, 2015.

Claire assigns her assistant Zara as the boys' guide, but they evade her and explore on their own. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Owen Grady|Owen Grady]] has been training four ''[[Velociraptor]]s'' named Blue, Echo, Delta, and Charlie, and researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, head of [[Jurassic Park#InGen|InGen]] security [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Vic Hoskins|Vic Hoskins]] believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Barry|Barry]] begrudgingly oppose.\n\nPrior to its opening, Claire and park owner [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Simon Masrani|Simon Masrani]] inspect the park's newest attraction, the ''[[List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series#Indominus rex|Indominus rex]]'', a [[Transgene|transgenic]] dinosaur created by geneticist [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Henry Wu|Dr. Henry Wu]]. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire that the ''Indominus'' lacks social skills, making it dangerous and unpredictable. When it seems that the ''Indominus'' has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The ''Indominus'', which can camouflage itself and [[Multi-spectral camouflage|mask its heat signature]], suddenly appears. Owen survives, but it devours the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen advises Masrani to have the ''Indominus'' executed, but to protect his company's investment, Masrani dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry, so it can safely be returned to its paddock. After most of the unit is slaughtered, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.\n\nWhile exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The ''Indominus'' arrives and destroys the vehicle but the boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center, repair an old [[Jeep Wrangler]], and drive back to the park resort. After Claire called Zara, she and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the ''Indominus''. Masrani and two troopers hunt the ''Indominus'' by helicopter but it breaks into the park's aviary, releasing [[pterosaur]]s \u2013 ''[[Pteranodon]]'' and ''[[Dimorphodon]]'' species \u2013 which collide with the helicopter, causing it to crash, killing Masrani and his troopers in the process. The pterosaurs attack the visitors, although Zara is trapped by a Pteranodon and devoured by the ''[[Mosasaurus]]''. Gray and Zach find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed personnel shoot down swarming pterosaurs with tranquilizers.\n\nAssuming command, Hoskins orders the raptors to be used to track the ''Indominus''. Forced to comply, Owen leads the raptors. Upon finding the ''Indominus'', the dinosaurs begin communicating among themselves. Owen realizes that the ''Indominus'' has ''Velociraptor'' [[DNA]] in it and it usurps Owen's dominance, becoming the pack's new [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]]. Troops fire on the ''Indominus'', but it escapes. The raptors slaughter most of the troops, but they do manage to kill Charlie. Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to protect Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the lab trying to secure more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills him.\n\nOwen re-establishes his bond with the three surviving raptors before the ''Indominus'' reappears. They attack the ''Indominus'', but Delta and Echo are killed while Blue is knocked unconscious. Claire releases the veteran ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' from its paddock and lures it into a decisive battle with the ''Indominus'', which gains the advantage over the ''T. rex'' until Blue recovers and rejoins the battle. With their combined strength, they corner the ''Indominus'' at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the park's ''[[Mosasaurus]]''.\n\nThe survivors are evacuated and the island is abandoned again. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide to stay together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align   = right\n| image1  = Chris Pratt by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| width1  = 160\n| height1 = 190\n| image2  = Bryce Dallas Howard NYFF 2010 \"Hereafter\" Press Conference(4) (cropped).jpg\n| width2  = 144\n| height2 = 160\n| image3  = BDWongNYCJune08.jpg\n| width3  = 187\n| height3 = 150\n| footer  = (L&C) [[Chris Pratt]] and [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] play the film's two leads, while [[BD Wong]] (R) reprises his role as Dr. Henry Wu from the [[Jurassic Park (film)|first film]].\n}}\n{{main|List of Jurassic Park characters}}\n<!-- DO NOT MODIFY THE ORDER OF THE CAST LIST!

Several dinosaur researchers called the film a \"dumb monster movie\" for failing to include new discoveries about the creatures; for example, the feathers or proto-feathers that covered some dinosaurs and the way ''[[Velociraptor]]'' held its front limbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141126-jurassic-park-trailer-experts-science/ |title='Jurassic World' Dinosaurs Stuck in the 1980s, Experts Grumble |first1=Linda |last1=Qiu |first2=Dan |last2=Vergano |date=November 26, 2014 |work=National Geographic |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206195709/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141126-jurassic-park-trailer-experts-science/ |archivedate=December 6, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Update\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3075451/New-Jurassic-World-film-slammed-dumb-monster-movie-dinosaurs-covered-fluffy-feathers-real-life.html |title=New Jurassic World film slammed as 'dumb monster movie' because dinosaurs were covered in fluffy feathers in real life |author=Khaleda Rahman |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=May 10, 2015 |accessdate=May 10, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150616192923/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3075451/New-Jurassic-World-film-slammed-dumb-monster-movie-dinosaurs-covered-fluffy-feathers-real-life.html |archivedate=June 16, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jurassic-world-scientists-criticise-dumb-monster-movie-for-lack-of-feathers-on-dinosaurs-10240525.html |title=Jurassic World: Scientists criticise 'dumb monster movie' for lack of feathers on dinosaurs |author=Jess Denham |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=([[Alexander Lebedev]]) |date=May 11, 2015 |accessdate=May 11, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513100327/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jurassic-world-scientists-criticise-dumb-monster-movie-for-lack-of-feathers-on-dinosaurs-10240525.html |archivedate=May 13, 2015 }}</ref> Since the film's teaser trailer release, many paleontologists expressed their disappointment on [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and their own [[blogs]], calling the dinosaurs that were featured a retrograde step from the original ''Jurassic Park''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2014/dec/04/scientists-disappointed-jurassic-world-dinosaurs-movie-film |title=Scientists disappointed Jurassic World dinosaurs don't look like dinosaurs |author=John Conway |work=The Guardian |date=December 4, 2014 |accessdate=December 6, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204152116/http://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2014/dec/04/scientists-disappointed-jurassic-world-dinosaurs-movie-film |archivedate=December 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to these criticisms, Trevorrow said, \"the film is scientifically 'inaccurate' because it is a science-fiction movie and not a documentary\".<ref name=\"Update\"/> The filmmakers had planned to depict feathered dinosaurs early in the film's development.<ref>{{cite news|last=Merali|first=Zeeya|title=Feathered ancestor of T. rex unearthed|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041004/full/041004-11.html|accessdate=June 19, 2017|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=October 6, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024083401/http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041004/full/041004-11.html|archivedate=October 24, 2004}}</ref> A fictional review on the film's theme park website speculates that the use of amphibian DNA to fill the gaps in the dinosaur DNA\u2014a plot point in the original novel and film\u2014prevented the dinosaurs from growing feathers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jurassicworld.com/tickets/john-hammond/ |title=Jurassic World |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829155054/http://www.jurassicworld.com/tickets/john-hammond/ |archivedate=August 29, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Writing credits dispute===\n{{See also|Production of Jurassic World#Writing}}\nAt the end of March 2015, a [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) arbitration panel ruled that Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver would receive [[WGA screenwriting credit system|credit]] for writing the screenplay with Trevorrow and Connolly, who disagreed with the decision,<ref name= April2 /><ref name=\"AR\"/> although they decided that under WGA rules they had no grounds to appeal.

It was directed by [[Colin Trevorrow]], written by [[Derek Connolly]] and Trevorrow, produced by [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] and Patrick Crowley, and stars [[Chris Pratt]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Ty Simpkins]], [[Nick Robinson (American actor)|Nick Robinson]], [[Omar Sy]], [[BD Wong]], and [[Irrfan Khan]].\n\nSet 22 years after the events of ''Jurassic Park'', ''Jurassic World'' takes place on the same fictional [[Central American]] island of [[Isla Nublar]], which is located off the Pacific coast of [[Costa Rica]], where a [[Animal theme park|theme park]] of [[Cloning|cloned]] [[dinosaur]]s has operated for nearly a decade. The park plunges into chaos when a [[Transgene|transgenic]] dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage.\n\n[[Universal Pictures]] intended to begin production of a fourth ''Jurassic Park'' film in 2004 for a mid-2005 release but development stalled while the script underwent several revisions. Following a suggestion from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], writers [[Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver]] explored the idea of a functional dinosaur park. Once Trevorrow was hired as director in 2013, he followed the same idea while developing a new script with Connolly. Filming lasted from April to August 2014 in [[Louisiana]] and [[Hawaii]]. The dinosaurs were created by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] using [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and by [[Legacy Effects]] using life-sized [[animatronics]].\n\nProduction was completed in May 2015,<ref name=SC-2015/> and ''Jurassic World'' was released in over 60 countries beginning on June 10, 2015.

Claire assigns her assistant Zara as the boys' guide, but they evade her and explore on their own. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Owen Grady|Owen Grady]] has been training four ''[[Velociraptor]]s'' named Blue, Echo, Delta, and Charlie, and researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, head of [[Jurassic Park#InGen|InGen]] security [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Vic Hoskins|Vic Hoskins]] believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Barry|Barry]] begrudgingly oppose.\n\nPrior to its opening, Claire and park owner [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Simon Masrani|Simon Masrani]] inspect the park's newest attraction, the ''[[List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series#Indominus rex|Indominus rex]]'', a [[Transgene|transgenic]] dinosaur created by geneticist [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Henry Wu|Dr. Henry Wu]]. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire that the ''Indominus'' lacks social skills, making it dangerous and unpredictable. When it seems that the ''Indominus'' has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The ''Indominus'', which can camouflage itself and [[Multi-spectral camouflage|mask its heat signature]], suddenly appears. Owen survives, but it devours the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen advises Masrani to have the ''Indominus'' executed, but to protect his company's investment, Masrani dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry, so it can safely be returned to its paddock. After most of the unit is slaughtered, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.\n\nWhile exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The ''Indominus'' arrives and destroys the vehicle but the boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center, repair an old [[Jeep Wrangler]], and drive back to the park resort. After Claire called Zara, she and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the ''Indominus''. Masrani and two troopers hunt the ''Indominus'' by helicopter but it breaks into the park's aviary, releasing [[pterosaur]]s \u2013 ''[[Pteranodon]]'' and ''[[Dimorphodon]]'' species \u2013 which collide with the helicopter, causing it to crash, killing Masrani and his troopers in the process. The pterosaurs attack the visitors, although Zara is trapped by a Pteranodon and devoured by the ''[[Mosasaurus]]''. Gray and Zach find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed personnel shoot down swarming pterosaurs with tranquilizers.\n\nAssuming command, Hoskins orders the raptors to be used to track the ''Indominus''. Forced to comply, Owen leads the raptors. Upon finding the ''Indominus'', the dinosaurs begin communicating among themselves. Owen realizes that the ''Indominus'' has ''Velociraptor'' [[DNA]] in it and it usurps Owen's dominance, becoming the pack's new [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]]. Troops fire on the ''Indominus'', but it escapes. The raptors slaughter most of the troops, but they do manage to kill Charlie. Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to protect Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the lab trying to secure more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills him.\n\nOwen re-establishes his bond with the three surviving raptors before the ''Indominus'' reappears. They attack the ''Indominus'', but Delta and Echo are killed while Blue is knocked unconscious. Claire releases the veteran ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' from its paddock and lures it into a decisive battle with the ''Indominus'', which gains the advantage over the ''T. rex'' until Blue recovers and rejoins the battle. With their combined strength, they corner the ''Indominus'' at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the park's ''[[Mosasaurus]]''.\n\nThe survivors are evacuated and the island is abandoned again. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide to stay together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align   = right\n| image1  = Chris Pratt by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| width1  = 160\n| height1 = 190\n| image2  = Bryce Dallas Howard NYFF 2010 \"Hereafter\" Press Conference(4) (cropped).jpg\n| width2  = 144\n| height2 = 160\n| image3  = BDWongNYCJune08.jpg\n| width3  = 187\n| height3 = 150\n| footer  = (L&C) [[Chris Pratt]] and [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] play the film's two leads, while [[BD Wong]] (R) reprises his role as Dr. Henry Wu from the [[Jurassic Park (film)|first film]].\n}}\n{{main|List of Jurassic Park characters}}\n<!-- DO NOT MODIFY THE ORDER OF THE CAST LIST!

Several dinosaur researchers called the film a \"dumb monster movie\" for failing to include new discoveries about the creatures; for example, the feathers or proto-feathers that covered some dinosaurs and the way ''[[Velociraptor]]'' held its front limbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141126-jurassic-park-trailer-experts-science/ |title='Jurassic World' Dinosaurs Stuck in the 1980s, Experts Grumble |first1=Linda |last1=Qiu |first2=Dan |last2=Vergano |date=November 26, 2014 |work=National Geographic |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206195709/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141126-jurassic-park-trailer-experts-science/ |archivedate=December 6, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Update\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3075451/New-Jurassic-World-film-slammed-dumb-monster-movie-dinosaurs-covered-fluffy-feathers-real-life.html |title=New Jurassic World film slammed as 'dumb monster movie' because dinosaurs were covered in fluffy feathers in real life |author=Khaleda Rahman |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=May 10, 2015 |accessdate=May 10, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150616192923/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3075451/New-Jurassic-World-film-slammed-dumb-monster-movie-dinosaurs-covered-fluffy-feathers-real-life.html |archivedate=June 16, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jurassic-world-scientists-criticise-dumb-monster-movie-for-lack-of-feathers-on-dinosaurs-10240525.html |title=Jurassic World: Scientists criticise 'dumb monster movie' for lack of feathers on dinosaurs |author=Jess Denham |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=([[Alexander Lebedev]]) |date=May 11, 2015 |accessdate=May 11, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513100327/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jurassic-world-scientists-criticise-dumb-monster-movie-for-lack-of-feathers-on-dinosaurs-10240525.html |archivedate=May 13, 2015 }}</ref> Since the film's teaser trailer release, many paleontologists expressed their disappointment on [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and their own [[blogs]], calling the dinosaurs that were featured a retrograde step from the original ''Jurassic Park''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2014/dec/04/scientists-disappointed-jurassic-world-dinosaurs-movie-film |title=Scientists disappointed Jurassic World dinosaurs don't look like dinosaurs |author=John Conway |work=The Guardian |date=December 4, 2014 |accessdate=December 6, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204152116/http://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2014/dec/04/scientists-disappointed-jurassic-world-dinosaurs-movie-film |archivedate=December 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to these criticisms, Trevorrow said, \"the film is scientifically 'inaccurate' because it is a science-fiction movie and not a documentary\".<ref name=\"Update\"/> The filmmakers had planned to depict feathered dinosaurs early in the film's development.<ref>{{cite news|last=Merali|first=Zeeya|title=Feathered ancestor of T. rex unearthed|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041004/full/041004-11.html|accessdate=June 19, 2017|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=October 6, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024083401/http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041004/full/041004-11.html|archivedate=October 24, 2004}}</ref> A fictional review on the film's theme park website speculates that the use of amphibian DNA to fill the gaps in the dinosaur DNA\u2014a plot point in the original novel and film\u2014prevented the dinosaurs from growing feathers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jurassicworld.com/tickets/john-hammond/ |title=Jurassic World |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829155054/http://www.jurassicworld.com/tickets/john-hammond/ |archivedate=August 29, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Writing credits dispute===\n{{See also|Production of Jurassic World#Writing}}\nAt the end of March 2015, a [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) arbitration panel ruled that Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver would receive [[WGA screenwriting credit system|credit]] for writing the screenplay with Trevorrow and Connolly, who disagreed with the decision,<ref name= April2 /><ref name=\"AR\"/> although they decided that under WGA rules they had no grounds to appeal.

Because the region separates the lower Adriatic coast from the [[Julian Alps]] range, extreme bora winds often occur there. They have influenced the region's traditional lifestyle and architecture. Towns on the coast, where the bora frequently occurs, are built densely with narrow streets in part because of the wind. Buildings in several towns and villages in [[Slovenia]] and the [[Province of Trieste]] ([[Italy]]) have stones on their roofs to prevent the tiles from being blown off. Chains and ropes are occasionally stretched along the sidewalks in downtown [[Trieste]], Italy, to facilitate pedestrian traffic &mdash; gusts in the city are usually above 120&nbsp;km/h reaching to maxima of near 200&nbsp;km/h.

Because the region separates the lower Adriatic coast from the [[Julian Alps]] range, extreme bora winds often occur there. They have influenced the region's traditional lifestyle and architecture. Towns on the coast, where the bora frequently occurs, are built densely with narrow streets in part because of the wind. Buildings in several towns and villages in [[Slovenia]] and the [[Province of Trieste]] ([[Italy]]) have stones on their roofs to prevent the tiles from being blown off. Chains and ropes are occasionally stretched along the sidewalks in downtown [[Trieste]], Italy, to facilitate pedestrian traffic &mdash; gusts in the city are usually above 120&nbsp;km/h reaching to maxima of near 200&nbsp;km/h. A strong bora will often be reported on Italian television news. Slovenian towns where the strongest bora occurs are [[Ajdov\u0161\u010dina]], [[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Nova Gorica]]. In Slovenia, the most affected section is usually the upper part of the Vipava Valley, stretching from Ajdov\u0161\u010dina to [[Podnanos]], where the speed of the wind can exceed 200&nbsp;km/h.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zurnal24.si/za-ajdovci-mirna-noc-pred-njimi-vetroven-dan-clanek-147460|title=Ekipe so v stalni pripravljenosti|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[File:Novorossiysk, 1997.jpg|thumb|After bora catastrophe, [[Novorossiysk]] 1997]]\nStrong bora winds also occur in the [[Tsemes Bay]] of the [[Black Sea]] near the Russian port of [[Novorossiysk]], where they are known as nordost (\"northeastern\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vydrenkov.com/index.html|title=A book about bora|access-date=6 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211025811/http://vydrenkov.com/index.html|archive-date=11 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> They can reach speeds of up to 220 kilometres per hour.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dzungarian Gate]]\n* [[Oroshi]]\n* [[Santa Ana winds]]\n* [[Volkswagen Bora]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Hann, Julius.
