It is [[List of Solar System objects by size#List of objects by radius|the fifth-largest]] satellite in the [[Solar System]], and by far<ref>{{cite book |last=Lowrie |first=William |date=1997 |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=5}}</ref> the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the [[planet]] that it orbits (its [[Primary (astronomy)|primary]]). The Moon is, after [[Jupiter]]'s satellite [[Io (moon)|Io]], the second-[[Density|densest]] satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.\n\nThe Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51&nbsp;billion years ago, [[Age of the Earth|not long after Earth]]. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a [[giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact]] between Earth and a hypothetical [[Mars]]-sized body called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]]. New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.universetoday.com/143025/the-moon-is-older-than-scientists-thought/ |title=The Moon is older than scientists thought |website=Universe Today}}</ref>\n\nThe Moon is in [[tidal locking|synchronous rotation]] with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to Earth, the [[near side of the Moon|near side]]. Because of [[libration]], slightly more than half (about 59%) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smoon4.htm |title=Libration of the Moon |last=Stern |first=David |date=30 March 2014 |website=NASA |access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref> The near side is marked by dark volcanic [[lunar mare|maria]] that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent [[impact crater]]s. After the [[Sun]], the Moon is the [[List of brightest natural objects in the sky|second-brightest celestial object]] regularly visible in Earth's sky. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the [[night sky]] it appears very bright, with a [[reflectance]] just slightly higher than that of worn [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]]. Its gravitational influence produces the [[tide|ocean tides]], [[Earth tide|body tides]], and the [[tidal acceleration|slight lengthening]] of the day.\n\nThe Moon's average [[lunar distance (astronomy)|orbital distance]] is {{cvt|384402|km|mi}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/ |title=How far away is the moon? |work=Space Place |publisher=NASA |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006220531/http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/ |archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Elaine |title=Our Moon: New discoveries about Earth's closest companion |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] Harcourt |year=2016 |page=7 |isbn=978-0-544-75058-6}}</ref> or 1.28&nbsp;light-seconds. This is about thirty times the diameter of Earth. The Moon's [[angular diameter|apparent size]] in the sky is almost the same as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400&nbsp;times the lunar distance and diameter. Therefore, the Moon covers the Sun nearly precisely during a total [[solar eclipse]]. This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the [[timeline of the far future|far future]] because the Moon's distance from Earth is gradually increasing.\n\nThe Moon was first reached by a human-made object in September 1959, when the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Luna 2]], an [[unmanned spacecraft]], was intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface. This accomplishment was followed by the first successful soft landing on the Moon by [[Luna 9]] in 1966. The [[United States]]' NASA [[Apollo program]] achieved the only manned lunar missions to date, beginning with the first manned orbital mission by [[Apollo 8]] in 1968, and six manned landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being [[Apollo 11]] in July&nbsp;1969. These missions returned [[Moon rock|lunar rocks]] which have been used to develop a [[Geology of the Moon|geological understanding]] of the [[Origin of the Moon|Moon's origin]], [[internal structure of the Moon|internal structure]], and the Moon's later history. Since the 1972 [[Apollo 17]] mission, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft.\n\nBoth the Moon's natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of [[lunar phases|phases]] as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures since time immemorial. Such cultural influences can be found in [[Moon#Name and etymology|language]], [[lunar calendar]] systems, [[Moon in fiction|art]], and [[lunar deity|mythology]].\n\n== Name and etymology ==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities}}\n[[File:Lunar eclipse October 8 2014 California Alfredo Garcia Jr mideclipse.JPG|thumb|The Moon, tinted reddish, during a [[lunar eclipse]]]]\n[[File:Two Lunar Phases.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|During the [[lunar phase]]s, only portions of the Moon can be observed from [[Earth]]]]\n\nThe usual [[English language|English]] proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply '''the Moon''', with a capital M.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |title=Naming Astronomical Objects: Spelling of Names |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=6 April 2020 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216024716/http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"PN-FAQ\" /> The noun ''moon'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''m\u014dna'', which (like all its [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] cognates) stems from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*m\u0113n\u014dn'',<ref>Vladimir Orel (2003) [https://archive.org/details/Orel-AHandbookOfGermanicEtymology/mode/2up/search/moon ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology,] Brill</ref> which in turn comes from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*m\u0113nsis'' \"month\"<ref>Fernando L\u00f3pez-Menchero, [https://indo-european.info/dictionary-translator/word.inc.php/ine/m%c4%93nsis Late Proto-Indo-European Etymological Lexicon]</ref> (from earlier ''*m\u0113n\u014dt'', genitive ''*m\u0113neses'') which may be related to the verb \"measure\" (of time).<ref name=\"barnhart1995\" />\n\nOccasionally, the name '''Luna''' {{IPAc-en|'|l|u\u02d0|n|\u0259}} is used in scientific writing<ref>E.g.

This is thought to be because the Moon fused from two different bodies.\n\nThis hypothesis, although not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen months prior to an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: \"You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, go back to your computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you have something to say about the Moon's birth.\" At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most consensual theory. <blockquote>Before the conference, there were partisans of the three \"traditional\" theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn't think the debate would ever be resolved.

As a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in [[tidal forces]]. Tidal forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.\n\nThe most obvious effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite. This results in elevated sea levels called [[tide|ocean tides]].<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> As the Earth spins on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place \"under\" the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth. The Sun has the same tidal effect on the Earth, but its forces of attraction are only 40% that of the Moon's; the Sun's and Moon's interplay is responsible for [[Spring tide|spring and neap tides]].<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects: the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the [[inertia]] of water's movement, ocean basins that grow shallower near land, the sloshing of water between different ocean basins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Le Provost |first=C. |author2=Bennett, A.F. |author3=Cartwright, D.E. |date=1995 |title=Ocean Tides for and from TOPEX/POSEIDON |pages=639\u2013642 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |pmid=17745840 |volume=267 |issue=5198 |bibcode=1995Sci...267..639L |doi=10.1126/science.267.5198.639}}</ref> As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.\n\nWhile gravitation causes acceleration and movement of the Earth's fluid oceans, gravitational coupling between the Moon and Earth's solid body is mostly elastic and plastic. The result is a further tidal effect of the Moon on the Earth that causes a bulge of the solid portion of the Earth nearest the Moon that acts as a [[torque]] in opposition to the Earth's rotation. This \"drains\" [[angular momentum]] and rotational [[kinetic energy]] from Earth's spin, slowing the Earth's rotation.<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /><ref name=\"touma1994\" /> That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process (confusingly known as [[tidal acceleration]]), which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit and results in its lower orbital speed about the Earth.

It is [[List of Solar System objects by size#List of objects by radius|the fifth-largest]] satellite in the [[Solar System]], and by far<ref>{{cite book |last=Lowrie |first=William |date=1997 |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=5}}</ref> the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the [[planet]] that it orbits (its [[Primary (astronomy)|primary]]). The Moon is, after [[Jupiter]]'s satellite [[Io (moon)|Io]], the second-[[Density|densest]] satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.\n\nThe Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51&nbsp;billion years ago, [[Age of the Earth|not long after Earth]]. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a [[giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact]] between Earth and a hypothetical [[Mars]]-sized body called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]]. New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.universetoday.com/143025/the-moon-is-older-than-scientists-thought/ |title=The Moon is older than scientists thought |website=Universe Today}}</ref>\n\nThe Moon is in [[tidal locking|synchronous rotation]] with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to Earth, the [[near side of the Moon|near side]]. Because of [[libration]], slightly more than half (about 59%) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smoon4.htm |title=Libration of the Moon |last=Stern |first=David |date=30 March 2014 |website=NASA |access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref> The near side is marked by dark volcanic [[lunar mare|maria]] that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent [[impact crater]]s. After the [[Sun]], the Moon is the [[List of brightest natural objects in the sky|second-brightest celestial object]] regularly visible in Earth's sky. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the [[night sky]] it appears very bright, with a [[reflectance]] just slightly higher than that of worn [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]]. Its gravitational influence produces the [[tide|ocean tides]], [[Earth tide|body tides]], and the [[tidal acceleration|slight lengthening]] of the day.\n\nThe Moon's average [[lunar distance (astronomy)|orbital distance]] is {{cvt|384402|km|mi}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/ |title=How far away is the moon? |work=Space Place |publisher=NASA |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006220531/http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/ |archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Elaine |title=Our Moon: New discoveries about Earth's closest companion |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] Harcourt |year=2016 |page=7 |isbn=978-0-544-75058-6}}</ref> or 1.28&nbsp;light-seconds. This is about thirty times the diameter of Earth. The Moon's [[angular diameter|apparent size]] in the sky is almost the same as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400&nbsp;times the lunar distance and diameter. Therefore, the Moon covers the Sun nearly precisely during a total [[solar eclipse]]. This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the [[timeline of the far future|far future]] because the Moon's distance from Earth is gradually increasing.\n\nThe Moon was first reached by a human-made object in September 1959, when the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Luna 2]], an [[unmanned spacecraft]], was intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface. This accomplishment was followed by the first successful soft landing on the Moon by [[Luna 9]] in 1966. The [[United States]]' NASA [[Apollo program]] achieved the only manned lunar missions to date, beginning with the first manned orbital mission by [[Apollo 8]] in 1968, and six manned landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being [[Apollo 11]] in July&nbsp;1969. These missions returned [[Moon rock|lunar rocks]] which have been used to develop a [[Geology of the Moon|geological understanding]] of the [[Origin of the Moon|Moon's origin]], [[internal structure of the Moon|internal structure]], and the Moon's later history. Since the 1972 [[Apollo 17]] mission, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft.\n\nBoth the Moon's natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of [[lunar phases|phases]] as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures since time immemorial. Such cultural influences can be found in [[Moon#Name and etymology|language]], [[lunar calendar]] systems, [[Moon in fiction|art]], and [[lunar deity|mythology]].\n\n== Name and etymology ==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities}}\n[[File:Lunar eclipse October 8 2014 California Alfredo Garcia Jr mideclipse.JPG|thumb|The Moon, tinted reddish, during a [[lunar eclipse]]]]\n[[File:Two Lunar Phases.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|During the [[lunar phase]]s, only portions of the Moon can be observed from [[Earth]]]]\n\nThe usual [[English language|English]] proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply '''the Moon''', with a capital M.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |title=Naming Astronomical Objects: Spelling of Names |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=6 April 2020 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216024716/http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"PN-FAQ\" /> The noun ''moon'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''m\u014dna'', which (like all its [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] cognates) stems from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*m\u0113n\u014dn'',<ref>Vladimir Orel (2003) [https://archive.org/details/Orel-AHandbookOfGermanicEtymology/mode/2up/search/moon ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology,] Brill</ref> which in turn comes from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*m\u0113nsis'' \"month\"<ref>Fernando L\u00f3pez-Menchero, [https://indo-european.info/dictionary-translator/word.inc.php/ine/m%c4%93nsis Late Proto-Indo-European Etymological Lexicon]</ref> (from earlier ''*m\u0113n\u014dt'', genitive ''*m\u0113neses'') which may be related to the verb \"measure\" (of time).<ref name=\"barnhart1995\" />\n\nOccasionally, the name '''Luna''' {{IPAc-en|'|l|u\u02d0|n|\u0259}} is used in scientific writing<ref>E.g.

This is thought to be because the Moon fused from two different bodies.\n\nThis hypothesis, although not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen months prior to an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: \"You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, go back to your computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you have something to say about the Moon's birth.\" At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most consensual theory. <blockquote>Before the conference, there were partisans of the three \"traditional\" theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn't think the debate would ever be resolved.

As a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in [[tidal forces]]. Tidal forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.\n\nThe most obvious effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite. This results in elevated sea levels called [[tide|ocean tides]].<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> As the Earth spins on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place \"under\" the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth. The Sun has the same tidal effect on the Earth, but its forces of attraction are only 40% that of the Moon's; the Sun's and Moon's interplay is responsible for [[Spring tide|spring and neap tides]].<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects: the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the [[inertia]] of water's movement, ocean basins that grow shallower near land, the sloshing of water between different ocean basins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Le Provost |first=C. |author2=Bennett, A.F. |author3=Cartwright, D.E. |date=1995 |title=Ocean Tides for and from TOPEX/POSEIDON |pages=639\u2013642 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |pmid=17745840 |volume=267 |issue=5198 |bibcode=1995Sci...267..639L |doi=10.1126/science.267.5198.639}}</ref> As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.\n\nWhile gravitation causes acceleration and movement of the Earth's fluid oceans, gravitational coupling between the Moon and Earth's solid body is mostly elastic and plastic. The result is a further tidal effect of the Moon on the Earth that causes a bulge of the solid portion of the Earth nearest the Moon that acts as a [[torque]] in opposition to the Earth's rotation. This \"drains\" [[angular momentum]] and rotational [[kinetic energy]] from Earth's spin, slowing the Earth's rotation.<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /><ref name=\"touma1994\" /> That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process (confusingly known as [[tidal acceleration]]), which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit and results in its lower orbital speed about the Earth.

This work of Sela has led to the discovery of the genetic control of the immune response, as well as to the design of [[vaccine]]s based on synthetic molecules.\n\nHe was among the first who introduced the use of linear and branched synthetic [[polypeptide]]s as antigens, and this  brought about a better understanding of immunological phenomena.\n\nFor several decades, Sela has been interested in the possibility of fighting the autoimmune disease, experimental allergic [[encephalomyelitis]] (EAE) with synthetic analogs of the molecules in the [[myelin sheath]] of the brain which are capable of provoking the disease.\n\nHe is probably best known as the co-developer (with [[Ruth Arnon]] and [[Dvora Teitelbaum]]) of the [[multiple sclerosis]] drug [[copaxone]].\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nSela has received several awards.

This work of Sela has led to the discovery of the genetic control of the immune response, as well as to the design of [[vaccine]]s based on synthetic molecules.\n\nHe was among the first who introduced the use of linear and branched synthetic [[polypeptide]]s as antigens, and this  brought about a better understanding of immunological phenomena.\n\nFor several decades, Sela has been interested in the possibility of fighting the autoimmune disease, experimental allergic [[encephalomyelitis]] (EAE) with synthetic analogs of the molecules in the [[myelin sheath]] of the brain which are capable of provoking the disease.\n\nHe is probably best known as the co-developer (with [[Ruth Arnon]] and [[Dvora Teitelbaum]]) of the [[multiple sclerosis]] drug [[copaxone]].\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nSela has received several awards.

The Hoyas were coached by [[John Thompson III]] and played their home games at the [[Capital One Arena|Verizon Center]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The Hoyas were members of the original [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]]. They finished the season 16-15, 7-11 in Big East play. They lost to [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] in the first round of the [[2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]]. They received an at\u2013large bid to the [[2009 National Invitation Tournament]], earning a 6 seed in one of the NIT{{'}}s regions, and lost to [[2008\u201309 Baylor Bears men's basketball team|Baylor]] in the first round.\n\n==Season recap==\n\n===Regular season===\n\nComing off a [[2007\u201308 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|2007-08 season]] which saw a second consecutive [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] regular-season championship, a second straight appearance in the [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] final, a third straight [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] appearance, and a postseason No. 12 national ranking for Georgetown, the Hoyas were expected to have another impressive season even though only one scholarship senior, Jessie Sapp, returned for 2008-09. Although four-year starter and [[point guard]] [[Jonathan Wallace]] had graduated in 2008, sophomore [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1989)|Chris Wright]], recovered from a broken foot that caused him to miss much of the 2007-08 campaign, was expected to fill in ably as his successor, and the Hoyas placed great confidence in freshman [[Center (basketball)|center]] [[Greg Monroe]] as the next \"big man\" who could replace center [[Roy Hibbert]], who also had graduated in 2008. Although guard [[Jeremiah Rivers]] had transferred to [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] during the offseason, sophomore guard [[Austin Freeman]] returned after a very promising freshman year. At [[Forward (basketball)|forward]], [[Patrick Ewing, Jr.]], had departed through graduation, but junior [[DaJuan Summers]] returned and, although forward [[Vernon Macklin]] had transferred to [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida]] after the previous season in search of greater playing time, sophomore forward [[Julian Vaughn]] joined the Hoyas after playing for a season at [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]]. Freshman center [[Henry Sims]] also joined the team to come off the bench behind Monroe. The Hoyas entered the season with a No. 22 ranking in the preseason [[Associated Press Poll]].\n\n====Non-conference schedule====\n[[File:DaJuan Summers ready to dunk.jpg|300px|thumb|left|DaJuan Summers comes in for a dunk against Drexel at the Verizon Center on November&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2008.

Early in the second half, the Hoyas went on a 23-10 run to pull ahead, 65-57, but the Volunteers then responded with a 10-1 run of their own to take a 67-66 lead, followed by an 8-3 run to give Tennessee a 75-69 advantage. With some starters in early foul trouble on both sides, both teams\u2032 benches saw significant playing time, and that worked to Tennessee's advantage, with the Volunteers\u2032 bench outscoring the Hoyas\u2032 bench 37-12.

Summers led the team with 21 points, Austin Freeman scored 18, Chris Wright added 14 points and played an excellent defensive game against Tigers [[point guard]] [[Tyreke Evans]], and Greg Monroe had 13 points and six rebounds. It was a tight game, with Memphis leading 38-37 at the half, and for six of the last 6\u00bd minutes of the second half neither team led by more than one point, Freeman finally putting the Hoyas ahead 66-64 with a free throw with 31 seconds left in regulation. The Tigers scored to tie the game at 66-66 and force overtime, but thereafter shot 1-for-9 from the field while the Hoyas outscored Memphis 13-4 during overtime for a 79-70 upset victory.

Georgetown began the game with an 18-3 run against the veteran Huskies, and led 36-27 at halftime. Thirteen seconds into the second half, Greg Monroe hit a three-pointer to stretch the lead to 39-27, but Connecticut then went on a 13-1 run to close to a 40-37 deficit. With Georgetown clinging to a 42-39 lead with 13:19 left to play, Austin Freeman sparked Georgetown's offense, scoring seven of the first nine points of a 14-6 Georgetown run that gave the Hoyas a 56-45 advantage with 9:46 remaining. Connecticut never got closer than nine points the rest of the way, and Georgetown led by as many as 17 points in pulling off a 74-63 upset victory. In the second half, the Hoyas made 18 straight free throws and finished 18-for-21 (85.7 percent) from the free-throw line. DaJuan Summers had 18 points, Chris Wright and Greg Monroe scored 16 points each, and Freeman added 13.

Georgetown fell precipitously from the Top Ten early in January to a 16-15 record by the end of the season, with losses in 12 of their final 16 games and first-round exits from both the Big East Tournament and the NIT. After the Hoyas defeated DePaul in the last game of the regular season and reporters asked Blue Demons head coach [[Jerry Wainwright]] about his thoughts on why the 2008-2009 Georgetown team had fallen so far so fast, he replied that the Hoyas \"started with a bang and, I think, youth caught up with them.\"<ref name=depaul20090307/>\n\n==Roster==\nSource<ref>http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/gu/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/0809roster.pdf</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|#\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Height\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Weight (lbs.)\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Class\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Hometown\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Previous Team(s)\n|-\n|3\n|[[DaJuan Summers]]\n|6'8\"\n|236\n|[[Forward (basketball)|F]]\n|Jr.\n|[[Baltimore, MD]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[McDonogh School]]\n|-\n|4\n|[[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1989)|Chris Wright]]\n|6'1\"\n|201\n|[[Guard (basketball)|G]]\n|So.\n|[[Bowie, MD]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[St. John's College High School|St. John's College HS]]\n|-\n|5\n|Nikita Mescheriakov\n|6'8\"\n|214\n|[[Guard (basketball)|G]]/[[Forward (basketball)|F]]\n|So.\n|[[Minsk]], [[Belarus]]\n|[[St. John's College High School|St. John's College HS]]\n|-\n|10\n|[[Greg Monroe]]\n|6'11\"\n|250\n|[[Center (basketball)|C]]\n|Fr.\n|[[New Orleans, LA]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[Helen Cox High School|Helen Cox HS]]\n|-\n|11\n|Bryon Jansen\n|6'6\"\n|211\n|[[Forward (basketball)|F]]\n|Sr.\n|[[Kent, WA]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[Seattle Christian Schools]]\n|-\n|15\n|[[Austin Freeman]]\n|6'4\"\n|239\n|[[Guard (basketball)|G]]\n|So.\n|[[Mitchellville, MD]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[DeMatha Catholic High School|DeMatha HS]]\n|-\n|20\n|[[Jason Clark (basketball)|Jason Clark]]\n|6'2\"\n|176\n|[[Guard (basketball)|G]]\n|Fr.\n|[[Arlington, VA]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[Bishop Denis J.

team''' represented [[Georgetown University]] in the 2008\u20132009 [[NCAA Division I]] basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by [[John Thompson III]] and played their home games at the [[Capital One Arena|Verizon Center]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The Hoyas were members of the original [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]]. They finished the season 16-15, 7-11 in Big East play. They lost to [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] in the first round of the [[2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]]. They received an at\u2013large bid to the [[2009 National Invitation Tournament]], earning a 6 seed in one of the NIT{{'}}s regions, and lost to [[2008\u201309 Baylor Bears men's basketball team|Baylor]] in the first round.\n\n==Season recap==\n\n===Regular season===\n\nComing off a [[2007\u201308 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|2007-08 season]] which saw a second consecutive [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] regular-season championship, a second straight appearance in the [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] final, a third straight [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] appearance, and a postseason No. 12 national ranking for Georgetown, the Hoyas were expected to have another impressive season even though only one scholarship senior, Jessie Sapp, returned for 2008-09. Although four-year starter and [[point guard]] [[Jonathan Wallace]] had graduated in 2008, sophomore [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1989)|Chris Wright]], recovered from a broken foot that caused him to miss much of the 2007-08 campaign, was expected to fill in ably as his successor, and the Hoyas placed great confidence in freshman [[Center (basketball)|center]] [[Greg Monroe]] as the next \"big man\" who could replace center [[Roy Hibbert]], who also had graduated in 2008. Although guard [[Jeremiah Rivers]] had transferred to [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] during the offseason, sophomore guard [[Austin Freeman]] returned after a very promising freshman year. At [[Forward (basketball)|forward]], [[Patrick Ewing, Jr.]], had departed through graduation, but junior [[DaJuan Summers]] returned and, although forward [[Vernon Macklin]] had transferred to [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida]] after the previous season in search of greater playing time, sophomore forward [[Julian Vaughn]] joined the Hoyas after playing for a season at [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]]. Freshman center [[Henry Sims]] also joined the team to come off the bench behind Monroe. The Hoyas entered the season with a No. 22 ranking in the preseason [[Associated Press Poll]].\n\n====Non-conference schedule====\n[[File:DaJuan Summers ready to dunk.jpg|300px|thumb|left|DaJuan Summers comes in for a dunk against Drexel at the Verizon Center on November&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2008.

They met [[2008\u201309 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Wichita State]] in the first round in a game in which the Shockers outrebounded the Hoyas 17-6 but shot only 27.9 percent from the field, and Georgetown went 8-for-8 in free throws in the final minute to preserve a 58-50 victory, with Austin Freeman scoring a game-high 18 points, DaJuan Summers 14, and Greg Monroe 11.<ref>[http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=283320046 Anonymous, \"Freeman leads Hoyas to victory, second-round meeting vs. Tennessee,\" Associated Press, November 27, 2008.]</ref> In the semifinal the following day, the Hoyas faced No. 12 [[2008\u201309 Tennessee Volunteers basketball team|Tennessee]], their first ranked opponent of the season.

But Georgetown also committed 20 turnovers, including 10 in the first 15 minutes, and had an uncharacteristically porous defense, allowing the Volunteers also to shoot 53 percent from the field, and Tennessee had a 39-37 advantage at halftime. Early in the second half, the Hoyas went on a 23-10 run to pull ahead, 65-57, but the Volunteers then responded with a 10-1 run of their own to take a 67-66 lead, followed by an 8-3 run to give Tennessee a 75-69 advantage. With some starters in early foul trouble on both sides, both teams\u2032 benches saw significant playing time, and that worked to Tennessee's advantage, with the Volunteers\u2032 bench outscoring the Hoyas\u2032 bench 37-12.

Freeman scored 18 points, Summers contributed 14, Monroe had 12, and Jessie Sapp scored 10 as the Hoyas made 10 of their first 14 shots, shot 53.1 percent from the field, and held the Terrapins to 36.1 percent shooting.

DaJuan Summers scored 16 points, Wright had 13, and sophomore guard/forward Nikita Mescheriakov, starting in place of Jessie Sapp, contributed a career-high 11 points as Georgetown upset Villanova 56-54, the Hoyas' fifth straight win over the Wildcats.<ref>[http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=290590222 Anonymous, \"Summers, Wright lead Hoyas past Villanova,\" Associated Press, March 1, 2009.]</ref>\n\nGeorgetown finished its regular season with an overtime loss at [[2008\u201309 St. John's Red Storm men's basketball team|St. John's]] \u2013 the first overtime game in the 91 meetings between the schools \u2013 in which the Hoyas blew a 45-30 lead, breaking a five-game Hoya winning streak against the Red Storm,<ref name=stjohns20090303>[http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=290622599 Anonymous, \"St. John's 59, Georgetown 56,\" Associated Press, March 3, 2009.]</ref> and a low-scoring win at the Verizon Center against [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]] that dealt the Blue Demons their 18th straight defeat and gave them a winless Big East season.<ref name=depaul20090307>[http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=290660046 Anonymous, \"Georgetown 48, DePaul 40,\" Associated Press, March 7, 2009.]</ref> Greg Monroe had 18 points against St. John's,<ref name=stjohns20090303/> while DaJuan Summers scored 10 points against St. John's<ref name=stjohns20090303/> and 15 in the DePaul game.<ref name=depaul20090307/> Austin Freeman sat out the St. John's game with a hip injury,<ref name=stjohns20090303/> but started the DePaul game and scored two points.<ref name=depaul20090307/>\n\nThe Hoyas finished the regular season with a record of 16-13 overall and 7-11 in the Big East, tied with Seton Hall for 11th place. It was their first losing record in the conference since the [[2003\u201304 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|2003-04 season]].\n\n===Big East Tournament===\n{{main|2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament}}\n\nSeeded 12th in the [[2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|2009 Big East Tournament]], Georgetown needed to win the tournament championship in order to make the [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2009 NCAA Tournament]]. In the first round, the Hoyas faced the No. 13 seed, St. John's, which had not won a Big East Tournament game since [[2003 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|2003]] and had only qualified for the tournament once in the previous five years. St. John's led 30-28 at halftime and extended its lead to 46-37 in the second half before the Hoyas went on a 12-0 run to take the lead, 49-46, with 6:05 left to play.

Seeded sixth in one of the NIT's four regions, the Hoyas faced the region's No. 3 seed, [[2008\u201309 Baylor Bears basketball team|Baylor]], in the first round on Baylor's home court. The Hoyas shot 16-for-21 (76.2 percent) from the field in the first half to take a 44-34 lead at halftime, but the Bears opened the second half with a 13-2 run that gave them a 47-46 lead with 16:24 left to play. Georgetown retook the lead and stretched it to as many as five points, but Baylor junior guard [[Tweety Carter]] hit a three-pointer with 4:29 to play that gave the Bears the lead for good at 70-67. The Bears were clinging to a 72-69 lead with 11 seconds left when Chris Wright missed a three-pointer and Baylor sophomore guard [[LaceDarius Dunn]] grabbed the rebound, took a foul, and made two free throws to give Baylor a 74-69 advantage. DaJuan Summers sank a three-pointer with four seconds remaining to close to 74-72, and, after Carter missed the front half of a one-and-one, attempted his final shot as a Hoya, a long-distance heave that missed. Baylor won a postseason game for the first time since 1950, and Georgetown's disappointing season ended with a 16-15 record and the Hoyas exiting the NIT in the first round for the first time since [[1999 National Invitation Tournament|1999]].<ref>[http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=290770239 Anonymous, \"Baylor stops Georgetown to break out of postseason slump,\" Associated Press, March 21, 2008.]</ref><ref>[http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/playbyplay?gameId=290770239 Play-by-Play, Georgetown vs. Baylor, March 18, 2009.]</ref>\n\n===Wrap-up===\nFor the season, DaJuan Summers led the Hoyas in scoring, shooting 47.4 percent from the field and finishing with 13.6 points per game, while Greg Monroe finished the year with the team's highest field goal percentage (57.2 percent) and averaged 12.7 points per game. Chris Wright and Austin Freeman both shot 48.2 percent, with Wright averaging 12.5 points per game and Freeman 11.4 points.

Georgetown fell precipitously from the Top Ten early in January to a 16-15 record by the end of the season, with losses in 12 of their final 16 games and first-round exits from both the Big East Tournament and the NIT. After the Hoyas defeated DePaul in the last game of the regular season and reporters asked Blue Demons head coach [[Jerry Wainwright]] about his thoughts on why the 2008-2009 Georgetown team had fallen so far so fast, he replied that the Hoyas \"started with a bang and, I think, youth caught up with them.\"<ref name=depaul20090307/>\n\n==Roster==\nSource<ref>http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/gu/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/0809roster.pdf</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|#\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Height\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Weight (lbs.)\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Class\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Hometown\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Previous Team(s)\n|-\n|3\n|[[DaJuan Summers]]\n|6'8\"\n|236\n|[[Forward (basketball)|F]]\n|Jr.\n|[[Baltimore, MD]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[McDonogh School]]\n|-\n|4\n|[[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1989)|Chris Wright]]\n|6'1\"\n|201\n|[[Guard (basketball)|G]]\n|So.\n|[[Bowie, MD]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[St. John's College High School|St. John's College HS]]\n|-\n|5\n|Nikita Mescheriakov\n|6'8\"\n|214\n|[[Guard (basketball)|G]]/[[Forward (basketball)|F]]\n|So.\n|[[Minsk]], [[Belarus]]\n|[[St. John's College High School|St. John's College HS]]\n|-\n|10\n|[[Greg Monroe]]\n|6'11\"\n|250\n|[[Center (basketball)|C]]\n|Fr.\n|[[New Orleans, LA]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[Helen Cox High School|Helen Cox HS]]\n|-\n|11\n|Bryon Jansen\n|6'6\"\n|211\n|[[Forward (basketball)|F]]\n|Sr.\n|[[Kent, WA]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[Seattle Christian Schools]]\n|-\n|15\n|[[Austin Freeman]]\n|6'4\"\n|239\n|[[Guard (basketball)|G]]\n|So.\n|[[Mitchellville, MD]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[DeMatha Catholic High School|DeMatha HS]]\n|-\n|20\n|[[Jason Clark (basketball)|Jason Clark]]\n|6'2\"\n|176\n|[[Guard (basketball)|G]]\n|Fr.\n|[[Arlington, VA]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n|[[Bishop Denis J.

{"title_page": "Flute Sonata (Poulenc)", "text_new": "The '''''Sonate pour fl\u00fbte et piano''''' ('''Flute Sonata'''), [[FP (Poulenc)|FP]] 164, by [[Francis Poulenc]], is a three-movement work for [[flute]] and [[piano]],  written in 1957. \n\nThe sonata was commissioned by the American [[Library of Congress]] and is dedicated to the memory of [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], an American patron of chamber music. Poulenc preferred composing for woodwinds above strings. He premiered the piece with the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. The work was an immediate success, and was quickly taken up in the US, Britain and elsewhere and has been recorded many times. Critics have noted Poulenc's characteristic \"trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment\" in the piece. In 1976, thirteen years after Poulenc's death, the composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] made a well-regarded orchestrated version of the work that has also been recorded.\n\nThe flute sonata became one of Poulenc's best-known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire. It has a claim to be the most played of any work for flute and piano.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015). Notes to Nimbus CD NI 5933</ref> In April 1956, when he was still working on the opera, he was approached by [[Harold Spivacke]] of the American [[Library of Congress]] with a request to write a piece for two pianos or alternatively a chamber piece for up to six instruments.<ref>Schmidt (2001), p. 408</ref> Poulenc was too busy to accept, but Spivacke persisted. Poulenc told him, \"Much more at home with wind instruments than strings, I admit I am tempted by this combination\", as he had always preferred winds \u2013 with their similarities to the human voice \u2013 to stringed instruments.{{refn|Poulenc wrote: \"nothing could be further from human breath than the stroke of a bow\". He thought little of his own sonatas for cello and for violin.<ref>Mellers, pp. 160\u2013161</ref>|group=n}} In August he agreed to go ahead.<ref name=ib>Battioni, Isabelle (2000). Notes to Naxos CD 8.553611</ref> The sonata was commissioned in memory of a musical benefactor, [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], to whom Poulenc dedicated the work.<ref name=nimbus/> \n\nPoulenc spent the winter of 1956\u201357 in [[Cannes]], where he composed the sonata between December and March.<ref name=mm> MacDonald, Malcolm (2013). Notes to Opus Arte CD OACD9012D</ref> When he had completed the first two of the three movements, he wrote to his friend [[Pierre Bernac]]:\n{{blockindent|In working on this Flute Sonata I have the feeling of going back a long way, but with a more settled technique. It's a sonata of [[Claude Debussy|Debussyan]] dimensions. It's the French sense of balance [''la mesure fran\u00e7aise'']. Finding the form for your language is the most difficult thing. It's what [[Anton Webern|Webern]] has in the highest degree \u2026 and what [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]] has not yet found.<ref>Nichols, p. 251</ref>|}}\n\nOn 18 June 1957, the public premiere was given at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]] by the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]], for whom it had been written, with the composer at the piano.<ref name=hype>Mawer, Deborah (2001). Notes to Hyperion CD CDH55386</ref>{{refn|Rampal and Poulenc had given gave the work a private performance the previous day to an audience of one: the pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]], who could not be present at the official premiere.<ref name=mm/>|group=n}} ''[[Le Figaro]]'' said of the work, \"The music burst forth from the heart, without formality, and 'sang', in every sense\". Another critic stated that the sonata was \"the best of Poulenc, and even a little better\".<ref name=js>Siegel, Joseph (2000). Notes to 4Tay CD 4019</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe sonata is in three movements, taking a total of 12 minutes in performance.<ref>Poulenc, p. 1</ref> The score was published in France and Britain shortly after the premiere. In 1994 a new edition by Carl B. Schmidt and Patricia Harper was issued, correcting discrepancies and errors in the earlier published score.<ref name=js/> The musicologist [[Malcolm MacDonald (music critic)|Malcolm MacDonald]] writes of the sonata:\n\n{{block indent|The work is infused with Poulenc\u2019s trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment, which are manifested in different ways in each of its three movements.

Poulenc preferred composing for woodwinds above strings. He premiered the piece with the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. The work was an immediate success, and was quickly taken up in the US, Britain and elsewhere and has been recorded many times. Critics have noted Poulenc's characteristic \"trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment\" in the piece. In 1976, thirteen years after Poulenc's death, the composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] made a well-regarded orchestrated version of the work that has also been recorded.\n\nThe flute sonata became one of Poulenc's best known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire. It has a claim to be the most played of any work for flute and piano.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015). Notes to Nimbus CD NI 5933</ref> In April 1956, when he was still working on the opera, he was approached by [[Harold Spivacke]] of the American [[Library of Congress]] with a request to write a piece for two pianos or alternatively a chamber piece for up to six instruments.<ref>Schmidt (2001), p. 408</ref> Poulenc was too busy to accept, but Spivacke persisted. Poulenc told him, \"Much more at home with wind instruments than strings, I admit I am tempted by this combination\", as he had always preferred winds \u2013 with their similarities to the human voice \u2013 to stringed instruments.{{refn|Poulenc wrote: \"nothing could be further from human breath than the stroke of a bow\".
