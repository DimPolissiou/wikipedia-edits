Built on the site of an earlier, smaller flour mill, which itself replaced an iron [[forge]]\u2014one of many in the Crawley area\u2014it fell into disuse in the 1930s.  The local council, which acquired the land for housing development in the 1970s, leased the mill to local enthusiasts, who restored it to working order.  The mill and an associated house are [[Listed building|listed]] buildings, and there is also a cottage (not listed) on the site.\n\n==History of the site==\nThe area around Ifield was originally thickly wooded, forming part of [[St Leonard's Forest]].<ref name=\"Bracher1\">{{Harvnb|Bracher|1994|p=1.}}</ref>  Small [[stream|brooks]] and tributaries of the [[River Mole]] run through the soil, which is an area of Weald [[clay]] between the sandier soil to the south and a narrow outcrop of [[limestone]] further north.<ref name=\"Survey2\">{{Harvnb|Gibson-Hill|Henbery|1979|p=2.}}</ref>  At least one mill had been established in the village by the 13th century, although this was further north.<ref name=\"VCH18407\">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pt3/pp63-67|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3 \u2013 Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town.

By 1606, \"a house, barn, mill, mill pond and two [[Croft (land)|crofts]] of land known as Ifield Mill and Ifield Mill Pond\"<ref group=note>Quoted in the [[deed]]s of the mill.</ref> had been established.<ref name=\"Bracher2\"/>  The Middletons, a rich local family who owned many ironworks across [[Sussex]], [[lease]]d the mill and its associated buildings.

Bewbush furnace closed in 1642 because the area had been completely deforested and there was no more wood to use for fuel; the following year, as the [[English Civil War]] raged, [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] overran the area and destroyed all remnants of the industry.  The site of Ifield forge was cleared, and a corn mill was built in its place.<ref name=\"Bracher3\"/>  (At the time, the generic name \"mill\" was used to describe forges, and their operators were called \"millers\" or \"farmers\".  This makes it difficult to determine exactly when the change happened.)<ref name=\"Bracher2\"/>  It was definitely operating by 1660, when a local [[Quaker]], William Garton, operated it.

It was rebuilt in 1683.<ref name=\"Bracher4\">{{Harvnb|Bracher|1994|p=4.}}</ref>  The Middleton family owned the mill and its associated buildings outright by this time; another prosperous local businessman, Leonard Gale, bought it in 1715.<ref name=\"Survey4\"/>  By 1759 it had passed out of his family and began a 50-year period in which various combinations of partners owned it.<ref name=\"Bracher7\">{{Harvnb|Bracher|1994|p=7.}}</ref>  By this time it was the largest corn mill in the area; when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] threatened to [[Napoleon's invasion of the United Kingdom|invade the United Kingdom]], a survey was undertaken to determine the output of all mills, which found that Ifield Mill could supply 16 sacks of flour and 120 loaves of bread each day.  Other local mills could manage no more than four sacks per day.<ref name=\"Bracher8\">{{Harvnb|Bracher|1994|p=8.}}</ref>\n\nDespite its efficient output, the mill fell into disuse in the 1810s after London-based businessman [[Goldsmid family|Abraham Goldsmid]] bought it in 1809.  It lay unused for eight years until Thomas Durrant, a miller from nearby [[Merstham]], bought it for \u00a31,200 in 1817.  Durrant was the first owner who also acted as miller, and under his ownership the mill was completely rebuilt.<ref name=\"Survey4\"/><ref name=\"Bracher8\"/>\n\n==Reconstruction==\n[[File:Ifield Brook.jpg|thumb|left|Ifield Brook as it flows into the mill pond]]\nThe 1683 building was demolished and the structure which stands today was built in its place.  A decorative stone tablet with the date 1683 and the initials of Thomas Middleton and his wife Mary was salvaged and mounted on the exterior.  (Middleton was the owner at the time of the 1683 rebuilding.)<ref name=\"Bracher4\"/>  Thomas Durrant spent \u00a33,500 on construction.  This money came from successful litigation against a group of miners whose actions damaged the water supply to his mill at Merstham and rendered it useless;<ref name=\"Bracher8\"/> a similar problem started to affect the Ifield mill soon after it was rebuilt.  The water supply began to fail as the brook's flow became weaker, and in 1848 the mill pond was cut in half by the building of the [[Arun Valley Line|railway line]] to [[Horsham]].  This originally crossed it on a bridge, but an [[Embankment (transportation)|embankment]] soon replaced it.<ref name=\"Bracher9\">{{Harvnb|Bracher|1994|p=9.}}</ref>  Also, in 1837, a competing [[windmill]] had been built near the centre of the village,<ref name=\"Bracher9\"/><ref name=\"Survey7\">{{Harvnb|Gibson-Hill|Henbery|1979|p=7.}}</ref> and two other millers were recorded in Ifield parish by 1821.<ref name=\"VCH18407\"/>  Gradual decline continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries; the mill passed through many owners, and even one long-established family of owner-millers, the Hardings, struggled.  A steam engine driven by a [[waterwheel]] had been installed, but the engine often had to be worked manually because the water power was so feeble.<ref name=\"Bracher9\"/>  The mill was no longer in use by 1927,<ref name=\"Restoration1\">{{Harvnb|Henbery|1996|p=1.}}</ref> and it was put up for sale with the adjacent Mill Cottage in 1934.  Described as \"a gentleman's residence with a picturesque disused water mill\",<ref name=\"Bracher9\"/><ref name=\"Survey7\"/> it was clear that the mill's importance had ebbed away.\n\n==Restoration==\n[[File:Mill pond at Ifield Water Mill, Sussex.jpg|thumb|right|Looking south over the mill pond]]\nThe mill stood unused, apart from for storage, and nominally for sale until Crawley Borough Council used a [[compulsory purchase order]] to buy it in 1974.<ref name=\"Restoration1\"/>  The council was acquiring land on the edge of Ifield for housing.<ref name=\"Survey7\"/>  It allowed a group of volunteers to attempt to restore the mill, which was in poor structural condition.  Work started on 15 June 1974.<ref name=\"Restoration1\"/>\n\nAll parts of the structure were affected by the neglect and long period of disuse.  Trees had invaded the building, dislodging the roof; the main timbers holding the building up were rotting and needed replacement; a retaining wall had collapsed inwards; and the water wheel, while still sound, was embedded in the mud.  The work took eight years\u2014much longer than the original estimate of three, although large donations of money paid for many interior fittings which had not been taken into account.<ref name=\"Restoration1\"/>  Three staircases, the board cladding on the inside walls and the wooden floors were all renewed, and all windows were refitted to their original design.<ref name=\"Restoration2\">{{Harvnb|Henbery|1996|p=2.}}</ref><ref name=\"Restoration3\">{{Harvnb|Henbery|1996|p=3.}}</ref>  On the exterior, the weatherboarding was removed and a layer of waterproof cladding installed.  Much of the boardwork had to be replaced, although the original appearance was preserved.  The roof was also repaired inside and out to prevent it decaying any further.<ref name=\"Restoration2\"/>\n\nReplacing the load-bearing timbers and supports was particularly difficult.  The whole building had to be lifted with [[Jack (device)#Hydraulic jack|hydraulic jacks]] and suspended aloft temporarily while new timbers were installed.<ref name=\"Restoration2\"/>  Work on the water wheel and its surrounding brick structure was also difficult and took several years.  Parts of the wheel were salvaged and incorporated into the rebuilt oak and steel structure.  The walls supporting it were totally rebuilt at the same time.  A [[Sluice|sluice gate]] was built across the mill pond, and a flow control mechanism was brought in from the disused Hammonds Mill in [[Burgess Hill]], also in West Sussex.<ref name=\"Restoration3\"/>  The wheel is of the [[Water wheel#Overshot wheel|overshot]] type\u2014the largest such wheel in Sussex<ref name=\"Survey7\"/>\u2014weighs around {{convert|6|LT|t ST}}, has a diameter of {{convert|11|ft|m}} and can rotate at between 8 and 15 revolutions per minute depending on water flow.<ref name=\"Restoration4\">{{Harvnb|Henbery|1996|p=4.}}</ref>\n\nDespite its scale and the difficulty of many of the tasks, the restoration was carried out almost entirely by volunteers working mostly at weekends.  Some unemployed people enrolled in a [[job creation program]]me were briefly used, but no professional engineers, construction personnel or other qualified workers were employed at any time during the eight-year process.<ref name=\"Restoration4\"/>  The wooden parts of the waterwheel in this reconstruction rotted after about 30 years, so with some financial help from the [[Lottery Heritage Fund]] a new waterwheel was constructed in steel.<!-- http://www.ifieldmill.moonfruit.com, but page won't load for me -->\n \nEfforts have been made to improve the ecological and wildlife balance of the mill pond and the surrounding area.  The northern part of the pond had to be drained in 1976 during the reconstruction work, and trees started to become established in the bed;<ref name=\"Survey8\">{{Harvnb|Gibson-Hill|Henbery|1979|p=8.}}</ref> the part south of the railway line, meanwhile, was described as a \"virtual desert\" ecologically.  By 1979, however, it had been restocked with more than 30,000 fish,<ref name=\"Survey10\">{{Harvnb|Gibson-Hill|Henbery|1979|p=10.}}</ref> and birds quickly became established again: a study recorded 58 species.

The current focus is on prevention as much as on real time protection against well known and new threats.\n\n==Threats==\n===Malicious software ===\n\nAn internet user can be tricked or forced into downloading software that is of malicious intent onto a computer. Such software comes in many forms, such as viruses, [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], [[spyware]], and worms.\n\n* [[Malware]], short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. Malware is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency. The term badware is sometimes used, and applied to both true (malicious) malware and unintentionally harmful software.\n* A [[botnet]] is a network of [[zombie computer]]s that have been taken over by a robot or bot that performs large-scale malicious acts for the creator of the botnet.\n* [[Computer Viruses]] are programs that can replicate their structures or effects by infecting other files or structures on a computer. The common use of a virus is to take over a computer to steal data.\n* [[Computer worms]] are programs that can replicate themselves throughout a computer network, performing malicious tasks throughout.\n* [[Ransomware (malware)|Ransomware]] is a type of malware which restricts access to the computer system that it infects, and demands a ransom paid to the creator(s) of the malware in order for the restriction to be removed.\n* [[Scareware]] is scam software of usually limited or no benefit, containing malicious payloads, that is sold to consumers via certain unethical marketing practices. The selling approach uses social engineering to cause shock, anxiety, or the perception of a threat, generally directed at an unsuspecting user.\n* [[Spyware]] refers to programs that surreptitiously monitor activity on a computer system and report that information to others without the user's consent. \n* One particular kind of spyware is [[Keystroke logging|key logging]] malware. '''[[Keystroke logging]]''', often referred to as '''keylogging''' or '''keyboard capturing''', is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]].\n* A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]], commonly known as a ''Trojan'', is a general term for malicious software that pretends to be harmless, so that a user will be convinced to download it onto the computer.\n\n=== Denial-of-service attacks ===\nA [[denial-of-service attack]] (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. Another way of understanding DDoS is seeing it as attacks in [[Cloud computing|cloud computing environment]] that are growing due to the essential characteristics of cloud computing.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks in Cloud Computing Environments: A Survey, Some Research Issues, and Challenges|first1=Q.|last1=Yan|first2=F.

These protocols include [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL), succeeded by [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) for [[web traffic]], [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) for email, and IPsec for the network layer security.\n\n=== Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) ===\n[[IPsec]] is designed to protect [[TCP/IP]] communication in a secure manner. It is a set of security extensions developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|Internet Task Force]] (IETF). It provides security and authentication at the IP layer by transforming data using encryption. Two main types of transformation that form the basis of IPsec: the [[IPsec#Authentication Header|Authentication Header]] (AH) and [[IPsec#Encapsulating Security Payload|ESP]]. These two protocols provide data integrity, data origin authentication, and anti-replay service. These protocols can be used alone or in combination to provide the desired set of security services for the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) layer.\n\nThe basic components of the IPsec security architecture are described in terms of the following functionalities:\n*Security protocols for AH and ESP\n*Security association for policy management and traffic processing\n*Manual and automatic key management for the [[Internet key exchange]] (IKE)\n*Algorithms for [[authentication]] and encryption\n\nThe set of security services provided at the IP layer includes access control, data origin integrity, protection against replays, and confidentiality. The algorithm allows these sets to work independently without affecting other parts of the implementation. The IPsec implementation is operated in a host or security gateway environment giving protection to IP traffic.\n\n===Multi-factor authentication===\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of computer access control in which a [[User (computing)|user]] is granted access only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an [[authentication]] mechanism \u2013 typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Two-factor authentication: What you need to know (FAQ) \u2013 CNET|url = https://www.cnet.com/news/two-factor-authentication-what-you-need-to-know-faq/|website = CNET|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iphonebackupextractor.com/blog/extract-data-two-factor-authentication/|title=How to extract data from an iCloud account with two-factor authentication activated|website=iphonebackupextractor.com|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref> Internet resources, such as websites and email, may be secured using multi-factor authentication.\n\n===Security token===\nSome online sites offer customers the ability to use a six-digit code which randomly changes every 30\u201360 seconds on a [[security token]]. The keys on the security token have built in mathematical computations and manipulate numbers based on the current time built into the device. This means that every thirty seconds there is only a certain array of numbers possible which would be correct to validate access to the online account. The website that the user is logging into would be made aware of that device's serial number and would know the computation and correct time built into the device to verify that the number given is indeed one of the handful of six-digit numbers that works in that given 30-60 second cycle. After 30\u201360 seconds the device will present a new random six-digit number which can log into the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/security-token|title= What is a security token?|publisher=SearchSecurity.com|author=Margaret Rouse|date=September 2005|accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Electronic mail security===\n====Background====\n[[Email]] messages are composed, delivered, and stored in a multiple step process, which starts with the message's composition. When the user finishes composing the message and sends it, the message is transformed into a standard format: an RFC 2822 formatted message. Afterwards, the message can be transmitted. Using a network connection, the mail client, referred to as a [[mail user agent]] (MUA), connects to a [[mail transfer agent]] (MTA) operating on the mail server. The mail client then provides the sender's identity to the server. Next, using the mail server commands, the client sends the recipient list to the mail server. The client then supplies the message. Once the mail server receives and processes the message, several events occur: recipient server identification, connection establishment, and message transmission. Using [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) services, the sender's mail server determines the mail server(s) for the recipient(s). Then, the server opens up a connection(s) to the recipient mail server(s) and sends the message employing a process similar to that used by the originating client, delivering the message to the recipient(s).\n\n==== Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) ====\n[[Pretty Good Privacy]] provides confidentiality by encrypting messages to be transmitted or data files to be stored using an encryption algorithm such as [[Triple DES]] or [[CAST-128]]. Email messages can be protected by using cryptography in various ways, such as the following:\n:*Signing an email message to ensure its integrity and confirm the identity of its sender.\n:*Encrypting the body of an email message to ensure its confidentiality.\n:*Encrypting the communications between mail servers to protect the confidentiality of both message body and message header.\n\nThe first two methods, message signing and message body encryption, are often used together; however, encrypting the transmissions between mail servers is typically used only when two organizations want to protect emails regularly sent between each other. For example, the organizations could establish a [[virtual private network]] (VPN) to encrypt the communications between their mail servers over the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itcd.hq.nasa.gov/networking-vpn.html|title=Virtual Private Network|publisher=NASA|date=|accessdate=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603122059/http://itcd.hq.nasa.gov/networking-vpn.html|archive-date=2013-06-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> Unlike methods that can only encrypt a message body, a VPN can encrypt entire messages, including email header information such as senders, recipients, and subjects. In some cases, organizations may need to protect header information. However, a VPN solution alone cannot provide a message signing mechanism, nor can it provide protection for email messages along the entire route from sender to recipient.\n\n==== Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) ====\n[[MIME]] transforms non-[[ASCII]] data at the sender's site to Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) ASCII data and delivers it to client's [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) to be sent through the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pvv.org/~asgaut/crypto/thesis/node6.html|title= Network Virtual Terminal|publisher=The Norwegian Institute of Technology ppv.org|author=Asgaut Eng|date=1996-04-10|accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref> The server [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] at the receiver's side receives the NVT ASCII data and delivers it to MIME to be transformed back to the original non-ASCII data.\n\n==== Message Authentication Code ====\nA [[Message authentication code]] (MAC) is a cryptography method that uses a [[Key (cryptography)|secret key]] to digitally sign a message. This method outputs a MAC value that can be decrypted by the receiver, using the same secret key used by the sender. The Message Authentication Code protects both a message's [[data integrity]] as well as its [[Message authentication|authenticity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-message-authentication-code.htm |title=What Is a Message Authentication Code? |publisher=Wisegeek.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Firewalls ===\nA [[firewall (computing)|computer firewall]] controls access between networks. It generally consists of gateways and filters which vary from one firewall to another. Firewalls also screen network traffic and are able to block traffic that is dangerous. Firewalls act as the intermediate server between SMTP and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) connections.\n\n====Role of firewalls in web security====\nFirewalls impose restrictions on incoming and outgoing [[Network packet]]s to and from private networks. Incoming or outgoing traffic must pass through the firewall; only authorized traffic is allowed to pass through it. Firewalls create checkpoints between an internal private network and the public Internet, also known as ''[[choke points]]'' (borrowed from the identical military term of a combat limiting geographical feature). Firewalls can create choke points based on IP source and TCP port number. They can also serve as the platform for IPsec. Using tunnel mode capability, firewall can be used to implement VPNs. Firewalls can also limit network exposure by hiding the internal network system and information from the public Internet.\n\n====Types of firewall====\n\n===== Packet filter =====\nA packet filter is a first generation [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] that processes network traffic on a packet-by-packet basis. Its main job is to filter traffic from a remote IP host, so a router is needed to connect the internal network to the Internet. The router is known as a [[screening router]], which screens packets leaving and entering the network.\n\n===== Stateful packet inspection=====\nIn a [[stateful firewall]] the [[circuit-level gateway]] is a [[proxy server]] that operates at the network level of an [[OSI model|Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model]] and statically defines what traffic will be allowed. Circuit proxies will forward [[Network packet]]s (formatted unit of data ) containing a given port number, if the [[Port (computer networking)|port]] is permitted by the [[algorithm]]. The main advantage of a proxy server is its ability to provide [[Network Address Translation]] (NAT), which can hide the user's IP address from the Internet, effectively protecting all internal information from the Internet.\n\n===== Application-level gateway =====\nAn [[application-level firewall]] is a third generation firewall where a [[proxy server]] operates at the very top of the OSI model, the [[Internet protocol suite|IP suite]] application level. A network packet is forwarded only if a connection is established using a known protocol. Application-level gateways are notable for analyzing entire messages rather than individual packets of data when the data are being sent or received.\n\n=== Browser choice ===\n{{main|Browser security}}\nWeb browser statistics tend to affect the amount a Web browser is exploited. For example, [[Internet Explorer]] 6, which used to own a majority of the Web browser market share,<ref name=\"browser stats\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp|title= Browser Statistics|publisher=W3Schools.com|date=|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref> is considered extremely insecure<ref name=\"time to drop IE6\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/191356/its_time_to_finally_drop_internet_explorer_6.html|title=It's Time to Finally Drop Internet Explorer 6|author=Bradly, Tony|publisher=PCWorld.com|date=|access-date= 2010-11-09}}</ref> because vulnerabilities were exploited due to its former popularity.\n\n==Internet security products ==\n\n===Antivirus===\n[[Antivirus software]] and Internet security programs can protect a programmable device from attack by detecting and eliminating [[malware]]; Antivirus software was mainly shareware in the early years of the Internet,{{when|date=August 2015}} but there are now{{when|date=August 2015}} several free security applications on the Internet to choose from for all platforms.<ref name=\"Build free security suite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/150204/build_your_own_free_security_suite.html|title=Build Your Own Free Security Suite|author=Larkin, Eric| date=2008-08-26|accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Password managers ===\nA [[password manager]] is a software application that helps a user store and organize passwords. Password managers usually store passwords encrypted, requiring the user to create a master password; a single, ideally very strong password which grants the user access to their entire password database from top to bottom.<ref name=\"PASSWORD MANAGER\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scsccbkk.org/Use%20a%20Password%20Manager%20for%20Security.pdf|publisher=scsccbkk.org|title=USE A FREE PASSWORD MANAGER|access-date=2016-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125015536/http://scsccbkk.org/Use%20a%20Password%20Manager%20for%20Security.pdf|archive-date=2016-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Security suites===\nSo called ''security suites'' were first offered for sale in 2003 ([[McAfee]]) and contain a suite of [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[Antivirus software|anti-virus]], [[Anti spyware|anti-spyware]] and more.<ref name=\"all-in-one security 2006\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/125817/article.html |publisher=PC World.com |title=All-in-one Security |author=Rebbapragada, Narasu |accessdate=2010-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027173353/http://www.pcworld.com/article/125817/allinone_security.html |archivedate=October 27, 2010 }}</ref> They also offer theft protection, portable storage device safety check, private Internet browsing, cloud [[Anti-spam techniques|anti-spam]], a file shredder or make security-related decisions (answering popup windows) and several were free of charge.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.comodo.com/products/free-products.php|title= Free products for PC security|date= 2015-10-08}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1972, Egyptian engineer [[Mohamed M.

The current focus is on prevention as much as on real time protection against well known and new threats.\n\n==Threats==\n===Malicious software ===\n\nAn internet user can be tricked or forced into downloading software that is of malicious intent onto a computer. Such software comes in many forms, such as viruses, [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], [[spyware]], and worms.\n\n* [[Malware]], short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. Malware is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency. The term badware is sometimes used, and applied to both true (malicious) malware and unintentionally harmful software.\n* A [[botnet]] is a network of [[zombie computer]]s that have been taken over by a robot or bot that performs large-scale malicious acts for the creator of the botnet.\n* [[Computer Viruses]] are programs that can replicate their structures or effects by infecting other files or structures on a computer. The common use of a virus is to take over a computer to steal data.\n* [[Computer worms]] are programs that can replicate themselves throughout a computer network, performing malicious tasks throughout.\n* [[Ransomware (malware)|Ransomware]] is a type of malware which restricts access to the computer system that it infects, and demands a ransom paid to the creator(s) of the malware in order for the restriction to be removed.\n* [[Scareware]] is scam software of usually limited or no benefit, containing malicious payloads, that is sold to consumers via certain unethical marketing practices. The selling approach uses social engineering to cause shock, anxiety, or the perception of a threat, generally directed at an unsuspecting user.\n* [[Spyware]] refers to programs that surreptitiously monitor activity on a computer system and report that information to others without the user's consent. \n* One particular kind of spyware is [[Keystroke logging|key logging]] malware. '''[[Keystroke logging]]''', often referred to as '''keylogging''' or '''keyboard capturing''', is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]].\n* A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]], commonly known as a ''Trojan'', is a general term for malicious software that pretends to be harmless, so that a user will be convinced to download it onto the computer.\n\n=== Denial-of-service attacks ===\nA [[denial-of-service attack]] (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. Another way of understanding DDoS is seeing it as attacks in [[Cloud computing|cloud computing environment]] that are growing due to the essential characteristics of cloud computing.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks in Cloud Computing Environments: A Survey, Some Research Issues, and Challenges|first1=Q.|last1=Yan|first2=F.

These protocols include [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL), succeeded by [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) for [[web traffic]], [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) for email, and IPsec for the network layer security.\n\n=== Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) ===\n[[IPsec]] is designed to protect [[TCP/IP]] communication in a secure manner. It is a set of security extensions developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|Internet Task Force]] (IETF). It provides security and authentication at the IP layer by transforming data using encryption. Two main types of transformation that form the basis of IPsec: the [[IPsec#Authentication Header|Authentication Header]] (AH) and [[IPsec#Encapsulating Security Payload|ESP]]. These two protocols provide data integrity, data origin authentication, and anti-replay service. These protocols can be used alone or in combination to provide the desired set of security services for the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) layer.\n\nThe basic components of the IPsec security architecture are described in terms of the following functionalities:\n*Security protocols for AH and ESP\n*Security association for policy management and traffic processing\n*Manual and automatic key management for the [[Internet key exchange]] (IKE)\n*Algorithms for [[authentication]] and encryption\n\nThe set of security services provided at the IP layer includes access control, data origin integrity, protection against replays, and confidentiality. The algorithm allows these sets to work independently without affecting other parts of the implementation. The IPsec implementation is operated in a host or security gateway environment giving protection to IP traffic.\n\n===Multi-factor authentication===\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of computer access control in which a [[User (computing)|user]] is granted access only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an [[authentication]] mechanism \u2013 typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Two-factor authentication: What you need to know (FAQ) \u2013 CNET|url = https://www.cnet.com/news/two-factor-authentication-what-you-need-to-know-faq/|website = CNET|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iphonebackupextractor.com/blog/extract-data-two-factor-authentication/|title=How to extract data from an iCloud account with two-factor authentication activated|website=iphonebackupextractor.com|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref> Internet resources, such as websites and email, may be secured using multi-factor authentication.\n\n===Security token===\nSome online sites offer customers the ability to use a six-digit code which randomly changes every 30\u201360 seconds on a [[security token]]. The keys on the security token have built in mathematical computations and manipulate numbers based on the current time built into the device. This means that every thirty seconds there is only a certain array of numbers possible which would be correct to validate access to the online account. The website that the user is logging into would be made aware of that device's serial number and would know the computation and correct time built into the device to verify that the number given is indeed one of the handful of six-digit numbers that works in that given 30-60 second cycle. After 30\u201360 seconds the device will present a new random six-digit number which can log into the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/security-token|title= What is a security token?|publisher=SearchSecurity.com|author=Margaret Rouse|date=September 2005|accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Electronic mail security===\n====Background====\n[[Email]] messages are composed, delivered, and stored in a multiple step process, which starts with the message's composition. When the user finishes composing the message and sends it, the message is transformed into a standard format: an RFC 2822 formatted message. Afterwards, the message can be transmitted. Using a network connection, the mail client, referred to as a [[mail user agent]] (MUA), connects to a [[mail transfer agent]] (MTA) operating on the mail server. The mail client then provides the sender\u2019s identity to the server. Next, using the mail server commands, the client sends the recipient list to the mail server. The client then supplies the message. Once the mail server receives and processes the message, several events occur: recipient server identification, connection establishment, and message transmission. Using [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) services, the sender\u2019s mail server determines the mail server(s) for the recipient(s). Then, the server opens up a connection(s) to the recipient mail server(s) and sends the message employing a process similar to that used by the originating client, delivering the message to the recipient(s).\n\n==== Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) ====\n[[Pretty Good Privacy]] provides confidentiality by encrypting messages to be transmitted or data files to be stored using an encryption algorithm such as [[Triple DES]] or [[CAST-128]]. Email messages can be protected by using cryptography in various ways, such as the following:\n:*Signing an email message to ensure its integrity and confirm the identity of its sender.\n:*Encrypting the body of an email message to ensure its confidentiality.\n:*Encrypting the communications between mail servers to protect the confidentiality of both message body and message header.\n\nThe first two methods, message signing and message body encryption, are often used together; however, encrypting the transmissions between mail servers is typically used only when two organizations want to protect emails regularly sent between each other. For example, the organizations could establish a [[virtual private network]] (VPN) to encrypt the communications between their mail servers over the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itcd.hq.nasa.gov/networking-vpn.html|title=Virtual Private Network|publisher=NASA|date=|accessdate=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603122059/http://itcd.hq.nasa.gov/networking-vpn.html|archive-date=2013-06-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> Unlike methods that can only encrypt a message body, a VPN can encrypt entire messages, including email header information such as senders, recipients, and subjects. In some cases, organizations may need to protect header information. However, a VPN solution alone cannot provide a message signing mechanism, nor can it provide protection for email messages along the entire route from sender to recipient.\n\n==== Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) ====\n[[MIME]] transforms non-[[ASCII]] data at the sender's site to Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) ASCII data and delivers it to client's [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) to be sent through the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pvv.org/~asgaut/crypto/thesis/node6.html|title= Network Virtual Terminal|publisher=The Norwegian Institute of Technology ppv.org|author=Asgaut Eng|date=1996-04-10|accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref> The server [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] at the receiver's side receives the NVT ASCII data and delivers it to MIME to be transformed back to the original non-ASCII data.\n\n==== Message Authentication Code ====\nA [[Message authentication code]] (MAC) is a cryptography method that uses a [[Key (cryptography)|secret key]] to digitally sign a message. This method outputs a MAC value that can be decrypted by the receiver, using the same secret key used by the sender. The Message Authentication Code protects both a message's [[data integrity]] as well as its [[Message authentication|authenticity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-message-authentication-code.htm |title=What Is a Message Authentication Code? |publisher=Wisegeek.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Firewalls ===\nA [[firewall (computing)|computer firewall]] controls access between networks. It generally consists of gateways and filters which vary from one firewall to another. Firewalls also screen network traffic and are able to block traffic that is dangerous. Firewalls act as the intermediate server between SMTP and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) connections.\n\n====Role of firewalls in web security====\nFirewalls impose restrictions on incoming and outgoing [[Network packet]]s to and from private networks. Incoming or outgoing traffic must pass through the firewall; only authorized traffic is allowed to pass through it. Firewalls create checkpoints between an internal private network and the public Internet, also known as ''[[choke points]]'' (borrowed from the identical military term of a combat limiting geographical feature). Firewalls can create choke points based on IP source and TCP port number. They can also serve as the platform for IPsec. Using tunnel mode capability, firewall can be used to implement VPNs. Firewalls can also limit network exposure by hiding the internal network system and information from the public Internet.\n\n====Types of firewall====\n\n===== Packet filter =====\nA packet filter is a first generation [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] that processes network traffic on a packet-by-packet basis. Its main job is to filter traffic from a remote IP host, so a router is needed to connect the internal network to the Internet. The router is known as a [[screening router]], which screens packets leaving and entering the network.\n\n===== Stateful packet inspection=====\nIn a [[stateful firewall]] the [[circuit-level gateway]] is a [[proxy server]] that operates at the network level of an [[OSI model|Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model]] and statically defines what traffic will be allowed. Circuit proxies will forward [[Network packet]]s (formatted unit of data ) containing a given port number, if the [[Port (computer networking)|port]] is permitted by the [[algorithm]]. The main advantage of a proxy server is its ability to provide [[Network Address Translation]] (NAT), which can hide the user's IP address from the Internet, effectively protecting all internal information from the Internet.\n\n===== Application-level gateway =====\nAn [[application-level firewall]] is a third generation firewall where a [[proxy server]] operates at the very top of the OSI model, the [[Internet protocol suite|IP suite]] application level. A network packet is forwarded only if a connection is established using a known protocol. Application-level gateways are notable for analyzing entire messages rather than individual packets of data when the data are being sent or received.\n\n=== Browser choice ===\n{{main|Browser security}}\nWeb browser statistics tend to affect the amount a Web browser is exploited. For example, [[Internet Explorer]] 6, which used to own a majority of the Web browser market share,<ref name=\"browser stats\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp|title= Browser Statistics|publisher=W3Schools.com|date=|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref> is considered extremely insecure<ref name=\"time to drop IE6\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/191356/its_time_to_finally_drop_internet_explorer_6.html|title=It's Time to Finally Drop Internet Explorer 6|author=Bradly, Tony|publisher=PCWorld.com|date=|access-date= 2010-11-09}}</ref> because vulnerabilities were exploited due to its former popularity.\n\n==Internet security products ==\n\n===Antivirus===\n[[Antivirus software]] and Internet security programs can protect a programmable device from attack by detecting and eliminating [[malware]]; Antivirus software was mainly shareware in the early years of the Internet,{{when|date=August 2015}} but there are now{{when|date=August 2015}} several free security applications on the Internet to choose from for all platforms.<ref name=\"Build free security suite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/150204/build_your_own_free_security_suite.html|title=Build Your Own Free Security Suite|author=Larkin, Eric| date=2008-08-26|accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Password managers ===\nA [[password manager]] is a software application that helps a user store and organize passwords. Password managers usually store passwords encrypted, requiring the user to create a master password; a single, ideally very strong password which grants the user access to their entire password database from top to bottom.<ref name=\"PASSWORD MANAGER\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scsccbkk.org/Use%20a%20Password%20Manager%20for%20Security.pdf|publisher=scsccbkk.org|title=USE A FREE PASSWORD MANAGER|access-date=2016-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125015536/http://scsccbkk.org/Use%20a%20Password%20Manager%20for%20Security.pdf|archive-date=2016-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Security suites===\nSo called ''security suites'' were first offered for sale in 2003 ([[McAfee]]) and contain a suite of [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[Antivirus software|anti-virus]], [[Anti spyware|anti-spyware]] and more.<ref name=\"all-in-one security 2006\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/125817/article.html |publisher=PC World.com |title=All-in-one Security |author=Rebbapragada, Narasu |accessdate=2010-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027173353/http://www.pcworld.com/article/125817/allinone_security.html |archivedate=October 27, 2010 }}</ref> They also offer theft protection, portable storage device safety check, private Internet browsing, cloud [[Anti-spam techniques|anti-spam]], a file shredder or make security-related decisions (answering popup windows) and several were free of charge.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.comodo.com/products/free-products.php|title= Free products for PC security|date= 2015-10-08}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1972, Egyptian engineer [[Mohamed M.
