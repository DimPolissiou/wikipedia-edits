The series takes place in a romanticized [[Stone Age]] setting and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are also their best friends). It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=May 12, 2014|last=VanDerWerff|first=Emily|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref> The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc, though five episodes during the second season (the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth) employed Hanna-Barbera regular [[Daws Butler]] while Blanc was incapacitated by a near-fatal car accident. Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air. But they also told him, 'Do you want to be known as the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air? The guy who took away a show so many kids love and so many parents love, too?'\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Brooks| first = Marla| title = The American family on television: A chronology of 121 shows, 1948\u20132004| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hyTuAAAAMAAJ| year = 2005| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-2074-2| page = 54 }}</ref>\n\nHenry Corden's voice became Fred's after Reed's death in 1977, starting with ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]''.<ref>\"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/28593-Flintstone_Christmas.html A Flintstone Christmas]\".

Since 2000, [[Jeff Bergman]], [[James Arnold Taylor]], and [[Scott Innes]] (performing both Fred and Barney for [[Toshiba]] commercials) have performed the voice of Fred. Since Mel Blanc's death in 1989, Barney has been voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Frank Welker]], and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Various additional character voices were created by [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]], [[Allan Melvin]], [[Janet Waldo]], Daws Butler, and [[Howard Morris]], among others.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Fred Flintstone]] \u2013 [[Alan Reed]] \n* [[Wilma Flintstone]]/[[Pebbles Flintstone]] \u2013 [[Jean Vander Pyl]]\n* [[Barney Rubble]] \u2013 [[Mel Blanc]]; [[Daws Butler]] (season 2; episodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 only)\n* [[Betty Rubble]] \u2013 [[Bea Benaderet]] (seasons 1\u20134); [[Gerry Johnson]] (seasons 5\u20136)\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]/Hoppy/Arnold \u2013 [[Don Messick]]\n* [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] \u2013 [[Mel Blanc]]\n* Mr. Slate \u2013 [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]\n* [[Pearl Slaghoople|Mrs. Slaghoople]] \u2013 [[Verna Felton]] and [[Janet Waldo]]\n* [[The Great Gazoo]] \u2013 [[Harvey Korman]]\n\n===Additional voice cast===\n* [[Howard Morris]]\n* [[Doug Young (actor)|Doug Young]]\n* [[Henry Corden]]\n* [[June Foray]]\n* [[Walker Edmiston]]\n* [[Ginny Tyler]] \u2013 Carhop\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] \u2013 Uncle Tex and Santa Claus\n* [[Allan Melvin]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Flintstones episodes}}\n{{:List of The Flintstones episodes}}\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Meet the Flintstones}}\nThe opening and closing credits theme during the first two seasons was called \"Rise and Shine\", a lively instrumental underscore accompanying Fred on his drive home from work.

The musical underscores were credited to [[Hoyt Curtin]] for the show's first five seasons; [[Ted Nichols]] took over in 1965 for the final season.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>  Many early episodes used the underscores composed for \"Top Cat\" and \"The Jetsons.\"   Episodes of the last two seasons used the underscore of \"Jonny Quest\" for the more adventurous stories.\n\n==History and production==\nThe idea of ''The Flintstones'' started after Hanna-Barbera produced ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' and ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]''. Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show.

And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''. After spending a brief period in development as ''The Gladstones'' (GLadstone<!-- not a typo; see the succeeding link --> being a Los Angeles [[Telephone exchange names|telephone exchange]] at the time),<ref name=\"DreamTeam\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237649.stm|title=The cartoon dream team|date=March 21, 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> Hanna-Barbera settled upon ''The Flintstones'', and the idea of the Flintstones having a child from the start was discarded, with Fred and Wilma starting out as a childless couple. However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018. Online, the series was made available on the [[In2TV]] service beginning in 2006, then the online version of [[Kids' WB]] until that service was discontinued in 2015. As of 2017, full episodes are only available in the U.S. on Boomerang's subscription [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]] service, with select clips made available on the official [[YouTube]] account tied to the revamped Kids' WB website. In 2019, [[MeTV]] acquired rerun rights to the series, returning the show to broadcast television for the first time in over 20 years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/metv-grabs-the-flintstones |title = MeTV Grabs 'The Flintstones'}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe night after ''The Flintstones'' premiered, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine called it \"a pen and ink disaster\",<ref>Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera-1997</ref> and the series was among many that debuted in a \"[[Television and the Public Interest|vast wasteland]]\" of a [[1960\u201361 United States network television schedule|1960\u201361 television season]] considered one of the worst in television history up to that point.<ref>https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2012/06/vast-wasteland/</ref> As late as the 1980s, highbrow critics derided the show's limited animation and derivative plots.<ref>For example, an episode of the 1987 series ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'' (\"Don't Touch That Dial!\") has [[Mighty Mouse|the title character]] mocking ''The Flintstones'', which appears in a satirical crossover with ''[[The Jetsons]]'', as stupid.</ref> Despite the mixed critical reviews at first, ''The Flintstones'' has generally been considered a television classic and was rerun continuously for five decades after its end. In 1961, ''The Flintstones'' became the first animated series to be nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]], but lost out to ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''.

The series takes place in a romanticized [[Stone Age]] setting and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are also their best friends). It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]].

Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air.

Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''.

However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018. Online, the series was made available on the [[In2TV]] service beginning in 2006, then the online version of [[Kids' WB]] until that service was discontinued in 2015.

Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under [[open source license]]s that do not require fees to use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems are available and the instruction set is supported in several popular software [[toolchains]]. \n\nRISC-V has features to increase computer speed, yet reduce cost and power use. These include a [[load\u2013store architecture]], bit patterns to simplify the multiplexers in a CPU, simplified standards-based floating-point, a design that is architecturally neutral, and placing most-significant bits at a fixed location to speed [[sign extension]]. Sign extension is said to often be on the critical timing path.<ref name=\"isa\" />\nThe instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. It is variable-width and extensible so that more encoding bits can always be added. It supports three word-widths, 32, 64, and 128 bits, and a variety of subsets. The definitions of each subset vary slightly for the three word-widths. The subsets support small [[embedded system]]s, [[personal computer]]s, [[supercomputer]]s with vector processors, and warehouse-scale [[19 inch rack]]-mounted [[Parallel computing|parallel computers]]. \n\nThe instruction set space for the 128-bit stretched version of the ISA was reserved because 60 years of industry experience has shown that the most unrecoverable error in instruction set design is a lack of memory address space. {{As of|2016}}, the 128-bit ISA remains undefined intentionally, because there is yet so little practical experience with such large memory systems.<ref name=\"isa\" /> There are proposals to implement variable-width instructions up to 864-bits.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wolf |first1=Clifford |title=Alternative proposal for instruction length encoding |url=http://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2019/rvlonginsn/proposal_1.txt |website=Cliffords Subversion Servier |publisher=Clifford Wolf |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe project began in 2010 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but many contributors are volunteers not affiliated with the university.<ref name=\"contributors\" /> Unlike other academic designs which are typically optimized only for simplicity of exposition, the designers intended that the RISC-V instruction set be useable for practical computers. \n\nAs of June 2019, version 2.2 of the user-space ISA<ref name=\"isa\" /> and version 1.11 of the privileged ISA<ref name=priv-isa/> are [[Freeze (software engineering)|frozen]], permitting software and hardware development to proceed.

To cover the costs of such a team, commercial vendors of computer designs, such as [[ARM Holdings]] and [[MIPS Technologies]] charge [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for the use of their designs, [[patent]]s and [[copyright]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/07/a-long-look-at-how-arm-licenses-chips/ |title=A long look at how ARM licenses chips: Part 1 |last=Demerjian |first=Chuck |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=SemiAccurate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/08/how-arm-licenses-its-ip-for-production/ |title=How ARM licenses its IP for production: Part 2 |last=Demerjian |first=Chuck |date=August 8, 2013 |publisher=SemiAccurate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hackster.io/news/wave-computing-closes-its-mips-open-initiative-with-immediate-effect-zero-warning-e88b0df9acd0|title=Wave Computing Closes Its MIPS Open Initiative with Immediate Effect, Zero Warning|date=2019-11-15}}</ref> They also often require [[non-disclosure agreement]]s before releasing documents that describe their designs' detailed advantages. In many cases, they never describe the reasons for their design choices.\n\nRISC-V was started to solve these problems. The goal was to make a practical ISA that was open-sourced, usable academically and in any hardware or software design without royalties.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"isasbfree\" /> Also, the rationales for every part of the project are explained, at least broadly. The RISC-V authors are academic but have substantial experience in computer design. The RISC-V ISA is a direct development from a series of academic computer-design projects. It was originated in part to aid such projects.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nIn order to build a large, continuing community of users and therefore accumulate designs and software, the RISC-V ISA designers planned to support a wide variety of practical uses: Small, fast, and low-power real-world implementations,<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"rocketsspeed\" /> without over-architecting for a particular [[microarchitecture]].<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=sodor>{{cite web |last=Celio |first=Christopher |last2=Love |first2=Eric |title=ucb-bar/riscv-sodor |url=https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-sodor |website=GitHub Inc. |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"shakti\" /><ref name=boom>{{cite web |last=Celio |first=Christopher |title=CS 152 Laboratory Exercise 3 |url=http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs152/sp14/handouts/lab3.pdf |website=UC Berkeley |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref> A need for a large base of contributors is part of the reason why RISC-V was engineered to fit so many uses.\n\nThe designers say that the instruction set is the main interface in a computer because it lies between the hardware and the software. If a good instruction set was open, available for use by all, it should dramatically reduce the cost of software by permitting far more reuse. It should also increase competition among hardware providers, who can use more resources for design and less for software support.<ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nThe designers assert that new principles are becoming rare in instruction set design, as the most successful designs of the last forty years have become increasingly similar. Of those that failed, most did so because their sponsoring companies failed commercially, not because the instruction sets were poor technically. So, a well-designed open instruction set designed using well-established principles should attract long-term support by many vendors.<ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nRISC-V also supports the designers' academic uses. The simplicity of the integer subset permits basic student exercises. The integer subset is a simple ISA enabling software to control research machines. The variable-length ISA enables extensions for both student exercises and research.<ref name=\"isa\" /> The separated privileged instruction set permits research in operating system support, without redesigning compilers.<ref name=\"isapriv\" /> RISC-V's open intellectual property allows its designs to be published, reused, and modified.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n==History==\nThe term ''[[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]'' dates from about 1980.<ref name=\"riscstart\" /> Before this, there was some knowledge that simpler computers could be effective, but the design principles were not widely described. Simple, effective computers have always been of academic interest. Academics created the RISC instruction set [[DLX]] for the first edition of ''Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach'' in 1990. [[David Patterson (computer scientist)|David Patterson]] was an author, and later assisted RISC-V. DLX was intended for educational use; academics and hobbyists implemented it using [[field-programmable gate array]]s, but it was not a commercial success. ARM CPUs, versions 2 and earlier, had a public-domain instruction set, and it is still supported by the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), a popular free-software compiler. Three open-source [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|cores]] exist for this ISA, but they have not been manufactured.<ref name=\"amber\" /><ref name=\"arm4u\" /> [[OpenRISC]] is an open-source ISA based on DLX, with associated RISC designs. It is fully supported with GCC and [[Linux]] implementations. However, it has few commercial implementations.\n\n[[Krste Asanovi\u0107]] at the University of California, Berkeley, found many uses for an open-source computer system. In 2010, he decided to develop and publish one in a \"short, three-month project over the summer\". The plan was to help both academic and industrial users.<ref name=\"isasbfree\">{{cite web |url=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-146.pdf |title=Instruction Sets Should be Free |last=Asanovi\u0107 |first=Krste |author-link=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=U.C.

He originally identified the properties of [[Berkeley RISC]],<ref name=\"riscstart\" /> and RISC-V is one of his long series of cooperative RISC research projects. At this stage, students inexpensively provided initial software, simulations, and CPU designs.<ref name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThe RISC-V authors and their institution originally provided the ISA documents and several CPU designs under [[BSD licenses]], which allow derivative works\u2014such as RISC-V chip designs\u2014to be either open and free, or closed and proprietary. The ISA specification itself (i.e., the encoding of the instruction set) was effectively put into the public domain when the ISA tech reports were published, though the actual tech report text (an expression of the specification) was later put under a Creative Commons license to allow it to be improved by external contributors including the RISC-V Foundation.\n\nA full history of RISC-V has been published on the RISC-V Foundation website.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Foundation===\nCommercial users require an ISA to be stable before they can utilize it in a product that might last many years. To address this issue, the RISC-V Foundation was formed to own, maintain and publish intellectual property related to RISC-V's definition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/10/03/a-new-blueprint-for-microprocessors-challenges-the-industrys-giants|title=A new blueprint for microprocessors challenges the industry's giants|date=2019-10-03|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-11-10|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The original authors and owners have surrendered their rights to the foundation.<ref name=\"rv5_found\">{{cite web |title=RISC-V Foundation |url=https://riscv.org/risc-v-foundation/ |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2019, the RISC-V Foundation announced that it would re-locate to [[Switzerland]], citing concerns over U.S. trade regulations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-semiconductors-insight-idUSKBN1XZ16L|title=U.S.-based chip-tech group moving to Switzerland over trade curb fears|date=2019-11-26|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the foundation freely publishes the documents defining RISC-V and permits unrestricted utilization of the ISA for both software and hardware design.

The ISA base and its extensions are developed in a collective effort between industry, the research community and educational institutions. The base specifies instructions (and their encoding), control flow, registers (and their sizes), memory and addressing, logic (i.e., integer) manipulation, and ancillaries. The base alone can implement a simplified general-purpose computer, with full software support, including a general-purpose compiler.\n\nThe standard extensions are specified to work with all of the standard bases, and with each other without conflict.\n\nMany RISC-V computers might implement the compact extension to reduce power consumption, code size, and memory use.<ref name=\"isa\" /> There are also future plans to support [[hypervisor]]s and [[virtualization]].<ref name=\"isapriv\">\n{{cite web\n | last         = Waterman\n | first        = Andrew\n | last2        = Lee\n | first2       = Yunsup\n | last3        = Avizienas\n | first3       = Rimas\n | last4        = Patterson\n | first4       = David\n | author-link4 = David Patterson (computer scientist)\n | last5        = Asanovi\u0107\n | first5       = Krste\n | author-link5 = Krste Asanovi\u0107\n | title        = Draft Privileged ISA Specification 1.9\n | url          = https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/\n | website      = RISC-V\n | publisher    = RISC-V Foundation\n | access-date  = 30 August 2016\n}}</ref>\n\nTogether with a supervisor instruction set extension, S, an RVGC defines all instructions needed to conveniently support a general purpose [[operating system]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+ ISA base and extensions\n|-\n!

Except for memory access instructions, instructions address only registers.\n\nThe first integer register is a zero register, and the remainder are general-purpose registers. A store to the zero register has no effect, and a read always provides 0. Using the zero register as a placeholder makes for a simpler instruction set.\n\n{{code|move rx to ry}} becomes {{code|add r0 to rx and store in ry}}.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nControl and status registers exist, but user-mode programs can access only those used for performance measurement and floating-point management.\n\nNo instructions exist to save and restore multiple registers. Those were thought to be needless, too complex, and perhaps too slow.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Memory access===\nLike many RISC designs, RISC-V is a [[load\u2013store architecture]]: instructions address only registers, with load and store instructions conveying to and from memory.\n\nMost load and store instructions include a 12-bit offset and two register identifiers. One register is the base register. The other register is the source (for a store) or destination (for a load.)\n\nThe offset is added to a base register to get the address. Forming the address as a base register plus offset allows single instructions to access data structures. For example, if the base register points to the top of a stack, single instructions can access a subroutine's local variables in the stack. Likewise the load and store instructions can access a record-style structure or a memory-mapped I/O device. Using the constant zero register as a base address allows single instructions to access memory near address zero.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nMemory is addressed as 8-bit bytes, with words being in [[little-endian]] order.<ref name=\"isa\" /> Words, up to the register size, can be accessed with the load and store instructions.\n\nAccessed memory addresses need not be aligned to their word-width, but accesses to aligned addresses may be faster; for example, simple CPUs may implement unaligned accesses with slow software emulation driven from an alignment failure interrupt.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nLike many RISC instruction sets (and some [[complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) instruction sets, such as [[x86]] and [[IBM System/360]] families), RISC-V lacks address-modes that write back to the registers. For example, it does not auto-increment.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V manages memory systems that are shared between CPUs or [[thread (computing)|threads]] by ensuring a thread of execution always sees its memory operations in the programmed order. But between threads and I/O devices, RISC-V is simplified: It doesn't guarantee the order of memory operations, except by specific instructions, such as {{code|fence}}.\n\nA {{code|fence}} instruction guarantees that the results of predecessor operations are visible to successor operations of other threads or I/O devices. {{code|fence}} can guarantee the order of combinations of both memory and memory-mapped I/O operations. E.g. it can separate memory read and write operations, without affecting I/O operations. Or, if a system can operate I/O devices in parallel with memory, {{code|fence}} doesn't force them to wait for each other. One CPU with one thread may decode {{code|fence}} as {{code|nop}}.\n\nRISC-V is little-endian to resemble other familiar, successful computers, for example, [[x86]]. This also reduces a CPU's complexity and costs slightly because it reads all sizes of words in the same order. For example, the RISC-V instruction set decodes starting at the lowest-addressed byte of the instruction. The specification leaves open the possibility of non-standard big-endian or bi-endian systems.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nSome RISC CPUs (such as [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]], [[DLX]], and Berkeley's RISC-I) place 16 bits of offset in the loads and stores. They set the upper 16 bits by a ''load upper word'' instruction. This permits upper-halfword values to be set easily, without shifting bits. However, most use of the upper half-word instruction makes 32-bit constants, like addresses. RISC-V uses a [[SPARC]]-like combination of 12-bit offsets and 20-bit ''set upper'' instructions. The smaller 12-bit offset helps compact, 32-bit load and store instructions select two of 32 registers yet still have enough bits to support RISC-V's variable-length instruction coding.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Immediates===\nRISC-V handles 32-bit constants and addresses with instructions that set the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit register. Load upper immediate {{code|lui}} loads 20 bits into bits 31 through 12. Then a second instruction such as {{code|addi}} can set the bottom 12 bits.\n\nThis method is extended to permit [[position-independent code]] by adding an instruction, {{code|auipc}} that generates 20 upper address bits by adding an offset to the program counter and storing the result into a base register. This permits a program to generate 32-bit addresses that are relative to the program counter.\n\nThe base register can often be used as-is with the 12-bit offsets of the loads and stores. If needed, {{code|addi}} can set the lower 12-bits of a register. In 64-bit and 128-bit ISAs,{{code|lui}} and {{code|auipc}} sign-extend the result to get the larger address.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nSome fast CPUs may interpret combinations of instructions as single ''fused'' instructions. {{code|lui}} or {{code|auipc}} may be good candidates to fuse with {{code|addi}}, loads or stores.\n\n===Subroutine calls, jumps, and branches===\nRISC-V's subroutine call {{code|jal}} (jump and link) places its return address in a register. This is faster in many computer designs, because it saves a memory access compared to systems that push a return address directly on a stack in memory. {{code|jal}} has a 20-bit signed (2's complement) offset. The offset is multiplied by 2, then added to the PC to generate a relative address to a 32-bit instruction. If the result is not at a 32-bit address (i.e., evenly divisible by 4), the CPU may force an [[Exception handling|exception]].<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V CPUs jump to calculated addresses using a ''jump and link-register'', {{code|jalr}} instruction. {{code|jalr}} is similar to {{code|jal}}, but gets its destination address by adding a 12-bit offset to a base register. (In contrast,{{code|jal}} adds a larger 20-bit offset to the PC.)\n\n{{code|jalr}}'s bit format is like the register-relative loads and stores. Like them, {{code|jalr}} can be used with the instructions that set the upper 20 bits of a base register to make 32-bit branches, either to an absolute address (using {{code|lui}}) or a PC-relative one (using {{code|auipc}} for [[position-independent code]]). (Using a constant zero base address allows single-instruction calls to a small (the offset), fixed positive or negative address.)\n\nRISC-V recycles {{code|jal}} and {{code|jalr}} to get unconditional 20-bit PC-relative jumps and unconditional register-based 12-bit jumps. Jumps just make the linkage register 0 so that no return address is saved.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V also recycles {{code|jalr}} to return from a subroutine: To do this, {{code|jalr}}'s base register is set to be the linkage register saved by {{code|jal}} or {{code|jalr}}. {{code|jalr}}'s offset is zero and the linkage register is zero, so that there is no offset, and no return address is saved.\n\nLike many RISC designs, in a subroutine call, a RISC-V compiler must use individual instructions to save registers to the stack at the start, and then restore these from the stack on exit. RISC-V has no ''save multiple'' or ''restore multiple'' register instructions. These were thought to make the CPU too complex, and possibly slow.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> This can take more code space. Designers planned to reduce code size with library routines to save and restore registers.<ref name=\"isacompressed\" />\n\nRISC-V has no [[condition code register]] or [[carry bit]]. The designers believed that condition codes make fast CPUs more complex by forcing interactions between instructions in different stages of execution. This choice makes multiple-precision arithmetic more complex. Also, a few numerical tasks need more energy. As a result, [[Branch predication|predication]] (the conditional execution of instructions) is not supported. The designers claim that very fast, out-of-order CPU designs do predication anyway, by doing the comparison branch and conditional code in parallel, then discarding the unused path's effects. They also claim that even in simpler CPUs, predication is less valuable than [[branch prediction]], which can prevent most stalls associated with conditional branches. Code without predication is larger, with more branches, but they also claim that a compressed instruction set (such as RISC-V's set ''C'') solves that problem in most cases.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nInstead, RISC-V has short branches that perform comparisons: equal, not-equal, less-than, unsigned less-than, greater-than or equal and unsigned greater-than or equal. Ten comparison-branch operations are implemented with only six instructions, by reversing the order of operands in the [[Assembly language|assembler]]. For example, ''branch if greater than'' can be done by ''less-than'' with a reversed order of operands.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe comparing branches have a twelve-bit signed range, and jump relative to the PC.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nUnlike some RISC architectures, RISC-V does not include a [[branch delay slot]], a position after a branch instruction that can be filled with an instruction that is executed whether or not the branch is taken. RISC-V omits a branch delay slot because it complicates multicycle CPUs, superscalar CPUs, and long pipelines. Dynamic [[branch predictor]]s have succeeded well enough to reduce the need for delayed branches.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nOn the first encounter with a branch, RISC-V CPUs should assume that a negative relative branch (i.e. the sign bit of the offset is \"1\") will be taken.<ref name=\"isa\" /> This assumes that a backward branch is a loop, and provides a default direction so that simple pipelined CPUs can fill their pipeline of instructions. Other than this, RISC-V does not require [[branch prediction]], but core implementations are allowed to add it. RV32I reserves a \"HINT\" instruction space that presently does not contain any hints on branches.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Arithmetic and logic sets===\nRISC-V segregates math into a minimal set of [[integer]] instructions (set ''I'') with [[Arithmetic logic unit|add, subtract, shift, bit-wise logic]] and comparing-branches. These can simulate most of the other RISC-V instruction sets with software. (The atomic instructions are a notable exception.) RISC-V currently lacks the ''count leading zero'' and bit-field operations normally used to speed software floating-point in a pure-integer processor.\n\nThe integer multiplication instructions (set ''M'') includes signed and unsigned multiply and divide. Double-precision integer multiplies and divides are included, as multiplies and divides that produce the ''high word'' of the result. The ISA document recommends that implementors of CPUs and compilers ''fuse'' a standardized sequence of high and low multiply and divide instructions to one operation if possible.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe [[floating-point]] instructions (set ''F'') includes single-precision arithmetic and also comparison-branches similar to the integer arithmetic. It requires an additional set of 32 floating-point registers. These are separate from the integer registers. The double-precision floating point instructions (set ''D'') generally assume that the floating-point registers are 64-bit (i.e., double-width), and the ''F'' subset is coordinated with the ''D'' set. A quad-precision 128-bit floating-point ISA (''Q'') is also defined. RISC-V computers without floating-point can use a floating-point software library.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V does not cause [[Exception handling|exceptions]] on arithmetic errors, including [[Overflow flag|overflow]], underflow, subnormal, and divide by zero. Instead, both integer and floating-point arithmetic produce reasonable default values and set status bits. Divide-by-zero can be discovered by one branch after the division. The status bits can be tested by an operating system or periodic interrupt.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Atomic memory operations===\nRISC-V supports computers that share memory between multiple CPUs and [[Thread (computing)|threads]]. RISC-V's standard memory consistency model is [[release consistency]]. That is, loads and stores may generally be reordered, but some loads may be designated as ''acquire'' operations which must precede later memory accesses, and some stores may be designated as ''release'' operations which must follow earlier memory accesses.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe base instruction set includes minimal support in the form of a [[Fence instruction|{{code|fence}} instruction]] to enforce memory ordering. Although this is sufficient ({{code|fence r, rw}} provides ''acquire'' and {{code|fence rw, w}} provides ''release''), combined operations can be more efficient.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe atomic memory operation extension supports two types of atomic memory operations for release consistency. First, it provides general purpose [[Load-link/store-conditional|''load-reserved'' {{code|lr}} and ''store-conditional'' {{code|sc}}]] instructions. {{code|lr}} performs a load, and tries to reserve that address for its thread. A later store-conditional {{code|sc}} to the reserved address will be performed only if the reservation is not broken by an intervening store from another source. If the store succeeds, a zero is placed in a register. If it failed, a non-zero value indicates that software needs to retry the operation. In either case, the reservation is released.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe second group of atomic instructions perform [[read-modify-write]] sequences: a load (which is optionally a load-acquire) to a destination register, then an operation between the loaded value and a source register, then a store of the result (which may optionally be a store-release). Making the memory barriers optional permits combining the operations. The optional operations are enabled by ''acquire'' and ''release'' bits which are present in every atomic instruction. RISC-V defines nine possible operations: swap (use source register value directly); add; bitwise and, or, and exclusive-or; and signed and unsigned minimum and maximum.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nA system design may optimize these combined operations more than {{code|lr}} and {{code|sc}}. For example, if the destination register for a swap is the constant zero, the load may be skipped. If the value stored is unmodified since the load, the store may be skipped.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe [[IBM System/370]] and its successors including [[z/Architecture]], and [[x86]], both implement a [[compare-and-swap]] ({{code|cas}}) instruction, which tests and conditionally updates a location in memory: if the location contains an expected old value, {{code|cas}} replaces it with a given new value; it then returns an indication of whether it made the change. However, a simple load-type instruction is usually performed before the {{code|cas}} to fetch the old value. The classic problem is that if a thread reads (loads) a value ''A'', calculates a new value ''C'', and then uses ({{code|cas}}) to replace ''A'' with ''C'', it has no way to know whether concurrent activity in another thread has replaced ''A'' with some other value ''B'' and then restored the ''A'' in between. In some algorithms (e.g., ones in which the values in memory are pointers to dynamically allocated blocks), this [[ABA problem]] can lead to incorrect results. The most common solution employs a ''double-wide {{code|cas}}'' instruction to update both the pointer and an adjacent counter; unfortunately, such an instruction requires a special instruction format to specify multiple registers, performs several reads and writes, and can have complex bus operation.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe {{code|lr}}/{{code|sc}} alternative is more efficient. It usually requires only one memory load, and minimizing slow memory operations is desirable. It's also exact: it controls all accesses to the memory cell, rather than just assuring a bit pattern. However, unlike {{code|cas}}, it can permit [[livelock]], in which two or more threads repeatedly cause each other's instructions to fail. RISC-V guarantees forward progress (no livelock) if the code follows rules on the timing and sequence of instructions: 1) It must use only the ''I'' subset. 2) To prevent repetitive cache misses, the code (including the retry loop) must occupy no more than 16 consecutive instructions. 3) It must include no system or fence instructions, or taken backward branches between the {{code|lr}} and {{code|sc}}. 4) The backward branch to the retry loop must be to the original sequence.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe specification gives examples of how to use this subset to lock a data structure.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Compressed subset===\nThe standard RISC-V ISA specifies that all instructions are 32 bits. This makes for a particularly simple implementation, but like other RISC processors with such an instruction encoding, results in larger code size than in other instruction sets.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"riscvc\" />\nTo compensate, RISC-V's ''32-bit'' instructions are actually 30 bits; {{frac|3|4}} of the [[opcode]] space is reserved for an optional (but recommended) variable-length ''compressed'' instruction set, RVC, that includes 16-bit instructions. Like ARM's Thumb and the MIPS16, the compressed instructions are simply aliases for a subset of the larger instructions. Unlike ARM's Thumb or the MIPS compressed set, space was reserved from the beginning so there is no separate operating mode. Standard and compressed instructions may be intermixed freely.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"riscvc\" /> (letter ''C'')<ref name=\"isacompressed\" />\n\nBecause (like Thumb-1 and MIPS16) the compressed instructions are simply alternate encodings (aliases) for a selected subset of larger instructions, the compression can be implemented in the assembler, and it is not essential for the compiler to even know about it.\n\nA prototype of RVC was tested in 2011.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> The prototype code was 20% smaller than an [[x86]] PC and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] compressed code, and 2% larger than [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[Thumb-2]] code.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> It also substantially reduced both the needed cache memory and the estimated power use of the memory system.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nThe researcher intended to reduce the code's binary size for small computers, especially [[embedded computer]] systems. The prototype included 33 of the most frequently used instructions, recoded as compact 16-bit formats using operation codes previously reserved for the compressed set.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> The compression was done in the [[Assembly language|assembler]], with no changes to the compiler. Compressed instructions omitted fields that are often zero, used small immediate values or accessed subsets (16 or 8) of the registers. {{code|addi}} is very common and often compressible.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nMuch of the difference in size compared to Arm's Thumb set occurred because RISC-V, and the prototype, have no instructions to save and restore multiple registers. Instead, the compiler generated conventional instructions that access the stack. The prototype RVC assembler then often converted these to compressed forms that were half the size. However, this still took more code space than the ARM instructions that save and restore multiple registers. The researcher proposed to modify the compiler to call library routines to save and restore registers. These routines would tend to remain in a code cache and thus run fast, though probably not as fast as a save-multiple instruction.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nStandard RVC requires occasional use of 32-bit instructions. Several nonstandard RVC proposals are complete, requiring no 32-bit instructions, and are said to have higher densities than standard RVC.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |last1=Brussee |first1=Rogier |title=A Complete 16-bit RVC |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!msg/isa-dev/SrujNcNc8RA/0mA-dATSBwAJ |website=Google Groups |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Brussee\">{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!searchin/isa-dev/16-bit/isa-dev/iK3enKGb5bw/cuVAq0J8EAAJ |title=Proposal: Xcondensed, [a] ...

Each layer also is expected to have a thin layer of standardized supporting software that communicates to a more-privileged layer, or hardware.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nThe overall plan for this ISA is to make the hypervisor mode [[orthogonal]] to the user and supervisor modes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!msg/isa-dev/SfEDPLU0NU4/WpAE_A4OBQAJ |title=Proposal for Virtualization without H mode |last=Bonzini |first=Paolo |last2=Waterman |first2=Andrew |website=Google Groups, RISC-V ISA Dev. |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref> The basic feature is a configuration bit that either permits supervisor-level code to access hypervisor registers, or causes an interrupt on accesses. This bit lets supervisor mode directly handle the hardware needed by a hypervisor. This simplifies a type 2 hypervisor, hosted by an operating system. This is a popular mode to run warehouse-scale computers. To support type 1, unhosted hypervisors, the bit can cause these accesses to interrupt to a hypervisor. The bit simplifies nesting of hypervisors, in which a hypervisor runs under a hypervisor. It's also said to simplify supervisor code by letting the kernel use its own hypervisor features with its own kernel code. As a result, the hypervisor form of the ISA supports five modes: machine, supervisor, user, supervisor-under-hypervisor and user-under-hypervisor.\n\nThe privileged instruction set specification explicitly defines ''hardware [[Thread (computing)|threads]]'', or ''harts''. Multiple hardware threads are a common practice in more-capable computers. When one thread is stalled, waiting for memory, others can often proceed. Hardware threads can help make better use of the large number of registers and execution units in fast out-of-order CPUs. Finally, hardware threads can be a simple, powerful way to handle [[interrupt]]s: No saving or restoring of registers is required, simply executing a different hardware thread. However, the only hardware thread required in a RISC-V computer is thread zero.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nThe existing control and status register definitions support RISC-V's error and memory exceptions, and a small number of interrupts. For systems with more interrupts, the specification also defines an interrupt controller. Interrupts always start at the highest-privileged machine level, and the control registers of each level have explicit ''forwarding'' bits to route interrupts to less-privileged code. For example, the hypervisor need not include software that executes on each interrupt to forward an interrupt to an operating system. Instead, on set-up, it can set bits to forward the interrupt.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nSeveral memory systems are supported in the specification. Physical-only is suited to the simplest [[embedded system]]s. There are also three [[UNIX]]-style [[virtual memory]] systems for memory cached in mass-storage systems. The virtual memory systems have three sizes, with addresses sized 32, 39 and 48-bits. All virtual memory systems support 4&nbsp;KiB pages, multilevel page-table trees and use very similar algorithms to walk the page table trees. All are designed for either hardware or software page-table walking. To optionally reduce the cost of page table walks, super-sized pages may be leaf pages in higher levels of a system's page table tree. SV32 has a two layer page table tree and supports 4&nbsp;MiB superpages. SV39 has a three level page table, and supports 2&nbsp;MiB superpages and 1&nbsp;GiB gigapages. SV48 is required to support SV39. It also has a 4-level page table and supports 2&nbsp;MiB superpages, 1&nbsp;GiB gigapages, and 512&nbsp;GiB terapages. Superpages are aligned on the page boundaries for the next-lowest size of page.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\n===Bit manipulation===\nAn unapproved bit-manipulation (B) ISA for RISC-V was under review in January 2020.{{clarify|reason=Was under review and was accepted, was under review but was rejected, or still is under review?|date=January 2020}} Done well, a bit-manipulation subset can aid cryptographic, graphic, and mathematical operations.

The proposal lacked instruction formats and a license assignment to the foundation, but it was reviewed by the mailing list.<ref name=\"andes_simd\" /> Some unpopular parts of this proposal were that it added a condition code, the first in a RISC-V design, linked adjacent registers (also a first), and has a loop counter that could be difficult to implement in some microarchitectures.\n\nA previous, well-regarded implementation for a 64-bit CPU was PA-RISC's multimedia instructions: [[Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions]]. It increased the CPU's performance on digital signal processing tasks by 48-fold or more, enabling practical real-time video [[codec]]s in 1995.<ref name=lee64bit>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Ruby |author-link=Ruby B.

It also could move subwords to different positions. PA-RISC's MAX2 was intentionally simplified. It lacked support for 8-bit or 32-bit subwords. The 16-bit subword size was chosen to support most digital signal processing tasks. These instructions were inexpensive to design and build.\n\n===Vector set===\nThe proposed vector-processing instruction set may make the packed SIMD set obsolete. The designers hope to have enough flexibility that a CPU can implement vector instructions in a standard processor's registers. This would enable minimal implementations with similar performance to a multimedia ISA, as above. However, a true [[vector processors|vector coprocessor]] could execute the same code with higher performance.<ref name=\"vect\">{{cite web |url=https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/riscv-vector-workshop-june2015.pdf |title=RISC-V Vector Extension Proposal |last=Schmidt |first=Colin |last2=Ou |first2=Albert |last3=Lee |first3=Yunsup |last4=Asanovi\u0107 |first4=Krste |author-link4=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=RISC-V |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|06|29}}, the vector-processing proposal is a conservative, flexible design of a general-purpose mixed-precision [[vector processor]], suitable to execute [[compute kernel]]s. Code would port easily to CPUs with differing vector lengths, ideally without recompiling.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nIn contrast, short-vector SIMD extensions are less convenient. These are used in [[x86]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]] and [[PA-RISC]]. In these, a change in word-width forces a change to the instruction set to expand the vector registers (in the case of x86, from 64-bit [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] registers to 128-bit [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE), to 256-bit [[Advanced Vector Extensions]] (AVX), and [[AVX-512]]). The result is a growing instruction set, and a need to port working code to the new instructions.\n\nIn the RISC-V vector ISA, rather than fix the vector length in the architecture, an instruction ({{code|setvl}}) is available which takes a requested size and sets the vector length to the minimum of the hardware limit and the requested size. So, the RISC-V proposal is more like a [[Cray-1|Cray]]'s long-vector design or ARM's Scalable Vector Extension. That is, each vector in up to 32 vectors is the same length.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nThe application specifies the total vector width it requires, and the processor determines the vector length it can provide with available on-chip resources. This takes the form of an instruction ({{code|vsetcfg}}) with four immediate operands, specifying the number of vector registers of each available width needed. The total must be no more than the addressable limit of 32, but may be less if the application does not require them all. The vector length is limited by the available on-chip storage divided by the number of bytes of storage needed for each entry. (Added hardware limits may also exist, which in turn may permit SIMD-style implementations.)<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nOutside of vector loops, the application can request zero-vector registers, saving the operating system the work of preserving them on [[context switch]]es.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nThe vector length is not only architecturally variable, but designed to vary at run time also. To achieve this flexibility, the instruction set is likely to use variable-width data paths and variable-type operations using polymorphic overloading.<ref name=\"vect\" /> The plan is that these can reduce the size and complexity of the ISA and compiler.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nRecent experimental vector processors with variable-width data paths also show profitable increases in operations per: second (speed), area (lower cost), and watt (longer battery life).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yunsup/papers/hwacha-mvp-prism2014.pdf |title=A Case for MVPs: Mixed-Precision Vector Processors |last=Ou |first=Albert |last2=Nguyen |first2=Quan |last3=Lee |first3=Yunsup |last4=Asanovi\u0107 |first4=Krste |author-link4=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=UC Berkeley EECS |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike a typical modern [[graphics processing unit]], there are no plans to provide special hardware to support [[branch predication]].

A standard hardware debug interface may support either a ''standardized abstract interface'' or ''instruction feeding''.<ref name=\"debug\">{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x53gVvPrDWEYq3omqLUpJBHU594zidDvoIg42mUzHvM/edit#slide=id.p |title=RISC-V Run Control Debug |last=Bradbury |first=Alex |last2=Wallentowitz |first2=Stefan |website=Google Docs |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/debug/FDmZUk7YCNw |title=RISC-V Debug Group > poll results |last=Newsome |first=Tim |website=Google Groups, RISC-V Debug Group |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017|01}}, the exact form of the ''abstract interface'' remains undefined, but proposals include a memory mapped system with standardized addresses for the registers of debug devices or a command register and a data register accessible to the communication system.<ref name=\"debug\" /> Correspondents claim that similar systems are used by [[Freescale]]'s [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM) for some CPUs, [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[OpenRISC]], and [[Aeroflex]]'s [[LEON]].<ref name=\"debug\" />\n\nIn ''instruction feeding'', the CPU will process a debug exception to execute individual instructions written to a register. This may be supplemented with a data-passing register and a module to directly access the memory. Instruction feeding lets the debugger access the computer exactly as software would. It also minimizes changes in the CPU, and adapts to many types of CPU. This was said to be especially apt for RISC-V because it is designed explicitly for many types of computers. The data-passing register allows a debugger to write a data-movement loop to RAM, and then execute the loop to move data into or out of the computer at a speed near the maximum speed of the debug system's data channel.<ref name=\"debug\" /> Correspondents say that similar systems are used by [[MIPS Technologies]] [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[Intel Quark]], [[Tensilica]]'s [[Xtensa]], and for [[Freescale]] [[Power ISA]] CPUs' [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM).<ref name=\"debug\" />\n\nA vendor proposed a hardware trace subsystem for standardization, donated a conforming design, and initiated a review.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGooganus |title=riscv-trace-spec |url=https://github.com/riscv/riscv-trace-spec |website=GitHub |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dahad |first1=Nitin |title=UltraSoC Tackles RISC-V Support Challenge by Donating Trace Encoder |url=https://www.eetimes.com/ultrasoc-tackles-risc-v-support-challenge-by-donating-trace-encoder/# |website=EE Times |publisher=Aspencore |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> The proposal is for a hardware module that can trace code execution on most RV5 CPUs. To reduce the data rate, and permit simpler or less-expensive paths for the trace data, the proposal does not generate trace data that could be calculated from a binary image of the code. It sends only data that indicates \"uninferrable\" paths through the program, such as which conditional branches are taken. To reduce the data rates, branches that can be calculated, such as unconditional branches, are not traced. The proposed interface between the module and the control unit is a logic signal for each uninferrable type of instruction. Addresses and other data are to be provided in a specialized bus attached to appropriate data sources in a CPU. The data structure sent to an external trace unit is a series of short messages with the needed data. The details of the data channel are intentionally not described in the proposal, because several are likely to make sense.\n\n==Implementations==\nThe RISC-V organization maintains a list of RISC-V CPU and SoC implementations.<ref>{{cite web |title=RISC-V Cores and SoC Overview |url=https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cores-list |publisher=RISC-V |accessdate=5 October 2019 |date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Existing===\nExisting commercial implementations include:\n* [[Alibaba Group]], in July 2019 announced the 2.5&nbsp;GHz 16-core 64bit (RV64GCV) XuanTie 910 [[Out-of-order_execution#Out-of-order_processors|out-of-order]] processor, the fastest RISC-V processor to date<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html|title=China's Alibaba is making a 16-core, 2.5 GHz RISC-V processor|website=www.techspot.com|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n* [[Andes Technology|Andes Technology Corporation]], a founding member of the RISC-V Foundation<ref>{{cite web |url=https://riscv.org/membership/1581/andes-technology/ |title=Andes Technology |website=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> which joined the consortium in 2016, released its first two RISC-V cores in 2017.

architecture]] (ISA) based on established [[reduced instruction set computer]] (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under [[open source license]]s that do not require fees to use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems are available and the instruction set is supported in several popular [[toolchain|software tool chain]]s. \n\nRISC-V has features to increase computer speed, yet reduce cost and power use. These include a [[load\u2013store architecture]], bit patterns to simplify the multiplexers in a CPU, simplified standards-based floating-point, a design that is architecturally neutral, and placing most-significant bits at a fixed location to speed [[sign extension]]. Sign extension is said to often be on the critical timing path.<ref name=\"isa\" />\nThe instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. It is variable-width and extensible so that more encoding bits can always be added. It supports three word-widths, 32, 64, and 128 bits, and a variety of subsets. The definitions of each subset vary slightly for the three word-widths. The subsets support small [[embedded system]]s, [[personal computer]]s, [[supercomputer]]s with vector processors, and warehouse-scale [[19 inch rack]]-mounted [[Parallel computing|parallel computers]]. \n\nThe instruction set space for the 128-bit stretched version of the ISA was reserved because 60 years of industry experience has shown that the most unrecoverable error in instruction set design is a lack of memory address space. {{As of|2016}}, the 128-bit ISA remains undefined intentionally, because there is yet so little practical experience with such large memory systems.<ref name=\"isa\" /> There are proposals to implement variable-width instructions up to 864-bits.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wolf |first1=Clifford |title=Alternative proposal for instruction length encoding |url=http://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2019/rvlonginsn/proposal_1.txt |website=Cliffords Subversion Servier |publisher=Clifford Wolf |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe project began in 2010 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but many contributors are volunteers not affiliated with the university.<ref name=\"contributors\" /> Unlike other academic designs which are typically optimized only for simplicity of exposition, the designers intended that the RISC-V instruction set be useable for practical computers. \n\nAs of June 2019, version 2.2 of the user-space ISA<ref name=\"isa\" /> and version 1.11 of the privileged ISA<ref name=priv-isa/> are [[Freeze (software engineering)|frozen]], permitting software and hardware development to proceed.

To cover the costs of such a team, commercial vendors of computer designs, such as [[ARM Holdings]] and [[MIPS Technologies]] charge [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for the use of their designs, [[patent]]s and [[copyright]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/07/a-long-look-at-how-arm-licenses-chips/ |title=A long look at how ARM licenses chips: Part 1 |last=Demerjian |first=Chuck |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=SemiAccurate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/08/how-arm-licenses-its-ip-for-production/ |title=How ARM licenses its IP for production: Part 2 |last=Demerjian |first=Chuck |date=August 8, 2013 |publisher=SemiAccurate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hackster.io/news/wave-computing-closes-its-mips-open-initiative-with-immediate-effect-zero-warning-e88b0df9acd0|title=Wave Computing Closes Its MIPS Open Initiative with Immediate Effect, Zero Warning|date=2019-11-15}}</ref> They also often require [[non-disclosure agreement]]s before releasing documents that describe their designs' detailed advantages. In many cases, they never describe the reasons for their design choices.\n\nRISC-V was started to solve these problems. The goal was to make a practical ISA that was open-sourced, usable academically and in any hardware or software design without royalties.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"isasbfree\" /> Also, the rationales for every part of the project are explained, at least broadly. The RISC-V authors are academic but have substantial experience in computer design. The RISC-V ISA is a direct development from a series of academic computer-design projects. It was originated in part to aid such projects.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nIn order to build a large, continuing community of users and therefore accumulate designs and software, the RISC-V ISA designers planned to support a wide variety of practical uses: Small, fast, and low-power real-world implementations,<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"rocketsspeed\" /> without over-architecting for a particular [[microarchitecture]].<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=sodor>{{cite web |last=Celio |first=Christopher |last2=Love |first2=Eric |title=ucb-bar/riscv-sodor |url=https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-sodor |website=GitHub Inc. |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"shakti\" /><ref name=boom>{{cite web |last=Celio |first=Christopher |title=CS 152 Laboratory Exercise 3 |url=http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs152/sp14/handouts/lab3.pdf |website=UC Berkeley |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref> A need for a large base of contributors is part of the reason why RISC-V was engineered to fit so many uses.\n\nThe designers say that the instruction set is the main interface in a computer because it lies between the hardware and the software. If a good instruction set was open, available for use by all, it should dramatically reduce the cost of software by permitting far more reuse. It should also increase competition among hardware providers, who can use more resources for design and less for software support.<ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nThe designers assert that new principles are becoming rare in instruction set design, as the most successful designs of the last forty years have become increasingly similar. Of those that failed, most did so because their sponsoring companies failed commercially, not because the instruction sets were poor technically. So, a well-designed open instruction set designed using well-established principles should attract long-term support by many vendors.<ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nRISC-V also supports the designers' academic uses. The simplicity of the integer subset permits basic student exercises. The integer subset is a simple ISA enabling software to control research machines. The variable-length ISA enables extensions for both student exercises and research.<ref name=\"isa\" /> The separated privileged instruction set permits research in operating system support, without redesigning compilers.<ref name=\"isapriv\" /> RISC-V's open intellectual property allows its designs to be published, reused, and modified.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n==History==\nThe term ''[[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]'' dates from about 1980.<ref name=\"riscstart\" /> Before this, there was some knowledge that simpler computers could be effective, but the design principles were not widely described. Simple, effective computers have always been of academic interest. Academics created the RISC instruction set [[DLX]] for the first edition of ''Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach'' in 1990. [[David Patterson (computer scientist)|David Patterson]] was an author, and later assisted RISC-V. DLX was intended for educational use; academics and hobbyists implemented it using [[field-programmable gate array]]s, but it was not a commercial success. ARM CPUs, versions 2 and earlier, had a public-domain instruction set, and it is still supported by the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), a popular free-software compiler. Three open-source [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|cores]] exist for this ISA, but they have not been manufactured.<ref name=\"amber\" /><ref name=\"arm4u\" /> [[OpenRISC]] is an open-source ISA based on DLX, with associated RISC designs. It is fully supported with GCC and [[Linux]] implementations. However, it has few commercial implementations.\n\n[[Krste Asanovi\u0107]] at the University of California, Berkeley, found many uses for an open-source computer system. In 2010, he decided to develop and publish one in a \"short, three-month project over the summer\". The plan was to help both academic and industrial users.<ref name=\"isasbfree\">{{cite web |url=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-146.pdf |title=Instruction Sets Should be Free |last=Asanovi\u0107 |first=Krste |author-link=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=U.C.

He originally identified the properties of [[Berkeley RISC]],<ref name=\"riscstart\" /> and RISC-V is one of his long series of cooperative RISC research projects. At this stage, students inexpensively provided initial software, simulations, and CPU designs.<ref name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThe RISC-V authors and their institution originally provided the ISA documents and several CPU designs under [[BSD licenses]], which allow derivative works\u2014such as RISC-V chip designs\u2014to be either open and free, or closed and proprietary. The ISA specification itself (i.e., the encoding of the instruction set) was effectively put into the public domain when the ISA tech reports were published, though the actual tech report text (an expression of the specification) was later put under a Creative Commons license to allow it to be improved by external contributors including the RISC-V Foundation.\n\nA full history of RISC-V has been published on the RISC-V Foundation website.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Foundation===\nCommercial users require an ISA to be stable before they can utilize it in a product that might last many years.

The ISA base and its extensions are developed in a collective effort between industry, the research community and educational institutions. The base specifies instructions (and their encoding), control flow, registers (and their sizes), memory and addressing, logic (i.e., integer) manipulation, and ancillaries. The base alone can implement a simplified general-purpose computer, with full software support, including a general-purpose compiler.\n\nThe standard extensions are specified to work with all of the standard bases, and with each other without conflict.\n\nMany RISC-V computers might implement the compact extension to reduce power consumption, code size, and memory use.<ref name=\"isa\" /> There are also future plans to support [[hypervisor]]s and [[virtualization]].<ref name=\"isapriv\">\n{{cite web\n | last         = Waterman\n | first        = Andrew\n | last2        = Lee\n | first2       = Yunsup\n | last3        = Avizienas\n | first3       = Rimas\n | last4        = Patterson\n | first4       = David\n | author-link4 = David Patterson (computer scientist)\n | last5        = Asanovi\u0107\n | first5       = Krste\n | author-link5 = Krste Asanovi\u0107\n | title        = Draft Privileged ISA Specification 1.9\n | url          = https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/\n | website      = RISC-V\n | publisher    = RISC-V Foundation\n | access-date  = 30 August 2016\n}}</ref>\n\nTogether with a supervisor instruction set extension, S, an RVGC defines all instructions needed to conveniently support a general purpose [[operating system]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+ ISA base and extensions\n|-\n!

Except for memory access instructions, instructions address only registers.\n\nThe first integer register is a zero register, and the remainder are general-purpose registers. A store to the zero register has no effect, and a read always provides 0. Using the zero register as a placeholder makes for a simpler instruction set.\n\n{{code|move rx to ry}} becomes {{code|add r0 to rx and store in ry}}.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nControl and status registers exist, but user-mode programs can access only those used for performance measurement and floating-point management.\n\nNo instructions exist to save and restore multiple registers. Those were thought to be needless, too complex, and perhaps too slow.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Memory access===\nLike many RISC designs, RISC-V is a [[load\u2013store architecture]]: instructions address only registers, with load and store instructions conveying to and from memory.\n\nMost load and store instructions include a 12-bit offset and two register identifiers. One register is the base register. The other register is the source (for a store) or destination (for a load.)\n\nThe offset is added to a base register to get the address. Forming the address as a base register plus offset allows single instructions to access data structures. For example, if the base register points to the top of a stack, single instructions can access a subroutine's local variables in the stack. Likewise the load and store instructions can access a record-style structure or a memory-mapped I/O device. Using the constant zero register as a base address allows single instructions to access memory near address zero.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nMemory is addressed as 8-bit bytes, with words being in [[little-endian]] order.<ref name=\"isa\" /> Words, up to the register size, can be accessed with the load and store instructions.\n\nAccessed memory addresses need not be aligned to their word-width, but accesses to aligned addresses may be faster; for example, simple CPUs may implement unaligned accesses with slow software emulation driven from an alignment failure interrupt.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nLike many RISC instruction sets (and some [[complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) instruction sets, such as [[x86]] and [[IBM System/360]] families), RISC-V lacks address-modes that write back to the registers. For example, it does not auto-increment.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V manages memory systems that are shared between CPUs or [[thread (computing)|threads]] by ensuring a thread of execution always sees its memory operations in the programmed order. But between threads and I/O devices, RISC-V is simplified: It doesn't guarantee the order of memory operations, except by specific instructions, such as {{code|fence}}.\n\nA {{code|fence}} instruction guarantees that the results of predecessor operations are visible to successor operations of other threads or I/O devices. {{code|fence}} can guarantee the order of combinations of both memory and memory-mapped I/O operations. E.g. it can separate memory read and write operations, without affecting I/O operations. Or, if a system can operate I/O devices in parallel with memory, {{code|fence}} doesn't force them to wait for each other. One CPU with one thread may decode {{code|fence}} as {{code|nop}}.\n\nRISC-V is little-endian to resemble other familiar, successful computers, for example, [[x86]]. This also reduces a CPU's complexity and costs slightly because it reads all sizes of words in the same order. For example, the RISC-V instruction set decodes starting at the lowest-addressed byte of the instruction. The specification leaves open the possibility of non-standard big-endian or bi-endian systems.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nSome RISC CPUs (such as [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]], [[DLX]], and Berkeley's RISC-I) place 16 bits of offset in the loads and stores. They set the upper 16 bits by a ''load upper word'' instruction. This permits upper-halfword values to be set easily, without shifting bits. However, most use of the upper half-word instruction makes 32-bit constants, like addresses. RISC-V uses a [[SPARC]]-like combination of 12-bit offsets and 20-bit ''set upper'' instructions. The smaller 12-bit offset helps compact, 32-bit load and store instructions select two of 32 registers yet still have enough bits to support RISC-V's variable-length instruction coding.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Immediates===\nRISC-V handles 32-bit constants and addresses with instructions that set the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit register. Load upper immediate {{code|lui}} loads 20 bits into bits 31 through 12. Then a second instruction such as {{code|addi}} can set the bottom 12 bits.\n\nThis method is extended to permit [[position-independent code]] by adding an instruction, {{code|auipc}} that generates 20 upper address bits by adding an offset to the program counter and storing the result into a base register. This permits a program to generate 32-bit addresses that are relative to the program counter.\n\nThe base register can often be used as-is with the 12-bit offsets of the loads and stores. If needed, {{code|addi}} can set the lower 12-bits of a register. In 64-bit and 128-bit ISAs,{{code|lui}} and {{code|auipc}} sign-extend the result to get the larger address.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nSome fast CPUs may interpret combinations of instructions as single ''fused'' instructions. {{code|lui}} or {{code|auipc}} may be good candidates to fuse with {{code|addi}}, loads or stores.\n\n===Subroutine calls, jumps, and branches===\nRISC-V's subroutine call {{code|jal}} (jump and link) places its return address in a register. This is faster in many computer designs, because it saves a memory access compared to systems that push a return address directly on a stack in memory. {{code|jal}} has a 20-bit signed (2's complement) offset. The offset is multiplied by 2, then added to the PC to generate a relative address to a 32-bit instruction. If the result is not at a 32-bit address (i.e., evenly divisible by 4), the CPU may force an [[Exception handling|exception]].<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V CPUs jump to calculated addresses using a ''jump and link-register'', {{code|jalr}} instruction. {{code|jalr}} is similar to {{code|jal}}, but gets its destination address by adding a 12-bit offset to a base register. (In contrast,{{code|jal}} adds a larger 20-bit offset to the PC.)\n\n{{code|jalr}}'s bit format is like the register-relative loads and stores. Like them, {{code|jalr}} can be used with the instructions that set the upper 20 bits of a base register to make 32-bit branches, either to an absolute address (using {{code|lui}}) or a PC-relative one (using {{code|auipc}} for [[position-independent code]]). (Using a constant zero base address allows single-instruction calls to a small (the offset), fixed positive or negative address.)\n\nRISC-V recycles {{code|jal}} and {{code|jalr}} to get unconditional 20-bit PC-relative jumps and unconditional register-based 12-bit jumps. Jumps just make the linkage register 0 so that no return address is saved.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V also recycles {{code|jalr}} to return from a subroutine: To do this, {{code|jalr}}'s base register is set to be the linkage register saved by {{code|jal}} or {{code|jalr}}. {{code|jalr}}'s offset is zero and the linkage register is zero, so that there is no offset, and no return address is saved.\n\nLike many RISC designs, in a subroutine call, a RISC-V compiler must use individual instructions to save registers to the stack at the start, and then restore these from the stack on exit. RISC-V has no ''save multiple'' or ''restore multiple'' register instructions. These were thought to make the CPU too complex, and possibly slow.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> This can take more code space. Designers planned to reduce code size with library routines to save and restore registers.<ref name=\"isacompressed\" />\n\nRISC-V has no [[condition code register]] or [[carry bit]]. The designers believed that condition codes make fast CPUs more complex by forcing interactions between instructions in different stages of execution. This choice makes multiple-precision arithmetic more complex. Also, a few numerical tasks need more energy. As a result, [[Branch predication|predication]] (the conditional execution of instructions) is not supported. The designers claim that very fast, out-of-order CPU designs do predication anyway, by doing the comparison branch and conditional code in parallel, then discarding the unused path's effects. They also claim that even in simpler CPUs, predication is less valuable than [[branch prediction]], which can prevent most stalls associated with conditional branches. Code without predication is larger, with more branches, but they also claim that a compressed instruction set (such as RISC-V's set ''C'') solves that problem in most cases.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nInstead, RISC-V has short branches that perform comparisons: equal, not-equal, less-than, unsigned less-than, greater-than or equal and unsigned greater-than or equal. Ten comparison-branch operations are implemented with only six instructions, by reversing the order of operands in the [[Assembly language|assembler]]. For example, ''branch if greater than'' can be done by ''less-than'' with a reversed order of operands.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe comparing branches have a twelve-bit signed range, and jump relative to the PC.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nUnlike some RISC architectures, RISC-V does not include a [[branch delay slot]], a position after a branch instruction that can be filled with an instruction that is executed whether or not the branch is taken. RISC-V omits a branch delay slot because it complicates multicycle CPUs, superscalar CPUs, and long pipelines. Dynamic [[branch predictor]]s have succeeded well enough to reduce the need for delayed branches.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nOn the first encounter with a branch, RISC-V CPUs should assume that a negative relative branch (i.e. the sign bit of the offset is \"1\") will be taken.<ref name=\"isa\" /> This assumes that a backward branch is a loop, and provides a default direction so that simple pipelined CPUs can fill their pipeline of instructions. Other than this, RISC-V does not require [[branch prediction]], but core implementations are allowed to add it. RV32I reserves a \"HINT\" instruction space that presently does not contain any hints on branches.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Arithmetic and logic sets===\nRISC-V segregates math into a minimal set of [[integer]] instructions (set ''I'') with [[Arithmetic logic unit|add, subtract, shift, bit-wise logic]] and comparing-branches. These can simulate most of the other RISC-V instruction sets with software. (The atomic instructions are a notable exception.) RISC-V currently lacks the ''count leading zero'' and bit-field operations normally used to speed software floating-point in a pure-integer processor.\n\nThe integer multiplication instructions (set ''M'') includes signed and unsigned multiply and divide. Double-precision integer multiplies and divides are included, as multiplies and divides that produce the ''high word'' of the result. The ISA document recommends that implementors of CPUs and compilers ''fuse'' a standardized sequence of high and low multiply and divide instructions to one operation if possible.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe [[floating-point]] instructions (set ''F'') includes single-precision arithmetic and also comparison-branches similar to the integer arithmetic. It requires an additional set of 32 floating-point registers. These are separate from the integer registers. The double-precision floating point instructions (set ''D'') generally assume that the floating-point registers are 64-bit (i.e., double-width), and the ''F'' subset is coordinated with the ''D'' set. A quad-precision 128-bit floating-point ISA (''Q'') is also defined. RISC-V computers without floating-point can use a floating-point software library.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V does not cause [[Exception handling|exceptions]] on arithmetic errors, including [[Overflow flag|overflow]], underflow, subnormal, and divide by zero. Instead, both integer and floating-point arithmetic produce reasonable default values and set status bits. Divide-by-zero can be discovered by one branch after the division. The status bits can be tested by an operating system or periodic interrupt.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Atomic memory operations===\nRISC-V supports computers that share memory between multiple CPUs and [[Thread (computing)|threads]]. RISC-V's standard memory consistency model is [[release consistency]]. That is, loads and stores may generally be reordered, but some loads may be designated as ''acquire'' operations which must precede later memory accesses, and some stores may be designated as ''release'' operations which must follow earlier memory accesses.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe base instruction set includes minimal support in the form of a [[Fence instruction|{{code|fence}} instruction]] to enforce memory ordering. Although this is sufficient ({{code|fence r, rw}} provides ''acquire'' and {{code|fence rw, w}} provides ''release''), combined operations can be more efficient.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe atomic memory operation extension supports two types of atomic memory operations for release consistency. First, it provides general purpose [[Load-link/store-conditional|''load-reserved'' {{code|lr}} and ''store-conditional'' {{code|sc}}]] instructions. {{code|lr}} performs a load, and tries to reserve that address for its thread. A later store-conditional {{code|sc}} to the reserved address will be performed only if the reservation is not broken by an intervening store from another source. If the store succeeds, a zero is placed in a register. If it failed, a non-zero value indicates that software needs to retry the operation. In either case, the reservation is released.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe second group of atomic instructions perform [[read-modify-write]] sequences: a load (which is optionally a load-acquire) to a destination register, then an operation between the loaded value and a source register, then a store of the result (which may optionally be a store-release). Making the memory barriers optional permits combining the operations. The optional operations are enabled by ''acquire'' and ''release'' bits which are present in every atomic instruction. RISC-V defines nine possible operations: swap (use source register value directly); add; bitwise and, or, and exclusive-or; and signed and unsigned minimum and maximum.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nA system design may optimize these combined operations more than {{code|lr}} and {{code|sc}}. For example, if the destination register for a swap is the constant zero, the load may be skipped. If the value stored is unmodified since the load, the store may be skipped.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe [[IBM System/370]] and its successors including [[z/Architecture]], and [[x86]], both implement a [[compare-and-swap]] ({{code|cas}}) instruction, which tests and conditionally updates a location in memory: if the location contains an expected old value, {{code|cas}} replaces it with a given new value; it then returns an indication of whether it made the change. However, a simple load-type instruction is usually performed before the {{code|cas}} to fetch the old value. The classic problem is that if a thread reads (loads) a value ''A'', calculates a new value ''C'', and then uses ({{code|cas}}) to replace ''A'' with ''C'', it has no way to know whether concurrent activity in another thread has replaced ''A'' with some other value ''B'' and then restored the ''A'' in between. In some algorithms (e.g., ones in which the values in memory are pointers to dynamically allocated blocks), this [[ABA problem]] can lead to incorrect results. The most common solution employs a ''double-wide {{code|cas}}'' instruction to update both the pointer and an adjacent counter; unfortunately, such an instruction requires a special instruction format to specify multiple registers, performs several reads and writes, and can have complex bus operation.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe {{code|lr}}/{{code|sc}} alternative is more efficient. It usually requires only one memory load, and minimizing slow memory operations is desirable. It's also exact: it controls all accesses to the memory cell, rather than just assuring a bit pattern. However, unlike {{code|cas}}, it can permit [[livelock]], in which two or more threads repeatedly cause each other's instructions to fail. RISC-V guarantees forward progress (no livelock) if the code follows rules on the timing and sequence of instructions: 1) It must use only the ''I'' subset. 2) To prevent repetitive cache misses, the code (including the retry loop) must occupy no more than 16 consecutive instructions. 3) It must include no system or fence instructions, or taken backward branches between the {{code|lr}} and {{code|sc}}. 4) The backward branch to the retry loop must be to the original sequence.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe specification gives examples of how to use this subset to lock a data structure.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Compressed subset===\nThe standard RISC-V ISA specifies that all instructions are 32 bits. This makes for a particularly simple implementation, but like other RISC processors with such an instruction encoding, results in larger code size than in other instruction sets.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"riscvc\" />\nTo compensate, RISC-V's ''32-bit'' instructions are actually 30 bits; {{frac|3|4}} of the [[opcode]] space is reserved for an optional (but recommended) variable-length ''compressed'' instruction set, RVC, that includes 16-bit instructions. Like ARM's Thumb and the MIPS16, the compressed instructions are simply aliases for a subset of the larger instructions. Unlike ARM's Thumb or the MIPS compressed set, space was reserved from the beginning so there is no separate operating mode. Standard and compressed instructions may be intermixed freely.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"riscvc\" /> (letter ''C'')<ref name=\"isacompressed\" />\n\nBecause (like Thumb-1 and MIPS16) the compressed instructions are simply alternate encodings (aliases) for a selected subset of larger instructions, the compression can be implemented in the assembler, and it is not essential for the compiler to even know about it.\n\nA prototype of RVC was tested in 2011.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> The prototype code was 20% smaller than an [[x86]] PC and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] compressed code, and 2% larger than [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[Thumb-2]] code.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> It also substantially reduced both the needed cache memory and the estimated power use of the memory system.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nThe researcher intended to reduce the code's binary size for small computers, especially [[embedded computer]] systems. The prototype included 33 of the most frequently used instructions, recoded as compact 16-bit formats using operation codes previously reserved for the compressed set.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> The compression was done in the [[Assembly language|assembler]], with no changes to the compiler. Compressed instructions omitted fields that are often zero, used small immediate values or accessed subsets (16 or 8) of the registers. {{code|addi}} is very common and often compressible.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nMuch of the difference in size compared to Arm's Thumb set occurred because RISC-V, and the prototype, have no instructions to save and restore multiple registers. Instead, the compiler generated conventional instructions that access the stack. The prototype RVC assembler then often converted these to compressed forms that were half the size. However, this still took more code space than the ARM instructions that save and restore multiple registers. The researcher proposed to modify the compiler to call library routines to save and restore registers. These routines would tend to remain in a code cache and thus run fast, though probably not as fast as a save-multiple instruction.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nStandard RVC requires occasional use of 32-bit instructions. Several nonstandard RVC proposals are complete, requiring no 32-bit instructions, and are said to have higher densities than standard RVC.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |last1=Brussee |first1=Rogier |title=A Complete 16-bit RVC |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!msg/isa-dev/SrujNcNc8RA/0mA-dATSBwAJ |website=Google Groups |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Brussee\">{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!searchin/isa-dev/16-bit/isa-dev/iK3enKGb5bw/cuVAq0J8EAAJ |title=Proposal: Xcondensed, [a] ...

Floating-point instructions should not be supported (the specification forbids it as uneconomical), so a floating-point software library must be used.<ref name=\"isa\" /> The compressed set ''C'' is recommended. The privileged instruction set supports only machine mode, user mode and memory schemes that use base-and-bound address relocation.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nDiscussion has occurred for a microcontroller profile for RISC-V, to ease development of deeply [[embedded system]]s. It centers on faster, simple C-language support for interrupts, simplified security modes and a simplified [[POSIX]] application binary interface.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/emb-riscv/specs-markdown/blob/master/README.md |title=The RISC-V Microcontroller Profile |last=Ionescu |first=Liviu |website=Github |access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nCorrespondents have also proposed smaller, non-standard, 16-bit ''RV16E'' ISAs: Several serious proposals would use the 16-bit ''C'' instructions with 8 \u00d7 16-bit registers.<ref name=\"Brussee\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/> An April fools' joke proposed a very practical arrangement: Utilize 16 \u00d7 16-bit integer registers, with the standard ''EIMC'' ISAs (including 32-bit instructions.)

Each layer also is expected to have a thin layer of standardized supporting software that communicates to a more-privileged layer, or hardware.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nThe overall plan for this ISA is to make the hypervisor mode [[orthogonal]] to the user and supervisor modes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!msg/isa-dev/SfEDPLU0NU4/WpAE_A4OBQAJ |title=Proposal for Virtualization without H mode |last=Bonzini |first=Paolo |last2=Waterman |first2=Andrew |website=Google Groups, RISC-V ISA Dev. |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref> The basic feature is a configuration bit that either permits supervisor-level code to access hypervisor registers, or causes an interrupt on accesses. This bit lets supervisor mode directly handle the hardware needed by a hypervisor. This simplifies a type 2 hypervisor, hosted by an operating system. This is a popular mode to run warehouse-scale computers. To support type 1, unhosted hypervisors, the bit can cause these accesses to interrupt to a hypervisor. The bit simplifies nesting of hypervisors, in which a hypervisor runs under a hypervisor. It's also said to simplify supervisor code by letting the kernel use its own hypervisor features with its own kernel code. As a result, the hypervisor form of the ISA supports five modes: machine, supervisor, user, supervisor-under-hypervisor and user-under-hypervisor.\n\nThe privileged instruction set specification explicitly defines ''hardware [[Thread (computing)|threads]]'', or ''harts''. Multiple hardware threads are a common practice in more-capable computers. When one thread is stalled, waiting for memory, others can often proceed. Hardware threads can help make better use of the large number of registers and execution units in fast out-of-order CPUs. Finally, hardware threads can be a simple, powerful way to handle [[interrupt]]s: No saving or restoring of registers is required, simply executing a different hardware thread. However, the only hardware thread required in a RISC-V computer is thread zero.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nThe existing control and status register definitions support RISC-V's error and memory exceptions, and a small number of interrupts. For systems with more interrupts, the specification also defines an interrupt controller. Interrupts always start at the highest-privileged machine level, and the control registers of each level have explicit ''forwarding'' bits to route interrupts to less-privileged code. For example, the hypervisor need not include software that executes on each interrupt to forward an interrupt to an operating system. Instead, on set-up, it can set bits to forward the interrupt.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nSeveral memory systems are supported in the specification. Physical-only is suited to the simplest [[embedded system]]s. There are also three [[UNIX]]-style [[virtual memory]] systems for memory cached in mass-storage systems. The virtual memory systems have three sizes, with addresses sized 32, 39 and 48-bits. All virtual memory systems support 4&nbsp;KiB pages, multilevel page-table trees and use very similar algorithms to walk the page table trees. All are designed for either hardware or software page-table walking. To optionally reduce the cost of page table walks, super-sized pages may be leaf pages in higher levels of a system's page table tree. SV32 has a two layer page table tree and supports 4&nbsp;MiB superpages. SV39 has a three level page table, and supports 2&nbsp;MiB superpages and 1&nbsp;GiB gigapages. SV48 is required to support SV39. It also has a 4-level page table and supports 2&nbsp;MiB superpages, 1&nbsp;GiB gigapages, and 512&nbsp;GiB terapages. Superpages are aligned on the page boundaries for the next-lowest size of page.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\n===Bit manipulation===\nAn unapproved bit-manipulation (B) ISA for RISC-V was under review in January 2020.{{clarify|reason=Was under review and was accepted, was under review but was rejected, or still is under review?|date=January 2020}} Done well, a bit-manipulation subset can aid cryptographic, graphic, and mathematical operations.

The 16-bit subword size was chosen to support most digital signal processing tasks. These instructions were inexpensive to design and build.\n\n===Vector set===\nThe proposed vector-processing instruction set may make the packed SIMD set obsolete. The designers hope to have enough flexibility that a CPU can implement vector instructions in a standard processor's registers. This would enable minimal implementations with similar performance to a multimedia ISA, as above. However, a true [[vector processors|vector coprocessor]] could execute the same code with higher performance.<ref name=\"vect\">{{cite web |url=https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/riscv-vector-workshop-june2015.pdf |title=RISC-V Vector Extension Proposal |last=Schmidt |first=Colin |last2=Ou |first2=Albert |last3=Lee |first3=Yunsup |last4=Asanovi\u0107 |first4=Krste |author-link4=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=RISC-V |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|06|29}}, the vector-processing proposal is a conservative, flexible design of a general-purpose mixed-precision [[vector processor]], suitable to execute [[compute kernel]]s. Code would port easily to CPUs with differing vector lengths, ideally without recompiling.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nIn contrast, short-vector SIMD extensions are less convenient. These are used in [[x86]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]] and [[PA-RISC]]. In these, a change in word-width forces a change to the instruction set to expand the vector registers (in the case of x86, from 64-bit [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] registers to 128-bit [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE), to 256-bit [[Advanced Vector Extensions]] (AVX), and [[AVX-512]]). The result is a growing instruction set, and a need to port working code to the new instructions.\n\nIn the RISC-V vector ISA, rather than fix the vector length in the architecture, an instruction ({{code|setvl}}) is available which takes a requested size and sets the vector length to the minimum of the hardware limit and the requested size. So, the RISC-V proposal is more like a [[Cray-1|Cray]]'s long-vector design or ARM's Scalable Vector Extension. That is, each vector in up to 32 vectors is the same length.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nThe application specifies the total vector width it requires, and the processor determines the vector length it can provide with available on-chip resources. This takes the form of an instruction ({{code|vsetcfg}}) with four immediate operands, specifying the number of vector registers of each available width needed. The total must be no more than the addressable limit of 32, but may be less if the application does not require them all. The vector length is limited by the available on-chip storage divided by the number of bytes of storage needed for each entry. (Added hardware limits may also exist, which in turn may permit SIMD-style implementations.)<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nOutside of vector loops, the application can request zero-vector registers, saving the operating system the work of preserving them on [[context switch]]es.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nThe vector length is not only architecturally variable, but designed to vary at run time also. To achieve this flexibility, the instruction set is likely to use variable-width data paths and variable-type operations using polymorphic overloading.<ref name=\"vect\" /> The plan is that these can reduce the size and complexity of the ISA and compiler.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nRecent experimental vector processors with variable-width data paths also show profitable increases in operations per: second (speed), area (lower cost), and watt (longer battery life).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yunsup/papers/hwacha-mvp-prism2014.pdf |title=A Case for MVPs: Mixed-Precision Vector Processors |last=Ou |first=Albert |last2=Nguyen |first2=Quan |last3=Lee |first3=Yunsup |last4=Asanovi\u0107 |first4=Krste |author-link4=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=UC Berkeley EECS |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike a typical modern [[graphics processing unit]], there are no plans to provide special hardware to support [[branch predication]].

The debugger will use a transport system such as Joint Test Action Group ([[JTAG]]) or Universal Serial Bus ([[USB]]) to access debug registers. A standard hardware debug interface may support either a ''standardized abstract interface'' or ''instruction feeding''.<ref name=\"debug\">{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x53gVvPrDWEYq3omqLUpJBHU594zidDvoIg42mUzHvM/edit#slide=id.p |title=RISC-V Run Control Debug |last=Bradbury |first=Alex |last2=Wallentowitz |first2=Stefan |website=Google Docs |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/debug/FDmZUk7YCNw |title=RISC-V Debug Group > poll results |last=Newsome |first=Tim |website=Google Groups, RISC-V Debug Group |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017|01}}, the exact form of the ''abstract interface'' remains undefined, but proposals include a memory mapped system with standardized addresses for the registers of debug devices or a command register and a data register accessible to the communication system.<ref name=\"debug\" /> Correspondents claim that similar systems are used by [[Freescale]]'s [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM) for some CPUs, [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[OpenRISC]], and [[Aeroflex]]'s [[LEON]].<ref name=\"debug\" />\n\nIn ''instruction feeding'', the CPU will process a debug exception to execute individual instructions written to a register. This may be supplemented with a data-passing register and a module to directly access the memory. Instruction feeding lets the debugger access the computer exactly as software would. It also minimizes changes in the CPU, and adapts to many types of CPU. This was said to be especially apt for RISC-V because it is designed explicitly for many types of computers. The data-passing register allows a debugger to write a data-movement loop to RAM, and then execute the loop to move data into or out of the computer at a speed near the maximum speed of the debug system's data channel.<ref name=\"debug\" /> Correspondents say that similar systems are used by [[MIPS Technologies]] [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[Intel Quark]], [[Tensilica]]'s [[Xtensa]], and for [[Freescale]] [[Power ISA]] CPUs' [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM).<ref name=\"debug\" />\n\nA vendor proposed a hardware trace subsystem for standardization, donated a conforming design, and initiated a review.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGooganus |title=riscv-trace-spec |url=https://github.com/riscv/riscv-trace-spec |website=GitHub |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dahad |first1=Nitin |title=UltraSoC Tackles RISC-V Support Challenge by Donating Trace Encoder |url=https://www.eetimes.com/ultrasoc-tackles-risc-v-support-challenge-by-donating-trace-encoder/# |website=EE Times |publisher=Aspencore |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> The proposal is for a hardware module that can trace code execution on most RV5 CPUs. To reduce the data rate, and permit simpler or less-expensive paths for the trace data, the proposal does not generate trace data that could be calculated from a binary image of the code. It sends only data that indicates \"uninferrable\" paths through the program, such as which conditional branches are taken. To reduce the data rates, branches that can be calculated, such as unconditional branches, are not traced. The proposed interface between the module and the control unit is a logic signal for each uninferrable type of instruction. Addresses and other data are to be provided in a specialized bus attached to appropriate data sources in a CPU. The data structure sent to an external trace unit is a series of short messages with the needed data. The details of the data channel are intentionally not described in the proposal, because several are likely to make sense.\n\n==Implementations==\nThe RISC-V organization maintains a list of RISC-V CPU and SoC implementations.<ref>{{cite web |title=RISC-V Cores and SoC Overview |url=https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cores-list |publisher=RISC-V |accessdate=5 October 2019 |date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Existing===\nExisting commercial implementations include:\n* [[Alibaba Group]], in July 2019 announced the 2.5&nbsp;GHz 16-core 64bit (RV64GCV) XuanTie 910 [[Out-of-order_execution#Out-of-order_processors|out-of-order]] processor, the fastest RISC-V processor to date<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html|title=China's Alibaba is making a 16-core, 2.5 GHz RISC-V processor|website=www.techspot.com|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n* [[Andes Technology|Andes Technology Corporation]], a founding member of the RISC-V Foundation<ref>{{cite web |url=https://riscv.org/membership/1581/andes-technology/ |title=Andes Technology |website=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> which joined the consortium in 2016, released its first two RISC-V cores in 2017.

Violet ([[Jennifer Tilly]]), who longs to escape her relationship with her [[American Mafia|mafioso]] boyfriend Caesar ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), enters into a clandestine affair with alluring ex-con Corky ([[Gina Gershon]]), and the two women hatch a scheme to steal $2 million of Mafia money.\n\n''Bound'' was the first film directed by the Wachowskis, and they took inspiration from [[Billy Wilder]] to tell a noir story filled with sex and violence. Financed by [[Dino De Laurentiis]], the film was made on a tight budget with the help of frugal crew members including cinematographer [[Bill Pope]]. The directors initially struggled to cast the lesbian characters of Violet and Corky before securing Tilly and Gershon. To choreograph the sex scenes, the directors employed sex educator [[Susie Bright]], who also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the film.\n\n''Bound'' received positive reviews from film critics who praised the humor and style of the directors as well as the realistic portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film found its plot superficial and criticized the violence as excessive. The film won several festival awards.\n\n==Plot==\n\nCorky, a lesbian ex-con, is hired as a painter and plumber at an apartment building. She encounters Violet and Caesar, the couple who live next-door to the apartment she is renovating. While Caesar is gone, Violet deliberately drops an earring down the sink; the building owner sends Corky to retrieve it. Violet admits she dropped the earring on purpose and starts to seduce Corky. They are interrupted by Caesar's arrival and Corky returns to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck. They go to Corky's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and they have been together for five years.\n\nLater, Violet overhears Caesar and his Mob associates beating and torturing Shelly, a man who has been skimming money from the business. Upset by the violence, Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will bring the nearly $2 million that Shelly embezzled back to the apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money.\n\nAfter Shelly is shot and killed by Johnnie, the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzzone, Caesar returns to the apartment with a bag of bloody money. Angry at Johnnie for killing Shelly in a fit of rage and splattering blood everywhere, Caesar proceeds to wash, iron and hang the money to dry.\n\nViolet explains to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie will be coming to pick up the money from Caesar. Corky devises a plan: when Caesar has finished counting the money, he will shower to unwind. While he does, Violet will purposely drop the bottle of [[The Glenlivet distillery|Glenlivet]] Scotch that Gino prefers and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, Corky will enter, steal the money from a briefcase, and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leave. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to flee because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son Johnnie.\n\nWhen Caesar finds the money gone, he realizes Gino will think he stole it if he runs. Caesar decides he has to get the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave, but Caesar forces her to stay, suspecting she and Johnnie may have stolen the money and framed him.\n\nCorky waits next-door with the money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After Johnnie flirts with Violet and taunts him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. He kills Gino, Johnnie and Roy, Gino's bodyguard. Caesar tells Violet that they must find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived lest their Mafia pals discover the men are missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey, a Mob buddy, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.\n\nAfter discovering Corky and Violet stole the money, Caesar ties them up, threatens to torture them, and demands to know where it is. Corky tells Caesar she has hidden the money in the next-door apartment, but before he can go retrieve it, Mickey unexpectedly arrives at the apartment. Caesar makes a deal with Violet to help Mickey stall: Violet takes Johnnie's cell phone from his body and calls their own landline. Caesar answers the phone and Violet convinces him to feign a conversation with Gino, explaining that he and Johnnie are in the hospital after a car accident. The ruse fools Mickey, who leaves for the hospital.\n\nCaesar goes to get the money from Corky's apartment, but Violet escapes and calls Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats her violently. Violet arrives and holds Caesar at gunpoint; she informs him Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can. When Caesar refuses, Violet kills him.\n\nLater, Mickey, who believes Violet's story, tells her that he will find Caesar. Mickey wants Violet to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she needs a clean break\u2014which she makes by driving off hand-in-hand with Corky.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Corky\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Violet\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Caesar\n* [[Mary Mara]] as Bartender\n* [[Susie Bright]] as Jesse\n* [[Margaret Smith (comedian)|Margaret Smith]] as Woman Cop\n* [[Barry Kivel]] as Shelly\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Johnnie Marzzone\n* [[John P.

He and the Wachowskis drew from their love of comics and were influenced by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller's]] neo-noir ''[[Sin City]]'' series in particular.<ref name=\"Marx\" /> Pope's sound counterpart was sound director [[Dane Davis]]. One of his ideas was to give Corky a [[cat]]-like quality by making a \"swishing\" sound every time she walks past the camera in the scene where she and Violet plan the theft.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nThe Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano to watch [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' and to focus on [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character in order to prepare the paranoia of Caesar.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Gershon's influences for her role were [[James Dean]], [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about filming the sex scenes and prepared by drinking [[tequila]].<ref name=\"diva\" />\n\nVery little improvisation took place during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar near the end of the film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required [[surgical suture|stitches]].<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n===Sex scenes===\nThe sex scenes were choreographed by feminist writer and sex educator [[Susie Bright]]. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright and sent her a copy of the script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly what was happening in the sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nBright appeared as Jesse, the woman Corky tries to talk to in the bar. Comedian [[Margaret Smith (comedian)|Margaret Smith]] played Jesse's girlfriend and the extras in the bar scene were Bright's friends\u2014\"real life San Francisco [[Dyke (slang)|dykes]]\".<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n==Themes==\nThe Wachowskis describe several themes present in ''Bound''. They say that the film is about \"the boxes people make of their lives\", that it is not only gay people who \"live in [[Closeted|closets]]\". They wanted to define all of ''Bound'''s characters by the \"sort of trap that they were making out of their lives\".<ref name=\"gadfly\" /> Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet's closet, bound and gagged by Caesar.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says \"I had this image of you inside of me...\"<ref name=\"DVD\" /> This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by the fact that most of the film takes place in Violet and Casear's apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nSusie Bright described some of the specifically lesbian themes of the film. One is the concept of the hand as a sex organ, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet's hands.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet's earring from the sink.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Bright describes it as a movie that is \"wet\" (feminine) as opposed to \"hard\" (masculine).<ref name=\"DVD\" /> She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of \"lesbian signs\". She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is wearing jeans and able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and \"girly\"\u2014making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that \"everyone in the film wants to be with Violet\".<ref name=\"DVD\" /> When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the [[LGBT]] film festival screenings.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Rating===\n''Bound'' was rated by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) as R for \"strong sexuality, violence and language.\" To achieve that rating, the directors had to cut part of the first sex scene between Corky and Violet.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> The MPAA were most concerned with the images of what Lana Wachowski called \"hand-sex\".<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book | last =Merck | first =Mandy | title =In Your Face: 9 Sexual Studies | publisher =NYU Press | year =2000 | pages =124\u2013147 | isbn =0-8147-5639-5 }}</ref> It was rated R in Australia, R18 in New Zealand and 18 in the United Kingdom.

Violet ([[Jennifer Tilly]]), who longs to escape her relationship with her [[American Mafia|mafioso]] boyfriend Caesar ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), enters into a clandestine affair with alluring ex-con Corky ([[Gina Gershon]]), and the two women hatch a scheme to steal $2 million of Mafia money.\n\n''Bound'' was the first film directed by the Wachowskis, and they took inspiration from [[Billy Wilder]] to tell a noir story filled with sex and violence. Financed by [[Dino De Laurentiis]], the film was made on a tight budget with the help of frugal crew members including cinematographer [[Bill Pope]]. The directors initially struggled to cast the lesbian characters of Violet and Corky before securing Tilly and Gershon. To choreograph the sex scenes, the directors employed sex educator [[Susie Bright]], who also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the film.\n\n''Bound'' received positive reviews from film critics who praised the humor and style of the directors as well as the realistic portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film found its plot superficial and criticized the violence as excessive. The film won several festival awards.\n\n==Plot==\n\nCorky, a lesbian ex-con, is hired as a painter and plumber at an apartment building. She encounters Violet and Caesar, the couple who live next-door to the apartment she is renovating. While Caesar is gone, Violet deliberately drops an earring down the sink; the building owner sends Corky to retrieve it. Violet admits she dropped the earring on purpose and starts to seduce Corky. They are interrupted by Caesar's arrival and Corky returns to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck. They go to Corky's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and they have been together for five years.\n\nLater, Violet overhears Caesar and his Mob associates beating and torturing Shelly, a man who has been skimming money from the business. Upset by the violence, Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will bring the nearly $2 million that Shelly embezzled back to the apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money.\n\nAfter Shelly is shot and killed by Johnnie, the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzzone, Caesar returns to the apartment with a bag of bloody money. Angry at Johnnie for killing Shelly in a fit of rage and splattering blood everywhere, Caesar proceeds to wash, iron and hang the money to dry.\n\nViolet explains to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie will be coming to pick up the money from Caesar. Corky devises a plan: when Caesar has finished counting the money, he will shower to unwind. While he does, Violet will purposely drop the bottle of [[The Glenlivet distillery|Glenlivet]] Scotch that Gino prefers and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, Corky will enter, steal the money from a briefcase, and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leave. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to flee because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son Johnnie.\n\nWhen Caesar finds the money gone, he realizes Gino will think he stole it if he runs. Caesar decides he has to get the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave, but Caesar forces her to stay, suspecting she and Johnnie may have stolen the money and framed him.\n\nCorky waits next-door with the money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After Johnnie flirts with Violet and taunts him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. He kills Gino, Johnnie and Roy, Gino's bodyguard. Caesar tells Violet that they must find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived lest their Mafia pals discover the men are missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey, a Mob buddy, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.\n\nAfter discovering Corky and Violet stole the money, Caesar ties them up, threatens to torture them, and demands to know where it is. Corky tells Caesar she has hidden the money in the next-door apartment, but before he can go retrieve it, Mickey unexpectedly arrives at the apartment. Caesar makes a deal with Violet to help Mickey stall: Violet takes Johnnie's cell phone from his body and calls their own landline. Ceasar answers the phone and Violet convinces him to feign a conversation with Gino, explaining that he and Johnnie are in the hospital after a car accident. The ruse fools Mickey, who leaves for the hospital.\n\nCaesar goes to get the money from Corky's apartment, but Violet escapes and calls Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats her violently. Violet arrives and holds Caesar at gunpoint; she informs him Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can. When Caesar refuses, Violet kills him.\n\nLater, Mickey, who believes Violet's story, tells her that he will find Caesar.

One of his ideas was to give Corky a [[cat]]-like quality by making a \"swishing\" sound every time she walks past the camera in the scene where she and Violet plan the theft.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nThe Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano to watch [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' and to focus on [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character in order to prepare the paranoia of Caesar.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Gershon's influences for her role were [[James Dean]], [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about filming the sex scenes and prepared by drinking [[tequila]].<ref name=\"diva\" />\n\nVery little improvisation took place during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar near the end of the film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required [[surgical suture|stitches]].<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n===Sex scenes===\nThe sex scenes were choreographed by feminist writer and sex educator [[Susie Bright]]. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright and sent her a copy of the script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly what was happening in the sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nBright appeared as Jesse, the woman Corky tries to talk to in the bar. Comedian [[Margaret Smith (comedian)|Margaret Smith]] played Jesse's girlfriend and the extras in the bar scene were Bright's friends\u2014\"real life San Francisco [[Dyke (slang)|dykes]]\".<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n==Themes==\nThe Wachowskis describe several themes present in ''Bound''. They say that the film is about \"the boxes people make of their lives\", that it is not only gay people who \"live in [[Closeted|closets]]\". They wanted to define all of ''Bound'''s characters by the \"sort of trap that they were making out of their lives\".<ref name=\"gadfly\" /> Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet's closet, bound and gagged by Caesar.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says \"I had this image of you inside of me...\"<ref name=\"DVD\" /> This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by the fact that most of the film takes place in Violet and Casear's apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nSusie Bright described some of the specifically lesbian themes of the film. One is the concept of the hand as a sex organ, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet's hands.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet's earring from the sink.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Bright describes it as a movie that is \"wet\" (feminine) as opposed to \"hard\" (masculine).<ref name=\"DVD\" /> She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of \"lesbian signs\". She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is wearing jeans and able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and \"girly\"\u2014making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that \"everyone in the film wants to be with Violet\".<ref name=\"DVD\" /> When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the [[LGBT]] film festival screenings.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Rating===\n''Bound'' was rated by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) as R for \"strong sexuality, violence and language.\" To achieve that rating, the directors had to cut part of the first sex scene between Corky and Violet.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> The MPAA were most concerned with the images of what Lana Wachowski called \"hand-sex\".<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book | last =Merck | first =Mandy | title =In Your Face: 9 Sexual Studies | publisher =NYU Press | year =2000 | pages =124\u2013147 | isbn =0-8147-5639-5 }}</ref> It was rated R in Australia, R18 in New Zealand and 18 in the United Kingdom.

Recently much of the original literature concerning navicular disease has been called into question, particularly the significance of [[radiographic]] changes as a sole diagnostic criterion.<ref>Citing Clinical Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory Manual for Veterinary Technicians, Colville, Thomas and Bassert, Joanna M. 2008 Publ. Mosby/Elsevier, Canada. \"Navicular Bone - The distal sesamoid bone of the horse. The navicular bone is located deep in the hoof behind the joint between the middle and distal phalanges.\"</ref> Navicular syndrome may be responsible for as much as 1/3 of all cases of lameness in horses, but radiographic changes in the navicular bone do not always provide a definitive diagnosis.  Newer imaging techniques have shown that damage to the soft tissues in the region may be significant contributors to lameness and that multiple causes may result in visible lameness.<ref name=\"Auburn\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bone#Terminology|Bone terminology]]\n*[[Terms for anatomical location]]\n*[[Equine forelimb anatomy]]\n{{Commons category|Navicular bone}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.embodi3d.com/files/file/80-left-navicular-bone/ 3D printable navicular bone model], free download in STL format (Embodi3D.com)\n\n{{Bones of lower extremity}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Navicular Bone}}\n[[Category:Skeletal system]]\n[[Category:Horse anatomy]]\n[[Category:Bones of the foot]]\n[[Category:Tarsal bones]]\n", "name_user": "Bogwhistle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClinical significance:Simple line editing; corrections of spacing, punctuation and syntax.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navicular_bone"}

During the same period, Kounotori 3 underwent a series of pre-docking tests to precisely align the spacecraft with the ISS.\n\nThe capture and berthing operations of HTV-3 took place on 27 July 2012. Upon reaching the communications zone, the spacecraft began to use the Proximity Operations system located in the JEM module on the ISS, to communicate with the station. Once Kounotori 3 was within about 30 feet and began station-keeping, Mission Control in Houston issued the space station crew the \"GO\" for the capture of the spacecraft with the robotic arm of the space station. That command was radioed up by CAPCOM [[Catherine Coleman]], who had performed the capture of Kounotori 2 in 2011.\n\nKounotori 3 was placed into free-drift and NASA astronaut [[Joseph Acaba]], operating the station's robot arm, captured the HTV's grapple fixture at 12:23 UTC. Then Robotic operators on the ground in Mission Control Houston (ROBO team) completed the maneuver of the HTV to the pre-berthing position at the nadir port (Earth-facing) of the space station's Harmony module. The JAXA astronaut and flight engineer of Expedition 32/[[Expedition 33|33]] Akihiko Hoshide then resumed berthing operations, moving the spacecraft into the interface for installation.

The rocket flew smoothly arching out over the [[Pacific Ocean]] on a southeasterly trajectory 51.6\u00b0 titled to the [[Equator]]. Two minutes after liftoff, the four strap-on solid rocket boosters separated from the launch vehicle and fell away in pairs as planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/h2b/htv3/launch.html|title=Japan successfully launches its freighter to space station|author=William Harwood|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=20 July 2012|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref> The second stage then ignited and continued the push Kounotori 3 to orbit.

During the same period, Kounotori 3 underwent a series of pre-docking tests to precisely align the spacecraft with the ISS.\n\nThe capture and berthing operations of HTV-3 took place on 27 July 2012. Upon reaching the communications zone, the spacecraft began to use the Proximity Operations system located in the JEM module on the ISS, to communicate with the station. Once Kounotori 3 was within about 30 feet and began station-keeping, Mission Control in Houston issued the space station crew the \"GO\" for the capture of the spacecraft with the robotic arm of the space station. That command was radioed up by CAPCOM [[Catherine Coleman]], who had performed the capture of Kounotori 2 in 2011.\n\nKounotori 3 was placed into free-drift and NASA astronaut [[Joseph Acaba]], operating the station's robot arm, captured the HTV's grapple fixture at 12:23 UTC. Then Robotic operators on the ground in Mission Control Houston (ROBO team) completed the maneuver of the HTV to the pre-berthing position at the nadir port (Earth-facing) of the space station's Harmony module. The JAXA astronaut and flight engineer of Expedition 32/[[Expedition 33|33]] Akihiko Hoshide then resumed berthing operations, moving the spacecraft into the interface for installation.

He had very long, flaming red hair down his back and always wore old Hawaiian shirts that were popular at that time. He looked like he just rolled out of bed. His appearance was a bit gruff. We affectionately called him 'Red.'

He had very long, flaming red hair down his back and always wore old Hawaiian shirts that were popular at that time. He looked like he just rolled out of bed. His appearance was a bit gruff. We affectionately called him 'Red.' He was always in very deep thought and a bit uptight too, like he was getting ready to explode, but always a very nice guy.\"<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>In the late 1970s, the Saloon, the oldest running saloon in San Francisco,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfblues.net/Saloon.html|title=San Francisco Blues on SFBlues.net: The Saloon|website=www.sfblues.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> became a local hub for blues.<ref name=\":9\" /> The owner at the time, Tommy Browne, decided to offer live music shows on weekends.
