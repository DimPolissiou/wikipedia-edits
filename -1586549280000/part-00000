The game, which is a direct sequel to the Japan-exclusive [[Nintendo DS]] title ''[[Tomodachi Collection]]'', was released in Japan in April 2013, June 2014 worldwide and July 2014 in South Korea. The game received positive reviews and good sales records. Many reviewers praised the gameplay but criticised the minigames.

The building holds up to 100 Miis (or more depending on the date of the release of your copy).\n\n[[File:TomodachiLifeGameplayHusbandwifebaby.jpg|thumb|The player visits a married couple's house, where they can be seen playing with their baby.]]\n\nThe player can import Miis from the system's Mii Maker, other devices or QR codes or create them from scratch using the 3DS's camera or the in-game Mii Maker. The Miis are voiced by a [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech software]] and have unique personalities. Miis can then perform various actions, such as eating, trying on different outfits, falling in love with each other, and engaging in many leisure activities. As more Miis are added to the island, many strange and curious interactions can occur between them, such as friendship, romance, rivalry, romantic relationships and families.  As the game goes by, the player unlocks more stores, clothes, food, and places for the Miis to play. They can even unlock a port, where they can give and \"trade\" goods with other islands.\n\n== Development ==\nIn May 2014, a playable demo of the game was distributed to Platinum members of [[Club Nintendo]] in North America, the data of which could be transferred to the final version to unlock a bonus in-game item.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/club_nintendo_distributing_tomodachi_life_demo_codes_to_select_platinum_members |title=Club Nintendo Distributing Tomodachi Life Demo Codes to Select Platinum Members - 3DS News @ Nintendo Life |publisher=Nintendolife.com |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref> The game is bundled with two [[Nintendo eShop]] download codes for a 'Welcome version' demo, which can be given to friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2014/05/21/tomodachi-life-comes-2-free-demos-give-friends |title=Tomodachi Life Comes With 2 Free Demos to Give to Friends |last=MacDonald |first=Keza |publisher=Kotaku UK |date=May 21, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref> A slightly different demo version was later publicly released for download via the Nintendo eShop.

Most are serious pests of [[conifer]]s, such as [[spruce]]. There are nearly forty ''Choristoneura'' species, and even more subspecies, or forms, with a complexity of variation among populations found throughout much of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and about again this number in [[Eurasia]]. In Eastern North America, ''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'' is prevalent, while in Western North America ''[[Choristoneura freemani]]'' has devastated large areas.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first recorded outbreak of the (eastern) spruce budworm in the United States occurred in [[Maine]] in about 1807, although it seems to have escaped notice of the [[entomologists]] until 1865. Another outbreak followed in 1878. Since 1909 there have been waves of budworm outbreaks throughout the eastern United States and Canada.  Longer-term tree-ring studies suggest that spruce budworm outbreaks have been recurring approximately every three decades since the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacLean|first=David A.|title=Effects of Spruce Budworm Outbreaks on the Productivity and Stability of Balsam Fir Forests|journal=The Forestry Chronicle|volume=60|issue=5|pages=273\u2013279|doi=10.5558/tfc60273-5|year=1984}}</ref>\n\nThe first recorded outbreak of the western variety, which was in 2008 from ''occidentalis'' rechristened ''freemani'', occurred in 1909 on the southeastern part of [[Vancouver Island]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada. Since that year, infestations have frequently been reported in western Canada. The budworm was first recorded in 1914 in the United States, in [[Oregon]]. However, it was not initially recognized as a serious threat to coniferous forests in the western U.S.<ref name = Fellin>Fellin, D. and J. Dewey (March 1992).

The infestation collapsed from natural causes within five years. Estimates of the spruce mortality were on the order of 100,000 [[Cord measure|cords]], of which 60% was recovered because the valuable wood is left untouched by the insect and can be harvested profitably. The budworm eats only the needles, which have no economic value apart from being part of the mechanism for survival and growth.<ref name=ai/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[Fenitrothion]] had been developed to replace DDT, whose adverse health and environmental effects were already noted.<ref name=ai/>\n\nBy winter 1975, medical staff at the [[IWK Health Centre|Killam Hospital for Children]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] remarked that every child with a diagnosis of [[Reye's syndrome]] was a New Brunswicker, and later proved a link between the syndrome and the emulsifier used to apply the Fenitrothion.

In 2018, they proposed a proactive intervention strategy, which employs aerial sprays of [[tebufenozide]] (a [[molting hormone]], and agonist of the [[ecdysone receptor]]) and [[bacillus thuringiensis]] (soil-dwelling [[bacterium]] used as a [[biological pesticide]]), to the politicians.<ref name=cch>[http://m.thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1548182-early-intervention-research-is-key-for-possible-spruce-budworm-outbreak \"Early intervention research is key for possible spruce budworm outbreak\"], 23 Feb 2018</ref> In fact, they received $74.75 million over five years, to be made available on a 60-40 federal to provincial and industry cost-sharing basis.

During prolonged outbreaks when stands become heavily defoliated, starvation can be an important mortality factor in regulating populations.\n\nThis species is a favoured food of the [[Cape May warbler]], which is therefore closely associated with its host plant, [[balsam fir]]. This [[bird]], and the [[Tennessee warbler|Tennessee]] and [[bay-breasted warbler]]s, which also have a preference for budworm, lay more eggs and are more numerous in years of budworm abundance.\n\nNatural enemies are probably responsible for considerable mortality when budworm populations are low, but seldom have a regulating influence when populations are in epidemic proportions.\n\nChemical [[insecticide]]s such as [[malathion]], [[carbaryl]], and [[acephate]] can substantially reduce budworm. Microbial insecticides such as bacterium species ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''(Bt), a naturally occurring, host-specific [[pathogen]] that affects specific insect [[larvae]] based on the bacteria strain. Bt insecticides are often used in sensitive areas such as campgrounds or along rivers and streams, where it may not be desirable to use chemical insecticides with modes of action that affect [[fish]] and [[mammals]].\n\nThe [[Choristoneura fumiferana|eastern spruce budworm]] is one of the most destructive insects of fir and spruce forests throughout Canada and the eastern United States.<ref name=\"Powell\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520097964|title=Out Of Print : Biosystematic Studies of Conifer-Feeding Choristoneura (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in the Western United States : Edited by Jerry A.

Most are serious pests of [[conifer]]s, such as [[spruce]]. There are nearly forty ''Choristoneura'' species, and even more subspecies, or forms, with a complexity of variation among populations found throughout much of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and about again this number in [[Eurasia]]. In Eastern North America, ''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'' is prevalent, while in Western North America ''[[Choristoneura freemani]]'' has devastated large areas.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first recorded outbreak of the (eastern) spruce budworm in the United States occurred in [[Maine]] in about 1807, although it seems to have escaped notice of the [[entomologists]] until 1865. Another outbreak followed in 1878. Since 1909 there have been waves of budworm outbreaks throughout the eastern United States and Canada.  Longer-term tree-ring studies suggest that spruce budworm outbreaks have been recurring approximately every three decades since the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacLean|first=David A.|title=Effects of Spruce Budworm Outbreaks on the Productivity and Stability of Balsam Fir Forests|journal=The Forestry Chronicle|volume=60|issue=5|pages=273\u2013279|doi=10.5558/tfc60273-5|year=1984}}</ref>\n\nThe first recorded outbreak of the western variety, which was in 2008 from ''occidentalis'' rechristened ''freemani'', occurred in 1909 on the southeastern part of [[Vancouver Island]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada. Since that year, infestations have frequently been reported in western Canada. The budworm was first recorded in 1914 in the United States, in [[Oregon]]. However, it was not initially recognized as a serious threat to coniferous forests in the western U.S.<ref name = Fellin>Fellin, D. and J. Dewey (March 1992).

The infestation collapsed from natural causes within five years. Estimates of the spruce mortality were on the order of 100,000 [[Cord measure|cords]], of which 60% was recovered because the valuable wood is left untouched by the insect and can be harvested profitably. The budworm eats only the needles, which have no economic value apart from being part of the mechanism for survival and growth.<ref name=ai/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[Fenitrothion]] had been developed to replace DDT, whose adverse health and environmental effects were already noted.<ref name=ai/>\n\nBy winter 1975, medical staff at the [[IWK Health Centre|Killam Hospital for Children]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] remarked that every child with a diagnosis of [[Reye's syndrome]] was a New Brunswicker, and later proved a link between the syndrome and the emulsifier used to apply the Fenitrothion. As a consequence of the furore surrounding the discovery of the Reye's syndrome link with pesticides, in 1976 the Nova Scotia Minister of Health, [[Allan Sullivan]], cancelled a pesticide spraying programme that had only recently been approved by Cabinet.<ref name=kr>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19345558 Kramer MS: ''Kids versus trees: Reye's syndrome and spraying for spruce budworm in New Brunswick''] J Clin Epidemiol. 2009 Jun;62(6):578-81. doi: 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.01.002.

In 2018, they proposed a proactive intervention strategy, which employs aerial sprays of [[tebufenozide]] (a [[molting hormone]], and agonist of the [[ecdysone receptor]]) and [[bacillus thuringiensis]] (soil-dwelling [[bacterium]] used as a [[biological pesticide]]), to the politicians.<ref name=cch>[http://m.thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1548182-early-intervention-research-is-key-for-possible-spruce-budworm-outbreak \"Early intervention research is key for possible spruce budworm outbreak\"], 23 Feb 2018</ref> In fact, they received $74.75 million over five years, to be made available on a 60-40 federal to provincial and industry cost-sharing basis.

During prolonged outbreaks when stands become heavily defoliated, starvation can be an important mortality factor in regulating populations.\n\nThis species is a favoured food of the [[Cape May warbler]], which is therefore closely associated with its host plant, [[balsam fir]]. This [[bird]], and the [[Tennessee warbler|Tennessee]] and [[bay-breasted warbler]]s, which also have a preference for budworm, lay more eggs and are more numerous in years of budworm abundance.\n\nNatural enemies are probably responsible for considerable mortality when budworm populations are low, but seldom have a regulating influence when populations are in epidemic proportions.\n\nChemical [[insecticide]]s such as [[malathion]], [[carbaryl]], and [[acephate]] can substantially reduce budworm. Microbial insecticides such as bacterium species ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''(Bt), a naturally occurring, host-specific [[pathogen]] that affects specific insect [[larvae]] based on the bacteria strain. Bt insecticides are often used in sensitive areas such as campgrounds or along rivers and streams, where it may not be desirable to use chemical insecticides with modes of action that affect [[fish]] and [[mammals]].\n\nThe [[Choristoneura fumiferana|eastern spruce budworm]] is one of the most destructive insects of fir and spruce forests throughout Canada and the eastern United States.<ref name=\"Powell\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520097964|title=Out Of Print : Biosystematic Studies of Conifer-Feeding Choristoneura (Lepidoptera Tortricidae) in the Western United States : Edited by Jerry A.
