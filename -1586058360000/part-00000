Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures.

He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants.

While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.\n\n===Bentina Beakley===\n'''Mrs. Bentina Beakley''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]] in the 1987 series and ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]''; [[Wendee Lee]] in ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Toks Olagundoye]] in the 2017 series) is the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] and [[nanny]] of the household, and the maternal grandmother of Webby. Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle.

She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews. In \"Whatever Happened to Donald Duck?!\", it's revealed that his anger was rooted in a fear that the world was out to get him and that no one could understand him.

He is a self-made billionaire who left Scotland in his youth and came to America with his [[Number One Dime]], eventually establishing his home in McDuck Manor and erecting his famous [[Money Bin]].<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /> He sports a blue jacket with red cuffs and a red collar. [[Pat Fraley]] provided the voice for the younger Scrooge in flashback episode \"Once Upon a Dime\".<ref name=\"Once Upon a Dime\" /><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Scrooge's Scottish background, the Money Bin, and the Number One Dime remains the same, but he is well known as a seasoned \"adventure capitalist\" and [[CEO]] of McDuck Enterprises here. Born in Scotland in the mid-19th century and getting rich during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the 1890s, his decreased aging has been explained by him spending time \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\".<ref name=\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\" /> In his younger days he used to conduct adventures with his nephew Donald and niece Della joining him.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> However, Della's disappearance led to Donald cutting off his relationship with Scrooge, and Scrooge losing the spark for adventure.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /><ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> Ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, Scrooge regains his energy when he is reunited with Donald and introduced to his grandnephews for the first time.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> The reboot sees him wearing a red jacket with visible pockets and black cuffs, spats, and collar, as per his comic book appearance.<br>According to Frank Angones, several lines involving Scrooge using Scottish slang or dialogue are improvised by Tennant, who is also Scottish, in order to provide an accurate depiction of Scottish people.<ref name=\"Improvisation\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415806723293184 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref><ref name=\"CulturalDepiction\">[https://twitter.com/FrankAngones/status/1203415809113985024 Frank Angones' Twitter]</ref>\n\n===Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck===\n'''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]], respectively, in the 2017 series) are the nephews of Donald Duck through his sister Della, friends of [[Webbigail Vanderquack|Webby]], and the great-nephews (great-grandnephews in the 2017 series) of Scrooge. They were originally created for the comics by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]] in 1937.\n\nIn the 1987 series, the triplets are sent to Scrooge to stay with him, while Donald leaves to join the navy.<ref name=\"Don't Give Up the Ship\" /> All three tend to be playful and mischievous, while also being devoted members of the [[Junior Woodchucks]] scouts. They are identical in appearance and personality, and wear identical outfits \u2013 a cap and jumper \u2013 with the only difference between each of them being the color of their clothing: Huey wears red, Dewey wears blue, and Louie wears green. The introduction of this scheme by ''DuckTales'' was adapted for later use in future animations that featured the triplets. [[Avery Schreiber]] provided the voice for the adult Huey, Dewey and Louie in a possible future scenario in the episode \"Duck to the Future\".<ref name=\"Duck to the Future\">{{cite episode|title=Duck to the Future|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-01|season=1|number=52}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, Huey (short for Hubert), Dewey (Dewford), and Louie (Llewellyn) are depicted as slightly older, and given distinct appearances, voices and personalities \u2013 Huey is the eldest of the triplets by three seconds and the smartest of the group, a devoted Junior Woodchuck wearing a red short-sleeved shirt and cap; Dewey, wearing a blue long-sleeved T-shirt, is both the most adventurous and the most sensitive of the siblings, as well as the one most eager to find out whatever happened to their mother Della; and Louie, dressed in a green hoodie, is the youngest of the trio, the most money-obsessed and laid-back brother, jokingly described as the \"[[evil twin|evil triplet]]\". Although all three are mischievous and sneaky around Donald, they are wide-eyed admirers of Scrooge's fortune and the legends of his adventures. Initially, the trio are sent to stay with Scrooge while Donald attends a job interview during the premiere episode,<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> but after renewing Scrooge's spirit for adventure (and Dewey accidentally wrecking their houseboat), Donald and the nephews move into McDuck Manor and accompany him on his new adventures. Della had initially wanted to name her sons \"Jet, Turbo, and Rebel\", respectively; but Donald came up with their current names in her absence.<ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\"/>\n\n===Webby Vanderquack===\n'''Webbigail''' \"'''Webby'''\" '''Vanderquack''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in the 1987 series, ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Kate Micucci]] in the 2017 series) is the granddaughter of Mrs. Beakley and friend of [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]]. \n\nIn the 1987 series, she visually resembles [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]] from the Disney comics.

He is an able flyer, but is somewhat incompetent and rarely ever lands a plane safely, usually crashing them and walking away without injury.\n\nIn the 1987 series, he uses the motto \"If it has wings, I can crash it\". He is introduced in the third part of the pilot episode,<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> but has been Scrooge's pilot since his early youth.<ref name=\"Launchpad's First Crash\" /> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and his ancestor Rhubarb McQuack played an important role in the American Civil War,<ref name=\"Launchpad's Civil War\">{{cite episode|title=Launchpad's Civil War|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-20|season=1|number=27}}</ref> and prior to the series Launchpad used to perform with his parents and sister as the stunt pilot team \"The Flying McQuacks\".<ref name=\"Top Duck\" /> Aside from being a pilot, he is also a Junior Woodchuck scout leader.<ref name=\"Superdoo\" /><ref name=\"Merit-Time Adventure\" /> His physical appearance is somewhat heroic, with his clothing being similar to that of early era pilots, including a leather cap with flight goggles, an aviation scarf, and a brown flight jacket with light brown pants. The character later crossed over as [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#Launchpad McQuack|a main character]] in Disney's ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.\n\nIn the 2017 series, Launchpad initially works for Scrooge as his limo driver, before being placed in charge of piloting various craft including the airplane \"The Sunchaser\", which becomes his signature vehicle. While his physical appearance is the same as his 1987 counterpart, he wears an outfit resembling that of private commercial pilots from the 40s/50s, including a baseball cap, a bomber jacket with a fur lined collar, a green undershirt, and white slacks. The goofy aspects of the character have been enhanced, often giving Launchpad the role of a comic relief.  Like his 1987 incarnation, Launchpad is a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] scout leader.<ref name=\"Day of the Only Child!\" /><ref name=\"Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\"/> He is also an avid fan of the ''Darkwing Duck'' show-within-a-show (an allusion to his role in the original ''Darkwing Duck'' series), as evidenced by a bobblehead and a series of video tapes he owns as well as his watching the show with the family.\n\n===Bentina Beakley===\n'''Mrs. Bentina Beakley''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]] in the 1987 series and ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp|DuckTales the Movie]]''; [[Wendee Lee]] in ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''; [[Toks Olagundoye]] in the 2017 series) is the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] and [[nanny]] of the household, and the maternal grandmother of Webby. Like her granddaughter, Beakley is an original ''DuckTales'' character.\n\nIn the 1987 series, she is shown as a gentle woman of upper middle age, sweet on her granddaughter, and typically wearing a purple dress and large white apron over her front and having two hair pins to maintain her hairstyle. She is hired by Scrooge as a nanny for the nephews in the third part of the pilot episode, not asking for any payment other than a shelter for herself and Webby.<ref name=\"Three Ducks of the Condor\" /> She has been in the line of work for a long time, and used to take care of the young Prince Greydrake,<ref name=\"Jungle Duck\">{{cite episode|title=Jungle Duck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-25|season=1|number=53}}</ref> and she has proven to be a capable opera singer.<ref name=\"Maid of the Myth\" />\n\nIn the 2017 series, her character is more down-to-earth than the other residents of McDuck Manor, often offering advice to Scrooge and the ducklings. She is much more resourceful than the 1987 version, and has worked for Scrooge for years prior to the series' start. Her backstory includes a career as an agent for the secret espionage organization [[List of Darkwing Duck characters#S.H.U.S.H.|S.H.U.S.H.]], where her codename was \"Agent 22\" and through which she first met Scrooge.<ref name=\"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\" /> Though her physical appearance is similar to her 1987 counterpart, with clothing similar to a nanny, and an apron around her waist, she takes offense at being treated as her employer's secretary, and has proven to possess impressive strength.<ref name=\"The Great Dime Chase!\" /> Her nationality has also been changed to British.

In the reboot, he, Della, and Scrooge used to adventure together, until Della's disappearance caused Donald to cut off contact with Scrooge; not speaking to him for the next decade and raising Della's children in her absence.<ref name=\"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\" /> However, ten years later, as seen in the pilot episode, when Donald discovers his nephews' plan to be alone to cause some mischief with their houseboat, he reluctantly reunites with Scrooge in order to get him to babysit the boys.<ref name=\"Woo-oo!\" /> After a mishap leads him to becoming involved in a new adventure with Scrooge (and losing his houseboat), Donald agrees to move his family to McDuck Manor while still trying to maintain his independence. In addition to increasing his appearance, the reboot also sees him wearing the black sailor suit that he wears in many of the comics upon which the show is based. Like in the comics, Donald's main character traits are his bad luck and short temper, while he's also struggling to be a good parent figure to his nephews. In \"Whatever Happened to Donald Duck?!\", it's revealed that his anger was rooted in a fear that the world was out to get him and that no one could understand him.

He is portrayed as a French teenage student who has been homeschooled for most of his life and is also a model for his father, [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel Agreste]], a famous [[fashion designer]] with whom Adrien has a distant relationship. After passing the test of [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Master Fu|Master Fu]], who is later revealed as the keeper of the magical objects called the Miraculouses, by helping him, Adrien is chosen as one of the two soon-to-be [[superhero]]es alongside [[Ladybug (Miraculous)|Ladybug]], for whom he quickly develops feelings and whose secret civilian identity is [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]. Consequently, Adrien receives a ring named the Cat Miraculous, which when worn grants him the ability to transform into his superhero alias, '''Cat Noir''' ({{lang-fr|text=Chat Noir|translation=Black Cat|links=no}}). Cat Noir and Ladybug's aim is to protect [[Paris]] from the villain [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]]. Every Miraculous is accompanied by a small magical creature known as a [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Kwamis|kwami]], with Adrien's kwami being [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Plagg|Plagg]], a black cat-like being. As Cat Noir, Adrien's signature ability is destruction. Adrien appears in most ''Miraculous'' media, including the main series, the comic books, and the mobile [[running game]].\n\nAdrien was conceptualized as a character who would appeal to everyone, having many good characteristics and being able to inspire the viewers. Regarding Adrien's superhero identity, since Ladybug's power was connected to good luck, Astruc concluded that her partner would have powers related to bad luck, which resulted in him thinking of a black cat. Cat Noir was also inspired by the comic book superhero [[Catwoman]]. Adrien is [[Voice acting|voiced]] by [[Bryce Papenbrook]] in the English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]], while Benjamin Bollen voices him in the show's French version.\n\nCritical reception of Adrien has been generally positive, with writers describing him as a great, interesting, and relatable character. His relationship with Marinette has been praised, both when they are depicted as civilians and as superheroes. Adrien has served as inspiration for [[cosplay]]s. Merchandise inspired by him has been produced, such as action figures, accessories, and clothing items.\n\n==Development==\n==={{anchor|Conception and creation}}Concept and creation===\n[[File:Adrien_Agreste_as_Cat_Noir.png|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Adrien Agreste under his [[superhero]] identity, Cat Noir.

male [[protagonist]] of the animated television series ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir]]'' created by Thomas Astruc. He is portrayed as a French teenage student who has been homeschooled for most of his life and is also a model for his father, [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Gabriel Agreste|Gabriel Agreste]], a famous [[fashion designer]] with whom Adrien has a distant relationship. After passing the test of [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Master Fu|Master Fu]], who is later revealed as the keeper of the magical objects called the Miraculouses, by helping him, Adrien is chosen as one of the two soon-to-be [[superhero]]es alongside [[Ladybug (Miraculous)|Ladybug]], for whom he quickly develops feelings and whose secret civilian identity is [[Marinette Dupain-Cheng]]. Consequently, Adrien receives a ring named the Cat Miraculous, which when worn grants him the ability to transform into his superhero alias, '''Cat Noir''' ({{lang-fr|text=Chat Noir|translation=Black Cat|links=no}}). Cat Noir and Ladybug's aim is to protect [[Paris]] from the villain [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Gabriel Agreste|Hawk Moth]]. Every Miraculous is accompanied by a small magical creature known as a [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Kwamis|kwami]], with Adrien's kwami being [[List of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters#Plagg|Plagg]], a black cat-like being. As Cat Noir, Adrien's signature ability is destruction. Adrien appears in most ''Miraculous'' media, including the main series, the comic books, and the mobile [[running game]].\n\nAdrien was conceptualized as a character who would appeal to everyone, having many good characteristics and being able to inspire the viewers. Regarding Adrien's superhero identity, since Ladybug's power was connected to good luck, Astruc concluded that her partner would have powers related to bad luck, which resulted in him thinking of a black cat. Cat Noir was also inspired by the comic book superhero [[Catwoman]]. Adrien is [[Voice acting|voiced]] by [[Bryce Papenbrook]] in the English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]], while Benjamin Bollen voices him in the show's French version.\n\nCritical reception of Adrien has been generally positive, with writers describing him as a great, interesting, and relatable character. His relationship with Marinette has been praised, both when they are depicted as civilians and as superheroes. Adrien has served as inspiration for [[cosplay]]s. Merchandise inspired by him has been produced, such as action figures, accessories, and clothing items.\n\n==Development==\n==={{anchor|Conception and creation}}Concept and creation===\n[[File:Adrien_Agreste_as_Cat_Noir.png|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Adrien Agreste under his [[superhero]] identity, Cat Noir.
