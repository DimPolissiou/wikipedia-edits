The uniqueness of this temple is that this is the only temple of Shri Vishnu all over India having Shri Vishnu\u2019s name as [https://solapur.gov.in/en/gallery/barshi/ BHAGAVANT].{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe temple was built in 1245 A.D. in Hemadpanthi style. There are four entries to the temple from all the four directions, but the main entry is east-facing.\n\nThere is one GARUDKHAMB in front of Garbhagraha. The idol of main deity Shri Bhagvant is in black stone having SHANKH, CHAKRA andGADA is in the hands and picture of devotee king Ambrish below the right hand. Shri Laxmi is on the back of Bhagvant idol. Shivlinga is there on the forehead and marks of Footsteps of Bhrigu Rishi on the chest of the deity.\n\nThere are old records showing the grants released by Shri Nanasaheb Peshve in the year 1760, by East India Company in 1823 and by British Government in 1784.\n\nThe temple management is looked after by a Panch Committee. Badves carry out the work of daily rituals of the temple. The daily rituals include Kakada Arti, Nitya Puja, Mahapuja in the morning, Dhuparti in the evening and Shejarti in the\nnight.\n\nA large number of devotees visit during the Chaitri, Maghi, Aashadi & kartiki (Hindu Months) [[Ekadashi]].\n\nDuring the Aashadi & Kartiki Ekadashi a large procession is taken out covering the town with Bhagvant riding on Garuda. A CHABINA is taken out on every full moon day.\n\nRitual at Sri Bhagawanta Mandir:\n\nEvery morning at five Lord Bhagawanta is woken up with the Kakad arati adorations to the accompaniment of the sound of the cymbals.  Several devotees, both men and women, attend these morning devotions. They bring the offerings of sugar, fruits, milk, curds and butter.  The traditional honour of the Kakad of Bhagawant Mandir is with Sri Dattatreya Krishnath Patil. The priest is particular about continuing this convention. It was Sri Bhaurao Tatya Patil who took up the onus of Bhagawant Kakad way back, a tradition that has been passed down the generations.\n\nAt the time of Kakad arati, the Lord is first adored with ghee lamps and then the priest changes the cloak and offerings of fruits and sugar are made.  The lotus feet of the Lord are washed with warm water. Incense is waved, milk offered in silver vessels and then a pancharati performed. After this Sri Ganapati and Varun are worshipped with blowing of conch. The priest puts a blob of butter in Lord\u2019s mouth. Then He is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, sugar and honey. Lord Bhagawanta is given a bath with water showered out of His silver pail.  This water is considered equal in merit to Bhagirathi and sprinkled upon the devotees assembled. After this follows the karpur arati and hymns and praises are sung by the devotees.  After the Lord has bathed and put on new clothes, He is given an offering of khichadi. This is being taken care of by the local business community\u2014 Sri Nanasaheb Budukh and Sri Balasaheb Kokate are looking at this aspect presently.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Brahmins of town, Deshpande, Budukh, Joshi, Patil, Deshmukh etc. provide the naivedya/repast for Lord Bhagawanta. The priests bring this from the homes of the respective families.  Many are the offerings made on occasions such as Gudi Padva, Dasera, Diwali etc.\n\n==Educational institutes==\nThe city is well known in the region for its state of the art educational institutions and nearby districts and tehsils depends upon these educational facilities.\nMajor Pre Schools -\n1 Shishuvihar Barshi.\n\nMajor Primary Schools -\n\n1.

It covers an area of {{convert|46|km2|}} and is now governed under the Maharashtra Municipalities Act, 1965. The municipal council is composed of thirty-three members with three seats being reserved for women and two for [[scheduled caste]]s. The municipal council has six committees: the standing committee, the public works committee, the education committee, the sanitation, medical and public health committee, the water-supply and drainage committee and the planning and development committee to look after the various aspects of municipal administration. The Chief Officer is the executive head of the municipality and is assisted by the Health Officer, the Municipal Engineer, the Octroi Superintendent, the Internal Auditor and the Chief Accountant and other ministerial staff.\n\nFor public convenience the municipality maintains two vegetable markets, one mutton market and one fish market. The open-air theatre-cum-mangal Karyalaya has been constructed at a cost of about Rs. 67,000. The municipality conducts one hospital and an ayurvedic dispensary. The veterinary dispensary is managed by the Zilla Parishad. Primary education has been made compulsory in the town and is conducted by the municipal school board. The municipality spends annually about Rs. 4,00,000 on primary education. The underground drainage system has not been introduced in the town as yet. There are open and covered gutters and the arrangements are made by the municipal council for the removal of night-soil. Wells and the Pathari tank form the main sources of water-supply. Pumping sets have been installed on wells within the municipal area. The municipality maintains one fire-fighter and the necessary staff. The total length of roads in the municipal limit is approximately {{convert|46|km}}, of which a length of about {{convert|16|km}} is asphalted, about {{convert|12|km}} metalled and about {{convert|18|km}} unmetalled. The cremation and burial places are maintained by the municipality.<ref>http://solapur.gov.in/htmldocs/1977/places_Barshi.html Barshi information</ref>\n\n==Bhagvant Temple==\n[[Bhagvant temple]] is dedicated to Shri [[Vishnu]]. The uniqueness of this temple is that this is the only temple of Shri Vishnu all over India having Shri Vishnu\u2019s name as [https://solapur.gov.in/en/gallery/barshi/ BHAGAVANT].{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe temple was built in 1245 A.D. in Hemadpanthi style. There are four entries to the temple from all the four directions, but the main entry is east-facing.\n\nThere is one GARUDKHAMB in front of Garbhagraha. The idol of main deity Shri Bhagvant is in black stone having SHANKH, CHAKRA andGADA is in the hands and picture of devotee king Ambrish below the right hand. Shri Laxmi is on the back of Bhagvant idol. Shivlinga is there on the forehead and marks of Footsteps of Bhrigu Rishi on the chest of the deity.\n\nThere are old records showing the grants released by Shri Nanasaheb Peshve in the year 1760, by East India Company in 1823 and by British Government in 1784.\n\nThe temple management is looked after by a Panch Committee. Badves carry out the work of daily rituals of the temple. The daily rituals include Kakada Arti, Nitya Puja, Mahapuja in the morning, Dhuparti in the evening and Shejarti in the\nnight.\n\nA large number of devotees visit during the Chaitri, Maghi, Aashadi & kartiki (Hindu Months) [[Ekadashi]].\n\nDuring the Aashadi & Kartiki Ekadashi a large procession is taken out covering the town with Bhagvant riding on Garuda. A CHABINA is taken out on every full moon day.\n\nRitual at Sri Bhagawanta Mandir:\n\nEvery morning at five Lord Bhagawanta is woken up with the Kakad arati adorations to the accompaniment of the sound of the cymbals.  Several devotees, both men and women, attend these morning devotions. They bring the offerings of sugar, fruits, milk, curds and butter.  The traditional honour of the Kakad of Bhagawant Mandir is with Sri Dattatreya Krishnath Patil. The priest is particular about continuing this convention. It was Sri Bhaurao Tatya Patil who took up the onus of Bhagawant Kakad way back, a tradition that has been passed down the generations.\n\nAt the time of Kakad arati, the Lord is first adored with ghee lamps and then the priest changes the cloak and offerings of fruits and sugar are made.  The lotus feet of the Lord are washed with warm water. Incense is waved, milk offered in silver vessels and then a pancharati performed. After this Sri Ganapati and Varun are worshipped with blowing of conch. The priest puts a blob of butter in Lord\u2019s mouth. Then He is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, sugar and honey. Lord Bhagawanta is given a bath with water showered out of His silver pail.  This water is considered equal in merit to Bhagirathi and sprinkled upon the devotees assembled. After this follows the karpur arati and hymns and praises are sung by the devotees.  After the Lord has bathed and put on new clothes, He is given an offering of khichadi. This is being taken care of by the local business community\u2014 Sri Nanasaheb Budukh and Sri Balasaheb Kokate are looking at this aspect presently.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Brahmins of town, Deshpande, Budukh, Joshi, Patil, Deshmukh etc. provide the naivedya/repast for Lord Bhagawanta. The priests bring this from the homes of the respective families.  Many are the offerings made on occasions such as Gudi Padva, Dasera, Diwali etc.\n\n==Educational institutes==\nThe city is well known in the region for its state of the art educational institutions and nearby districts and tehsils depends upon these educational facilities.\nMajor Pre Schools -\n1 Shishuvihar Barshi.\n\nMajor Primary Schools -\n\n1.

Photographers sometimes deliberately use a [[shallow focus]] technique to create images with prominent out-of-focus regions.\n\nBokeh is often most visible around small background [[Point source#Light|highlights]], such as [[specular reflection]]s and [[list of light sources|light sources]], which is why it is often associated with such areas.<ref name=davis/> However, bokeh is not limited to highlights; blur occurs in all out-of-focus regions of the image.\n\n==Origin==\nThe term comes from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word ''boke'' ({{Nihongo2|\u6688\u3051}} or {{Nihongo2|\u30dc\u30b1}}), which means [[wikt:bokeh|\"blur\"]] or \"haze\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://photographytalking.com/2020/03/06/bokeh/ | title = photographytalking: bokeh entry}}</ref>, or ''boke-aji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u30dc\u30b1\u5473}}), the \"blur quality\". This is derived as a noun form of the verb ''bokeru'' (which is written in several ways<ref name=\"wwwjdic-bokeru\">{{cite web | url = https://www.edrdg.org/cgi-bin/wwwjdic/wwwjdic?1MDJ%CA%F2%A4%B1%A4%EB | title = wwwjdic: bokeru entry}}</ref>, with additional meanings and nuances: {{Nihongo2|\u6688\u3051\u308b}} refers to being blurry, hazy or out-of-focus, whereas the {{Nihongo2|\u60da\u3051\u308b}} and {{Nihongo2|\u5446\u3051\u308b}} spellings refer to being mentally hazy, befuddled, childish, senile, or playing stupid. ''Jisaboke'' ({{Nihongo2|\u6642\u5dee\u30dc\u30b1}})<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.edrdg.org/cgi-bin/wwwjdic/wwwjdic?1MDJ%BB%FE%BA%B9%A5%DC%A5%B1 | title = wwwjdic: jisaboke entry}}</ref> (literally, \"time difference haze\") is the term for jet lag.  ''Nebokeru'' ({{Nihongo2|\u5bdd\u307c\u3051\u308b}}<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.edrdg.org/cgi-bin/wwwjdic/wwwjdic?1MDJ%A4%CD%A4%DC%A4%B1%A4%EB | title = wwwjdic: nebokeru entry}}</ref> is a verb denoting the actions or condition of someone who is half-asleep, or nodding off. ''Tobokeru''<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.edrdg.org/cgi-bin/wwwjdic/wwwjdic?1MDJ%A4%C8%A4%DC%A4%B1%A4%EB | title = wwwjdic: tobokeru entry}}</ref> means playing dumb, and ''toboketa kao'' refers to a poker face. The related verb ''h\u014dkeru'' shares spelling with these and has the same meanings; in addition, that form acts as compound verb suffix, indicating that the subject is absorbed into the action denoted by the main verb: for instance, ''asobih\u014dkeru'' ({{Nihongo2|\u904a\u3073\u5446\u3051\u308b}})<ref>{{cite web | url = https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E6%83%9A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B_%28%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%29 | title = Goo Jisho: h\u014dkeru entry, example in sense 3}}</ref>, combining ''asobu'' and ''h\u014dkeru'', expresses being absorbed in play. The related term [[bokashi (disambiguation)|bokashi]] ({{Nihongo2|\u6688\u304b\u3057}}) means intentional blurring or gradation; that is a noun form of the transitive verb ''bokasu'' {{Nihongo2|\u6688\u3059}} which means to make something blurry, rather than to be blurry.\n\nThe English spelling ''bokeh'' was popularized in 1997 in ''Photo Techniques'' magazine, when Mike Johnston, the editor at the time, commissioned three papers on the topic for the May/June 1997 issue; he altered the spelling to suggest the correct pronunciation to English speakers, saying \"it is properly pronounced with bo as in bone and ke as in Kenneth, with equal stress on either syllable\".<ref name=johnston>{{cite web\n | author = Johnston, Mike\n | date = April 4, 2004\n | url = http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/sm-04-04-04.shtml\n | title = The Sunday Morning Photographer, 2004: Bokeh in Pictures\n | publisher = luminous-landscape.com\n | accessdate = July 3, 2009\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150103180320/http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/sm-04-04-04.shtml\n | archive-date = 3 January 2015\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\nThe spellings ''bokeh'' and ''boke'' have both been in use since at least 1996, when Merklinger had suggested \"or Bokeh if you prefer.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | author = Merklinger, Harold\n | url = http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/bokeh.shtml\n | title = Understanding Boke\n | publisher = luminous-landscape.com\n | accessdate = July 3, 2009\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130409135024/http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/bokeh.shtml\n | archive-date = 9 April 2013\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\nThe term ''bokeh'' has appeared in photography books as early as 1998.<ref name=\"Gerry Kopelow 1998 118\u2013119\"/>\nIt is sometimes pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|o\u028a|k|\u0259}} (boke-uh).<ref name=\"Wes McDermott 2009 198\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CAlJgUyEs0C&pg=PA198&dq=bokeh+boke-uh&num=20#v=onepage&q=bokeh%20boke-uh&f=false|title=Real World Modo: The Authorized Guide: In the Trenches with Modo|author=Wes McDermott|publisher=Focal Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-240-81199-4|page=198}}</ref>\n\n==Bokeh and lens design==\n[[Image:Circles of confusion lens diagram.svg|thumb|right|280px|The [[depth of field]] is the region where the size of the [[circle of confusion]] is less than the resolution of the human eye.]]\nThough difficult to quantify, some lenses have subjectively more pleasing out-of-focus areas. \"Good\" bokeh is especially important for [[macro lens]]es and long [[telephoto lens]]es, because they are typically used in situations that produce shallow [[depth of field]]. Good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses (typically 85\u2013150 mm on 35 mm format). When used in portrait photography (for their \"natural\" perspective), the photographer usually wants a shallow depth of field, so that the subject stands out sharply against a blurred background.\n\nBokeh characteristics may be quantified by examining the image's [[circle of confusion]]. In out-of-focus areas, each point of light becomes an image of the aperture, generally a more or less round disc. Depending on how a lens is corrected for [[spherical aberration]], the disc may be uniformly illuminated, brighter near the edge, or brighter near the center. A well-known lens that exhibited the latter \"soap-bubble\" characteristic was that produced by Hugo Meyer & Co., more recently revived by [[Meyer Optik G\u00f6rlitz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meyer-optik-goerlitz.com/how-to-create-soap-bubble-bokeh/|author=Blog|title=How to Create Soap Bubble Bokeh}}</ref>\n\nLenses that are poorly corrected for spherical aberration will show one kind of disc for out-of-focus points in front of the plane of focus, and a different kind for points behind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/understanding-bokeh/|author=Todd Vorenkamp|title=Understanding Bokeh}}</ref> This may actually be desirable, as blur circles that are dimmer near the edges produce less-defined shapes which blend smoothly with the surrounding image.\nThe shape of the aperture has an influence on the subjective quality of bokeh as well. For conventional lens designs (with bladed apertures), when a lens is stopped down smaller than its maximum [[aperture]] size (minimum [[f-number]]), out-of-focus points are blurred into the [[polygon]]al shape formed by the aperture blades. This is most apparent when a lens produces hard-edged bokeh. For this reason, some lenses have many aperture blades and/or blades with curved edges to make the aperture more closely approximate a circle rather than a polygon. Minolta has been on the forefront of promoting and introducing lenses with near-ideal circular apertures since 1987, but most other manufacturers now offer lenses with shape-optimized diaphragms, at least for the domain of portraiture photography. In contrast, a [[Catadioptric system|catadioptric]] [[telephoto lens]] renders bokehs resembling doughnuts, because its [[secondary mirror]] blocks the central part of the aperture opening. Recently, photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars, that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be, and placing it over the lens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diyphotography.net/diy_create_your_own_bokeh|author=Karsten Stroemvig|title=DIY \u2014 Create your own Bokeh}}</ref>\n\nLenses with 11, 12, or 15 blade iris diaphragms are often claimed to excel in bokeh quality. Because of this, the lenses do not need to reach wide apertures to get better circles (instead of polygons). In the past, wide aperture lenses (f/2, f/2.8) were very expensive, due to the complex mathematical design and manufacturing know-how required, at a time when all computations and glass making were done by hand. Leica could reach a good bokeh at f/4.5. Today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens, and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh.\n\nSome lens manufacturers including [[Nikon]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-nikon.com/en_GB/product/nikkor-lenses/auto-focus-lenses/fx/single-focal-length/af-dc-nikkor-135mm-f-2d|title=AF DC-Nikkor 135mm f/2D Single Focal Length FX Auto Focus Lenses NIKKOR Lenses|work=europe-nikon.com|accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> [[Minolta AF|Minolta]], and [[Sony Alpha|Sony]] make lenses designed with specific controls to change the rendering of the out-of-focus areas.\n\nThe Nikon 105 mm DC-Nikkor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/1932/af-dc-nikkor-105mm-f%252F2D.html|title=AF DC-NIKKOR 105mm f/2D from Nikon|publisher=}}</ref> and 135 mm DC-Nikkor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/1935/AF-DC-Nikkor-135mm-f%252F2D.html|title=AF DC-NIKKOR 135mm f/2D from Nikon|publisher=}}</ref> lenses (DC stands for \"Defocus Control\") have a control ring that permits the overcorrection or undercorrection of [[spherical aberration]] to change the bokeh in front of and behind the [[Cardinal point (optics)|focal plane]].\n\nThe [[Minolta STF 135mm f/2.8 T4.5 lens|Minolta/Sony STF 135mm f/2.8 [T4.5]]] (with STF standing for ''smooth trans focus'') is a lens specifically designed to produce pleasing bokeh.

The related verb ''h\u014dkeru'' shares spelling with these and has the same meanings; in addition, that form acts as compound verb suffix, indicating that the subject is absorbed into the action denoted by the main verb: for instance, ''asobih\u014dkeru'' ({{Nihongo2|\u904a\u3073\u5446\u3051\u308b}})<ref>{{cite web | url = https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E6%83%9A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B_%28%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%29 | title = Goo Jisho: h\u014dkeru entry, example in sense 3}}</ref>, combining ''asobu'' and ''h\u014dkeru'', expresses being absorbed in play.

Good bokeh is also important for medium telephoto lenses (typically 85\u2013150 mm on 35 mm format). When used in portrait photography (for their \"natural\" perspective), the photographer usually wants a shallow depth of field, so that the subject stands out sharply against a blurred background.\n\nBokeh characteristics may be quantified by examining the image's [[circle of confusion]]. In out-of-focus areas, each point of light becomes an image of the aperture, generally a more or less round disc. Depending on how a lens is corrected for [[spherical aberration]], the disc may be uniformly illuminated, brighter near the edge, or brighter near the center. A well-known lens that exhibited the latter \"soap-bubble\" characteristic was that produced by Hugo Meyer & Co., more recently revived by [[Meyer Optik G\u00f6rlitz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meyer-optik-goerlitz.com/how-to-create-soap-bubble-bokeh/|author=Blog|title=How to Create Soap Bubble Bokeh}}</ref>\n\nLenses that are poorly corrected for spherical aberration will show one kind of disc for out-of-focus points in front of the plane of focus, and a different kind for points behind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/understanding-bokeh/|author=Todd Vorenkamp|title=Understanding Bokeh}}</ref> This may actually be desirable, as blur circles that are dimmer near the edges produce less-defined shapes which blend smoothly with the surrounding image.\nThe shape of the aperture has an influence on the subjective quality of bokeh as well. For conventional lens designs (with bladed apertures), when a lens is stopped down smaller than its maximum [[aperture]] size (minimum [[f-number]]), out-of-focus points are blurred into the [[polygon]]al shape formed by the aperture blades. This is most apparent when a lens produces hard-edged bokeh. For this reason, some lenses have many aperture blades and/or blades with curved edges to make the aperture more closely approximate a circle rather than a polygon. Minolta has been on the forefront of promoting and introducing lenses with near-ideal circular apertures since 1987, but most other manufacturers now offer lenses with shape-optimized diaphragms, at least for the domain of portraiture photography. In contrast, a [[Catadioptric system|catadioptric]] [[telephoto lens]] renders bokehs resembling doughnuts, because its [[secondary mirror]] blocks the central part of the aperture opening. Recently, photographers have exploited the shape of the bokeh by creating a simple mask out of card with shapes such as hearts or stars, that the photographer wishes the bokeh to be, and placing it over the lens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diyphotography.net/diy_create_your_own_bokeh|author=Karsten Stroemvig|title=DIY \u2014 Create your own Bokeh}}</ref>\n\nLenses with 11, 12, or 15 blade iris diaphragms are often claimed to excel in bokeh quality. Because of this, the lenses do not need to reach wide apertures to get better circles (instead of polygons). In the past, wide aperture lenses (f/2, f/2.8) were very expensive, due to the complex mathematical design and manufacturing know-how required, at a time when all computations and glass making were done by hand. Leica could reach a good bokeh at f/4.5. Today it is much easier to make an f/1.8 lens, and a 9-bladed lens at f/1.8 is enough for an 85mm lens to achieve great bokeh.\n\nSome lens manufacturers including [[Nikon]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-nikon.com/en_GB/product/nikkor-lenses/auto-focus-lenses/fx/single-focal-length/af-dc-nikkor-135mm-f-2d|title=AF DC-Nikkor 135mm f/2D Single Focal Length FX Auto Focus Lenses NIKKOR Lenses|work=europe-nikon.com|accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> [[Minolta AF|Minolta]], and [[Sony Alpha|Sony]] make lenses designed with specific controls to change the rendering of the out-of-focus areas.\n\nThe Nikon 105 mm DC-Nikkor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/1932/af-dc-nikkor-105mm-f%252F2D.html|title=AF DC-NIKKOR 105mm f/2D from Nikon|publisher=}}</ref> and 135 mm DC-Nikkor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/1935/AF-DC-Nikkor-135mm-f%252F2D.html|title=AF DC-NIKKOR 135mm f/2D from Nikon|publisher=}}</ref> lenses (DC stands for \"Defocus Control\") have a control ring that permits the overcorrection or undercorrection of [[spherical aberration]] to change the bokeh in front of and behind the [[Cardinal point (optics)|focal plane]].\n\nThe [[Minolta STF 135mm f/2.8 T4.5 lens|Minolta/Sony STF 135mm f/2.8 [T4.5]]] (with STF standing for ''smooth trans focus'') is a lens specifically designed to produce pleasing bokeh. It is possible to choose between two diaphragms: one with 9 and another with 10 blades. An [[apodization]] filter is used to soften the aperture edges which results in a smooth defocused area with gradually fading circles. Those qualities made it the only lens of this kind on the market from its introduction in 1999 to 2014. In 2014 [[Fujifilm]] announced a lens utilizing a similar apodization filter in the [[Fujinon XF 56mm F1.2 R APD lens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fujifilm introduces XF 56mm F1.2 R APD with apodization filter|url=http://www.dpreview.com/articles/4106200256/fujifilm-introduces-xf-56mm-f1-2-r-apd-with-apodization-filter|website=DPReview}}</ref> Sony added the [[Sony FE 100mm F2.8 STF GM OSS]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=Neu von Sony: E-Mount-Objektive 100 mm F2.8 STF GM, FE 85 mm F1.8; Blitz HVL-F45RM |date=2017-02-07 |language=German |work=Photoscala |url=http://www.photoscala.de/2017/02/07/neu-von-sony-e-mount-objektive-100-mm-f2-8-stf-gm-fe-85-mm-f1-8-blitz-hvl-f45rm/ |access-date=2017-02-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211003316/http://www.photoscala.de/2017/02/07/neu-von-sony-e-mount-objektive-100-mm-f2-8-stf-gm-fe-85-mm-f1-8-blitz-hvl-f45rm/ |archive-date=2017-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThe 'Sigma YS System Focusing' 135mm f/2.8 also has an extra manually-moved component, intended to compensate for aberration at close-focus distances.

Perso-Arabic is one of two scripts used for Punjabi, the other being [[Gurmukh\u012b alphabet|Gurmukhi]], used in [[Punjab, India]].\n\nThe Shahmukhi alphabet was first used by the [[Sufi]] poets of the [[Punjab]]; it became the conventional writing style for the [[Muslims|Muslim]] populace of the [[Pakistan]]i province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] following the [[Partition of India]], while the largely [[Hindus|Hindu]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] modern-day state of [[Punjab, India]] adopted the [[Gurmukh\u012b alphabet|Gurmukhi]] script to record the Punjabi language.\n\nIt is used as the main alphabet to write the [[Pothohari dialect]] in Indian [[Jammu and Kashmir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/phr|title=Pahari-Potwari|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nShahmukhi is written from right to left, while Gurmukhi is written from left to right.
