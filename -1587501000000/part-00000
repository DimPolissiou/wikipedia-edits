At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).<ref name=strovel/>\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities.<ref name=fda-ddp/> These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/> It is a regulatory requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new vaccine is to be delivered by skin injection). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in

These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease. At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).<ref name=strovel/>\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities.<ref name=fda-ddp/> These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/> It is a regulatory requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new vaccine is to be delivered by skin injection). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in

Upon his entering the underworld, all the dead flee Heracles except for [[Meleager]] and the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]. Heracles drew his sword against Medusa, but Hermes told Heracles that the dead are mere \"empty phantoms\". Heracles asked Hades (here called Pluto) for Cerberus, and Hades said that Heracles could take Cerberus provided he was able to subdue him without using weapons. Heracles found Cerberus at the gates of [[Acheron]], and with his arms around Cerberus, though being bitten by Cerberus' serpent tail, Heracles squeezed until Cerberus submitted. Heracles carried Cerberus away, showed him to Eurystheus, then returned Cerberus to the underworld.\n\nIn an apparently unique version of the story, related by the sixth-century AD [[Pseudo-Nonnus]], Heracles descended into Hades to abduct Persephone, and killed Cerberus on his way back up.<ref>[[Pseudo-Nonnus]], 4.51 (Nimmo Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzZnMCP4JRIC&pg=PA37 p. 37]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA114 p. 114].</ref>\n\n== Iconography ==\n[[File:Skyphos aus Argos.JPG|thumb|350px|One of the two earliest depictions of the capture of Cerberus (composed of the last five figures on the right) shows, from right to left: Cerberus, with a single dog head and snakes rising from his body, fleeing right, Hermes, with his characteristic hat (''[[petasos]]'') and [[caduceus]], Heracles, with quiver on his back, stone in left hand, and bow in right, a goddess, standing in front of Hades' throne, facing Heracles, and Hades, with scepter, fleeing left.

It has been claimed to be related to the [[Sanskrit]] word \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e ''sarvar\u0101'', used as an epithet of one of the dogs of [[Yama]], from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *''k\u0311\u00e9rberos'', meaning \"spotted\".<ref>{{cite book\n| last1                 = Mallory\n| first1                = J.

Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] dog [[Garmr]], relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root ''*ger-'' \"to growl\" (perhaps with the suffixes ''-*m/*b'' and ''-*r''). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires ''Kerberos'' and ''Garmr'' to be derived from two ''different'' Indo-European roots (*''ker-'' and *''gher-'' respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.\n\nThough probably not Greek, Greek etymologies for Cerberus have been offered. An etymology given by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] (the late-fourth-century commentator on [[Virgil]])\u2014but rejected by Ogden\u2014derives Cerberus from the Greek word ''creoboros'' meaning \"flesh-devouring\".<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil]], ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA190 p. 190]; compare with [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]], ''Mythologies'' 1.6 (Whitbread, [https://books.google.com/books?id=73mJIuYfmzEC&pg=PA51 pp. 51\u201352]); [[First Vatican Mythographer]], 1.57 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA73 pp. 73\u201374; Pepin, p. 36]); [[Second Vatican Mythographer]], 13 (Pepin, 106), 173 (Pepin, p. 171); [[Third Vatican Mythographer]], 13.4 (Pepin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sE7WnkLLt2gC&pg=PA324 p. 324]).

The serpent was called the \"hound of Hades\" only because anyone bitten by it died immediately, and it was this snake that Heracles brought to Eurystheus. The geographer Pausanias (who preserves for us Hecataeus' version of the story) points out that, since Homer does not describe Cerberus, Hecataeus' account does not necessarily conflict with Homer, since Homer's \"Hound of Hades\" may not in fact refer to an actual dog.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.6 3.25.6].</ref>\n\nOther rationalized accounts make Cerberus out to be a normal dog.

Heracles killed Orthus, and drove away Geryon's cattle, with Cerberus following along behind. Molossus, a Mycenaen, offered to buy Cerberus from Eurystheus (presumably having received the dog, along with the cattle, from Heracles). But when Eurystheus refused, Molossus stole the dog and penned him up in a cave in Tainaron. Eurystheus commanded Heracles to find Cerberus and bring him back. After searching the entire Peloponnesus, Heracles found where it was said Cerberus was being held, went down into the cave, and brought up Cerberus, after which it was said: \"Heracles descended through the cave into Hades and brought up Cerberus.\"\n\nIn the rationalized account of [[Philochorus]], in which Heracles rescues Theseus, Perithous is eaten by Cerberus.<ref>[[Philochorus]], ''FGrH'' 328 F18a (= [[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D35%3Asection%3D1 35.1]), F18b, F18c; Harding, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KH4T9CBXwEEC&pg=PA68 pp. 68\u201370]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir5FhAQbcfAC&pg=PA73 p. 73]; Ogden 2013a, p. 109; Gantz, p. 295; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.637.xml p. 637].

Illustration from Dante's ''Inferno'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], a medieval commentator on [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', derived Cerberus' name from the Greek word ''creoboros'' meaning \"flesh-devouring\" (see above), and held that Cerberus symbolized the corpse-consuming earth, with Heracles' triumph over Cerberus representing his victory over earthly desires.<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil]], ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA190 p. 190].

This earth, swallowing up bodies, sends souls to Tartarus.\"<ref>[[Second Vatican Mythographer]], 13 (Pepin, p. 106); [[Third Vatican Mythographer]] 6.22 (Pepin, p. 171). For others who associated Cerberus' three heads with the three continents see Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6KygKVV5l7YC&pg=PA69 p. 69].</ref>\n\nVirgil described Cerberus as \"ravenous\" (''fame rabida''),<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.421 6.421].</ref> and a rapacious Cerberus became proverbial. Thus Cerberus came to symbolize avarice,<ref>Wilson-Okamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5PaUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA169 p. 169]; Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6KygKVV5l7YC&pg=PA69 p. 69].</ref> and so, for example, in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]],'' Cerberus is placed in the Third Circle of Hell, guarding over the gluttons, where he \"rends the spirits, flays and quarters them,\"<ref>[[Dante]], ''Inferno'' [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Inferno/Canto_VI 6.13\u201318]</ref> and Dante (perhaps echoing Servius' association of Cerbeus with earth) has his guide Virgil take up handfuls of earth and throw them into Cerberus' \"rapacious gullets.\"<ref>[[Dante]], ''Inferno'' [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Inferno/Canto_VI 6.25\u201327]; Lansing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CY-sAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154 p. 154].</ref>\n\n[[File:Hev 11 fig H hercules et cerberus.jpg|thumb|right|Cerberus constellation]]\n\n== Constellation ==\nIn the [[Cerberus (constellation)|constellation Cerberus]] introduced by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687, Cerberus is drawn as a three-headed snake, held in Hercules' hand (previously these stars had been depicted as a branch of the tree on which grew the [[Hesperides|Apples of the Hesperides]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/cerberus.htm |title=Ian Ridpath's 'Star Tales' |publisher=Ianridpath.com |date= |accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Snake genus==\nIn 1829 French naturalist [[Georges Cuvier]] gave the name ''[[Cerberus (snake)|Cerberus]]'' to a genus of Asian snakes, which are commonly called \"dog-faced water snakes\" in English.<ref>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] dog [[Garmr]], relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root ''*ger-'' \"to growl\" (perhaps with the suffixes ''-*m/*b'' and ''-*r''). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires ''Kerberos'' and ''Garmr'' to be derived from two ''different'' Indo-European roots (*''ker-'' and *''gher-'' respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.\n\nThough probably not Greek, Greek etymologies for Cerberus have been offered. An etymology given by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] (the late-fourth-century commentator on [[Virgil]])\u2014but rejected by Ogden\u2014derives Cerberus from the Greek word ''creoboros'' meaning \"flesh-devouring\".<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil]], ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA190 p. 190]; compare with [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]], ''Mythologies'' 1.6 (Whitbread, [https://books.google.com/books?id=73mJIuYfmzEC&pg=PA51 pp. 51\u201352]); [[First Vatican Mythographer]], 1.57 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA73 pp. 73\u201374; Pepin, p. 36]); [[Second Vatican Mythographer]], 13 (Pepin, 106), 173 (Pepin, p. 171); [[Third Vatican Mythographer]], 13.4 (Pepin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sE7WnkLLt2gC&pg=PA324 p. 324]).

The serpent was called the \"hound of Hades\" only because anyone bitten by it died immediately, and it was this snake that Heracles brought to Eurystheus. The geographer Pausanias (who preserves for us Hecataeus' version of the story) points out that, since Homer does not describe Cerberus, Hecataeus' account does not necessarily conflict with Homer, since Homer's \"Hound of Hades\" may not in fact refer to an actual dog.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.6 3.25.6].</ref>\n\nOther rationalized accounts make Cerberus out to be a normal dog.

Geryon lived in a city named Tricranium (in Greek ''Tricarenia,'' \"Three-Heads\"),<ref>Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA187 p. 187].</ref> from which name both Cerberus and Geryon came to be called \"three-headed\". Heracles killed Orthus, and drove away Geryon's cattle, with Cerberus following along behind. Molossus, a Mycenaen, offered to buy Cerberus from Eurystheus (presumably having received the dog, along with the cattle, from Heracles). But when Eurystheus refused, Molossus stole the dog and penned him up in a cave in Tainaron. Eurystheus commanded Heracles to find Cerberus and bring him back. After searching the entire Peloponnesus, Heracles found where it was said Cerberus was being held, went down into the cave, and brought up Cerberus, after which it was said: \"Heracles descended through the cave into Hades and brought up Cerberus.\"\n\nIn the rationalized account of [[Philochorus]], in which Heracles rescues Theseus, Perithous is eaten by Cerberus.<ref>[[Philochorus]], ''FGrH'' 328 F18a (= [[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D35%3Asection%3D1 35.1]), F18b, F18c; Harding, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KH4T9CBXwEEC&pg=PA68 pp. 68\u201370]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir5FhAQbcfAC&pg=PA73 p. 73]; Ogden 2013a, p. 109; Gantz, p. 295; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.637.xml p. 637].

After having stolen Helen, to be Theseus' wife, Theseus and Perithous, attempt to abduct Kore, for Perithous, but Aidoneus catches the two heroes, imprisons Theseus, and feeds Perithous to Cerberus. Later, while a guest of Aidoneus, Heracles asks Aidoneus to release Theseus, as a favor, which Aidoneus grants.\n\nA 2nd-century AD Greek known as [[Heraclitus the paradoxographer]] (not to be confused with the 5th-century BC Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]) \u2013 claimed that Cerberus had two pups that were never away from their father, which made Cerberus appear to be three-headed.<ref>Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&pg=PA73 p. 73].</ref>\n\n==Cerberus allegorized==\n[[File:Inferno Canto 6 lines 24-26.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Virgil feeding Cerberus earth, in the Third Circle of Hell.

[[California]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 136,484.<ref name=\"QF\"/> The [[county seat]] is the [[Napa, California|City of Napa]].<ref name=\"GR6\"/> Napa County was one of the original counties of California,<ref name=\"AutoZC-2\"/> created in 1850 at the time of statehood. Parts of the county's territory were given to [[Lake County, California|Lake County]] in 1861.\n\nNapa County comprises the Napa, CA [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-[[San Francisco]]-[[Oakland, California|Oakland]], CA [[San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area|Combined Statistical Area]]. It is one of four [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] counties.<ref name=\"landis\"/>\n\nNapa County, once the producer of many different crops, is known today for its [[Napa Valley AVA|regional wine industry]], rising to the first rank of wine regions with France by local wineries [[Stag's Leap Wine Cellars]] and [[Chateau Montelena]] winning the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|\"Judgment of Paris\"]] in 1976.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory\u201318th century===\nIn [[prehistoric]] times, the valley was inhabited by the [[Patwin]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, with possible habitation by [[Wappo]] tribes in the northwestern foothills. Most villages are thought to have been constructed near the [[floodplain]]s of watercourses that drain the valley. Their food consisted of wild roots, [[acorn]]s, small animals, [[earthworm]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, and bread made from crushed [[California buckeye]] kernels. In winter they would construct huts made of tree branches. In summer they camped near rivers and streams. In winter months, they were half-clad in wild animal skins and at other times they wore no clothing. The maximum prehistoric population is thought not to have exceeded 5000 persons.<ref name=\"AutoZC-3\"/>\n\nIn 1776, a fort was erected by the Spanish Governor, [[Felipe de Neve]] a short distance northwest of Napa, on an elevated [[plateau]].<ref name=\"AutoZC-4\"/> Russians from [[Sonoma County]]'s [[Fort Ross]] grazed cattle and sheep in the Napa Valley in the early 19th century and in 1841 a survey party from the fort placed a plaque on the summit of [[Mount Saint Helena]].\n\n===Early 19th century===\nFrancis Castro and Father Jose Altimura were the first Europeans to explore the Napa Valley, in 1823.<ref name=\"AutoZC-5\"/> When the first white settlers arrived in the early 1830s, there were six tribes in the valley speaking different dialects and they were often at war with each other. The Mayacomos tribe lived in the area where [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]] was founded. The Callajomans were in the area near where the town of St. Helena now stands. Further south, the Kymus dwelt in the middle part of the valley. The Napa and Ulcus tribes occupied part of the area where the City of [[Napa, California|Napa]] now exists while the Soscol tribe occupied the portion that now makes up the southern end of the valley. Many of the native peoples died during a smallpox epidemic in 1838. Settlers also killed several over claims of cattle theft.\n\nDuring the era between 1836 and 1846, when California was a province of independent [[Mexico]], the following 13 [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] were granted in Napa County:<ref name=\"AutoZC-6\"/>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Rancho Carne Humana|Carne Humana]]\n*[[Rancho Catacula|Catacula]]\n*[[Rancho Caymus|Caymus]]\n*[[Rancho Chimiles|Chimiles]]\n*[[Rancho Entre Napa|Entre Napa]]\n*[[Rancho La Jota|La Jota]]\n*[[Rancho Las Putas|Las Putas]]\n*[[Rancho Locoallomi|Locoallomi]]\n*[[Rancho Napa|Napa]]\n*[[Rancho Tulucay|Tulucay]]\n*[[Rancho Yajome|Yajome]]\n*[[Rancho Huichica|Huichica]]\n*[[Rancho Mallacomes|Mallacomes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[George C. Yount]] was an early settler in Napa County and is believed to be the first [[English-speaking|Anglo-Saxon]] resident in the county. In 1836 Yount obtained the Mexican grant Rancho Caymus where he built what is said to be the first log house in California. Soon afterward, he built a sawmill and grain mill, and was the first person to plant a vineyard in the county. Following Yount's death in 1865 at age 71, the town of [[Yountville, California|Yountville]] was named in his honor.\n\nFollowing his marriage to [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo|General Vallejo]]\u2019s niece Maria Guadalupe Soberanes, [[Edward Turner Bale]] became a citizen of Mexico and was granted Rancho Carne Humana in the northern end of the valley. Bale completed building the [[Bale Grist Mill State Historic Park|Bale Grist Mill]] a few miles north of [[St. Helena, California|St. Helena]] in 1846. Colonel [[Joseph Chiles|Joseph B. Chiles]] a guide for one of the earliest immigrant trains to California, was granted Rancho Catacula in 1844.\n\nThe Town of Napa was founded on Rancho Entre Napa by [[Nathan Coombs]] in 1847.\n\nFollowing the event of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] in 1846 and the [[Mexican Cession]] in 1848, settlers were granted deeds from the original ranchos during the 1850s through 1870s. To this day, a number of streets and landmarks around the valley reflect the names of these ranchos and original grantees.\n\n===Late 19th century===\nNapa County was formed and became one of the original California counties when the state became part of the [[United States]] in 1850.\n\nDescendants of George Yount and Captain Edward Bale played key roles in the early development of Napa County. Yount's granddaughter Elizabeth Yount married Thomas Rutherford in 1864. The couple received as a wedding gift from George Yount, land in the area of the valley now known as Rutherford. Rutherford established himself as a serious grower and producer of fine wines in the following years. Bale's oldest daughter Lolita married the seaman Louis Bruck. When Bale died in 1848, Bruck became the executor of the will for the family. He was elected the first mayor of Napa City when incorporated in 1872. Charles Krug, a fellow Prussian compatriot and pioneer viticulturalist at Sonoma, married Lolita's younger sister Caroline with a dowry that included land near the Bale mill. Krug then moved north of St. Helena to establish the valley's first commercial winery.\n\n[[John Patchett]] opened the first commercial winery in the county in 1859. The vineyard and wine cellar were in an area now in the city limits of Napa. After working as a winemaker for Patchett, [[Charles Krug]] founded his own winery in St. Helena 1861.<ref name=\"AutoZC-7\"/>\n\nThe county's population began to grow in the mid-century as pioneers, prospectors, and entrepreneurs moved in and set up residence. During this period, settlers primarily raised cattle and farmed grain and fruit crops. Mineral mining also played a role in the economics of the county. In 1858 the great silver rush began in Napa Valley, and miners flocked to the eastern hills. While gold was being prospected in other areas of the state in the 1850s, Napa County became a center for [[silver]] and [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] mining. In the 1860s, mining carried on, on a large scale, with quicksilver mines operating in many areas of Napa County.\n\nIn 1866 John Lawley established a toll road from Calistoga over Mount Saint Helena to Lake County.\n\n[[File:Mount Saint Helena, viewed from Napa Valley.JPG|right|thumb|Young vineyard in the valley with [[Mount Saint Helena]] in the background]]\n\n[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book ''[[The Silverado Squatters]]'' provides a snapshot of life and insight into some of the characters that lived around the valley during the later part of the 19th century. Stevenson, accompanied by his new bride [[Fanny Vandegrift]] and her 12-year-old son from a previous marriage, [[Lloyd Osbourne]], spent the late spring and early summer of 1880 honeymooning in an abandoned bunk house at a played-out mine near the summit of Mount Saint Helena. In the book, Stevenson's descriptive writing style documented his ventures in the area and profiled several of the early pioneers who played a role in shaping the region's commerce and society. Stevenson's book also brought attention to the various spas and hot springs in the county.  From Calistoga to \u00c6etna Springs in Pope Valley to Soda Springs Resort a few miles east of Napa, tourists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries made the county their destination much the same as modern day tourists. The resorts became very popular with San Franciscans anxious to escape the cold and foggy weather that often plagues the city to enjoy the warmer climate Napa County offered.\n\nIn the mid-1880s, entrepreneur [[Samuel Brannan]] purchased land in the northern end of the valley at the foot of Mount Saint Helena and founded Calistoga. He began developing it as a resort town taking advantage of or the area's numerous mineral hot springs. He also founded the Napa Valley Railroad Company in 1864 to bring tourists to Calistoga from [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|San Francisco ferry boats]] that docked in [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]]. Brannan's railroad venture failed and was sold at a foreclosure sale in 1869. The railroad eventually came under the ownership of [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] late in the 19th century.\n\nThe [[Veterans Home of California Yountville]] was established in Yountville in 1884 by the San Francisco chapter of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. The State of California assumed administration of the Home in 1897.<ref name=\"AutoZC-8\"/>\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n[[File:Napa Valley grapes Photo D Ramey Logan 02.JPG|right|thumb|Napa Valley grapes]]\nBy the end of the 1900s, farmers had planted over 500,000 fruit and nut trees in the county, especially plums and pears. This helped to soften the blows to the agricultural economy caused by the phylloxera infestation in the county's vineyards and upcoming prohibition that crippled the wine industry, but resulted in a boom for shipping grapes to immigrant, home winemakers across the country.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[Basalt Rock Company]] located south of the City of Napa on the Napa River, built 3 dozen [[Rescue and salvage ship|salvage rescue tugs]] for the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=\"AutoZC-9\"/> Following the war, several small and medium size businesses began operating in the County. A large majority of these businesses were related to the wine industry and tourism. Agriculture in the county remained very diverse until late in the 20th century when wine grapes again became the primary focus. While vineyards were planted on well over 90% of the agricultural land in the county, by the end of the 20th century, modern day farmers have recently begun exploring the possibility of raising other food crops in order to again diversify and take advantage of growing conditions.<ref name=\"AutoZC-10\"/>\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m. on August 24, 2014, the area was struck by a [[2014 South Napa earthquake|magnitude 6.0 earthquake]] centered {{convert|3.7|mi|km}} northwest of the city of [[American Canyon, California|American Canyon]].<ref name=\"BBC-28918600\"/><ref name=\"AutoZC-11\"/>\n\nIn October 2017, parts of the county were affected by [[October 2017 Northern California wildfires|wildfires]].\n\nFrom June to July 2018, the [[County Fire]] affected a small part of Napa County after crossing over from [[Yolo County, California]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php/news/56691-county-fire-grows-crosses-into-napa-county-more-evacuation-orders-advisories-issued|title=County fire grows, crosses into Napa County; more evacuation orders, advisories issued|last=Larson|first=Elizabeth|date=1 July 2018|work=Lake County News|access-date=27 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, heavy smoke and unscheduled black outs by [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] of up to 20,000 customers affected the county due to fierce winds and threats from the [[Kincade Fire]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/more-outages-strike-napa-county-after-fierce-overnight-winds-local/article_73775681-7e0e-5768-a5bd-f8c6400eda8a.html|title=More outages strike Napa County after fierce overnight winds; local shelters to open for Sonoma County wildfire evacuees|last=Yune|first=Howard|date=27 October 2019|work=Napa Valley Register|access-date=27 October 2019|last2=Sweeney|first2=Cynthia|publication-place=Napa, California}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rolling hills of the Napa valley.jpg|thumb|right|Rolling hills of Napa Valley]]\n[[File:Fall in Napa Valley.jpg|right|thumb|Fall in Napa Valley]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|789|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|748|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|40|sqmi}} (5.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\"/>\n\nNapa is warmer in the summer than [[Sonoma County]], to the west, or [[Santa Barbara County]], a wine-producing county in southern California. Thus, the Napa wineries favor varietals such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], while [[Pinot noir]] and [[Chardonnay]] are more the specialty of Sonoma and Santa Barbara wineries. At the north end of Napa County, in the [[Mayacamas Mountains]], lies Mount Saint Helena, the Bay Area's second tallest peak at 4,344 feet (1,323 m) and home to [[Robert Louis Stevenson State Park]]; [[Snell Valley]] is also situated in northern Napa County; the [[Missimer Wildflower Preserve]] is within Snell Valley.

By the end of the nineteenth century, there were more than 140 wineries in the area. Several still exist in the valley including Charles Krug Winery, Schramsberg, [[Chateau Montelena]], Nichelini and Beringer. Viticulture in Napa suffered a setback when [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] was enacted in 1920.<ref name=\"AutoZC-21\"/>  Furthering the damage was an infestation of the [[phylloxera]] root louse which killed many of the vines through the valley. These two events caused many wineries to shut down and stalled the growth of the wine industry in Napa County for years. But for many Italian and Swiss families as farm labor in the vineyards, Prohibition offered the unique opportunity for the growing and shipping of grapes to immigrant homewinemakers across the country. Charles Forni, who received a gold coin as his first U.S. dollar upon arriving, rose to be a large shipper. The Mondavi family came West from the Minnesota ore-country to Lodi to ship grapes to the \"Italian Club\" miners. When Prohibition stopped in 1933, the price of grapes crashed to below $24 per ton. Then A.P. Giannini, founder of Bank of America at San Francisco, started to promote to rebuild the commerce of wine and viticulture. Following the [[Second World War]], the  wine industry in Napa again began to grow.  But cattle and prunes were king.\n\n[[File:RobertMondavi.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Mondavi Winery, Napa]]\nIn 1965, Napa Valley icon [[Robert Mondavi]] broke away from his family's Charles Krug estate to found his own. This was the first new large scale winery to be established in the valley since before prohibition. After the establishment of the Mondavi estate, the number of wineries in the valley continued to grow, as did the region's reputation. Consumer trends followed the 60s free lifestyle for experimentation. The old \"paesano\" customers of \"dego red\" gallon jug wines changed to young women who considered white wine, not beer, as their new drink of choice for romance. Robert Mondavi Winery attracted new wine aficionados by introducing the larger, 1.5 liter wine bottle for an image of affordable quality.\n\n[[File:ChateauMontelena.jpg|thumb|right|Chateau Montelena]]\nIn addition to large scale wineries, Napa Valley's boutique wineries produce some of the world's best wines. The producers of these wines include but are not limited to: [[Araujo Estate Wines|Araujo]], Bryant Family, Monticello Vineyards, [[Ceja Vineyards]], Chimney Rock Winery, [[Colgin Cellars]], Dalla Valle Maya, Diamond Creek, [[Dominus Estate]], [[Duckhorn Vineyards]], Dunn Howell Mountain, [[Grace Family Vineyards]], [[Harlan Estate]], Husic, Kistler, Jericho Canyon Vineyards, Marcassin, Rutherford Hill Winery, [[Screaming Eagle Winery and Vineyards|Screaming Eagle]], Sequoia Grove, Shafer Hillside Select, Steltzner Vineyards, and Bouchaine Vineyards.\n\nToday Napa Valley features more than four hundred wineries and grows many different grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, [[Merlot]], [[Zinfandel]], and other popular varietals. As many as five million people visit the area each year.\n\n==Agricultural preservation==\n[[File:Clos du Val Winery, Napa Valley, California, USA (6863361815).jpg|right|thumb|A vineyard in the valley]]\n\nNapa County has maintained a rural agricultural environment in a large part of the valley floor while neighboring Sonoma, Solano and Yolo counties have allowed large tracts of former farmland to be rezoned for commercial and residential development. In 1968 vintners and civic leaders in the county seized an opportunity to preserve farmland by taking advantage of the [[Williamson Act]]<ref name=\"AutoZC-22\"/> enacted by the California Legislature to give landowners property tax relief for designating their land for agricultural purposes. This agricultural preserve<ref name=\"AutoZC-23\"/> on the floor of the valley in unincorporated areas between Napa and Calistoga was the first of its kind in the state.  Initially, the preserve encompassed {{convert|23000|acre|km2|1}},but it has grown to more than {{convert|30000|acre|km2|1}}. In 2010, legislation was passed by the California State Senate and State Assembly and sent to the Governor for signing in the form of Senate Bill 1142. This bill was created to provide relief stream of funding to augment the Williamson Act.<ref name=\"AutoZC-24\"/>\n\nThe county has resisted encroachment on the preserve since it was created with voters reaffirming their desire keep it intact on several occasions. In 1990 voters passed Measure J<ref name=\"AutoZC-25\"/>  adopting an initiative freezing all county zoning changes until the year 2020 unless there is a \u2154 majority vote to adopt such changes.<ref name=\"AutoZC-26\"/>  Measure J was reaffirmed by a 5\u20132 vote of the California Supreme Court in 1995 in the case of Devita v. County of Napa.<ref name=\"AutoZC-27\"/>\n\nThe Land Trust of Napa County<ref name=\"AutoZC-28\"/> was founded in 1976 by a group of local citizens with a mission to protect the natural diversity, scenic open space and agricultural vitality of the county. The trust acquires conservation easements, facilitates land transfers to local, state and federal agencies along with accepting outright donations of land within and outside the boundary of the agricultural preserve. The trust now covers over {{convert|50000|acre|km2|1}}.<ref name=\"AutoZC-29\"/>\n\nWhile establishment of the agricultural preserve and the land trust has slowed residential development in much of the county, residential growth within the incorporated cities has continued at a moderate pace. Several substantial homes have been built on the hills surrounding the valley in areas not covered by the preserve or the land trust. A large portion of the land south of the City of Napa remained undeveloped for many decades until the 1980s. Several wine bottling facilities and [[wine storage]] warehouses now stand on what was once vacant land. A number of light industries have also sprung up in this region as new business parks have been built. The growth of American Canyon,<ref name=\"AutoZC-30\"/> Napa County's southernmost and newest city, incorporated in 1992, has prompted the establishment of several new retail outlets in the southern end of the county in recent years. American Canyon has also established a green belt preserve of over {{convert|1000|acre|km2|1}} on the western and eastern sides of the city.\n\nIn November 2009, the Napa Valley Vintners Association, the Napa Farm Bureau, the Napa Valley Grapegrowers and an advocacy group called Preserving the Integrity of Napa's Agriculture completed a two-year study of [[Genetically Modified Organism|Genetically Engineered Organisms (GEOs)]],<ref name=\"Current Issues NVFB\"/> and released a joint letter recommending no GEO usage in Napa County until the risks and benefits of GEOs are reevaluated and a \"satisfactory\" regulatory framework is put in place.<ref name=\"Joint Letter Napa GEOs\"/>\n\n==Education==\nIn addition to its many public and private schools, two colleges also operate in the County. [[Pacific Union College]], classified as a National [[Liberal Arts College]] by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]], is the county's only four-year college and serves roughly 1,500 students. [[Napa Valley College]], a [[community college]], offers two-year degrees in the county.\n\n=== Library ===\nThe Napa County Library, is the [[public library]] of Napa [[California]].

In March every year since the late '70s, the county plays host to the [[Napa Valley Marathon]].\n\nIn June, the annual Napa Valley Wine Auction takes place. Wineries throughout the valley donate wines and other prizes to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

County''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] north of [[San Pablo Bay]] in the [[Northern California|northern portion]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 136,484.<ref name=\"QF\"/> The [[county seat]] is the [[Napa, California|City of Napa]].<ref name=\"GR6\"/> Napa County was one of the original counties of California,<ref name=\"AutoZC-2\"/> created in 1850 at the time of statehood. Parts of the county's territory were given to [[Lake County, California|Lake County]] in 1861.\n\nNapa County comprises the Napa, CA [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-[[San Francisco]]-[[Oakland, California|Oakland]], CA [[San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area|Combined Statistical Area]]. It is one of four [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] counties.<ref name=\"landis\"/>\n\nNapa County, once the producer of many different crops, is known today for its [[Napa Valley AVA|regional wine industry]], rising to the first rank of wine regions with France by local wineries [[Stag's Leap Wine Cellars]] and [[Chateau Montelena]] winning the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|\"Judgment of Paris\"]] in 1976.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory\u201318th century===\nIn [[prehistoric]] times, the valley was inhabited by the [[Patwin]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, with possible habitation by [[Wappo]] tribes in the northwestern foothills. Most villages are thought to have been constructed near the [[floodplain]]s of watercourses that drain the valley. Their food consisted of wild roots, [[acorn]]s, small animals, [[earthworm]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, and bread made from crushed [[California buckeye]] kernels. In winter they would construct huts made of tree branches. In summer they camped near rivers and streams. In winter months, they were half-clad in wild animal skins and at other times they wore no clothing. The maximum prehistoric population is thought not to have exceeded 5000 persons.<ref name=\"AutoZC-3\"/>\n\nIn 1776, a fort was erected by the Spanish Governor, [[Felipe de Neve]] a short distance northwest of Napa, on an elevated [[plateau]].<ref name=\"AutoZC-4\"/> Russians from [[Sonoma County]]'s [[Fort Ross]] grazed cattle and sheep in the Napa Valley in the early 19th century and in 1841 a survey party from the fort placed a plaque on the summit of [[Mount Saint Helena]].\n\n===Early 19th century===\nFrancis Castro and Father Jose Altimura were the first Europeans to explore the Napa Valley, in 1823.<ref name=\"AutoZC-5\"/> When the first white settlers arrived in the early 1830s, there were six tribes in the valley speaking different dialects and they were often at war with each other. The Mayacomos tribe lived in the area where [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]] was founded. The Callajomans were in the area near where the town of St. Helena now stands. Further south, the Kymus dwelt in the middle part of the valley. The Napa and Ulcus tribes occupied part of the area where the City of [[Napa, California|Napa]] now exists while the Soscol tribe occupied the portion that now makes up the southern end of the valley. Many of the native peoples died during a smallpox epidemic in 1838. Settlers also killed several over claims of cattle theft.\n\nDuring the era between 1836 and 1846, when California was a province of independent [[Mexico]], the following 13 [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] were granted in Napa County:<ref name=\"AutoZC-6\"/>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Rancho Carne Humana|Carne Humana]]\n*[[Rancho Catacula|Catacula]]\n*[[Rancho Caymus|Caymus]]\n*[[Rancho Chimiles|Chimiles]]\n*[[Rancho Entre Napa|Entre Napa]]\n*[[Rancho La Jota|La Jota]]\n*[[Rancho Las Putas|Las Putas]]\n*[[Rancho Locoallomi|Locoallomi]]\n*[[Rancho Napa|Napa]]\n*[[Rancho Tulucay|Tulucay]]\n*[[Rancho Yajome|Yajome]]\n*[[Rancho Huichica|Huichica]]\n*[[Rancho Mallacomes|Mallacomes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[George C. Yount]] was an early settler in Napa County and is believed to be the first [[English-speaking|Anglo-Saxon]] resident in the county. In 1836 Yount obtained the Mexican grant Rancho Caymus where he built what is said to be the first log house in California. Soon afterward, he built a sawmill and grain mill, and was the first person to plant a vineyard in the county. Following Yount's death in 1865 at age 71, the town of [[Yountville, California|Yountville]] was named in his honor.\n\nFollowing his marriage to [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo|General Vallejo]]\u2019s niece Maria Guadalupe Soberanes, [[Edward Turner Bale]] became a citizen of Mexico and was granted Rancho Carne Humana in the northern end of the valley. Bale completed building the [[Bale Grist Mill State Historic Park|Bale Grist Mill]] a few miles north of [[St. Helena, California|St. Helena]] in 1846. Colonel [[Joseph Chiles|Joseph B. Chiles]] a guide for one of the earliest immigrant trains to California, was granted Rancho Catacula in 1844.\n\nThe Town of Napa was founded on Rancho Entre Napa by [[Nathan Coombs]] in 1847.\n\nFollowing the event of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] in 1846 and the [[Mexican Cession]] in 1848, settlers were granted deeds from the original ranchos during the 1850s through 1870s. To this day, a number of streets and landmarks around the valley reflect the names of these ranchos and original grantees.\n\n===Late 19th century===\nNapa County was formed and became one of the original California counties when the state became part of the [[United States]] in 1850.\n\nDescendants of George Yount and Captain Edward Bale played key roles in the early development of Napa County. Yount's granddaughter Elizabeth Yount married Thomas Rutherford in 1864. The couple received as a wedding gift from George Yount, land in the area of the valley now known as Rutherford. Rutherford established himself as a serious grower and producer of fine wines in the following years. Bale's oldest daughter Lolita married the seaman Louis Bruck. When Bale died in 1848, Bruck became the executor of the will for the family. He was elected the first mayor of Napa City when incorporated in 1872. Charles Krug, a fellow Prussian compatriot and pioneer viticulturalist at Sonoma, married Lolita's younger sister Caroline with a dowry that included land near the Bale mill. Krug then moved north of St. Helena to establish the valley's first commercial winery.\n\n[[John Patchett]] opened the first commercial winery in the county in 1859. The vineyard and wine cellar were in an area now in the city limits of Napa. After working as a winemaker for Patchett, [[Charles Krug]] founded his own winery in St. Helena 1861.<ref name=\"AutoZC-7\"/>\n\nThe county's population began to grow in the mid-century as pioneers, prospectors, and entrepreneurs moved in and set up residence. During this period, settlers primarily raised cattle and farmed grain and fruit crops. Mineral mining also played a role in the economics of the county. In 1858 the great silver rush began in Napa Valley, and miners flocked to the eastern hills. While gold was being prospected in other areas of the state in the 1850s, Napa County became a center for [[silver]] and [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] mining. In the 1860s, mining carried on, on a large scale, with quicksilver mines operating in many areas of Napa County.\n\nIn 1866 John Lawley established a toll road from Calistoga over Mount Saint Helena to Lake County.\n\n[[File:Mount Saint Helena, viewed from Napa Valley.JPG|right|thumb|Young vineyard in the valley with [[Mount Saint Helena]] in the background]]\n\n[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book ''[[The Silverado Squatters]]'' provides a snapshot of life and insight into some of the characters that lived around the valley during the later part of the 19th century. Stevenson, accompanied by his new bride [[Fanny Vandegrift]] and her 12-year-old son from a previous marriage, [[Lloyd Osbourne]], spent the late spring and early summer of 1880 honeymooning in an abandoned bunk house at a played-out mine near the summit of Mount Saint Helena. In the book, Stevenson's descriptive writing style documented his ventures in the area and profiled several of the early pioneers who played a role in shaping the region's commerce and society. Stevenson's book also brought attention to the various spas and hot springs in the county.  From Calistoga to \u00c6etna Springs in Pope Valley to Soda Springs Resort a few miles east of Napa, tourists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries made the county their destination much the same as modern day tourists. The resorts became very popular with San Franciscans anxious to escape the cold and foggy weather that often plagues the city to enjoy the warmer climate Napa County offered.\n\nIn the mid-1880s, entrepreneur [[Samuel Brannan]] purchased land in the northern end of the valley at the foot of Mount Saint Helena and founded Calistoga. He began developing it as a resort town taking advantage of or the area's numerous mineral hot springs. He also founded the Napa Valley Railroad Company in 1864 to bring tourists to Calistoga from [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|San Francisco ferry boats]] that docked in [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]]. Brannan's railroad venture failed and was sold at a foreclosure sale in 1869. The railroad eventually came under the ownership of [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] late in the 19th century.\n\nThe [[Veterans Home of California Yountville]] was established in Yountville in 1884 by the San Francisco chapter of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. The State of California assumed administration of the Home in 1897.<ref name=\"AutoZC-8\"/>\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n[[File:Napa Valley grapes Photo D Ramey Logan 02.JPG|right|thumb|Napa Valley grapes]]\nBy the end of the 1900s, farmers had planted over 500,000 fruit and nut trees in the county, especially plums and pears. This helped to soften the blows to the agricultural economy caused by the phylloxera infestation in the county's vineyards and upcoming prohibition that crippled the wine industry, but resulted in a boom for shipping grapes to immigrant, home winemakers across the country.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[Basalt Rock Company]] located south of the City of Napa on the Napa River, built 3 dozen [[Rescue and salvage ship|salvage rescue tugs]] for the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=\"AutoZC-9\"/> Following the war, several small and medium size businesses began operating in the County. A large majority of these businesses were related to the wine industry and tourism. Agriculture in the county remained very diverse until late in the 20th century when wine grapes again became the primary focus. While vineyards were planted on well over 90% of the agricultural land in the county, by the end of the 20th century, modern day farmers have recently begun exploring the possibility of raising other food crops in order to again diversify and take advantage of growing conditions.<ref name=\"AutoZC-10\"/>\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m. on August 24, 2014, the area was struck by a [[2014 South Napa earthquake|magnitude 6.0 earthquake]] centered {{convert|3.7|mi|km}} northwest of the city of [[American Canyon, California|American Canyon]].<ref name=\"BBC-28918600\"/><ref name=\"AutoZC-11\"/>\n\nIn October 2017, parts of the county were affected by [[October 2017 Northern California wildfires|wildfires]].\n\nFrom June to July 2018, the [[County Fire]] affected a small part of Napa County after crossing over from [[Yolo County, California]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php/news/56691-county-fire-grows-crosses-into-napa-county-more-evacuation-orders-advisories-issued|title=County fire grows, crosses into Napa County; more evacuation orders, advisories issued|last=Larson|first=Elizabeth|date=1 July 2018|work=Lake County News|access-date=27 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, heavy smoke and unscheduled black outs by [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] of up to 20,000 customers affected the county due to fierce winds and threats from the [[Kincade Fire]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/more-outages-strike-napa-county-after-fierce-overnight-winds-local/article_73775681-7e0e-5768-a5bd-f8c6400eda8a.html|title=More outages strike Napa County after fierce overnight winds; local shelters to open for Sonoma County wildfire evacuees|last=Yune|first=Howard|date=27 October 2019|work=Napa Valley Register|access-date=27 October 2019|last2=Sweeney|first2=Cynthia|publication-place=Napa, California}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rolling hills of the Napa valley.jpg|thumb|right|Rolling hills of Napa Valley]]\n[[File:Fall in Napa Valley.jpg|right|thumb|Fall in Napa Valley]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|789|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|748|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|40|sqmi}} (5.1%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\"/>\n\nNapa is warmer in the summer than [[Sonoma County]], to the west, or [[Santa Barbara County]], a wine-producing county in southern California. Thus, the Napa wineries favor varietals such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], while [[Pinot noir]] and [[Chardonnay]] are more the specialty of Sonoma and Santa Barbara wineries. At the north end of Napa County, in the [[Mayacamas Mountains]], lies Mount Saint Helena, the Bay Area's second tallest peak at 4,344 feet (1,323 m) and home to [[Robert Louis Stevenson State Park]]; [[Snell Valley]] is also situated in northern Napa County; the [[Missimer Wildflower Preserve]] is within Snell Valley.

By the end of the nineteenth century, there were more than 140 wineries in the area. Several still exist in the valley including Charles Krug Winery, Schramsberg, [[Chateau Montelena]], Nichelini and Beringer. Viticulture in Napa suffered a setback when [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] was enacted in 1920.<ref name=\"AutoZC-21\"/>  Furthering the damage was an infestation of the [[phylloxera]] root louse which killed many of the vines through the valley. These two events caused many wineries to shut down and stalled the growth of the wine industry in Napa County for years. But for many Italian and Swiss families as farm labor in the vineyards, Prohibition offered the unique opportunity for the growing and shipping of grapes to immigrant homewinemakers across the country. Charles Forni, who received a gold coin as his first U.S. dollar upon arriving, rose to be a large shipper. The Mondavi family came West from the Minnesota ore-country to Lodi to ship grapes to the \"Italian Club\" miners. When Prohibition stopped in 1933, the price of grapes crashed to below $24 per ton. Then A.P. Giannini, founder of Bank of America at San Francisco, started to promote to rebuild the commerce of wine and viticulture. Following the [[Second World War]], the  wine industry in Napa again began to grow.  But cattle and prunes were king.\n\n[[File:RobertMondavi.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Mondavi Winery, Napa]]\nIn 1965, Napa Valley icon [[Robert Mondavi]] broke away from his family's Charles Krug estate to found his own. This was the first new large scale winery to be established in the valley since before prohibition. After the establishment of the Mondavi estate, the number of wineries in the valley continued to grow, as did the region's reputation. Consumer trends followed the 60s free lifestyle for experimentation. The old \"paesano\" customers of \"dego red\" gallon jug wines changed to young women who considered white wine, not beer, as their new drink of choice for romance. Robert Mondavi Winery attracted new wine aficionados by introducing the larger, 1.5 liter wine bottle for an image of affordable quality.\n\n[[File:ChateauMontelena.jpg|thumb|right|Chateau Montelena]]\nIn addition to large scale wineries, Napa Valley's boutique wineries produce some of the world's best wines. The producers of these wines include but are not limited to: [[Araujo Estate Wines|Araujo]], Bryant Family, Monticello Vineyards, [[Ceja Vineyards]], Chimney Rock Winery, [[Colgin Cellars]], Dalla Valle Maya, Diamond Creek, [[Dominus Estate]], [[Duckhorn Vineyards]], Dunn Howell Mountain, [[Grace Family Vineyards]], [[Harlan Estate]], Husic, Kistler, Jericho Canyon Vineyards, Marcassin, Rutherford Hill Winery, [[Screaming Eagle Winery and Vineyards|Screaming Eagle]], Sequoia Grove, Shafer Hillside Select, Steltzner Vineyards, and Bouchaine Vineyards.\n\nToday Napa Valley features more than four hundred wineries and grows many different grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, [[Merlot]], [[Zinfandel]], and other popular varietals. As many as five million people visit the area each year.\n\n==Agricultural preservation==\n[[File:Clos du Val Winery, Napa Valley, California, USA (6863361815).jpg|right|thumb|A vineyard in the valley]]\n\nNapa County has maintained a rural agricultural environment in a large part of the valley floor while neighboring Sonoma, Solano and Yolo counties have allowed large tracts of former farmland to be rezoned for commercial and residential development. In 1968 vintners and civic leaders in the county seized an opportunity to preserve farmland by taking advantage of the [[Williamson Act]]<ref name=\"AutoZC-22\"/> enacted by the California Legislature to give landowners property tax relief for designating their land for agricultural purposes. This agricultural preserve<ref name=\"AutoZC-23\"/> on the floor of the valley in unincorporated areas between Napa and Calistoga was the first of its kind in the state.  Initially, the preserve encompassed {{convert|23000|acre|km2|1}},but it has grown to more than {{convert|30000|acre|km2|1}}. In 2010, legislation was passed by the California State Senate and State Assembly and sent to the Governor for signing in the form of Senate Bill 1142. This bill was created to provide relief stream of funding to augment the Williamson Act.<ref name=\"AutoZC-24\"/>\n\nThe county has resisted encroachment on the preserve since it was created with voters reaffirming their desire keep it intact on several occasions. In 1990 voters passed Measure J<ref name=\"AutoZC-25\"/>  adopting an initiative freezing all county zoning changes until the year 2020 unless there is a \u2154 majority vote to adopt such changes.<ref name=\"AutoZC-26\"/>  Measure J was reaffirmed by a 5\u20132 vote of the California Supreme Court in 1995 in the case of Devita v. County of Napa.<ref name=\"AutoZC-27\"/>\n\nThe Land Trust of Napa County<ref name=\"AutoZC-28\"/> was founded in 1976 by a group of local citizens with a mission to protect the natural diversity, scenic open space and agricultural vitality of the county. The trust acquires conservation easements, facilitates land transfers to local, state and federal agencies along with accepting outright donations of land within and outside the boundary of the agricultural preserve. The trust now covers over {{convert|50000|acre|km2|1}}.<ref name=\"AutoZC-29\"/>\n\nWhile establishment of the agricultural preserve and the land trust has slowed residential development in much of the county, residential growth within the incorporated cities has continued at a moderate pace. Several substantial homes have been built on the hills surrounding the valley in areas not covered by the preserve or the land trust. A large portion of the land south of the City of Napa remained undeveloped for many decades until the 1980s. Several wine bottling facilities and [[wine storage]] warehouses now stand on what was once vacant land. A number of light industries have also sprung up in this region as new business parks have been built. The growth of American Canyon,<ref name=\"AutoZC-30\"/> Napa County's southernmost and newest city, incorporated in 1992, has prompted the establishment of several new retail outlets in the southern end of the county in recent years. American Canyon has also established a green belt preserve of over {{convert|1000|acre|km2|1}} on the western and eastern sides of the city.\n\nIn November 2009, the Napa Valley Vintners Association, the Napa Farm Bureau, the Napa Valley Grapegrowers and an advocacy group called Preserving the Integrity of Napa's Agriculture completed a two-year study of [[Genetically Modified Organism|Genetically Engineered Organisms (GEOs)]],<ref name=\"Current Issues NVFB\"/> and released a joint letter recommending no GEO usage in Napa County until the risks and benefits of GEOs are reevaluated and a \"satisfactory\" regulatory framework is put in place.<ref name=\"Joint Letter Napa GEOs\"/>\n\n==Education==\nIn addition to its many public and private schools, two colleges also operate in the County. [[Pacific Union College]], classified as a National [[Liberal Arts College]] by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]], is the county's only four-year college and serves roughly 1,500 students. [[Napa Valley College]], a [[community college]], offers two-year degrees in the county.\n\n=== Library ===\nThe Napa County Library, is the [[public library]] of Napa [[California]].

In all cases, the outbreaks are a direct result of inadequate cleaning, and maintenance, or defects with the construction materials or assembly process. In many cases the building itself is too damaged to recover, as the materials themselves (wood structural members) are decaying from mold or rot. The phenomenon is found worldwide in buildings with lower than adequate maintenance or other economic concerns. Health professionals recommend anyone living in an older building with medical conditions, to use [[HEPA]] [[air filter]]s for indoor use to minimize airborne particulate introduced from outside the living space. Many cases of [[Norwalk virus]] and [[Norovirus]] outbreak have been traced back to [[cruise ship]]s and hotels with food service in unsanitary conditions or substandard restroom cleanliness protocols. Certain symptoms tend to increase in severity with the time people spend in the building; often improving over time or even disappearing when people are away from the building. The main identifying observation is an increased incidence of complaints of symptoms such as headache, eye, nose, and throat irritation, fatigue, and dizziness and nausea from exposure to harmful chemicals released by toxic black mold.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stolwijk|first=J A|date=1991-11-01|title=Sick-building syndrome.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=95|pages=99\u2013100|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1568418|pmid=1821387|doi=10.1289/ehp.919599}}</ref> Some symptoms are linked to the average amount of time spent in a building, such as mold spore and dust inhalation.

Different toxins will aggravate the human body in different ways. Some people are more allergic to mold, while others are highly sensitive to dust. Inadequate ventilation will exaggerate small problems (such as deteriorating fiberglass insulation or cooking fumes) into a much more serious indoor air quality problem. Common products such as paint, insulation, rigid foam, Particle Board, plywood, duct liners, exhaust fumes and other chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants can be trapped inside by the HVAC AC system. As this air is recycled using fan coils the overall oxygenation ratio drops and becomes harmful. When combined with other stress factors such as traffic noise, poor lighting, inhabitants of buildings located in a polluted urban area can quickly become ill as their immune system is overwhelmed.<ref name=\":1\" /> Certain [[volatile organic compounds|VOCs]], considered toxic chemical contaminants to humans, are used as adhesives in all common building construction products. These aromatic carbon rings / VOCs can cause acute and chronic health effects on the occupants of a building, including cancer, paralysis, lung failure, and others. Bacterial spores, fungal spores, mold spores, pollen, and viruses are types of biological contaminants and can all cause allergic reactions or illness described as SBS. In addition, pollution from outdoors, such as motor vehicle exhaust, can infiltrate into poorly designed buildings and contribute to poor indoor air quality, high ppm of CO and CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"Sick Building Syndrome\" /> Adult SBS symptoms were associated with a history of allergic rhinitis, eczema and asthma.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA 2015 study concerning the association of SBS and indoor air pollutants in office buildings in Iran found that, as [[carbon dioxide]] levels increase in a building, symptoms like nausea, headaches, nasal irritation, [[dyspnea]], and throat dryness have also been shown to increase.<ref name=\":1\" /> Certain work conditions have been found to be correlated with specific symptoms.

These can typically be identified, measured, and quantified.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Seltzer|first=J.

Any known cure would be associated with the specific eventual disease that was cause by exposure to known contaminants. In all cases, alleviation consists of removing the affected person from the building associated. BRI, on the other hand, utilizes treatment appropriate for the contaminant identified within the building (e.g., antibiotics for Legionnaire's disease).\n\nIn most cases, simply improving the indoor air quality (IAQ) of a particular building will attenuate, or even eliminate, the continued exposure to toxins. For the individual, the recovery may be a process involved with targeting the acute symptoms of a specific illness, as in the case of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] toxins.<ref>Indoor Air Facts No. 4 (revised) Sick building syndrome. Available from: <nowiki>https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/sick_building_factsheet.pdf</nowiki>.</ref> Treating various building-related illnesses is vital to the overall understanding of SBS. Careful analysis by certified building professionals and Medical Doctors can help to identify the exact cause of the BRI, and help to illustrate a causal path to infection. With this knowledge one can, theoretically, remediate a building of contaminants and rebuild the structure with new materials. Office BRI may more likely than not be explained by three events: \"Wide range in the threshold of response in any population (susceptibility), a spectrum of response to any given agent, or variability in exposure within large office buildings.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Menzies|first=Dick|last2=Bourbeau|first2=Jean|date=1997-11-20|title=Building-Related Illnesses|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=337|issue=21|pages=1524\u20131531|doi=10.1056/NEJM199711203372107|issn=0028-4793|pmid=9366585}}</ref> Isolating any one of the three aspects of office BRI can be a great challenge, which is why those who find themselves with BRI should take three steps, history, examinations, and interventions.

Examinations go hand in hand with monitoring employee health. This step is done by physically examining the entire workspace and evaluating possible threats to health status among employees.

In media it was called \"office illness\". The term \"sick building syndrome\" was coined by the WHO in 1986, when they also estimated that 10\u201330% of newly built office buildings in the West had indoor air problems. Early Danish and British studies reported symptoms.\n\nPoor indoor environments attracted attention. The Swedish allergy study (SOU 1989:76) designated \"sick building\" as a cause of the allergy epidemic as was feared. In the 1990s, therefore, extensive research into \"sick building\" was carried out. Various physical and chemical factors in the buildings were examined on a broad front.\n\nThe problem was highlighted increasingly in media and was described as a \"ticking time bomb\". Many studies were performed in individual buildings.\n\nIn the 1990s \"sick buildings\" were contrasted against \"[[healthy building]]s\". The chemical contents of building materials were highlighted. Many building material manufacturers were actively working to gain control of the chemical content and to replace criticized additives. The ventilation industry advocated above all more well-functioning ventilation. Others perceived ecological construction, natural materials, and simple techniques as a solution.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s came an increased distrust of the concept of \"sick building\". A dissertation at the ''Karolinska Institutet'' in Stockholm 1999 questioned the methodology of previous research, and a Danish study from 2005 showed these flaws experimentally. It was suggested that sick building syndrome was not really a coherent syndrome and was not a disease to be individually diagnosed, but a collection of as many as to dozen semi related diseases. In 2006 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommended in the medical journal ''[[L\u00e4kartidningen]]'' that \"sick building syndrome\" should not be used as a clinical diagnosis. Thereafter, it has become increasingly less common to use terms such as \"sick buildings\" and \"sick building syndrome\" in research. However, the concept remains alive in popular culture and is used to designate the set of symptoms related to poor home or work environment engineering. \"Sick building\" is therefore an expression used especially in the context of workplace health.\n\nSick building syndrome made a rapid journey from media to courtroom where professional engineers and architects became named defendants and were represented by their respective professional practice insurers. Proceedings invariably relied on expert witnesses, medical and technical experts along with building managers, contractors and manufacturers of finishes and furnishings, testifying as to cause and effect. Most of these actions resulted in sealed settlement agreements, none of these being dramatic. The insurers needed a defense based upon Standards of Professional Practice to meet a court decision that declared that in a modern, essentially sealed building, the HVAC systems must produce breathing air for suitable human consumption. ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers, currently with over 50,000 international members) undertook the task of codifying its indoor air quality (IAQ) standard.\n\nASHRAE empirical research determined that \"acceptability\" was a function of outdoor (fresh air) ventilation rate and used carbon dioxide as an accurate measurement of occupant presence and activity. Building odors and contaminants would be suitably controlled by this dilution methodology. ASHRAE codified a level of 1,000 ppm of carbon dioxide and specified the use of widely available sense-and-control equipment to assure compliance. The 1989 issue of ASHRAE 62.1-1989 published the whys and wherefores and overrode the 1981 requirements that were aimed at a ventilation level of 5,000 ppm of carbon dioxide, (the OAHA workplace limit), federally set to minimize HVAC system energy consumption. This apparently ended the SBS epidemic.\n\nOver time, building materials changed with respect to emissions potential. Smoking vanished and dramatic improvements in ambient air quality, coupled with code compliant ventilation and maintenance, per ASHRAE standards have all contributed to the acceptability of the indoor air environment. Only time and the courts will tell how right, or wrong ASHRAE is.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/sick_building_factsheet.pdf|title=Sick Building Syndrome - Fact Sheet|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]| accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sick-building-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=Sick Building Syndrome |publisher=[[National Health Service]], England|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerotoxic syndrome]]\n* [[Havana syndrome]]\n* [[Healthy building]]\n* [[Multiple chemical sensitivity]]\n* [[NASA Clean Air Study]]\n* [[Somatization disorder]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mart\u00edn-Gil J., Yanguas M.

In all cases, the outbreaks are a direct result of inadequate cleaning, and maintenance, or defects with the construction materials or assembly process. In many cases the building itself is too damaged to recover, as the materials themselves (wood structural members) are decaying from mold or rot. The phenomenon is found worldwide in buildings with lower than adequate maintenance or other economic concerns. Health professionals recommend anyone living in an older building with medical conditions, to use [[HEPA]] [[air filter]]s for indoor use to minimize airborne particulate introduced from outside the living space. Many cases of [[Norwalk virus]] and [[Norovirus]] outbreak have been traced back to [[cruise ship]]s and hotels with food service in unsanitary conditions or substandard restroom cleanliness protocols. Certain symptoms tend to increase in severity with the time people spend in the building; often improving over time or even disappearing when people are away from the building. The main identifying observation is an increased incidence of complaints of symptoms such as headache, eye, nose, and throat irritation, fatigue, and dizziness and nausea from exposure to harmful chemicals released by toxic black mold.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stolwijk|first=J A|date=1991-11-01|title=Sick-building syndrome.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=95|pages=99\u2013100|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1568418|pmid=1821387|doi=10.1289/ehp.919599}}</ref> Some symptoms are linked to the average amount of time spent in a building, such as mold spore and dust inhalation.

In some cases \u2013 particularly in sensitive individuals \u2013 there can be long-term health effects.\n\n==Cause==\n[[ASHRAE]] has recognized that polluted urban air, designated within the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s air quality ratings as unacceptable requires the installation of treatment such as filtration for which the [[HVAC]] practitioners generally apply carbon-impregnated filters and their likes. Different toxins will aggravate the human body in different ways. Some people are more allergic to mold, while others are highly sensitive to dust. Inadequate ventilation will exaggerate small problems (such as deteriorating fiberglass insulation or cooking fumes) into a much more serious indoor air quality problem. Common products such as paint, insulation, rigid foam, Particle Board, plywood, duct liners, exhaust fumes and other chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants can be trapped inside by the HVAC AC system. As this air is recycled using fan coils the overall oxygenation ratio drops and becomes harmful. When combined with other stress factors such as traffic noise, poor lighting, inhabitants of buildings located in a polluted urban area can quickly become ill as their immune system is overwhelmed.<ref name=\":1\" /> Certain [[volatile organic compounds|VOCs]], considered toxic chemical contaminants to humans, are used as adhesives in all common building construction products. These aromatic carbon rings / VOCs can cause acute and chronic health effects on the occupants of a building, including cancer, paralysis, lung failure, and others. Bacterial spores, fungal spores, mold spores, pollen, and viruses are types of biological contaminants and can all cause allergic reactions or illness described as SBS. In addition, pollution from outdoors, such as motor vehicle exhaust, can infiltrate into poorly designed buildings and contribute to poor indoor air quality, high ppm of CO and CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"Sick Building Syndrome\" /> Adult SBS symptoms were associated with a history of allergic rhinitis, eczema and asthma.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA 2015 study concerning the association of SBS and indoor air pollutants in office buildings in Iran found that, as [[carbon dioxide]] levels increase in a building, symptoms like nausea, headaches, nasal irritation, [[dyspnea]], and throat dryness have also been shown to increase.<ref name=\":1\" /> Certain work conditions have been found to be correlated with specific symptoms.

Any known cure would be associated with the specific eventual disease that was cause by exposure to known contaminants. In all cases, alleviation consists of removing the affected person from the building associated. BRI, on the other hand, utilizes treatment appropriate for the contaminant identified within the building (e.g., antibiotics for Legionnaire's disease).\n\nIn most cases, simply improving the indoor air quality (IAQ) of a particular building will attenuate, or even eliminate, the continued exposure to toxins.

Careful analysis by certified building professionals and Medical Doctors can help to identify the exact cause of the BRI, and help to illustrate a causal path to infection. With this knowledge one can, theoretically, remediate a building of contaminants and rebuild the structure with new materials.

For example, men\u2019s workplace tend to be significantly larger and have all around better job characteristics. Secondly, there was a noticeable difference in reporting rates, finding that women have higher rates of reporting roughly 20% higher than men. This information was similar to that found in previous studies, indicating a potential difference in willingness to report.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThere might be a [[gender]] difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men do. Along with this, some studies have found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial [[erythema]]. Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors because they have a greater tendency to have clerical jobs, wherein they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: [[blueprint]] machines), whereas men often have jobs based outside of offices.<ref>Godish, Thad (2001). ''Indoor Environmental quality.'' New York: CRC Press. pp. 196\u2013197. {{ISBN|1-56670-402-2}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{or-section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the late 1970s, it was noted that nonspecific symptoms were reported by tenants in newly constructed homes, offices, and nurseries. In media it was called \"office illness\". The term \"sick building syndrome\" was coined by the WHO in 1986, when they also estimated that 10\u201330% of newly built office buildings in the West had indoor air problems. Early Danish and British studies reported symptoms.\n\nPoor indoor environments attracted attention. The Swedish allergy study (SOU 1989:76) designated \"sick building\" as a cause of the allergy epidemic as was feared. In the 1990s, therefore, extensive research into \"sick building\" was carried out. Various physical and chemical factors in the buildings were examined on a broad front.\n\nThe problem was highlighted increasingly in media and was described as a \"ticking time bomb\". Many studies were performed in individual buildings.\n\nIn the 1990s \"sick buildings\" were contrasted against \"[[healthy building]]s\". The chemical contents of building materials were highlighted. Many building material manufacturers were actively working to gain control of the chemical content and to replace criticized additives. The ventilation industry advocated above all more well-functioning ventilation. Others perceived ecological construction, natural materials, and simple techniques as a solution.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s came an increased distrust of the concept of \"sick building\". A dissertation at the ''Karolinska Institutet'' in Stockholm 1999 questioned the methodology of previous research, and a Danish study from 2005 showed these flaws experimentally. It was suggested that sick building syndrome was not really a coherent syndrome and was not a disease to be individually diagnosed, but a collection of as many as to dozen semi related diseases. In 2006 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommended in the medical journal ''[[L\u00e4kartidningen]]'' that \"sick building syndrome\" should not be used as a clinical diagnosis. Thereafter, it has become increasingly less common to use terms such as \"sick buildings\" and \"sick building syndrome\" in research. However, the concept remains alive in popular culture and is used to designate the set of symptoms related to poor home or work environment engineering. \"Sick building\" is therefore an expression used especially in the context of workplace health.\n\nSick building syndrome made a rapid journey from media to courtroom where professional engineers and architects became named defendants and were represented by their respective professional practice insurers. Proceedings invariably relied on expert witnesses, medical and technical experts along with building managers, contractors and manufacturers of finishes and furnishings, testifying as to cause and effect. Most of these actions resulted in sealed settlement agreements, none of these being dramatic. The insurers needed a defense based upon Standards of Professional Practice to meet a court decision that declared that in a modern, essentially sealed building, the HVAC systems must produce breathing air for suitable human consumption. ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers, currently with over 50,000 international members) undertook the task of codifying its indoor air quality (IAQ) standard.\n\nASHRAE empirical research determined that \"acceptability\" was a function of outdoor (fresh air) ventilation rate and used carbon dioxide as an accurate measurement of occupant presence and activity. Building odors and contaminants would be suitably controlled by this dilution methodology. ASHRAE codified a level of 1,000 ppm of carbon dioxide and specified the use of widely available sense-and-control equipment to assure compliance. The 1989 issue of ASHRAE 62.1-1989 published the whys and wherefores and overrode the 1981 requirements that were aimed at a ventilation level of 5,000 ppm of carbon dioxide, (the OAHA workplace limit), federally set to minimize HVAC system energy consumption. This apparently ended the SBS epidemic.\n\nOver time, building materials changed with respect to emissions potential. Smoking vanished and dramatic improvements in ambient air quality, coupled with code compliant ventilation and maintenance, per ASHRAE standards have all contributed to the acceptability of the indoor air environment. Only time and the courts will tell how right, or wrong ASHRAE is.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/sick_building_factsheet.pdf|title=Sick Building Syndrome - Fact Sheet|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]| accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sick-building-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=Sick Building Syndrome |publisher=[[National Health Service]], England|accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerotoxic syndrome]]\n* [[Havana syndrome]]\n* [[Healthy building]]\n* [[Multiple chemical sensitivity]]\n* [[NASA Clean Air Study]]\n* [[Somatization disorder]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mart\u00edn-Gil J., Yanguas M.

It annually hosts the [[Snake River Stampede Rodeo|Snake River Stampede]], considered one of the nation's top rodeos, during the third week in July. The Stampede moved indoors to the Ford Arena in 1997; it was formerly held in an outdoor stadium (now demolished) near Lakeview Park.<ref>[http://www.snakeriverstampede.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=126&Itemid=208 Snake River Stampede.com] - history - accessed 2011-10-27</ref> Since 1999, the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR) has hosted a [[Built Ford Tough Series]] (originally Bud Light Cup) event at the Ford Idaho Center in what has been a major stop of the tour.\n\nFord Arena is used for concerts, trade shows, sporting events, and other events. It is the former home of the [[Idaho Stampede]], then of the [[Continental Basketball Association]] from 1997 to 2005 and the [[Idaho Stallions]] of the now defunct [[Indoor Professional Football League]] in their inaugural season of 1999.  \nFord Arena is the former home of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Division II Men's Basketball Tournament. Upon its completion, the tournament moved to the Ford Idaho Center in 1998 from its former home on the campus of [[Northwest Nazarene University]].  The tournament moved in 2000 when NNU left the NAIA to join the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] in [[NCAA Division II|Division II]].\n\n== History ==\nIn March 2004, the Ford Idaho Center Arena was the home court for the [[Boise State Broncos|Boise State]] [[Boise State Broncos men's basketball|men's basketball team]] for a second round matchup in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] against the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee|UWM Panthers]]. The game was moved to the Ford Idaho Center due to a prior scheduled [[Metallica]] concert at Boise State's [[Taco Bell Arena]]. The game drew a crowd of 10,153, the largest for a basketball game in the arena's history. BSU and [[Idaho Vandals men's basketball|Idaho]] played a non-conference basketball game at the arena on December 31, 2011; the Broncos won 76-73 before 7,540 spectators.<ref>[http://www.espnnorthwest.com/article/2011/dec/31/turnovers-cost-vandals-loss-boise/ ESPN Northwest] - Turnovers cost Vandals in loss to Boise  - 2011-12-31</ref>\n\nThe Amphitheater opened on June 15, 1998 with a concert by [[Country music]] legend [[Shania Twain]] during her [[Come On Over Tour]]. Since then it has held concerts by musicians like [[Tim McGraw]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Jack Johnson]] and [[James Taylor]].\n\nThe Ford Amphitheater has played host to music festivals, including the [[Vans Warped Tour]], the [[Gigantour]], [[Lilith Fair]], and the [[Mayhem Festival]].\n\n[[Pearl Jam]] performed during their [[Binaural Tour]] on November 3, 2000, with [[Supergrass]] as their opening act. The show was filmed and later released as a live album, titled ''[[11/3/00 \u2013 Boise, Idaho]]''.\n\n[[The Rolling Stones]] played their first concert in the state of Idaho at the arena during their [[A Bigger Bang Tour]] on Tuesday, November 14, 2006.<ref>[http://www.iorr.org/tour05/boise.htm io0rr.org/tour05/boise] - accessed 2011-10-27</ref>\n\nThe Ford Idaho Center has been the Treasure Valley stop for the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]], [[Disney on Ice]] and [[Champions on Ice]] since it opened.\n\nOn January 14, 2014, the City of Nampa announced [[Ford]] as the new title sponsor for the Idaho Center.

The underlying bone is a virtual mold of the overlying horny structure and therefore has the same shape as the claw or nail.
