She was educated at [[St Louis High School, Rathmines]]. Her father was a [[fiddler]], who came from [[Rathlin Island]] off the coast of [[Northern Ireland]], her mother a singer, and her brothers had their own musical group called [[The Black Family (band)|The Black Brothers]] and her younger sister [[Frances Black|Frances]] would go on to achieve great success as a singer in the 90s. From this musical background, Mary began singing [[Music of Ireland|traditional Irish songs]] at the age of eight. As she grew older, she began to perform with her siblings (Shay, Michael and Martin Black) in small clubs around Dublin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.black-brothers.com/library/blackfamily.htm |title=The Black Brothers |publisher=The Black Brothers |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907120041/http://www.black-brothers.com/library/blackfamily.htm |archive-date=7 September 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===1980s===\nBlack joined a small [[folk music|folk]] band in 1975 called General Humbert, with whom she toured Europe and released two albums, in 1975 and 1978. In 1982 she developed a professional relationship with musician/[[Record producer|producer]] [[Declan Sinnott]]<ref name=\"EnscrtyGuardian\">{{cite web|title=Declan Sinnott: Guitar star hits the right chords|url=http://www.independent.ie/regionals/enniscorthyguardian/lifestyle/declan-sinnott-guitar-star-hits-the-right-chords-27229465.html|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers (Ireland)]]|date=6 May 2009}}</ref>  and recorded her first solo album, ''Mary Black''. The album performed well in the Irish charts and it went [[RIAA certification|gold]]. In 1983 it was honoured by the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' and it is still referred to as one of the best Irish albums of the 1980s. Black ventured into the traditional [[Irish music]] band [[De Dannan]] and toured with them around Europe and in the US. The album she recorded with them ''Anthem'', won the Irish Album of the Year award. During her time with De Dannan, Black continued with her solo career with albums such as ''Collected'' (1984) and ''Without the Fanfare'' (1985). These recordings took Black into a more modern musical direction. Along with the success of these releases, [[Irish Recorded Music Association|IRMA]] named her Entertainer of the Year in 1986 and Best Female Artist in 1987 and 1988.\n\nFor much of her early solo career, Sinnott acted as her producer, guitarist and musical director. This partnership lasted until 1995 when they parted amicably.<ref name=\"ut-lls-1975\">{{cite AV media |year=1995 |title= The Late Late Show |medium= TV|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6Qazt9r5bE|accessdate= 4 March 2013 |time= 0:15|publisher= [[RT\u00c9]]}}</ref>\n\nBlack departed from De Dannan in 1986 and 1987 saw the release of her first [[multi-platinum]] Irish album, ''By the Time it Gets Dark''. However, her popularity reached new heights with the release of the ground-breaking album, ''[[No Frontiers]]'', in August 1989.  It rocketed to the top of the Irish album charts (it stayed in the Top 30 for over a year), and achieved triple-platinum status. Mary's popularity grew in the United States, due to several tours and widespread radio exposure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sweetslyrics.com/bio-Mary%20Black.html |title=Mary Black Biography |publisher=Sweetslyrics |accessdate=2012-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215145616/http://www.sweetslyrics.com/bio-Mary%20Black.html |archivedate=15 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nFollowing the success of ''No Frontiers'' in the United States, and the extensive [[Airplay (radio)|airplay]] received by the lead track \"Columbus\", Black became a hit NAC recording artist. In spring 1991, she embarked on an American tour. Her 1991 release, ''Babes in the Wood'', entered the Irish charts at No.1 once again and remained there for six weeks. Her single \"The Thorn Upon the Rose\" reached No.8 on the Japanese singles chart after it was used in a national railroad television advert. ''Babes in the Wood'' performed well in the US and it was voted one of the top 10 albums of the year in the United Kingdom by ''Today'' newspaper. The album release brought about a sell-out tour and her first concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in January, 1992, which was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] a year later. She was once again named Best Female Artist by the IRMA.\n\nMary was featured on the cover of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in a story hailing her as \"a firm favorite to join the heavy-hitting ranks of such Irish artists as [[Enya]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]]'s [[M\u00e1ire Brennan]] in the international marketplace\". Her next album ''The Holy Ground'' once again reached the top of the Irish album chart. She also toured the US during October/November 1993, in support of the album. The next project saw Mary join forces with six Irish female artists to record the compilation album, ''[[A Woman's Heart (compilation album)|A Woman's Heart]]''. Other artists here included her sister [[Frances Black]], [[Eleanor McEvoy]], [[Dolores Keane]], [[Sharon Shannon]] and [[Maura O'Connell]]. Its good sales success spawned another album, ''A Woman's Heart 2''.\n\nBlack recorded two duets with American folk singer [[Joan Baez]] in the spring of 1995, for Baez's album ''[[Ring Them Bells]]''. A greatest hits album of Mary's work, ''Looking Back'', was released and she went touring mainly in the US, Germany and Scandinavia, to support the release. Black released three more albums in the 1990s, ''Circus'', ''Shine'', and ''Speaking with the Angel''. She was named \"Best Female Artist\" in 1994 and 1996 for the fourth and fifth time.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nBlack released her first live album in 2003, ''Mary Black Live''. She also released her only [[studio album]] of the 2000s decade, ''Full Tide''. Although it was successful, she has kept a low musical profile in the last few years. In 2008, Black released a compilation album called \"Twenty Five Years - Twenty Five Songs\" celebrating her career in the music business. It contains 4 remixed tracks, fully remastered songs and 2 brand new recordings. In 2008, Black was invited to sing a duet on Christie Hennessy's posthumous album \"The Two Of Us\" called \"If You Were To Fall\". She also made a guest appearance on Liam Clancy's album \"The Wheels Of Life\" on the track \"Talk To Me Of Mendocino\". In 2009 she is featured on one track of [[Steve Martin]]'s album ''[[The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo]]''.   In 2011, she released a new album titled ''Stories from the Steeples''. She has sang a duet live with [[Ireland|Irish]] pop band [[Westlife]] entitled \"Walking in the Air\".\n\nA 2014-15 \"Last Call\" tour with her daughter [[R\u00f3is\u00edn O]] is billed as Black's final international tour although she intends to continue singing after this.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/swansong-for-mary-black-as-singer-plans-final-foreign-tour-29874063.html | title=Swansong for Mary Black as singer plans final foreign tour | first=Laura | last=Butler | newspaper=Independent | location=Ireland | date=30 December 2013 | accessdate=24 October 2014 }}</ref> Her autobiography ''Down the Crooked Road'' ({{ISBN|9781848271876}}) was published in October 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2014/10/irish_singer_mary_black_makes.html | title=Irish singer Mary Black makes final U.S. visit with 'The Last Call Tour ' stop at Music Box Supper Club | date=20 October 2014 | first=Chuck | last=Yarborough | newspaper=The Plain Dealer | location=Cleveland | accessdate=24 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Black released a remastered version of her 1987 album, \"By The Time It Gets Dark\", to celebrate its 30th anniversary.

The Temple family owned the school until 1977, with Dickinson serving in an [[ex officio]] capacity.  In 1968 Westlake became exclusively a secondary school.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Merger ===\nAs both schools continued to grow in size towards the late 1980s, and as gender exclusivity became less of a factor both in the schools' reputations and desirability, the trustees of both Harvard and Westlake effectuated a merger in 1989.

[[convocation]] of the legislative branch of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], [[Ukraine]]'s [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. The 9th convocation meets at the [[Verkhovna Rada building]] in [[Kiev]], having begun its term on 29 August 2019 following the last session of the [[8th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada|8th Verkhovna Rada]].\n\nThe 9th Verkhovna Rada's composition is based upon the results of the [[2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election|October 26, 2019 parliamentary election]], which was contested eight months after the [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election]]. Ukraine's head of state during the parliament's term is [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]]. Eleven parties were represented in the Verkhovna Rada, although only five of them surpassed the mandatory five percent [[election threshold]] to gain representation based on the [[proportional representation]] system.\n\n==Post-election developments==\n\nA total of 27 [[Electoral district|constituencies]] were not elected due to various events taking place in the country. A total of 10 constituencies in the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] and two in the [[Sevastopol|City of Sevastopol]] were not elected due to the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 Crimean crisis]] and subsequent [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] by Russia, while a further nine constituencies in [[Donetsk Oblast]] and six constituencies in [[Luhansk Oblast]] were not elected due to the ongoing War in Donbass.

Created in 2012 by co-hosts Hanson and [[JonTron|Jon Jafari]], the series centers around its hosts playing video games while adding comedic commentary. After Jafari left the show in 2013 to focus on his own [[YouTube]] webseries, [[Jon Jafari#JonTron|''JonTron'']], he was succeeded by Avidan. The [[YouTube]] channel for ''Game Grumps'' currently operates under [[Jetpak|JETPAK]], a network created by [[Adam Montoya]].<ref name=\"INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT\">{{cite web|url=http://3blackdot.com/influencers/|title=INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT|website=3blackdot.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714020956/http://3blackdot.com/influencers/|archive-date=2017-07-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince Jafari's departure, the channel has expanded to include other hosts, besides the main two, who have floated in and out of the channel over time as a part of spin-off shows. Those include [[Ross O'Donovan]], Barry Kramer, Suzy Berhow, and [[Brian Wecht]], as well as various guest hosts. {{as of|2020|3}}, ''Game Grumps'' has over 5.23 million subscribers and over 5 billion total video views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/GameGrumps|title=GameGrumps|website=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210155034/http://www.youtube.com/user/GameGrumps|archive-date=2013-12-10|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref> Game Grumps have also developed and published two of their own video games, ''[[Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator]]'' and ''Soviet Jump Game'', as well as writing the [[young adult novel]] ''Ghost Hunters Adventure Club and the Secret of the Grande Chateau''.\n\n==Format==\nEpisodes usually consist of two hosts or more, playing a video game, featuring their commentary, experience with (and opinions of) the chosen game, as well as related and unrelated discussions, along with stories from their lives. Many of the games played on the show are sent in by fans, who mail in games to the Grumps\u2019 PO box in Glendale, California.<ref name=\"5 facts\">{{cite web |url=http://heavy.com/games/2017/08/game-grumps-animated-arin-danny-jontron-good-game-dream-daddy/ |title=Game Grumps: Five Fast Facts You Need to Know |first=Jack |last=Fennimore |publisher=Heavy |date=August 30, 2017 |accessdate=November 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040013/http://heavy.com/games/2017/08/game-grumps-animated-arin-danny-jontron-good-game-dream-daddy/ |archive-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> The channel typically uploads two or three episodes each day. Lengthier games often result in ongoing series, which continue airing until completion, unless ending early in favor of beginning a new series. Occasionally, the hosts will participate and compete in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games, as part of their ''Game Grumps VS'' series. Though the episodes usually consist of two or more people, there are some special episodes with Hanson or Avidan alone.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Game Grumps Founders.png|left|thumb|[[Arin Hanson]] (''left, pictured in 2011'') and [[JonTron|Jon Jafari]] (''right, pictured in 2016'') created Game Grumps in 2012 and hosted it together until 2013|alt=]]\n''Game Grumps'' was created by [[JonTron|Jon \"JonTron\" Jafari]] and [[Egoraptor|Arin \"Egoraptor\" Hanson]], and began with a video of the two playing ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' uploaded on July 18, 2012 to video streaming site [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> According to Jafari and Hanson, the idea for the show came about when the two were arguing over whether or not the character Wolf from the fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' was too similar to the character Fox in terms of their fighting styles. After animator Ross O\u2019Donovan told the duo about their tendency to be \u201cgrumpy\u201d with each other over video games, Hanson came up with the idea of a [[podcast]] revolving around this concept, though the show ultimately became a video series on YouTube rather than a podcast.<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> In September 2012, Barry Kramer was brought onto the show as an editor.<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> Hanson and Jafari worked on the show together until June 25, 2013, when Jafari announced he would be leaving the show due to desires to focus on [[JonTron|his own show]]. Many fans were upset by Jafari's departure from ''Game Grumps'', with many expressing disappointment in the decision's last-minute announcement, as well as the channel's decision to announce the beginning of ''Steam Train'' on the same day.<ref name=\"INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT\"/> After Jafari's departure, [[Ninja Sex Party]] vocalist [[Dan Avidan]] succeeded him as co-host of the main show. Avidan also joined animator [[Ross O'Donovan]] as co-host of the show ''Steam Train'' where both play [[Personal computer|PC]] games. This expanded the channel's output to three videos a day: two standard ''Game Grumps'' episodes and a single ''Steam Train'' episode. ''Steam Train'' later expanded to include Hanson as a co-host at times, as well as featuring one of the group's editors, Barry Kramer, and Hanson's wife Suzy Berhow. The expansion also introduced a new ''Steam Rolled'' series, where four-player games (not necessarily PC games) are played by the group.\n\nIn October 2013, the group began a gameplay series featuring ''[[Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate]]'' on the Polaris YouTube channel, titled ''Hunting Monsters''. A second installment, featuring ''[[Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate]]'', began in February 2015.\n[[File:Game Grumps Kiss.png|left|thumb|The current hosts of Game Grumps, [[Dan Avidan]] (top) and [[Arin Hanson]] (bottom), in 2015]]\nIn December 2013, Kramer and Berhow began hosting ''Table Flip'', where they dress in [[Victorian era|Victorian]]/[[The United States in the 19th century|19th century American]] period clothing<ref>{{cite web|title=18th Century-ish Table Flip Theme? \u2013 Suzy and Barry Game Grumps AMA|url=http://www.polarisgo.com/video/uWcw7LY2Sr7w/search/table+flip/page/0|publisher=Polaris|accessdate=28 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305064847/http://www.polarisgo.com/video/uWcw7LY2Sr7w/search/table+flip/page/0|archive-date=2014-03-05|url-status=live}}</ref> and play [[tabletop game]]s, such as [[card game]]s, [[board game]]s, and [[tile-based game]]s with other YouTube personalities.

Although Abernathy took on editing for most of the series, Kramer continued to edit ''Steam Train''. Since Abernathy's departure from the show in mid-2016, Kramer, Ryan Magee, and Matt Watson have taken on editing duties.\n\nIn January 2015, to celebrate reaching two million subscribers, a new show called ''Grumpcade'' was launched, featuring any combination of co-hosts playing console games. The show also features guest YouTube personalities, including game critics ProJared, The Completionist and [[Markiplier]]. Shortly after, in February 2015, GrumpOut, a channel dedicated to recreational and live-action video projects, was created. In November 2015, Avidan's [[Ninja Sex Party]] bandmate [[Brian Wecht]] officially joined the team, leaving behind his career as a [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]].\n\nThe channel also airs special holiday-themed series, featuring holiday-themed games, including ''Jingle Grumps'' and ''Steam Sleigh'' for Christmas, ''Ghoul Grumps'' and ''Scream Train'' for Halloween, ''Date Grumps'', ''Single Train'' and ''Love Train'' for Valentine's Day, and ''Stout Train'' for St. Patrick's Day.\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at [[The Improv|Hollywood Improv]] for a special performance of ''Game Grumps Live'' on March 30<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/701899486491185152| title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-02-27}}</ref> and 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/702676696005128192| title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://hollywood.improv.com/event.cfm?cart&id=440599| title = Game Grumps LIVE| website = hollywood.improv.com| access-date = 2016-02-27| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301082843/http://hollywood.improv.com/event.cfm?cart&id=440599| archivedate = 2016-03-01}}</ref> Later, in April 2016, it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at Levity Live in [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]], [[New York (state)|New York]] for more performances of ''Game Grumps Live'' on April 29 and 30.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/717388267872591872|title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://nyack.levitylive.com/| title = Levity Live| website = Levity Live| access-date = 2016-04-13| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160412022047/http://nyack.levitylive.com/| archive-date = 2016-04-12| url-status = live}}</ref> ''Game Grumps Live'' has since gone on to become a regularly-touring entity, performing across the United States and Canada in brief regional stints at a time.[[File:Game Grumps members.png|thumb|[[Suzy Berhow]] (left), [[Arin Hanson]] (center, bottom), [[Barry Kramer]] (center, top), and [[Ross O'Donovan]], pictured in 2015, are all members of Game Grumps]]On January 6, 2017, it was announced that the show's middle slot would no longer upload on a consistent schedule.

After Jafari left the show in 2013 to focus on his own [[YouTube]] webseries, [[Jon Jafari#JonTron|''JonTron'']], he was succeeded by Avidan. The [[YouTube]] channel for ''Game Grumps'' currently operates under [[Jetpak|JETPAK]], a network created by [[Adam Montoya]].<ref name=\"INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT\">{{cite web|url=http://3blackdot.com/influencers/|title=INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT|website=3blackdot.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714020956/http://3blackdot.com/influencers/|archive-date=2017-07-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince Jafari's departure, the channel has expanded to include other hosts, besides the main two, who have floated in and out of the channel over time as a part of spin-off shows.

Lengthier games often result in ongoing series, which continue airing until completion, unless ending early in favor of beginning a new series. Occasionally, the hosts will participate and compete in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games, as part of their ''Game Grumps VS'' series. Though the episodes usually consist of two or more people, there are some special episodes with Hanson or Avidan alone.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Game Grumps Founders.png|left|thumb|[[Arin Hanson]] (''left, pictured in 2011'') and [[JonTron|Jon Jafari]] (''right, pictured in 2016'') created Game Grumps in 2012 and hosted it together until 2013|alt=]]\n''Game Grumps'' was created by [[JonTron|Jon \"JonTron\" Jafari]] and [[Egoraptor|Arin \"Egoraptor\" Hanson]], and began with a video of the two playing ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' uploaded on July 18, 2012 to video streaming site [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> According to Jafari and Hanson, the idea for the show came about when the two were arguing over whether or not the character Wolf from the fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' was too similar to the character Fox in terms of their fighting styles. After animator Ross O\u2019Donovan told the duo about their tendency to be \u201cgrumpy\u201d with each other over video games, Hanson came up with the idea of a [[podcast]] revolving around this concept, though the show ultimately became a video series on YouTube rather than a podcast.<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> In September 2012, Barry Kramer was brought onto the show as an editor.<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> Hanson and Jafari worked on the show together until June 25, 2013, when Jafari announced he would be leaving the show due to desires to focus on [[JonTron|his own show]]. Many fans were upset by Jafari's departure from ''Game Grumps'', with many expressing disappointment in the decision's last-minute announcement, as well as the channel's decision to announce the beginning of ''Steam Train'' on the same day.<ref name=\"INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT\"/> After Jafari's departure, [[Ninja Sex Party]] vocalist [[Dan Avidan]] succeeded him as co-host of the main show. Avidan also joined animator [[Ross O'Donovan]] as co-host of the show ''Steam Train'' where both play [[Personal computer|PC]] games. This expanded the channel's output to three videos a day: two standard ''Game Grumps'' episodes and a single ''Steam Train'' episode. ''Steam Train'' later expanded to include Hanson as a co-host at times, as well as featuring one of the group's editors, Barry Kramer, and Hanson's wife Suzy Berhow. The expansion also introduced a new ''Steam Rolled'' series, where four-player games (not necessarily PC games) are played by the group.\n\nIn October 2013, the group began a gameplay series featuring ''[[Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate]]'' on the Polaris YouTube channel, titled ''Hunting Monsters''. A second installment, featuring ''[[Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate]]'', began in February 2015.\n[[File:Game Grumps Kiss.png|left|thumb|The current hosts of Game Grumps, [[Dan Avidan]] (top) and [[Arin Hanson]] (bottom), in 2015]]\nIn December 2013, Kramer and Berhow began hosting ''Table Flip'', where they dress in [[Victorian era|Victorian]]/[[The United States in the 19th century|19th century American]] period clothing<ref>{{cite web|title=18th Century-ish Table Flip Theme? \u2013 Suzy and Barry Game Grumps AMA|url=http://www.polarisgo.com/video/uWcw7LY2Sr7w/search/table+flip/page/0|publisher=Polaris|accessdate=28 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305064847/http://www.polarisgo.com/video/uWcw7LY2Sr7w/search/table+flip/page/0|archive-date=2014-03-05|url-status=live}}</ref> and play [[tabletop game]]s, such as [[card game]]s, [[board game]]s, and [[tile-based game]]s with other YouTube personalities.

Although Abernathy took on editing for most of the series, Kramer continued to edit ''Steam Train''. Since Abernathy's departure from the show in mid-2016, Kramer, Ryan Magee, and Matt Watson have taken on editing duties.\n\nIn January 2015, to celebrate reaching two million subscribers, a new show called ''Grumpcade'' was launched, featuring any combination of co-hosts playing console games. The show also features guest YouTube personalities, including game critics ProJared, The Completionist and [[Markiplier]]. Shortly after, in February 2015, GrumpOut, a channel dedicated to recreational and live-action video projects, was created. In November 2015, Avidan's [[Ninja Sex Party]] bandmate [[Brian Wecht]] officially joined the team, leaving behind his career as a [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]].\n\nThe channel also airs special holiday-themed series, featuring holiday-themed games, including ''Jingle Grumps'' and ''Steam Sleigh'' for Christmas, ''Ghoul Grumps'' and ''Scream Train'' for Halloween, ''Date Grumps'', ''Single Train'' and ''Love Train'' for Valentine's Day, and ''Stout Train'' for St. Patrick's Day.\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at [[The Improv|Hollywood Improv]] for a special performance of ''Game Grumps Live'' on March 30<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/701899486491185152| title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-02-27}}</ref> and 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/702676696005128192| title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://hollywood.improv.com/event.cfm?cart&id=440599| title = Game Grumps LIVE| website = hollywood.improv.com| access-date = 2016-02-27| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301082843/http://hollywood.improv.com/event.cfm?cart&id=440599| archivedate = 2016-03-01}}</ref> Later, in April 2016, it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at Levity Live in [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]], [[New York (state)|New York]] for more performances of ''Game Grumps Live'' on April 29 and 30.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/717388267872591872|title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://nyack.levitylive.com/| title = Levity Live| website = Levity Live| access-date = 2016-04-13| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160412022047/http://nyack.levitylive.com/| archive-date = 2016-04-12| url-status = live}}</ref> ''Game Grumps Live'' has since gone on to become a regularly-touring entity, performing across the United States and Canada in brief regional stints at a time.[[File:Game Grumps members.png|thumb|[[Suzy Berhow]] (left), [[Arin Hanson]] (center, bottom), [[Barry Kramer]] (center, top), and [[Ross O'Donovan]], pictured in 2015, are all members of Game Grumps]]On January 6, 2017, it was announced that the show's middle slot would no longer upload on a consistent schedule.

They speak the [[Nafaanra]] language. They equally speak [[Twi]] because Sampa is a cosmopolitan society. Nafaanra is also spoken in [[Banda District (Ghana)|Banda District]], parts of [[Tain District]] and [[Bondoukou]] District of [[Cote d'Ivoire]]. The major cash crop produced by the people is [[Cashew]]. It is the leading producer of Cashew in Ghana.\n\n==History==\nSampa is derived from two [[Nafaanra]] words; Se (Go) and Pa (Come), when the two words are combined together as 'Sempa', it means, \"When you go come back.\" Sempa has now assumed the orthographic form 'Sampa'. Sampa, capital of the [[Jaman North Municipal]] was originally called Sikasoko. It means gold powder. This explains the abundant gold in the area in times past.  In 1890s when the British and French colonialists established a boundary between their territories, Sampa which was known as Sikasoko was designated headquarters of the Northwestern [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]]. Before [[Sunyani]] became the capital of the Northwestern Ashanti in 1906, Sampa had served as capital of the district, which comprised [[Jaman]], [[Wenchi]], [[Techiman]], [[Berekum]], Wam ([[Dormaa]]), [[Ahafo]], [[Odumasi]] and [[Sunyani]].\n\nThe ancestors of Sampa are said to have migrated from Kakala, a village in the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. The migration was necessitated by the Trans-Saharan trade that was bringing civilization from the south to the North as well as tribal wars in the area at that time. They were led by Tolee Sie Nyonogboo and Tolee Kra Longo. When they arrived at Tampi area, the chief of Jamera invited them to help fight the Klolosa tribe in the neighbourhood. Sie Nyonogboo asked Kra Longo and his team to pass through the [[Banda District (Ghana)|Banda]] hills while he and his team took the west direction. It took Sie Nyonogboo and his men a relatively short time to conquer the Klolosa army around the present-day Debibi and Namasa area. After the war, a parcel of land being occupied by the chiefs and people of Sampa today was offered as reward for the role in the war and to further prevent the Klolosa people from attacking Jamera. Elders of Sampa explain that during the Trans-Saharan trade period, merchants from the south used to ply the main route that passed through Sampa to northern [[Africa]]. When they arrived at Sampa, they met the indigenes that wore cloth, a practice, which was not common at the time. The merchants preferred to say they were travelling to the land of the cloth-wearing people(Firantoma fo), instead of the specific name of their destination. The word 'Firantoma fo' has been corrupted to 'Fantra fo' by their [[Bono]] neighbours, though the people of Sampa find the name 'Fantra fo' as pejorative. \n\nSampa served also as an important centre during the [[Slave trade]] era. Bones of the countless slaves damped in a mass grave are still visible at a spot in a town of Jenini near Sampa. Other items of historical interest in Sampa include the bungalows of the expatriate administrators, a ruined chapel of the [[Presbyterian Church]] and a cemetery of the colonial administrators with toms that date back to the [[19th century]].\n\n==Festivals==\nThe two main annual festivals of the royal Stool of Sampa are the Songbee and Dwobofie. The former is celebrated in the latter part of June or July to commemorate the life and works of the ancestors. A highlight of this festival is wrestling competition among the youth. Dwobofie is held in September to usher in the eating of new yam. It is a taboo for the Omanhene (Paramount chief) to eat yam before the festival.\n\n==Education==\nSeveral senior high and technical schools can be found within Sampa and its suburbs. This include Nafana Presby Senior High which is rated among the best schools in Ghana. Others are St. Ann's Girls Senior High School, Our Lady Of Fatima Vocational Training Institute, Maranatha Business Senior High School, Diamono Senior High and Duadaso No. 1 Senior High/Technical school. Sampa is also the home of the Sampa Nurses' Training College. \n\n==Health==\nSampa has the Sampa Government Hospital which is a district hospital to support nursing training at the Sampa Nurses' Training College. Several other private hospitals and clinics operate in Sampa. Recommended private medical facilities are the Pieta Hospital, along the Sampa-Kabile road and Fountain Care Hospital, located behind Yankee Radio premises.\n\n==Economy==\nThe major economic activities of Sampa fall under agriculture, commerce, industrialization and service. Sampa was formerly a slave market site during the \n[[Atlantic slave trade]] in Africa and contemporary a [[Cashew]] market centre in Ghana. Cashew buyers and purchasers from [[India]] and [[Vietnam]] have their company warehouses in Sampa. These companies have merchants in Bole, Wenchi, Dormaa, Techiman, Banda and the neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire who transport [[Cashew]] nuts to Sampa before they are further transported to Tema for export. Again, the Sampa Market is one of the largest in the Bono Region which sees foreigners from [[Cote d'Ivoire]] and other regions across the country to engage in buying and selling.\n\n==Some notable personalities from Sampa==\n*Seth Appiah-Mensah\n*[[Siaka Stevens (Ghanaian politician)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Ghana district capitals}}\n\n[[Category:Ghana\u2013Ivory Coast border crossings]]\n[[Category:Populated places in the Brong-Ahafo Region]]\n\n\n{{Ghana-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=October 2019}}\n{{Confusing|date=October 2019}}\n{{Unfocused|date=October 2019}}\n{{Disputed|date=October 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!--See the Table at Infobox Settlement for all fields and descriptions of usage-->\n<!-- Basic info  ---------------->| official_name                   = Sampa\n| other_name                      = Sikasoko\n| native_name                     = samgba<!-- for cities whose native name is not in English -->\n| nickname                        =  The Border City \n| settlement_type                 = Urban<!--For Town or Village (Leave blank for the default City)-->\n| motto                           = Yeyiri Nafana<!-- images and maps  ----------->\n| image_skyline                   = \n| imagesize                       = 300px\n| image_caption                   = \n| image_flag                      = \n| flag_size                       = \n| image_seal                      = \n| seal_size                       = \n| image_shield                    = \n| shield_size                     = \n| image_map                       = \n| mapsize                         = \n| map_caption                     = \n| pushpin_map                     = Ghana<!-- the name of a location map as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Location_map -->\n| pushpin_label_position          = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location in Ghana\n<!-- Location ------------------>| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|Ghana}}\n| subdivision_type1               = [[Regions of Ghana|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1               = [[Bono Region]]\n| subdivision_type2               = [[Districts of Ghana|District]]\n| subdivision_name2               = [[Jaman North Municipal]]\n| government_footnotes            = \n| government_type                 = \n| leader_title                    = \n| leader_name                     = \n| established_title               = <!-- Settled -->\n| established_date                = <!-- Area    --------------------->\n| area_magnitude                  = \n| unit_pref                       = Imperial <!--Enter: Imperial, if Imperial (metric) is desired-->\n| area_footnotes                  = \n| area_total_km2                  = <!-- ALL fields dealing with a measurements are subject to automatic unit conversion-->\n| area_land_km2                   = <!--See table @ Template:Infobox Settlement for details on automatic unit conversion-->\n| area_water_km2                  = <!-- Population   ----------------------->\n| population_as_of                = 2005\n| population_footnotes            = \n| population_note                 = \n| population_total                = \n| population_density_km2          = <!-- General information  --------------->\n| timezone                        = \n| utc_offset                      = \n| timezone_DST                    = \n| utc_offset_DST                  = \n| coordinates                     = {{coord|7|57|N|2|42|W|region:GH|display=inline,title}}\n| elevation_footnotes             = <!--for references: use<ref> </ref>  tags-->\n| elevation_m                     = <!-- Area/postal codes & others -------->\n| postal_code_type                = <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n| postal_code                     = \n| area_code                       = \n| website                         = \n| footnotes                       = \n| name                            = \n}}\n\n'''Sampa''' is a town in the [[Bono Region]] of [[Ghana]], on the [[Ghana\u2013Ivory Coast border|border]] with [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]]. It is the capital of [[Jaman North Municipal]], and was formerly the site of a [[Slave trade|Slave market]]. It was also the capital of the Akan State of [[Gyaaman]] in the late [[15th century]]. It is the biggest border town in Ghana with a population of over 36,000. It is the principal town of the [[Nafana]] ethnic group. They speak the [[Nafaanra]] language. They equally speak [[Twi]] because Sampa is a cosmopolitan society. Nafaanra is also spoken in [[Banda District (Ghana)|Banda District]], parts of [[Tain District]] and [[Bondoukou]] District of [[Cote d'Ivoire]]. The major cash crop produced by the people is [[Cashew]]. It is the leading producer of Cashew in Ghana.\n\n==History==\nSampa is derived from two [[Nafaanra]] words; Se (Go) and Pa (Come), when the two words are combined together as 'Sempa', it means, \"When you go come back.\" Sempa has now assumed the orthographic form 'Sampa'. Sampa, capital of the [[Jaman North Municipal]] was originally called Sikasoko. It means gold powder. This explains the abundant gold in the area in times past.  In 1890s when the British and French colonialists established a boundary between their territories, Sampa which was known as Sikasoko was designated headquarters of the Northwestern [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]]. Before [[Sunyani]] became the capital of the Northwestern Ashanti in 1906, Sampa had served as capital of the district, which comprised [[Jaman]], [[Wenchi]], [[Techiman]], [[Berekum]], Wam ([[Dormaa]]), [[Ahafo]], [[Odumasi]] and [[Sunyani]].\n\nThe ancestors of Sampa are said to have migrated from Kakala, a village in the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. The migration was necessitated by the Trans-Saharan trade that was bringing civilization from the south to the North as well as tribal wars in the area at that time. They were led by Tolee Sie Nyonogboo and Tolee Kra Longo. When they arrived at Tampi area, the chief of Jamera invited them to help fight the Klolosa tribe in the neighbourhood. Sie Nyonogboo asked Kra Longo and his team to pass through the [[Banda District (Ghana)|Banda]] hills while he and his team took the west direction. It took Sie Nyonogboo and his men a relatively short time to conquer the Klolosa army around the present-day Debibi and Namasa area. After the war, a parcel of land being occupied by the chiefs and people of Sampa today was offered as reward for the role in the war and to further prevent the Klolosa people from attacking Jamera. Elders of Sampa explain that during the Trans-Saharan trade period, merchants from the south used to ply the main route that passed through Sampa to northern [[Africa]]. When they arrived at Sampa, they met the indigenes that wore cloth, a practice, which was not common at the time. The merchants preferred to say they were travelling to the land of the cloth-wearing people(Firantoma fo), instead of the specific name of their destination. The word 'Firantoma fo' has been corrupted to 'Fantra fo' by their [[Bono]] neighbours, though the people of Sampa find the name 'Fantra fo' as pejorative. \n\nSampa served also as an important centre during the [[Slave trade]] era. Bones of the countless slaves damped in a mass grave are still visible at a spot in a town of Jenini near Sampa. Other items of historical interest in Sampa include the bungalows of the expatriate administrators, a ruined chapel of the [[Presbyterian Church]] and a cemetery of the colonial administrators with toms that date back to the [[19th century]].\n\n==Festivals==\nThe two main annual festivals of the royal Stool of Sampa are the Songbee and Dwobofie.
