The aircraft safely landed at [[Lajes Field|Lajes Air Base]], on [[Terceira Island]]. The aircraft was evacuated in 90 seconds. All 306 passengers on board survived. An investigation revealed that the cause of the accident was a fuel leak in the number two engine which was caused by an incorrect part installed in the hydraulics system by Air Transat maintenance staff. The part did not maintain adequate clearance between the hydraulic lines and the fuel line, allowing vibration in the hydraulic lines to degrade the fuel line and cause the leak. The aircraft involved in the incident was repaired and remains in service with Air Transat. The incident went down in history as the longest non-powered flight and landing by a commercial airliner.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/a330-glider-drama-facts-revealed-189183/ A330 'glider' drama facts revealed.] [[Flight International]], 26 Oct 2004.

The investigation that followed determined that the manufacturer's inspection procedure for the composite rudder was not adequate. Inspection procedures for composite structures on airliners were changed because of this incident.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2005/07/19/200307/Weakest+points.html Weakest points.] [[Flight International]], 19 July 2005.

The aircraft safely landed at [[Lajes Field|Lajes Air Base]], on [[Terceira Island]]. The aircraft was evacuated in 90 seconds. All 306 passengers on board survived.

Erasers have a rubbery consistency and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. Some pencils have an eraser on one end. Less expensive erasers are made from [[synthetic rubber]] and synthetic [[soybean|soy]]-based gum, but more expensive or specialized erasers are made from [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[plastic]], or [[Natural gum|gum]]-like materials.\n\nAt first, erasers were invented to erase mistakes made with a pencil; later, more abrasive [[ink eraser]]s were introduced. The term is also used for things that remove marks from chalkboards and whiteboards.\n[[File:Toy Erasers.jpg|thumb|Fragrant toy erasers for children]]\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pencil Eraser.jpg|right|thumb|A [[pencil]] eraser]]\nBefore rubber erasers, tablets of wax were used to erase lead or charcoal marks from paper. Bits of rough stone such as [[sandstone]] or [[pumice]] were used to remove small errors from parchment or papyrus documents written in ink.  Crustless bread was used; a [[Meiji period]] (1868-1912) Tokyo student said: \"Bread erasers were used in place of rubber erasers, and so they would give them to us with no restriction on amount.

Until that time the material was known as ''gum elastic'' or by its Native American name (via French) ''caoutchouc''. Nairne sold natural rubber erasers for the high price of three shillings per half-inch cube. According to Nairne, he inadvertently picked up a piece of rubber instead of breadcrumbs, discovered rubber's erasing properties, and began selling rubber erasers.

It is very soft yet retains its shape and is not mechanically plastic, instead crumbling as it is used. It is especially suited to cleaning large areas without damaging paper. However, they are so soft as to be imprecise in use. The removed graphite is carried away in the crumbles, leaving the eraser clean, but resulting in a lot of eraser residue. This residue must then be brushed away with care, as the eraser particles are coated with the graphite and can make new marks.  Art gum erasers are traditionally tan or brown, but some are blue.\n\n===Vinyl erasers===\nHigh-quality plasticized [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] or other \"plastic\" erasers, originally trademarked ''Mylar'' in the mid-20th century, are softer, non-abrasive, and erase cleaner than standard rubber erasers. This is because the removed graphite does not remain on the eraser as much as rubber erasers, but is instead absorbed into the discarded vinyl scraps. Being softer and non-abrasive, they are less likely to damage canvas or paper. Engineers favor this type of eraser for work on [[technical drawing]]s due to their gentleness on paper with less smearing to surrounding areas. They often come in white and can be found in a variety of shapes.  More recently, very low-cost erasers are manufactured from highly plasticized vinyl compounds and made in decorative shapes.\n\n===Kneaded erasers===\n{{main article|Kneaded eraser}}\n[[Kneaded eraser]]s (called '''putty rubbers''' outside the United States) have a plastic consistency and are common to most artists' standard toolkit. They can be pulled into a point for erasing small areas and tight detail erasing, molded into a textured surface and used like a reverse stamp to give texture, or used in a \"blotting\" manner to lighten lines or shading without completely erasing them. They gradually lose their efficacy and resilience as they become infused with particles picked up from erasing and from their environment. They are not suited to erase large areas because of their tendency to deform under vigorous erasing.\n\n===Poster putty===\nCommonly sold in retail outlets with school supplies and home improvement products, this soft, malleable putty appears in many colours and under numerous brand names. Intended to adhere posters and prints to walls without damaging the underlying wall surface, poster putty works much the same as traditional kneaded erasers, but with a greater tack and in some circumstances, lifting strength. Poster putty does not erase so much as lighten by directly pulling particles of graphite, charcoal or pastel from a drawing. In this regard, poster putty does not smudge or damage work in the process. Repeatedly touching the putty to a drawing pulls ever more medium free, gradually lightening the work in a controlled fashion. Poster putty can be shaped into fine points or knife edges, making it ideal for detailed or small areas of work. It can be rolled across a surface to create visual textures. Poster putty loses its efficacy with use, becoming less tacky as the material grows polluted with debris and oils from the user's skin.\n\n===Electric erasers===\nThe electric eraser was invented in 1932 by [[Arthur Dremel]] of Racine, Wisconsin, USA.<ref name=hist>{{cite journal|last1=Piedmont-Palladino|first1=Susan|title=The Invisible History of Erasing|journal=Blueprints (National Building Museum)|date=Summer 2005|page=2}}</ref> It used a replaceable cylinder of eraser material held by a [[chuck (engineering)|chuck]] driven on the axis of a motor. The speed of rotation allowed less pressure to be used, which minimized paper damage. Originally standard pencil-eraser rubber was used, later replaced by higher-performance vinyl. [[Dremel]] went on to develop an entire line of hand-held rotary power tools.\n\n===Fibreglass erasers===\nA fibreglass eraser, a bundle of very fine glass fibres, can be used for erasing<ref>Rendering with Pen and Ink (The Thames & Hudson Manuals), Robert W Gill. 1984, p191-193</ref> and other tasks requiring abrasion. Typically the eraser is a pen-shaped device with a replaceable insert with glass fibres, which wear down in use. The fibres are very hard; in addition to removing pencil and pen markings, such erasers are used for cleaning traces on electronic circuit boards to facilitate soldering, removing rust, and many other applications. As an example of an unusual use, a fibreglass eraser was used for preparing a [[Pterosaur]] [[fossil]] embedded in a very hard and massive limestone.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stecher|first=Rico|date=2008|title=A new Triassic pterosaur from Switzerland (Central Austroalpine,  Grisons), Raeticodactylus filisurensis gen. et sp. nov. |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rico_Stecher/publication/225173595_A_new_Triassic_pterosaur_from_Switzerland_%28Central_Austroalpine_Grisons%29_Raeticodactylus_filisurensisgen._et_sp._nov/links/0f31752e97092454a0000000.pdf|journal=Swiss J.

Chalk writing leaves light-coloured particles weakly adhering to a dark surface (e.g., white on black, or yellow on green); it can be rubbed off with a soft material, such as a rag. Erasers for chalkboards are made, with a block of plastic or wood, much larger than an eraser for pen or pencil, with a layer of felt on one side. The block is held in the hand and the felt rubbed against the writing, which it easily wipes off.

Erasers have a rubbery consistency and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. Some pencils have an eraser on one end. Less expensive erasers are made from [[synthetic rubber]] and synthetic [[soybean|soy]]-based gum, but more expensive or specialized erasers are made from [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[plastic]], or [[Natural gum|gum]]-like materials.\n\nAt first, erasers were invented to erase mistakes made with a pencil; later, more abrasive [[ink eraser]]s were introduced. The term is also used for things that remove marks from chalkboards and whiteboards.\n[[File:Toy Erasers.jpg|thumb|Fragrant toy erasers for children]]\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pencil Eraser.jpg|right|thumb|A [[pencil]] eraser]]\nBefore rubber erasers, tablets of wax were used to erase lead or charcoal marks from paper. Bits of rough stone such as [[sandstone]] or [[pumice]] were used to remove small errors from parchment or papyrus documents written in ink.  Crustless bread was used; a [[Meiji period]] (1868-1912) Tokyo student said: \"Bread erasers were used in place of rubber erasers, and so they would give them to us with no restriction on amount.  So we thought nothing of taking these and eating a firm part to at least slightly satisfy our hunger.  \"<ref>{{cite book|author=Teiy\u00fbkai\n |title=K\u00f4bu daigakk\u00f4 mukashibanashi\n |location=Tokyo|publisher= Teiy\u00fbkai\n |year=1926|pages=25\u201326|language=ja}}</ref>\n\nIn 1770 English engineer [[Edward Nairne]] is reported to have developed the first widely marketed rubber eraser, for an inventions competition. Until that time the material was known as ''gum elastic'' or by its Native American name (via French) ''caoutchouc''. Nairne sold natural rubber erasers for the high price of three shillings per half-inch cube. According to Nairne, he inadvertently picked up a piece of rubber instead of breadcrumbs, discovered rubber's erasing properties, and began selling rubber erasers. The invention was described by [[Joseph Priestley]] on April 15, 1770, in a footnote: \"I have seen a substance excellently adapted to the purpose of wiping from paper the mark of black-lead-pencil. ... It is sold by Mr. Nairne, Mathematical Instrument-Maker, opposite the Royal-Exchange.\"<ref>See the footnote on page xv at the end of the preface to the following: {{cite book | title = A Familiar Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Perspective | author = Priestley, Joseph | year = 1770 | publisher = J.
