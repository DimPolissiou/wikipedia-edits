It was named after John E. Brookings, president of the Brookings Lumber and Box Company, which founded the city in 1908. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 6,336.<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST10&prodType=table American FactFinder - Results]{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding ===\nIn 1906, the Brookings Timber Company hired William James Ward, a graduate in civil engineering and forestry, to come to the southern Oregon Coast and survey its lumbering potential. After timber cruising the Chetco and Pistol River areas for several years, he recommended that the Brookings people begin extensive lumbering operations here and secure a townsite for a mill and shipping center.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brookings, a Live Community, Marks Once Bleak Spot of Dreary Desolation|date=April 14, 2001|origyear=May 3, 1914|newspaper=Oregon Sunday Journal|location=Portland, Oregon|url=http://www.currypilot.com/Community/History-of-Brookings/Brookings-A-new-town-across-the-Chetco}} Republished by the ''Curry Coastal Pilot'' (Brookings).</ref>\n\nWhile John E. Brookings was responsible for the founding of Brookings as a [[company town]], it was his cousin, [[Robert S. Brookings]], who was responsible for its actual design. The latter Brookings hired [[Bernard Maybeck]], an architect based in [[San Francisco]] who was later involved in the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]], to lay out the [[plat]] of the townsite.<ref name=mccoy>{{cite book  | last =McCoy  | first =Esther  | authorlink =Esther McCoy  | title =Five California Architects  |  publisher =Reinhold Publishing Corporation  | year =1960  | location =New York  | page =46}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{Main|Lookout Air Raids}}\nOn September&nbsp;9, 1942, [[Mount Emily]] near Brookings became the first site in the mainland United States and the second in the continental territory after the [[Battle of Dutch Harbor|bombing of Dutch Harbor]] to [[Lookout Air Raids|suffer aerial bombardment]] during [[World War II]]. A Japanese floatplane piloted by [[Nobuo Fujita]] was launched from [[Japanese submarine I-25|submarine I-25]]. The plane was armed with incendiary bombs on a mission to start massive fires in the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest.<ref>[https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/exhibits/ww2/Pages/threats-bombs.aspx Oregon State Archives, Office of the Secretary of State]</ref><ref>[http://www.eugeneleeslover.com/Japanese_bomb_Oregon.html GENE SLOVERS US NAVY PAGES Japanese Plane Bombed Oregon on September 9, 1942]</ref> The attack caused only minor damage. Fujita would be invited back to Brookings in 1962 and he presented the town his family's 400-year-old samurai sword in friendship after the Japanese government was given assurances that he would not be tried as a war criminal. Brookings made him an honorary citizen several days before his death in 1997.\n\n===1980s onwards===\nSince the 1980s, Brookings has attracted retirees, mostly from [[California]]; senior citizens constitute the majority of the town's population. It is also home for a number of people who commute to jobs in California at nearby [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].\n\n=== Recent ===\nThe total population of the Brookings area is over 13,000, which includes [[Harbor, Oregon|Harbor]] (a [[census-designated place]]), and others. There have been numerous proposals to annex the nearby unincorporated areas into Brookings; while most attempts failed over the years, one large area north of town owned by the U.S. [[Pacific Coast Borax Company|Borax]] Corp. has succeeded. This development has the potential to add approximately 1,000 homes over the next 20 years, although developers expect many of them to be occupied only seasonally. The unincorporated community to the south of the [[Chetco River]], while included in the Brookings Urban Growth Boundary, has resisted annexation into the City of Brookings. There development has occurred without annexation, as Harbor is independently served by independent fire, water and sewer districts. The City of Brookings offers the only 24/7 police service in Curry County.\n\nThe current marketing \"[[brand]]\" for the community, through the Brookings-Harbor Chamber of Commerce,<ref>[http://www.brookingsor.com/ Welcome! | Brookings-Harbor Chamber Of Commerce]</ref> is \"The Pulse of America's Wild Rivers Coast\". America's Wild Rivers Coast is a regional marketing brand for Curry County, Oregon, and [[Del Norte County, California]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020602115157/http://www.wildriverscoast.com/ Home Page - America's Wild Rivers Coast]</ref>\n\n==== 2011 Tsunami ====\nThe [[Port of Brookings Harbor]] was damaged by [[tidal surge]]s from a [[tsunami]] on March&nbsp;11, 2011.<ref name=Oregonian_damage>{{cite news |last=Manning|first=Jeff |author2=Brettman, Allan  |title=Brookings port destruction by tsunami is a blow Curry County cannot afford |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2011/03/brookings_port_destruction_by_tsunami_is_a_blow_curry_county_cannot_afford.html |newspaper= [[The Oregonian]]|location=Portland, Oregon|accessdate=March 13, 2011 |date=March 12, 2011}}</ref> The largest surge was estimated to be nearly {{convert|8|ft}}.<ref name=Pilot_damage/> Boats were damaged, sunk, set adrift, and swept out to sea after many docks were torn away and pilings broken.<ref name=Pilot_damage>{{cite news |last=Rice|first=Arwyn|author2=Graves, Scott\n|title=Tidal surges pummel port, sink boats |url=http://www.currypilot.com/News/Local-News/Tidal-surges-pummel-port-sink-boats |accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=March 12, 2011 |newspaper=[[Curry Coastal Pilot]]}}</ref><ref name=sunk>{{cite news |last=Rasmussen |first=Randy L. |title=Southern Oregon tsunami damage |url=http://photos.oregonlive.com/oregonian/2011/03/southern_oregon_tsunami_damage_2.html |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |date=March 11, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060706/http://photos.oregonlive.com/oregonian/2011/03/southern_oregon_tsunami_damage_2.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The tsunami was caused by the 9.0 [[Moment magnitude scale|M<sub>W</sub>]]<ref>[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2011/usc0001xgp/neic_c0001xgp_wmt.php \"USGS analysis as of 2011-03-12\"].

Temperatures can reach {{convert|70|to|100|F|C|1}} throughout the year. This is due  mostly to its situation at the foot of the [[Klamath Mountains]], from which winds compress and warm the air flowing onto Brookings. This is called the [[Brookings effect]] or Chetco effect, similar to the warm dry [[Santa Ana winds]] of coastal Southern California. Daffodils and other bulbs generally bloom in February. In the lowlands, heavy fog is common in the summer while the coastal hills are generally sunny and cool.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Brookings, Oregon, 1981\u22122010 normals, extremes 1914\u2212present\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 78\n|Feb record high F = 83\n|Mar record high F = 83\n|Apr record high F = 92\n|May record high F = 99\n|Jun record high F = 101\n|Jul record high F = 108\n|Aug record high F = 101\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F = 96\n|Nov record high F = 85\n|Dec record high F = 79\n|year record high F = 108\n|Jan high F = 55.4\n|Feb high F = 56.2\n|Mar high F = 57.6\n|Apr high F = 59.6\n|May high F = 63.0\n|Jun high F = 66.8\n|Jul high F = 67.8\n|Aug high F = 68.6\n|Sep high F = 70.1\n|Oct high F = 67.4\n|Nov high F = 60.9\n|Dec high F = 55.2\n|year high F = 61.6\n|Jan mean F = 48.8\n|Feb mean F = 49.4\n|Mar mean F = 50.2\n|Apr mean F = 51.7\n|May mean F = 55.0\n|Jun mean F = 58.2\n|Jul mean F = 60.1\n|Aug mean F = 60.2\n|Sep mean F = 59.5\n|Oct mean F = 56.3\n|Nov mean F = 51.2\n|Dec mean F = 48.4\n|year mean F = 54.1\n|Jan low F = 41.3\n|Feb low F = 41.7\n|Mar low F = 42.7\n|Apr low F = 43.8\n|May low F = 47.0\n|Jun low F = 49.5\n|Jul low F = 52.4\n|Aug low F = 52.8\n|Sep low F = 51.2\n|Oct low F = 48.3\n|Nov low F = 44.5\n|Dec low F = 41.6\n|year low F = 46.6\n|Jan record low F = 21\n|Feb record low F = 20\n|Mar record low F = 24\n|Apr record low F = 28\n|May record low F = 31\n|Jun record low F = 37\n|Jul record low F = 35\n|Aug record low F = 41\n|Sep record low F = 39\n|Oct record low F = 32\n|Nov record low F = 28\n|Dec record low F = 17\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 11.84\n|Feb precipitation inch = 9.96\n|Mar precipitation inch = 9.43\n|Apr precipitation inch = 6.47\n|May precipitation inch = 3.85\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.02\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.43\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.72\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.39\n|Oct precipitation inch = 5.36\n|Nov precipitation inch = 11.24\n|Dec precipitation inch = 14.51\n|year precipitation inch = 77.22\n|Jan snow inch = 0.4\n|Feb snow inch = 0.2\n|Mar snow inch = 0\n|Apr snow inch = 0\n|May snow inch = 0\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0\n|Oct snow inch = 0\n|Nov snow inch = 0\n|Dec snow inch = 0\n|year snow inch = 0.7\n|source 1 = Western Regional Climate Center<ref name=\"WRCC\">{{cite web\n| url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?or1055 |title=BROOKINGS 2 SE, OREGON (351055) |accessdate=28 September 2015 |date=September 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 515\n|1930= 250\n|1940= 500\n|1950= 1000\n|1960= 2637\n|1970= 2720\n|1980= 3384\n|1990= 4400\n|2000= 5447\n|2010= 6336\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=6465\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=source:<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=https://www.census.gov|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Moffatt|first=Riley Moore|title=Population History of Western U.S. Cities and Towns, 1850\u20131990|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1996|page=207|isbn=978-0-8108-3033-2}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 6,336 people, 2,717 households, and 1,689 families residing in the city.

It was named after John E. Brookings, president of the Brookings Lumber and Box Company, which founded the city in 1908. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 6,336.<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST10&prodType=table American FactFinder - Results]{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding ===\nIn 1906, the Brookings Timber Company hired William James Ward, a graduate in civil engineering and forestry, to come to the southern Oregon Coast and survey its lumbering potential. After timber cruising the Chetco and Pistol River areas for several years, he recommended that the Brookings people begin extensive lumbering operations here and secure a townsite for a mill and shipping center.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brookings, a Live Community, Marks Once Bleak Spot of Dreary Desolation|date=April 14, 2001|origyear=May 3, 1914|newspaper=Oregon Sunday Journal|location=Portland, Oregon|url=http://www.currypilot.com/Community/History-of-Brookings/Brookings-A-new-town-across-the-Chetco}} Republished by the ''Curry Coastal Pilot'' (Brookings).</ref>\n\nWhile John E. Brookings was responsible for the founding of Brookings as a [[company town]], it was his cousin, [[Robert S. Brookings]], who was responsible for its actual design. The latter Brookings hired [[Bernard Maybeck]], an architect based in [[San Francisco]] who was later involved in the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]], to lay out the [[plat]] of the townsite.<ref name=mccoy>{{cite book  | last =McCoy  | first =Esther  | authorlink =Esther McCoy  | title =Five California Architects  |  publisher =Reinhold Publishing Corporation  | year =1960  | location =New York  | page =46}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{Main|Lookout Air Raids}}\nOn September&nbsp;9, 1942, [[Mount Emily]] near Brookings became the first site in the mainland United States and the second in the continental territory after the [[Battle of Dutch Harbor|bombing of Dutch Harbor]] to [[Lookout Air Raids|suffer aerial bombardment]] during [[World War II]]. A Japanese floatplane piloted by [[Nobuo Fujita]] was launched from [[Japanese submarine I-25|submarine I-25]]. The plane was armed with incendiary bombs on a mission to start massive fires in the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest.<ref>[https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/exhibits/ww2/Pages/threats-bombs.aspx Oregon State Archives, Office of the Secretary of State]</ref><ref>[http://www.eugeneleeslover.com/Japanese_bomb_Oregon.html GENE SLOVERS US NAVY PAGES Japanese Plane Bombed Oregon on September 9, 1942]</ref> The attack caused only minor damage. Fujita would be invited back to Brookings in 1962 and he presented the town his family's 400-year-old samurai sword in friendship after the Japanese government was given assurances that he would not be tried as a war criminal. Brookings made him an honorary citizen several days before his death in 1997.\n\n===1980s onwards===\nSince the 1980s, Brookings has attracted retirees, mostly from [[California]]; senior citizens constitute the majority of the town's population. It is also home for a number of people who commute to jobs in California at nearby [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].\n\n=== Recent ===\nThe total population of the Brookings area is over 13,000, which includes [[Harbor, Oregon|Harbor]] (a [[census-designated place]]), and others. There have been numerous proposals to annex the nearby unincorporated areas into Brookings; while most attempts failed over the years, one large area north of town owned by the U.S. [[Pacific Coast Borax Company|Borax]] Corp. has succeeded. This development has the potential to add approximately 1,000 homes over the next 20 years, although developers expect many of them to be occupied only seasonally. The unincorporated community to the south of the [[Chetco River]], while included in the Brookings Urban Growth Boundary, has resisted annexation into the City of Brookings. There development has occurred without annexation, as Harbor is independently served by independent fire, water and sewer districts. The City of Brookings offers the only 24/7 police service in Curry County.\n\nThe current marketing \"[[brand]]\" for the community, through the Brookings-Harbor Chamber of Commerce,<ref>[http://www.brookingsor.com/ Welcome! | Brookings-Harbor Chamber Of Commerce]</ref> is \"The Pulse of America's Wild Rivers Coast\".

Temperatures can reach {{convert|70|to|100|F|C|1}} throughout the year. This is due  mostly to its situation at the foot of the [[Klamath Mountains]], from which winds compress and warm the air flowing onto Brookings. This is called the [[Brookings effect]] or Chetco effect, similar to the warm dry [[Santa Ana winds]] of coastal Southern California. Daffodils and other bulbs generally bloom in February. In the lowlands, heavy fog is common in the summer while the coastal hills are generally sunny and cool.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Brookings, Oregon, 1981\u22122010 normals, extremes 1914\u2212present\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 78\n|Feb record high F = 83\n|Mar record high F = 83\n|Apr record high F = 92\n|May record high F = 99\n|Jun record high F = 101\n|Jul record high F = 108\n|Aug record high F = 101\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F = 96\n|Nov record high F = 85\n|Dec record high F = 79\n|year record high F = 108\n|Jan high F = 55.4\n|Feb high F = 56.2\n|Mar high F = 57.6\n|Apr high F = 59.6\n|May high F = 63.0\n|Jun high F = 66.8\n|Jul high F = 67.8\n|Aug high F = 68.6\n|Sep high F = 70.1\n|Oct high F = 67.4\n|Nov high F = 60.9\n|Dec high F = 55.2\n|year high F = 61.6\n|Jan mean F = 48.8\n|Feb mean F = 49.4\n|Mar mean F = 50.2\n|Apr mean F = 51.7\n|May mean F = 55.0\n|Jun mean F = 58.2\n|Jul mean F = 60.1\n|Aug mean F = 60.2\n|Sep mean F = 59.5\n|Oct mean F = 56.3\n|Nov mean F = 51.2\n|Dec mean F = 48.4\n|year mean F = 54.1\n|Jan low F = 41.3\n|Feb low F = 41.7\n|Mar low F = 42.7\n|Apr low F = 43.8\n|May low F = 47.0\n|Jun low F = 49.5\n|Jul low F = 52.4\n|Aug low F = 52.8\n|Sep low F = 51.2\n|Oct low F = 48.3\n|Nov low F = 44.5\n|Dec low F = 41.6\n|year low F = 46.6\n|Jan record low F = 21\n|Feb record low F = 20\n|Mar record low F = 24\n|Apr record low F = 28\n|May record low F = 31\n|Jun record low F = 37\n|Jul record low F = 35\n|Aug record low F = 41\n|Sep record low F = 39\n|Oct record low F = 32\n|Nov record low F = 28\n|Dec record low F = 17\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 11.84\n|Feb precipitation inch = 9.96\n|Mar precipitation inch = 9.43\n|Apr precipitation inch = 6.47\n|May precipitation inch = 3.85\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.02\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.43\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.72\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.39\n|Oct precipitation inch = 5.36\n|Nov precipitation inch = 11.24\n|Dec precipitation inch = 14.51\n|year precipitation inch = 77.22\n|Jan snow inch = 0.4\n|Feb snow inch = 0.2\n|Mar snow inch = 0\n|Apr snow inch = 0\n|May snow inch = 0\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0\n|Oct snow inch = 0\n|Nov snow inch = 0\n|Dec snow inch = 0\n|year snow inch = 0.7\n|source 1 = Western Regional Climate Center<ref name=\"WRCC\">{{cite web\n| url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?or1055 |title=BROOKINGS 2 SE, OREGON (351055) |accessdate=28 September 2015 |date=September 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 515\n|1930= 250\n|1940= 500\n|1950= 1000\n|1960= 2637\n|1970= 2720\n|1980= 3384\n|1990= 4400\n|2000= 5447\n|2010= 6336\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=6465\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=source:<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=https://www.census.gov|accessdate=June 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Moffatt|first=Riley Moore|title=Population History of Western U.S. Cities and Towns, 1850\u20131990|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1996|page=207|isbn=978-0-8108-3033-2}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 6,336 people, 2,717 households, and 1,689 families residing in the city.

In a 'strongly anti-semitic' campaign, in which Jewishness and German origin were conflated, the Union demanded the [[internment]] and [[repatriation]] of \"enemy aliens\", many of whom were Jews.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\n====Joynson-Hicks and the Die Hards====\nAfter World War I, Joynson-Hicks became an important member of the [[Die hard (phrase)#British political uses|Die Hards]], who were united 'by their national chauvinism, verging on xenophobia, and anti-Bolshevism', with some members (e.g., [[Henry Percy, 7th Duke of Northumberland|Henry Percy]] (Duke of Northumberland), [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|George Clarke]] (Lord Sydenham), and the MPs [[Ronald McNeill, 1st Baron Cushendun|Ronald McNeill]], [[Sir Charles Yate, 1st Baronet|Charles Yate]], [[Charles Foxcroft|Charles Taylor Foxcroft]] and [[Henry Page Croft, 1st Baron Croft|Henry Page Croft]]) believing the conspiracy theory of a Jewish world effort to subvert Britain and its Empire.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Jew baiting was known among them.<ref>Inbal Rose, ''Conservatism and Foreign Policy During the Lloyd George Coalition 1918-1922'' (London: Frank Cass, 1999)</ref> Joynson-Hicks 'exemplified the Die Hard position', involving himself in matters in which Jews were concerned.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> For example, he was involved in the hunt for 'aliens', which led to many Russian Jews being expelled from Britain, and the Die Hard ousting of [[Edwin Montagu]], the [[Secretary of State for India]].<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks questioned the trustworthiness of Ango-Jewish MPs and civil servants. He spoke out against [[Sir Herbert Samuel]] when he was appointed [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|High Commissioner for Palestine]].<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joyson-Hicks also continued his involvement in extra-parliamentary antisemitic agitation. He was involved with groups composed of a 'comprehensive cross-section of anti-Jews': for example, George Clarke (Lord Sydenham), [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Nesta Webster]], [[Rosita Forbes]] and [[Arnold White]].<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Sir Charles Yate, George Clarke (Lord Sydenham), Henry Percy (Duke of Northumberland) and several other anti-Zionist MPs produced the publication ''The Conspiracy Against the British Empire'', a 'boiled-down version' of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joyson-Hicks was in favour of self-government by 'the majority in Palestine' and proposal of a resolution to that effect, which was perhaps a result of his antisemitism.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> At some point in his career, he commented that the Jewish immigrants to Palestine were 'the sweepings of the ghettos of Central Europe'.<ref name=\"Julius\"/>\n\n====Macmillan and the \"International Jew\"====\n[[Harold Macmillan]] wrote to a friend during the 1919 Paris peace talks that the government of Prime Minister Lloyd George was not 'really popular, except with the International Jew'.<ref name=\"tablet\">C.

Samuel saw this opposition by Decre and his supporters as 'purely anti-Semitic'.<ref name=\"defries\"/>\n\n==Baldwin leadership (1923\u20131937)==\n===Parliamentary level===\n====Baldwin and Joynson-Hicks====\n[[Stanley Baldwin]] had strong ties to Joynson-Hicks, which can be seen throughout their political careers together - each vouched for the other in election campaigns; Joynson-Hicks was instrumental in the 'destruction of the coalition and the old Conservative leadership which opened the way to [[Bonar Law]] and then Baldwin' and supported Baldwin in the passing of policy; they worked together in the Treasury; Baldwin promoted Joynson-Hicks to Home Secretary; and Joynson-Hicks stood by Baldwin in defeat.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> According to David Cesarani, Baldwin and Joynson-Hicks 'shared a discourse about England and Englishness' that included a definition of 'Englishness' based around 'a common language, heritage and racial character', and, on the other side of the coin, a dislike of other 'races', seen as 'less illustrious ..., other and 'alien'.'<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\nBaldwin became prime minister in 1923 and gave Joynson-Hicks a place in the Cabinet as Financial Secretary to the Treasury. This was 'noted by the Zionist press with anxiety'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> In August 1923 he became Health Minister.<ref>'[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810105201334 Joynson-Hicks, William]' in ''A Dictionary of Political Biography'' (OUP) (accessed 19/01/19)</ref> There were also causes for concern for Anglo-Jewry in the way Baldwin's government came to power again in the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]].<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> That election saw an 'exceptionally dirty campaign' (most notoriously known for the [[Zinoviev letter]], a forgery purportedly written by the Jewish head of the [[Communist International]] in Moscow, published by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to turn the [[election|electorate]] against the Labour party), and the Conservative campaign had a stream of anti-Jewish, anti-alienism underlying it.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Now and at other times in this period, 'anti-Jewish feeling was mobilized under the guise of anti-alienism, anti-Zionism and anti-Bolshevism by mainstream political figures'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> During the campaign, Baldwin and other Conservatives used the threat of aliens as one of their platforms.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> In their campaigning, the term 'aliens' was 'used as a code for Jews'.<ref>Martin Pugh, ''Hurrah For The Blackshirts!: Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars'' (London: Pimlico, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn speeches like his [[party political broadcast]] on 16 October, Baldwin gave the all clear to Joynson-Hicks and other extremists{{who|date=March 2019}} in the Conservative party who had been engaged in [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] campaigning for decades.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> He said, 'we cannot afford the luxury of academic socialists or revolutionary agitation ... I think its high time somebody said to Russia \"Hands off England\" ... I want to examine the laws and regulations as to entry of aliens into this country, for in these days no alien should be substituted for one of our own people when we have not enough work at home to go around'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Baldwin's allies could now exploit prejudices against foreigners, 'aliens' and 'agitators'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> For Hoynson-Hicks, the concept of 'alien' and 'communist' blended, and throughout his political career his 'anti-alienism, his anti-Zionism, [and] his anti-communism all brought him into conflict with the Jews'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\n=====Home Secretary Joynson-Hicks=====\nAfter the Conservatives won the election, in November 1924, Baldwin made Joynson-Hicks Home Secretary (he was Home Secretary until 1929). [[David Cesarani]] ascribes this 'sudden [and] unexpected' political ascent - which, 'in the view of many at the time and since, [was] undeserved in terms of talent' - to the ideological affinity between Baldwin and Hoynson-Hicks.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joynson-Hick's appointment worried the Jewish community, and not without reasons: his time as Home Secretary saw him in regular conflict with British Jews.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joynson-Hicks became known as '[[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] Minor'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> His antisemitism caused him no harm during his time in office and he was emboldened in his antisemitism because he knew he had the general support of the Conservative party, 'the large majority of whom are anti-alien in the sense of generally disliking foreigners, and despising anyone who does not happen to have been born in this country with a long English lineage to boot'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> More specifically, too, the Conservative party contained a 'very noisy and active element' of antisemites.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> '[A]nti-Jewish currents were evident at the centre of politics, even present at the Cabinet table'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Writing to a friend shortly after the 1924 election, [[Chaim Weizmann]] commented, 'There is a new government ... the Cabinet contains two or three reactionaries, anti-Zionists and even anti-semites'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Within the government ranks, there was no 'dissent against [Joynson-Hicks's] activity ... least of all from ... Baldwin'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Cesarani says Baldwin chose the right-winger Joynson-Hicks for his government because he considered him 'a desirable representative of elemental Toryism', a 'representative figure' who would 'enhance, rather than detract from, first, his electoral team, and second, his government'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\nTowards the start of his Home Secretary career Joynson-Hicks was visited by the right-wing organisation the [[National Citizens Union]].<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joynson-Hicks told the group he would not allow a mass arrival of immigrants to Britain and that he would wouldn't hesitate to use his power to deport aliens.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Under Joynson-Hicks, the Home Office became 'the bane of the Jewish community' and 'the situation of Jewish aliens had deteriorated seriously'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Jews who had not become British citizens were deported for [[misdemeanor]]s but, when they applied for citizenship, were met with long, unnecessary delays with kept them in the precarious position of alien.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> A group from the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]  visited Joynson-Hicks at the Home Office in February 1925 to ask for an improvement to the regulations concerning aliens, 'the establishment of immigration boards to judge cases of aliens forbidden to land by immigration officers, some modification of the Home Secretary's power of deportation [and an] to end the delays in [[naturalization]]. Joynson-Hicks dismissed their requests.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\nIn November 1925, during parliamentary debates about the renewal of the Aliens Act, Joynson-Hicks was confronted about his actions by Labour MP [[John Scurr]] and Jewish Conservative MP [[Samuel Finburgh]]. Scurr said that the Aliens Act was being used 'against one section of the community, and particularly against the poorer members of the Jewish community'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Samuel Finburgh highlighted that Jews who 'had been trying to get naturalized [were finding that] every possible obstruction was placed in their way'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joynson-Hicks responded by challenging Finburgh to give him a single example of when the Home Office had shown anti-Jewish bias, even though, Cesarani points out, Joynson-Hicks had entered and accepted a Home Office already discriminating against Jews in the applications for citizenship<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/><ref name=\"MBJ\"/> and, during his time in office, had received a memorandum on naturalization from [[John Pedder]], the Home Office Principle Assistant Secretary, who regularly processed complaints from the Jewish community about Home Office action.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\nWhen asked by a Jewish journalist, Meir Grossman, about the 'impression [that] has gain ground' that Joynson-Hicks was 'in general antagonistic to the alien population' and, more particularly 'in the exercising [of] his discretion as Home Secretary', was 'discriminating against Jewish applicants' for citizenship, Joynson-Hicks replied that he was upset by the accusation of antisemitism, insisted that he was fair.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> However, his bias against the Jews was revealed when he went on to give the following example of the 'chief test' which he would apply before granting citizenship:\n<blockquote>The chief test ... is whether the applicant has, so far as can be judged, become an Englishman at heart and has completely identified himself with English interests. I will give you an example. If two brothers came to this country and one of them settles in a district where only aliens live, continues to speak his native language, marries a woman from his own country, sends his child to a school where only foreign children are kept, keeps his account in a foreign bank, employs only foreign labour, while the other marries and Englishwoman, sends his children to an English school, speaks English, employs British labour, keeps his accounts in a British bank, it is the second brother and not the first who will stand to obtain naturalization.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/></blockquote>\nThe anti-alien legislation, as described and used by Joynson-Hicks in this way, was antisemitic.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/><ref>B.

Churchill was a [[Zionist]] and held both positive and antisemitic opinions of Jews;<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/><ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">Tom Heyden, '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29701767 The 10 greatest controversies of Winston Churchill's career]' (25/01/15) on BBC News</ref> however, even some of his positive views were based on [[Stereotypes of Jews|antisemitic stereotypes]].<ref name=\"Julius\"/><ref name=\"Cohen2\"/> For example, Churchill commented:<ref name=\"Julius\"/>\n<blockquote>Some people like Jews and some do not. But no thoughtful man can deny the fact that they are beyond question the most formidable and the most remarkable race which has ever appeared in the world.{{refn|group=note|About this type of comment, [[Anthony Julius]] writes: 'This is a view many anti-Semites embrace and ''ex''-anti-Semites will often retain, however much else they might discard. ... The Jews are ''not'' collectively formidable. They are weak, divided, heterogeneous. They have constituted themselves as a nation only with great difficulty, and never such as to secure the consent of the entirety of Jewry. ... [T]here is something dubious about the making of ''any'' general statement about Jews - however favourable. It cannot but simplify and therefore misrepresent the diversity of actual Jews. In its denial of their diversity, it does each one of them a distinct diservice'.<ref name=\"Julius\"/>}}</blockquote>\nIn 1914 and 1920 Churchill had been accused of Jew bating.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> After World War I, Churchill believed communism to be under the control of \"[[international Jewry]]\", which was \"a world-wide conspiracy\" dedicated to \"the overthrow of civilization and the reconstruction of society\".<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> He expressed this in a 1920 ''[[Illustrated Sunday Herald]]'' article entitled \"Zionism versus Bolshevism: A struggle for the soul of the Jewish people\",<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> which pitted good, Zionist Jews against the evil of Jewish controlled Bolshevism.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/> In the article he cited favourably [[Nesta Helen Webster]], the right-wing, antisemitic conspiracy theorist<ref name=\"Julius\"/> and was 'tainted heavily with imagery' from the [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic fabricated text]] ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/> The ''Jewish Chronicle'' castigated Churchill for the article.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\nChurchill had also told [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] that the Jews were 'the main instigators of the ruin of the Empire', that they had played 'a leading part in Bolshevik atrocities',<ref name=\"Cohen\">Michael J. Cohen, ''Churchill and the Jews, 1900-1948'' 2nd edn (London: Routledge, 2013)</ref> that the presence of Jews in radical groups was due (in Lebzelter's summation of Churchill's view) 'to inherent inclinations rooted in Jewish character and religion', and that a government should not have 'too many' Jews in it.<ref>G. Lebzelter, ''Political Anti-Semitism in England 1918\u20131939'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1978)</ref> He said Britain need beware the 'international Soviet of the Russian and Polish Jew' and that he had found evidence of a 'very powerful' Jewish lobby in the country.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> His antisemitism was shared by his wife, [[Clementine Churchill|Clementine]], who wrote to him in 1931 that she could understand 'American Anti-Semitic prejudice'.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> It has been suggests that Churchill learned to keep his antisemitism quiet for political advantage.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/><ref name=\"ARJK\"/>\n\n====Involvement with Oswald Mosley====\n[[Oswald Mosley]] founded the [[January Club]], a social and dining club, in 1934 to attract [[The Establishment|Establishment]] support for his [[British Union of Fascists]] movement,<ref name=\"Thurlow\">Richard Thurlow, 'State Management of the British Union of Fascits in the 1930s' in Mike Cronin (ed.), ''The Failure of British Fascism: The Far Right and the Fight for Political Recognition'' (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1996)</ref> which had increasing levels of antisemitism.<ref name=\"brush\">R.

He spoke out against [[Sir Herbert Samuel]] when he was appointed [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|High Commissioner for Palestine]].<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joyson-Hicks also continued his involvement in extra-parliamentary antisemitic agitation.

This was 'noted by the Zionist press with anxiety'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> In August 1923 he became Health Minister.<ref>'[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810105201334 Joynson-Hicks, William]' in ''A Dictionary of Political Biography'' (OUP) (accessed 19/01/19)</ref> There were also causes for concern for Anglo-Jewry in the way Baldwin's government came to power again in the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]].<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> That election saw an 'exceptionally dirty campaign' (most notoriously known for the [[Zinoviev letter]], a forgery purportedly written by the Jewish head of the [[Communist International]] in Moscow, published by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to turn the [[election|electorate]] against the Labour party), and the Conservative campaign had a stream of anti-Jewish, anti-alienism underlying it.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Now and at other times in this period, 'anti-Jewish feeling was mobilized under the guise of anti-alienism, anti-Zionism and anti-Bolshevism by mainstream political figures'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> During the campaign, Baldwin and other Conservatives used the threat of aliens as one of their platforms.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> In their campaigning, the term 'aliens' was 'used as a code for Jews'.<ref>Martin Pugh, ''Hurrah For The Blackshirts!: Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars'' (London: Pimlico, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn speeches like his [[party political broadcast]] on 16 October, Baldwin gave the all clear to Joynson-Hicks and other extremists{{who|date=March 2019}} in the Conservative party who had been engaged in [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] campaigning for decades.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> He said, 'we cannot afford the luxury of academic socialists or revolutionary agitation ... I think its high time somebody said to Russia \"Hands off England\" ... I want to examine the laws and regulations as to entry of aliens into this country, for in these days no alien should be substituted for one of our own people when we have not enough work at home to go around'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Baldwin's allies could now exploit prejudices against foreigners, 'aliens' and 'agitators'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> For Hoynson-Hicks, the concept of 'alien' and 'communist' blended, and throughout his political career his 'anti-alienism, his anti-Zionism, [and] his anti-communism all brought him into conflict with the Jews'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\n=====Home Secretary Joynson-Hicks=====\nAfter the Conservatives won the election, in November 1924, Baldwin made Joynson-Hicks Home Secretary (he was Home Secretary until 1929). [[David Cesarani]] ascribes this 'sudden [and] unexpected' political ascent - which, 'in the view of many at the time and since, [was] undeserved in terms of talent' - to the ideological affinity between Baldwin and Hoynson-Hicks.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joynson-Hick's appointment worried the Jewish community, and not without reasons: his time as Home Secretary saw him in regular conflict with British Jews.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joynson-Hicks became known as '[[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] Minor'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> His antisemitism caused him no harm during his time in office and he was emboldened in his antisemitism because he knew he had the general support of the Conservative party, 'the large majority of whom are anti-alien in the sense of generally disliking foreigners, and despising anyone who does not happen to have been born in this country with a long English lineage to boot'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> More specifically, too, the Conservative party contained a 'very noisy and active element' of antisemites.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> '[A]nti-Jewish currents were evident at the centre of politics, even present at the Cabinet table'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Writing to a friend shortly after the 1924 election, [[Chaim Weizmann]] commented, 'There is a new government ... the Cabinet contains two or three reactionaries, anti-Zionists and even anti-semites'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Within the government ranks, there was no 'dissent against [Joynson-Hicks's] activity ... least of all from ... Baldwin'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Cesarani says Baldwin chose the right-winger Joynson-Hicks for his government because he considered him 'a desirable representative of elemental Toryism', a 'representative figure' who would 'enhance, rather than detract from, first, his electoral team, and second, his government'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\nTowards the start of his Home Secretary career Joynson-Hicks was visited by the right-wing organisation the [[National Citizens Union]].<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joynson-Hicks told the group he would not allow a mass arrival of immigrants to Britain and that he would wouldn't hesitate to use his power to deport aliens.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Under Joynson-Hicks, the Home Office became 'the bane of the Jewish community' and 'the situation of Jewish aliens had deteriorated seriously'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Jews who had not become British citizens were deported for [[misdemeanor]]s but, when they applied for citizenship, were met with long, unnecessary delays with kept them in the precarious position of alien.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> A group from the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]  visited Joynson-Hicks at the Home Office in February 1925 to ask for an improvement to the regulations concerning aliens, 'the establishment of immigration boards to judge cases of aliens forbidden to land by immigration officers, some modification of the Home Secretary's power of deportation [and an] to end the delays in [[naturalization]]. Joynson-Hicks dismissed their requests.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\nIn November 1925, during parliamentary debates about the renewal of the Aliens Act, Joynson-Hicks was confronted about his actions by Labour MP [[John Scurr]] and Jewish Conservative MP [[Samuel Finburgh]]. Scurr said that the Aliens Act was being used 'against one section of the community, and particularly against the poorer members of the Jewish community'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Samuel Finburgh highlighted that Jews who 'had been trying to get naturalized [were finding that] every possible obstruction was placed in their way'.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> Joynson-Hicks responded by challenging Finburgh to give him a single example of when the Home Office had shown anti-Jewish bias, even though, Cesarani points out, Joynson-Hicks had entered and accepted a Home Office already discriminating against Jews in the applications for citizenship<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/><ref name=\"MBJ\"/> and, during his time in office, had received a memorandum on naturalization from [[John Pedder]], the Home Office Principle Assistant Secretary, who regularly processed complaints from the Jewish community about Home Office action.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/>\n\nWhen asked by a Jewish journalist, Meir Grossman, about the 'impression [that] has gain ground' that Joynson-Hicks was 'in general antagonistic to the alien population' and, more particularly 'in the exercising [of] his discretion as Home Secretary', was 'discriminating against Jewish applicants' for citizenship, Joynson-Hicks replied that he was upset by the accusation of antisemitism, insisted that he was fair.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/> However, his bias against the Jews was revealed when he went on to give the following example of the 'chief test' which he would apply before granting citizenship:\n<blockquote>The chief test ... is whether the applicant has, so far as can be judged, become an Englishman at heart and has completely identified himself with English interests. I will give you an example. If two brothers came to this country and one of them settles in a district where only aliens live, continues to speak his native language, marries a woman from his own country, sends his child to a school where only foreign children are kept, keeps his account in a foreign bank, employs only foreign labour, while the other marries and Englishwoman, sends his children to an English school, speaks English, employs British labour, keeps his accounts in a British bank, it is the second brother and not the first who will stand to obtain naturalization.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/></blockquote>\nThe anti-alien legislation, as described and used by Joynson-Hicks in this way, was antisemitic.<ref name=\"Cesarani\"/><ref>B.

But no thoughtful man can deny the fact that they are beyond question the most formidable and the most remarkable race which has ever appeared in the world.{{refn|group=note|About this type of comment, [[Anthony Julius]] writes: 'This is a view many anti-Semites embrace and ''ex''-anti-Semites will often retain, however much else they might discard. ... The Jews are ''not'' collectively formidable. They are weak, divided, heterogeneous. They have constituted themselves as a nation only with great difficulty, and never such as to secure the consent of the entirety of Jewry. ... [T]here is something dubious about the making of ''any'' general statement about Jews - however favourable. It cannot but simplify and therefore misrepresent the diversity of actual Jews. In its denial of their diversity, it does each one of them a distinct diservice'.<ref name=\"Julius\"/>}}</blockquote>\nIn 1914 and 1920 Churchill had been accused of Jew bating.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> After World War I, Churchill believed communism to be under the control of \"[[international Jewry]]\", which was \"a world-wide conspiracy\" dedicated to \"the overthrow of civilization and the reconstruction of society\".<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> He expressed this in a 1920 ''[[Illustrated Sunday Herald]]'' article entitled \"Zionism versus Bolshevism: A struggle for the soul of the Jewish people\",<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> which pitted good, Zionist Jews against the evil of Jewish controlled Bolshevism.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/> In the article he cited favourably [[Nesta Helen Webster]], the right-wing, antisemitic conspiracy theorist<ref name=\"Julius\"/> and was 'tainted heavily with imagery' from the [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic fabricated text]] ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/> The ''Jewish Chronicle'' castigated Churchill for the article.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\nChurchill had also told [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] that the Jews were 'the main instigators of the ruin of the Empire', that they had played 'a leading part in Bolshevik atrocities',<ref name=\"Cohen\">Michael J.

This creates shorter weapons in comparison to [[ rifle]]s with the same size of [[gun barrel]].

But it was not until the [[Cold War]] that more successful designs and improvements made the weapon successful. In the 1970s, [[Austria]] became the first [[Austrian Army|army]] in the world to adopt a [[Steyr AUG|bullpup rifle]] as a principal combat weapon.

The EM-2 was adopted by the UK in 1951 as the world's first (limited) service bullpup rifle, but was promptly displaced by the adoption of the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (0.308&nbsp;in) cartridge, to which the EM-2 was not easily adapted.

The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].

Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia. The additional word ''via'' indicated that the \"passengers\" were not sent on the usual train, but rather via [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. In this case, the authorities were tricked into going to the regular location (station) in an attempt to intercept the runaways, while Still met them at the correct station and guided them to safety. They eventually escaped either to the North or to Canada, where slavery had been abolished during the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book| author=Still, William| title=The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts| date=1872| url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243533-the-underground-railroad?from_search=true&search_version=service_impr| asin=B00264GNTU}}</ref>\n\n===National Underground Railroad Network===\n\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990, in 1997, Congress passed H.R. 1635, which President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law, and which authorized the [[United States National Park Service]] to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites, as well as preserve them and popularize the Underground Railroad and stories of people involved in it. The National Park Service has designated many sites within the network, posted stories about people and places, sponsors an essay contest, and holds a national conference about the Underground Railroad in May or June each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/index.htm|title=Network to Freedom Homepage|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Arrival in Canada===\n[[File:UndergroundRailroadmonumentWindsor.jpg|175px|thumb|''International Underground Railroad Memorial'' in [[Windsor, Ontario]]]]\n[[File:John Brown by Levin Handy, 1890-1910.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] participated in the Underground Railroad as an abolitionist.]]\n\nEstimates vary widely, but at least 30,000 slaves, and potentially more than 100,000, escaped to Canada via the Underground Railroad.<ref name=\"CAN\">{{cite web| url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10166| work=[[Historica Minutes]]| quote=Between 1840 and 1860, more than 30,000 American slaves came secretly to Canada and freedom| title=Settling Canada Underground Railroad |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106114439/http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10166 |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=January 30, 2018 }}</ref> The largest group settled in [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario), called [[Canada West]] from 1841.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 379</ref> Numerous [[Black Canadian]] communities developed in [[Southern Ontario]].

The abolitionist [[Levi Coffin]], who was known for aiding over 2,000 fugitives to safety,  supported this choice. He described Fort Malden as \"the great landing place, the principle terminus of the underground railroad of the west.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Landon |first=Fred |date=1925 |title=Amherstburg, Terminus of the Underground Railroad |journal=The Journal of Negro History |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=5|doi=10.2307/2713665 |jstor=2713665 }}</ref> After 1850, approximately thirty fugitive slaves a day were crossing over to Fort Malden by steamboat.<ref name=Calarco>Tom Calarco, ''Places of the Underground Railroad: A Geographical Guide'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, LLC, 2011)</ref>{{rp|15}} The ''Sultana'' was one of the ships, making \"frequent round trips\" between [[Great Lakes]] ports.

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\".

The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and [[safe house]]s, all of them maintained by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist sympathizers]] and communicated by [[word of mouth]]. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route but knew few details of their{{whose|date=November 2019}} immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. \"Conductors\" on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included [[free people of color|free-born blacks]], white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or [[manumission|manumitted]]), and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/undergroundrailroad/|title=The Underground Railroad|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-11-16|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=August 1, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Miles|first=Tiya|date=Summer 2011|title=Of Waterways and Runaways: Reflections on the Great Lakes in Underground Railroad History|magazine=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=L|issue=3|issn=1558-7266|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0050.320}}</ref> Church clergy and congregations of the North often played a role, especially the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]), [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]], and [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterians]], as well as the anti-slavery branches  of [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream denominations]] which split over the issue, such the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and the [[American Baptists|Baptists]].

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the \"[[Promised Land]]\" or \"Heaven\" and the [[Ohio River]] as the \"[[Jordan River|River Jordan]]\", which marked the boundary between [[slave states and free states]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Underground Railroad Codes| url=http://www.safepassageohio.org/resources/weblesson.pdf| work=Myths and Codes of the Underground Railroad| series=Safe Passage| publisher=Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation| page=20| accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Desperate Conflict in a Barn.png|left|thumb|280px|''Struggle for freedom in a Maryland barn''.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia.

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\".

Woodland Natives inhabited the area circa 1000 BCE &ndash; 1000 CE, followed by [[Iroquois]] and [[Mississaugas]] circa 1740 CE. Two of the more prominent sites surviving from this time are the [[petroglyph]]s at [[Petroglyphs Provincial Park]] and [[Serpent Mounds Park|Serpent Mounds]]. The petroglyphs are located northeast of Peterborough and are believed to have been carved by the [[Algonquin people]] between 900 and 1400 CE.

The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honor. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219. Print</ref>\n\nRobinson was urged by landlords to remove the \"pauper and undesirables\". He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish. to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they traveled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904.

To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-39|F|1}} on December 21, 1871.<ref name=\"December 1871\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Peterborough ([[Trent University]]), 1981\u22122010 normals, extremes

Trent's academic focus is on environmental, cultural and science studies. The main '''Symons Campus''' of Trent, located in the city's far north end, is approximately 14.6 square kilometres, over half of which is a part of Trent's Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wild-life [[nature reserve]].\n\nTrent University operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, [[Catharine Parr Traill]], Otonabee, [[Peter Gzowski]] and Julian Blackburn. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room and student government, except for Catharine Parr Traill (which consists only of part-time students and is located near downtown Peterborough) and Julian Blackburn (which is mostly administrative).\n\n====Fleming College====\n{{Main|Fleming College}}\nEstablished in 1967, Fleming College (formerly Sir Sandford Fleming College), is a multidisciplinary institution with two primary campuses within the city of Peterborough:\n\n'''Sutherland Campus''' is located on Brealey Drive in the city's west end, and has recently undergone a massive expansion. The new St. Joseph's at Fleming is the first long-term care facility to be built on a college or university campus. In 2005, the Peterborough Sport & Wellness Centre was constructed to accommodate the college's athletic needs.\n\nMcRae Campus was located in a renovated [[textile]] mill located on McDonnel Street near Monaghan Road. Formerly the School of Continuing Education and Skilled Trades, the campus closed in 2014 when the Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre opened on the Sutherland Campus.\n\nThe college also operates satellite campuses in nearby [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], [[Cobourg]] and [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Haliburton]].\n\n====Kawartha Lakes Bible College====\n{{Main|Kawartha Lakes Bible College}}\nKawartha Lakes Bible College (KLBC) is a small evangelical Bible college affiliated with the [[Brethren Movement|Plymouth Brethren]].

The school has partnerships with Trent University and [[Tyndale University College and Seminary]] of Toronto.\n\n===Public library system===\n[[Image:Peterborough Public Library, Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Peterborough's main library]]\nThe Peterborough Mechanics Institute, established in 1868, housed a subscription library that allowed members who paid a fee to borrow books. Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|title=Film crew jumps around the city|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2006|website=mykawartha.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211000337/http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|archive-date=11 February 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]].

Peterborough is also home to a single television station, [[CHEX-DT]], which is the local [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O; as well as [[TVCogeco]], a local cable television channel operated by [[Cogeco]] Cable. Peterborough has two main newspapers, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'', which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and ''[[Peterborough This Week]]'', which publishes every Wednesday and Friday. A non-political publication called SNAP Peterborough is published monthly with sections for home, business, sporting events, etc. with a main focus on providing friendly and photographic news.<ref>{{cite web |title=snapd Peterborough |url=https://peterborough.snapd.com/ |publisher=snapd Inc. |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Sister cities==\n\n* {{flag|United States}} [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] since 1983.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Peterborough, Ontario}}\n<!-- Other than the 3 people mentioned below, individuals should not be listed here, but rather in List of people from Peterborough, Ontario -->\n[[Sir Sandford Fleming]] originally came to the town in the late 1840s with his first impression finding it to be \"rather a poor little place\".<ref name=\"cheekyfleming\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/material_culture/sfaulkne/arch.htm\n |title        = Diaries of Sir Sandford Fleming\n |date         = June 17, 1845\n |accessdate   = December 8, 2008\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090209065123/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/material_culture/sfaulkne/arch.htm\n |archive-date = February 9, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> However, since, there have been a number of people of note, including athletes, musicians, authors and more who made Peterborough their home.

The Serpent Mounds are located near [[Keene, Ontario|Keene]], approximately 30&nbsp;km southeast of Peterborough in [[Otonabee-South Monaghan, Ontario|Otonabee-South Monaghan]] township, in an area first inhabited sometime before 10 CE.<ref name=\"mounds\">{{cite web\n |title      = Serpent Mounds National Historic Site of Canada\n |work       = Parks Canada Directory of Federal Heritage Designations\n |publisher  = [[Government of Canada]]\n |date       = \n |url        = https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=511\n |accessdate = March 19, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1615, [[Samuel de Champlain]] travelled through the area, coming down from [[Lake Chemong]] and portaging down a trail, which is approximated by present-day Chemong Road, to the [[Otonabee River]]<ref name=\"champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |title=Peterborough and the Kawarthas |publisher=[[Trent University]] |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211014631/http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> and stayed for a brief time near the present-day site of [[Bridgenorth, Ontario|Bridgenorth]], just north of Peterborough.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1818, Adam Scott settled on the west shore of the [[Otonabee River]]. The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219. Print</ref>\n\nRobinson was urged by landlords to remove the \"pauper and undesirables\". He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish. to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here. One school and one bank agency were operating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-39|F|1}} on December 21, 1871.<ref name=\"December 1871\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Peterborough ([[Trent University]]), 1981\u22122010 normals, extremes

Trent's academic focus is on environmental, cultural and science studies. The main '''Symons Campus''' of Trent, located in the city's far north end, is approximately 14.6 square kilometres, over half of which is a part of Trent's Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wild-life [[nature reserve]].\n\nTrent University operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, [[Catharine Parr Traill]], Otonabee, [[Peter Gzowski]] and Julian Blackburn. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room and student government, except for Catharine Parr Traill (which consists only of part-time students and is located near downtown Peterborough) and Julian Blackburn (which is mostly administrative).\n\n====Fleming College====\n{{Main|Fleming College}}\nEstablished in 1967, Fleming College (formerly Sir Sandford Fleming College), is a multidisciplinary institution with two primary campuses within the city of Peterborough:\n\n'''Sutherland Campus''' is located on Brealey Drive in the city's west end, and has recently undergone a massive expansion. The new St. Joseph's at Fleming is the first long-term care facility to be built on a college or university campus. In 2005, the Peterborough Sport & Wellness Centre was constructed to accommodate the college's athletic needs.\n\nMcRae Campus was located in a renovated [[textile]] mill located on McDonnel Street near Monaghan Road. Formerly the School of Continuing Education and Skilled Trades, the campus closed in 2014 when the Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre opened on the Sutherland Campus.\n\nThe college also operates satellite campuses in nearby [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], [[Cobourg]] and [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Haliburton]].\n\n====Kawartha Lakes Bible College====\n{{Main|Kawartha Lakes Bible College}}\nKawartha Lakes Bible College (KLBC) is a small evangelical Bible college affiliated with the [[Brethren Movement|Plymouth Brethren]].

Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|title=Film crew jumps around the city|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2006|website=mykawartha.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211000337/http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|archive-date=11 February 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]].

Peterborough is also home to a single television station, [[CHEX-DT]], which is the local [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O; as well as [[TVCogeco]], a local cable television channel operated by [[Cogeco]] Cable. Peterborough has two main newspapers, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'', which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and ''[[Peterborough This Week]]'', which publishes every Wednesday and Friday.
