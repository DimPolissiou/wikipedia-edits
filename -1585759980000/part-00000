description|Province of South Africa on the south-western coast}}\nThe '''Western Cape''' ({{lang-af|Wes-Kaap}}; {{lang-xh|iNtshona-Koloni}}) is a [[provinces of South Africa|province]] of [[South Africa]], situated on the south-western coast of the country. It is the [[List of South African provinces by area|fourth largest of the nine provinces]] with an area of {{convert|129449|km2}}, and [[List of South African provinces by population|the third most populous]], with an estimated 6.6 million inhabitants in 2018.<ref> Statistics South Africa, 2018. Mid- year population estimates. Available: http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022018.pdf</ref> About two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the metropolitan area of [[Cape Town]], which is also the provincial capital. The Western Cape was created in 1994 from part of the former [[Cape Province]], The two largest cities are [[Cape Town]] and [[George, Western Cape|George]]\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Western Cape topography labelled (with provincial labels).svg|thumb|400px|left|Topography of the Western Cape. The Roggeveld and Nuweveld mountains are part of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] (see diagrams below). The other mountain ranges belong to the [[Cape Fold Belt]], also shown in the diagrams below. The Western Cape's inland boundary lies for the most part at the foot of the Great Escarpment.]]\n[[File:SW-NE geological cross section through South Africa.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|An approximate SW-NE cross section through South Africa with the [[Cape Peninsula]] (with [[Table Mountain]]) on left, and northeastern [[KwaZulu-Natal]] on the right. Diagrammatic and only roughly to scale. It shows the major geological structures (coloured layers) that dominate the southern and eastern parts of the country, as well as the relationship between the Central Plateau, the [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Fold Mountains]], and the [[Drakensberg]] escarpment. The significance and origin of the geological layers can be found under the headings \"[[Karoo Supergroup]]\" and \"[[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Supergroup]]\".]]\n[[File:NS cross section Southern Cape.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|A diagrammatic 400 km north-south crosssection through the southern portion of the country at approximately 21\u00b0 30\u2019 E (i.e. near [[Calitzdorp]] in the Little Karoo), showing the relationship between the [[Cape Fold Mountains]] (and their geological structure) and the [[Karoo Supergroup|geology of the Little and Great Karoo]], as well as the position of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]]. The colour code for the geological layers is the same as those used in the diagram above. The heavy black line flanked by opposing arrows is the fault that runs for nearly 300 km along the southern edge of the [[Swartberg]] Mountains. The Swartberg Mountain range owes some of its great height to upliftment along this fault line. The subsurface structures are not to scale.]]\nThe '''Western Cape Province''' is roughly L-shaped, extending north and east from the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in the southwestern corner of South Africa. It stretches about {{convert|400|km}} northwards along the Atlantic coast and about {{convert|500|km|-2}} eastwards along the South African south coast ([[Southern Indian Ocean]]). It is bordered on the north by the [[Northern Cape]] and on the east by the [[Eastern Cape]]. The total land area of the province is {{convert|129462|km2}},<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|9}} about 10.6% of the country's total. It is roughly the size of [[England]] or the [[State of Louisiana]]. Its capital city and largest city is [[Cape Town]], and some other major cities include [[Stellenbosch]], [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]], [[Paarl]], and [[George, South Africa|George]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] are popular coastal tourism areas.\n\nThe Western Cape is the '''southernmost region of the African continent''' with [[Cape Agulhas]] as its southernmost point, only 3800&nbsp;km from the Antarctic coastline. The coastline varies from sandy between capes, to rocky to steep and mountainous in places. The only natural harbour is [[Saldanha Bay]] on the west coast, about 140&nbsp;km north of Cape Town. However a lack of fresh water in the region meant that it has only recently been used as a harbour. The province's main harbour was built in [[Table Bay]], which in its natural state was fully exposed to the northwesterly storms that bring rain to the province in winter, as well as the almost uninterrupted dry southeasterly winds in summer. But fresh water coming off [[Table Mountain]] and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] allowed the early European settlers to build Cape Town on the shores of this less than satisfactory anchorage.\n\nThe province is '''topographically''' exceptionally diverse. Most of the province falls within the [[Cape Fold Belt]], a set of nearly parallel ranges of [[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|sandstone folded mountains]] of [[Cambrian]]-[[Ordovician]] age (the age of the rocks is from 510 to about 330&nbsp;million years ago; their folding into mountains occurred about 350 to about 270&nbsp;million years ago).<ref name=compton>Compton, J.S.

The valleys between ranges are generally very fertile as they contain the weathered loamy soils of the [[Cape Fold Belt#Bokkeveld Group|Bokkeveld mudstones]] (see the diagrams on the left).<ref name=McCarthy />\n\nThe '''far interior''' forms part of the [[Karoo]]. This region of the Province is generally arid and hilly with a [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|prominent escarpment]] that runs close to the Province's most inland boundary.\n\nThe '''Escarpment''' marks the southwestern edge of [[Geography of South Africa#Topographical Divisions|South Africa's central plateau]] (see the middle and bottom diagrams on the left).<ref name=McCarthy /><ref name= \"Altas\">Atlas of Southern Africa. (1984). p. 13. Readers Digest Association, Cape Town</ref> It runs parallel to the entire South African coastline except in the very far northeast, where it is interrupted by the [[Limpopo River]] valley, and the far northwest, where it is interrupted by the [[Orange River]] valley. The 1000&nbsp;km-long northeastern stretch of the escarpment is called the [[Drakensberg]], which is geographically and geologically quite distinct from the [[Cape Fold Belt#Cape Supergroup|Cape Fold Mountains]], which originated much earlier and totally independently of the origin of the escarpment.<ref name=McCarthy /><ref name=Truswell /><ref name= McCarthy1>McCarthy, T.S.

(2006). ''Geological Journeys''. p.290-300. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref>\n\nThe '''principal rivers''' of the province are the [[Berg River|Berg]] and [[Olifants River (Western Cape)|Olifants]] which drain into the Atlantic Ocean, and the [[Breede River|Breede]] and [[Gourits River|Gourits]] which drain into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe '''vegetation''' is also extremely diverse, with one of the world's seven floral kingdoms almost exclusively endemic to the province, namely the [[Cape floristic region|Cape Floral Kingdom]], most of which is covered by [[Fynbos]] (from the Afrikaans meaning \"Fine Bush\" (Dutch: Fijnbosch), though precisely how it came to be referred to as such, is uncertain.).<ref name=manning>{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=Field Guide to Fynbos|date=2007|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town| isbn=9781770072657|pages=8\u201323|url= |lpg= |chapter=The World of Fynbos}}</ref><ref name=maytham>{{cite book|last1=Trinder-Smith|first1=Terry|title=Wild Flowers of the Table Mountain National Park|date=2006|publisher=Botanical Society of South Africa|location=Cape Town| isbn=1874999600|pages=19\u201335|url= |lpg= |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> These evergreen heathlands are extremely rich in species diversity,<ref name=manning /><ref name=maytham /> with at least as many plant species occurring on [[Table Mountain]] as in  the entire United Kingdom.<ref name=maytham /> It is characterised by various types of shrubs, thousands of flowering plant species and some grasses.<ref name=manning /> With the exception of the Silver tree, ''[[Leucadendron argenteum]]'', which only grows on the granite and clay soils of the [[Cape Peninsula]],<ref name=manning2>{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=Field Guide to Fynbos|date=2007|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town| isbn=9781770072657|page=258|url= |lpg= |chapter=Cone Bush, Tolbos}}</ref> open fynbos is generally treeless except in the wetter mountain ravines where patches of [[Afromontane forest]] persist.<ref name=manning /><ref name=maytham />\n\nThe arid interior is dominated by [[Karoo#Karoo flora|Karoo drought-resistant shrubbery]]. The [[Geography of South Africa#Namaqualand|West Coast]] and [[Karoo#Divisions|Little Karoo]] are [[semi-arid]] regions and are typified by many species of succulents and drought-resistant shrubs and acacia trees. The [[Garden Route]] on the south coast (between the [[Outeniqua Mountains]] and the [[Southern Indian Ocean]]) is extremely lush, with temperate rainforest (or [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane Forest]]) covering many areas adjacent to the coast, in the deep river valleys and along the southern slopes of the Outeniqua mountain range. Typical species are hardwoods of exceptional height, such as [[Podocarpus|Yellowwood]], [[Stinkwood]] and [[Ironwood]] trees.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Western Cape is also climatologically diverse, with many distinct micro- and macroclimates created by the varied topography and the influence of the surrounding ocean currents. These are the warm [[Agulhas Current]] which flows southwards along South Africa's east coast, and the cold [[Benguela Current]] which is an upwelling current from the depths of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] along South Africa's west coast.<ref name=Branch>Branch, M & Branch G. (1981). ''The Living Shores of Southern Africa.'' pp. 14\u201318. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref><ref name=tyson>Tyson, P.D., Preston-Whyte, R.A. (2000) ''The Weather and Climate of Southern Africa''. pp. 221\u2013223. Oxford University Press, Cape Town</ref> Thus climatic statistics can vary greatly over short distances. Most of the province is considered to have a [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Both the [[Karoo|Great Karoo and Little Karoo]], in the interior, have an [[arid]] to [[semi-arid]] climate with cold, frosty winters and hot summers with occasional [[thunderstorms]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] on the south coast have a maritime climate with cool, moist winters and mild, moist summers. [[Mossel Bay]] in the Garden Route is considered to have the second mildest climate worldwide after Hawaii.\n\nThunderstorms are generally rare in the province (except in the [[Karoo]]) with most precipitation being of a [[Cold front|frontal]] or [[orographic]] nature.

The BCM represented a social movement for political consciousness.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ideology of the Black Consciousness Movement |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/ideology-black-consciousness-movement |website=South African History Online |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1968, the [[South African Student Organization]] (SASO) was formed at a conference held in Marianhill, Natal. The conference was exclusively attended by Black students.

Poster parades by UWC and Black Power Salute marches by UCT was broken by the police, resulting in 73 students getting arrested and detained at [[Victor Verster Prison]], near Paarl.\n\nOn 1 September 1976, the unrest spread to the city of Cape Town itself. Approximately 2000 black students from Western Cape townships, namely Langa, Nyanga and Gugulethu, matched the Cape Town central business district (CBD). Coloured students also contributed to the protests by peacefully marching to the city, but were blockaded by the police in the CBD. The protests turned violent when coloured students started burning schools, libraries and a magistrate's court in support of the student revolt. Thereafter, 200,000 coloured workers partook in a two-day strike staying away from work in the Cape Town area.\n\nAccording to a report by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), the Western Cape experienced the second highest number of deaths and casualties associated with the 1976 uprising protests.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/black-consciousness-and-student-revolt-cape|title = Black consciousness and student revolt in Cape Town|date = |accessdate = 14 June 2014|website = South African History Online|publisher = }}</ref>\n\n=== 1994 and the Western Cape post-apartheid ===\nIn 1994, at the introduction of the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] and the [[South African general election, 1994|first non-racial election]], South Africa's original provinces and [[bantustan]]s were abolished and [[Provinces of South Africa|nine new provinces]] were established. The former [[Cape Province]] was divided into the Western Cape, [[Northern Cape]], Eastern Cape and part of [[North West (South African province)|North West]].\n\nIn the 1994 election the Western Cape was one of two provinces that did not elect an [[African National Congress]] (ANC) provincial government (the other being [[KwaZulu-Natal]]). The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) won 53% of the votes and 23 seats in the 42-seat provincial legislature, and [[Hernus Kriel]], a former Minister of Law and Order, was elected [[Premier of the Western Cape|Premier]]. He resigned in 1998 and was replaced by [[Gerald Morkel]].\n\nThe [[South African general election, 1999|1999 election]] marked the beginning of a period of great turbulence in Western Cape politics. No party achieved an absolute majority in the provincial parliament, as the ANC won 18 seats while the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] (NNP), successor to the NP, won 17. The NNP went into coalition with the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]] (DP), which won 5 seats, to form a government, and Morkel remained Premier. In 2000 the DP and the NNP formalised their coalition by forming the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA).\n\nIn 2001, however, the NNP broke with the DA over the removal of [[Peter Marais]] from office as [[Mayor of Cape Town]] by DA leader [[Tony Leon]]. The NNP instead went into coalition with the ANC; Gerald Morkel, who was opposed to the split, resigned as Premier and was replaced by Peter Marais. In 2002 Marais resigned as Premier due to a sexual harassment scandal, and was replaced by NNP leader [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]]. During the [[2003 South African floor-crossing window period|2003 floor-crossing period]] four members of the provincial parliament crossed to the ANC, giving it an absolute majority of 22 seats in the 42-seat house. However, the ANC remained in coalition with the NNP and van Schalkwyk remained as Premier.\n\nIn the [[South African general election, 2004|2004 election]] there was again no absolute winner in the provincial parliament; this time the ANC won 19 seats, the DA won 12, and the NNP won 5. The ANC-NNP coalition continued in power, but van Schalkwyk took up a ministerial post in the national cabinet and was replaced as Premier by the ANC's [[Ebrahim Rasool]]. The NNP was finally dissolved after the [[2005 South African floor-crossing window period|2005 floor-crossing period]] and its members joined the ANC, again giving that party an absolute majority of 24 seats. In the [[2007 South African floor-crossing window period|2007 floor-crossing period]] the ANC gained a further three members of the provincial parliament. In 2008 Rasool resigned as Premier due to internal party politics, and was replaced by [[Lynne Brown]].\n\nThe [[South African general election, 2009|2009 election]] marked a significant change in Western Cape politics, as the Democratic Alliance won 51% of the votes and an absolute majority of 22 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 31% of the vote. The DA leader [[Helen Zille]] was elected Premier. In 2010 the [[Independent Democrats]], which had won 3 seats with 5% of the vote, merged with the DA. In the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]] the DA won 59% of the votes and an absolute majority of 26 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 32% of the vote.

It had won   24 seats with 55%. Helen Zille was term-limited and the DA premier candidate [[Alan Winde]] succeeded her. The ANC also lost support. It had received 12 seats with 28% support, its lowest showing since 1994.

The provincial parliament is responsible for legislating within its responsibilities as set out by the [[Constitution of South Africa|national constitution]]; these responsibilities include agriculture, education, environment, health services, housing, language policies, tourism, trade, and welfare.\n\nThe provincial parliament also elects the [[Premier of the Western Cape]] to lead the provincial executive. Since 2019 the Premiership has been held by [[Alan Winde]], former Provincial Minister of Community Safety. The Premier appoints ten members of the provincial legislature to serve as a cabinet of ministers, overseeing the departments of the provincial government.

Other routes are the \"R\" roads which connect the smaller towns. All major roads are tarred with major rural gravel roads well maintained. Limited access motorways are limited to the Cape Metropolitan Area, Winelands and Garden Route, however due to the low population density of the remainder of the province, the highways remain efficient and high-speed, except during peak holiday travel seasons, when travel can be slow-going in places due to heavy traffic. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nTelecommunications in the province are highly sophisticated.

Major cities and towns have access to mobile internet speeds in excess of 21 Mbit/s (HSDPA+).

Africa]], situated on the south-western coast of the country. It is the [[List of South African provinces by area|fourth largest of the nine provinces]] with an area of {{convert|129449|km2}}, and [[List of South African provinces by population|the third most populous]], with an estimated 6.6 million inhabitants in 2018.<ref> Statistics South Africa, 2018. Mid- year population estimates. Available: http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022018.pdf</ref> About two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the metropolitan area of [[Cape Town]], which is also the provincial capital.

The Roggeveld and Nuweveld mountains are part of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] (see diagrams below). The other mountain ranges belong to the [[Cape Fold Belt]], also shown in the diagrams below. The Western Cape's inland boundary lies for the most part at the foot of the Great Escarpment.]]\n[[File:SW-NE geological cross section through South Africa.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|An approximate SW-NE cross section through South Africa with the [[Cape Peninsula]] (with [[Table Mountain]]) on left, and northeastern [[KwaZulu-Natal]] on the right. Diagrammatic and only roughly to scale. It shows the major geological structures (coloured layers) that dominate the southern and eastern parts of the country, as well as the relationship between the Central Plateau, the [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Fold Mountains]], and the [[Drakensberg]] escarpment. The significance and origin of the geological layers can be found under the headings \"[[Karoo Supergroup]]\" and \"[[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Supergroup]]\".]]\n[[File:NS cross section Southern Cape.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|A diagrammatic 400 km north-south crosssection through the southern portion of the country at approximately 21\u00b0 30\u2019 E (i.e. near [[Calitzdorp]] in the Little Karoo), showing the relationship between the [[Cape Fold Mountains]] (and their geological structure) and the [[Karoo Supergroup|geology of the Little and Great Karoo]], as well as the position of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]]. The colour code for the geological layers is the same as those used in the diagram above. The heavy black line flanked by opposing arrows is the fault that runs for nearly 300 km along the southern edge of the [[Swartberg]] Mountains. The Swartberg Mountain range owes some of its great height to upliftment along this fault line. The subsurface structures are not to scale.]]\nThe '''Western Cape Province''' is roughly L-shaped, extending north and east from the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in the southwestern corner of South Africa. It stretches about {{convert|400|km}} northwards along the Atlantic coast and about {{convert|500|km|-2}} eastwards along the South African south coast ([[Southern Indian Ocean]]). It is bordered on the north by the [[Northern Cape]] and on the east by the [[Eastern Cape]]. The total land area of the province is {{convert|129462|km2}},<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|9}} about 10.6% of the country's total. It is roughly the size of [[England]] or the [[State of Louisiana]]. Its capital city and largest city is [[Cape Town]], and some other major cities include [[Stellenbosch]], [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]], [[Paarl]], and [[George, South Africa|George]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] are popular coastal tourism areas.\n\nThe Western Cape is the '''southernmost region of the African continent''' with [[Cape Agulhas]] as its southernmost point, only 3800&nbsp;km from the Antarctic coastline. The coastline varies from sandy between capes, to rocky to steep and mountainous in places. The only natural harbour is [[Saldanha Bay]] on the west coast, about 140&nbsp;km north of Cape Town. However a lack of fresh water in the region meant that it has only recently been used as a harbour. The province's main harbour was built in [[Table Bay]], which in its natural state was fully exposed to the northwesterly storms that bring rain to the province in winter, as well as the almost uninterrupted dry southeasterly winds in summer. But fresh water coming off [[Table Mountain]] and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] allowed the early European settlers to build Cape Town on the shores of this less than satisfactory anchorage.\n\nThe province is '''topographically''' exceptionally diverse. Most of the province falls within the [[Cape Fold Belt]], a set of nearly parallel ranges of [[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|sandstone folded mountains]] of [[Cambrian]]-[[Ordovician]] age (the age of the rocks is from 510 to about 330&nbsp;million years ago; their folding into mountains occurred about 350 to about 270&nbsp;million years ago).<ref name=compton>Compton, J.S.

This region of the Province is generally arid and hilly with a [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|prominent escarpment]] that runs close to the Province's most inland boundary.\n\nThe '''Escarpment''' marks the southwestern edge of [[Geography of South Africa#Topographical Divisions|South Africa's central plateau]] (see the middle and bottom diagrams on the left).<ref name=McCarthy /><ref name= \"Altas\">Atlas of Southern Africa.

The [[Geography of South Africa#Namaqualand|West Coast]] and [[Karoo#Divisions|Little Karoo]] are [[semi-arid]] regions and are typified by many species of succulents and drought-resistant shrubs and acacia trees. The [[Garden Route]] on the south coast (between the [[Outeniqua Mountains]] and the [[Southern Indian Ocean]]) is extremely lush, with temperate rainforest (or [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane Forest]]) covering many areas adjacent to the coast, in the deep river valleys and along the southern slopes of the Outeniqua mountain range. Typical species are hardwoods of exceptional height, such as [[Podocarpus|Yellowwood]], [[Stinkwood]] and [[Ironwood]] trees.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Western Cape is also climatologically diverse, with many distinct micro- and macroclimates created by the varied topography and the influence of the surrounding ocean currents. These are the warm [[Agulhas Current]] which flows southwards along South Africa's east coast, and the cold [[Benguela Current]] which is an upwelling current from the depths of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] along South Africa's west coast.<ref name=Branch>Branch, M & Branch G.

Most of the province is considered to have a [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Both the [[Karoo|Great Karoo and Little Karoo]], in the interior, have an [[arid]] to [[semi-arid]] climate with cold, frosty winters and hot summers with occasional [[thunderstorms]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] on the south coast have a maritime climate with cool, moist winters and mild, moist summers. [[Mossel Bay]] in the Garden Route is considered to have the second mildest climate worldwide after Hawaii.\n\nThunderstorms are generally rare in the province (except in the [[Karoo]]) with most precipitation being of a [[Cold front|frontal]] or [[orographic]] nature. Extremes of heat and cold are common inland, but rare near the coast. Snow is a common winter occurrence on the [[Cape Fold Belt|Western Cape Mountains]] occasionally reaching down into the more inland valleys. Otherwise, frost is relatively rare in coastal areas and many of the heavily cultivated valleys.\n\n* [[Cape Town International Airport]] averages: January maximum: 26&nbsp;\u00b0C (min: 16&nbsp;\u00b0C), July maximum: 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (min: 7&nbsp;\u00b0C), annual rainfall: 515mm\n* [[Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden]], [[Cape Town]] annual rainfall: 1395mm\n* [[George, Western Cape|George]] averages: January maximum: 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (min: 15&nbsp;\u00b0C), July maximum: 19&nbsp;\u00b0C (min: 7&nbsp;\u00b0C), annual rainfall: 715mm\n* [[Laingsburg, Western Cape|Laingsburg, on the N1 highway in the Great Karoo]] (coordinates:  Lat: S33.20\u00b0, Long: E20.85\u00b0) annual rainfall: 150&nbsp;mm, summer daytime temperatures exceeding 30&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Cities and towns===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n{{see also|List of cities and towns in the Western Cape}}\n[[File:Road map of the Western Cape with towns.svg|right|thumb|Towns and main roads in the Western Cape]]\n\n'''Population over 3 million:'''\n* [[Cape Town]] : 4,005,015\n\n'''Population 100,000\u20131,000,000:'''\n* [[Paarl]] * [[Wellington, Western Cape|Wellington]]  : 179, 319\n* [[George, Western Cape|George]] : 122,291\n* [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]] : 103,073\n\n'''Population 50,000\u2013100,000:'''\n{{div col |colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]]\n* [[Knysna]]\n* [[Mossel Bay]]\n* [[Oudtshoorn]]\n* [[Stellenbosch]]\n\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Population 10,000\u201350,000:'''\n{{div col |colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Ashton, Western Cape|Ashton]]\n* [[Beaufort West]]\n* [[Bredasdorp]]\n* [[Caledon, Western Cape|Caledon]]\n* [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]]\n* [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]\n* [[De Doorns]]\n* [[Dysselsdorp]]\n* [[Fisantekraal]]\n* [[Franschhoek]]\n* [[Gansbaai]]\n* [[Gordon's Bay]]\n* [[Grabouw]]\n* [[Great Brak River (town)|Great Brak River]]\n* [[Hermanus]]\n* [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]\n* [[Melkbosstrand]]\n* [[Montagu, Western Cape|Montagu]]\n* [[Moorreesburg]]\n* [[Piketberg]]\n* [[Plettenberg Bay]]\n* [[Riversdale, Western Cape|Riversdale]]\n* [[Robertson, Western Cape|Robertson]]\n* [[Saldanha, Western Cape|Saldanha]]\n* [[St Helena Bay]]\n* [[Swellendam]]\n* [[Velddrif]]\n* [[Villiersdorp]]\n* [[Vredenburg]]\n* [[Vredendal]]\n* [[Wolseley, Western Cape|Wolseley]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Population 5,000\u201310,000:'''\n{{div col |colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Albertinia, Western Cape|Albertinia]]\n* [[Bonnievale, Western Cape|Bonnievale]]\n* [[Botrivier]]\n* [[Citrusdal]]\n* [[Clanwilliam, Western Cape|Clanwilliam]]\n* [[Genadendal]]\n* [[Hawston]]\n* [[Heidelberg, Western Cape|Heidelberg]]\n* [[Hopefield, Western Cape|Hopefield]]\n* [[Klapmuts]]\n* [[Klawer]]\n* [[Kleinmond]]\n* [[Ladismith]]\n* [[Laingsburg, Western Cape|Laingsburg]]\n* [[Lamberts Bay]]\n* [[Langebaan]]\n* [[Lutzville]]\n* [[Mamre, Western Cape|Mamre]]\n* [[Murraysburg]]\n* [[Onrusrivier]]\n* [[Porterville, Western Cape|Porterville]]\n* [[Prince Albert, Western Cape|Prince Albert]]\n* [[Prince Alfred Hamlet]]\n* [[Riviersonderend]]\n* [[Saron, Western Cape|Saron]]\n* [[Sedgefield, Western Cape|Sedgefield]]\n* [[Touws River (town)|Touws River]]\n* [[Tulbagh]]\n* [[Vanrhynsdorp]]\n* [[Wilderness, Western Cape|Wilderness]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Political history==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Contribution of the Western Cape in the National Youth Uprisings ===\nThe [[Black Consciousness Movement]] (BCM) was a grassroots anti-Apartheid activist movement that emerged in South Africa in the mid-1960s out of the political vacuum created by the jailing and banning of the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress leadership after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960. The BCM represented a social movement for political consciousness.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ideology of the Black Consciousness Movement |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/ideology-black-consciousness-movement |website=South African History Online |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1968, the [[South African Student Organization]] (SASO) was formed at a conference held in Marianhill, Natal. The conference was exclusively attended by Black students. After its launch, SASO became the medium through which black consciousness ideology spread to schools and other university campuses across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/black-consciousness-and-student-revolt-cape|title = Black Consciousness and Student Revolt in the Cape|date = |accessdate = 16 June 2014|website = South African History Online|publisher = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, the then South African Minister of Bantu Education and Development, MC Botha, constituted the imposition of using [[Afrikaans]] as a medium of instruction in black schools, effective with students in Grade 7 (Standard 5) upwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Afrikaans Medium Decree |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-afrikaans-medium-decree-43416 |website=ThoughtCo |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref> As early as March 1976, students began passive resistance against Afrikaans, fueling the outbreak of the [[Soweto uprising|Soweto Uprising]] on 16 June 1976.

Poster parades by UWC and Black Power Salute marches by UCT was broken by the police, resulting in 73 students getting arrested and detained at [[Victor Verster Prison]], near Paarl.\n\nOn 1 September 1976, the unrest spread to the city of Cape Town itself. Approximately 2000 black students from Western Cape townships, namely Langa, Nyanga and Gugulethu, matched the Cape Town central business district (CBD). Coloured students also contributed to the protests by peacefully marching to the city, but were blockaded by the police in the CBD. The protests turned violent when coloured students started burning schools, libraries and a magistrate's court in support of the student revolt. Thereafter, 200,000 coloured workers partook in a two-day strike staying away from work in the Cape Town area.\n\nAccording to a report by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), the Western Cape experienced the second highest number of deaths and casualties associated with the 1976 uprising protests.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/black-consciousness-and-student-revolt-cape|title = Black consciousness and student revolt in Cape Town|date = |accessdate = 14 June 2014|website = South African History Online|publisher = }}</ref>\n\n=== 1994 and the Western Cape post-apartheid ===\nIn 1994, at the introduction of the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] and the [[South African general election, 1994|first non-racial election]], South Africa's original provinces and [[bantustan]]s were abolished and [[Provinces of South Africa|nine new provinces]] were established. The former [[Cape Province]] was divided into the Western Cape, [[Northern Cape]], Eastern Cape and part of [[North West (South African province)|North West]].\n\nIn the 1994 election the Western Cape was one of two provinces that did not elect an [[African National Congress]] (ANC) provincial government (the other being [[KwaZulu-Natal]]). The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) won 53% of the votes and 23 seats in the 42-seat provincial legislature, and [[Hernus Kriel]], a former Minister of Law and Order, was elected [[Premier of the Western Cape|Premier]]. He resigned in 1998 and was replaced by [[Gerald Morkel]].\n\nThe [[South African general election, 1999|1999 election]] marked the beginning of a period of great turbulence in Western Cape politics. No party achieved an absolute majority in the provincial parliament, as the ANC won 18 seats while the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] (NNP), successor to the NP, won 17. The NNP went into coalition with the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]] (DP), which won 5 seats, to form a government, and Morkel remained Premier. In 2000 the DP and the NNP formalised their coalition by forming the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA).\n\nIn 2001, however, the NNP broke with the DA over the removal of [[Peter Marais]] from office as [[Mayor of Cape Town]] by DA leader [[Tony Leon]]. The NNP instead went into coalition with the ANC; Gerald Morkel, who was opposed to the split, resigned as Premier and was replaced by Peter Marais. In 2002 Marais resigned as Premier due to a sexual harassment scandal, and was replaced by NNP leader [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]]. During the [[2003 South African floor-crossing window period|2003 floor-crossing period]] four members of the provincial parliament crossed to the ANC, giving it an absolute majority of 22 seats in the 42-seat house. However, the ANC remained in coalition with the NNP and van Schalkwyk remained as Premier.\n\nIn the [[South African general election, 2004|2004 election]] there was again no absolute winner in the provincial parliament; this time the ANC won 19 seats, the DA won 12, and the NNP won 5. The ANC-NNP coalition continued in power, but van Schalkwyk took up a ministerial post in the national cabinet and was replaced as Premier by the ANC's [[Ebrahim Rasool]]. The NNP was finally dissolved after the [[2005 South African floor-crossing window period|2005 floor-crossing period]] and its members joined the ANC, again giving that party an absolute majority of 24 seats. In the [[2007 South African floor-crossing window period|2007 floor-crossing period]] the ANC gained a further three members of the provincial parliament. In 2008 Rasool resigned as Premier due to internal party politics, and was replaced by [[Lynne Brown]].\n\nThe [[South African general election, 2009|2009 election]] marked a significant change in Western Cape politics, as the Democratic Alliance won 51% of the votes and an absolute majority of 22 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 31% of the vote. The DA leader [[Helen Zille]] was elected Premier. In 2010 the [[Independent Democrats]], which had won 3 seats with 5% of the vote, merged with the DA. In the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]] the DA won 59% of the votes and an absolute majority of 26 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 32% of the vote.

It had won   24 seats with 55%. Helen Zille was term-limited and the DA premier candidate [[Alan Winde]] succeeded her. The ANC also lost support. It had received 12 seats with the 28% support, its lowest showing since 1994.

The provincial parliament is responsible for legislating within its responsibilities as set out by the [[Constitution of South Africa|national constitution]]; these responsibilities include agriculture, education, environment, health services, housing, language policies, tourism, trade, and welfare.\n\nThe provincial parliament also elects the [[Premier of the Western Cape]] to lead the provincial executive. Since 2019 the Premiership has been held by [[Alan Winde]], former Provincial Minister of Community Safety. The Premier appoints ten members of the provincial legislature to serve as a cabinet of ministers, overseeing the departments of the provincial government.

In areas where HSDPA+ is not available, networks make provisions for HSDPA, 3G, EDGE or finally GPRS if demand does not warrant higher speed investment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Western Cape population density map.svg|thumb|right|Population density in the Western Cape\n{{columns\n|col1 =\n{{legend|#ffffcc|&lt;1 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#ffeda0|1\u20133 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fed976|3\u201310 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#feb24c|10\u201330 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fd8d3c|30\u2013100 /km\u00b2}}\n|col2=\n{{legend|#fc4e2a|100\u2013300 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#e31a1c|300\u20131000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#bc0026|1000\u20133000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#800026|&gt;3000 /km\u00b2}}}}]]\n\n[[File:Western Cape 2001 dominant language map.svg|thumb|Dominant home languages in the Western Cape\n{{columns |col1=\n{{legend|#8dd3c7|[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffb3|[[South African English|English]]}}\n{{legend|#fb8072|[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]}}\n|col2=\n{{legend|#fccde5|[[Tswana language|Tswana]]}}\n{{legend|#d0d0d0|No language dominant}}}}]]\n\nThe [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 Census]] recorded the population of the Western Cape as 5,822,734 people living in 1,634,000 households.<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|8, 63}} As the province covers an area of {{convert|129462|km2}},<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|9}} the population density was {{convert|45.0|PD/km2}} and the household density {{convert|12.6|/km2}}.\n\n49% of the people of the Western Cape described themselves as \"[[Coloured]]\", while 33% described themselves as \"[[Black African]]\", 17% as \"[[White South African|White]]\", and 1% as \"[[Indian South African|Indian]] or [[Asian South African|Asian]]\".<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|21}} [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] is the plurality language, spoken as the [[first language]] of 50% of the province's population.

The objective of the game is to attain certain amounts of money, happiness, status, and education.<ref name=TopSecret>{{cite journal |last=Przasnyski |first=Mateusz |date=September\u2013October 1991 |title= Jones in the Fast Lane|journal= Top Secret |issue=7 |page=14 |language=Polish}}</ref> The exact amounts needed are defined by the player(s) when the game begins. The game's name and goals are a play on the concept of [[keeping up with the Joneses]].\n\nIn 2006, the game was unofficially ported to [[Adobe Flash]]. <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.broadpark.no/~kboye/jones/jones.html |title=''Jones in the Fast Lane'' Flash Port (SWF) |access-date=2008-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027174718/http://home.broadpark.no/~kboye/jones/jones.html |archive-date=2017-10-27 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Jones in the Fast Lane.png|200px|left|thumb|Screenshot from video game]]\nThe game world is represented by a board game-like ring of buildings in squares, resembling a cross between ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' and ''[[Careers (board game)|Careers]]''. The game can be played by up to four players, who take turns  \"living\" their respective weeks. If only one player is present, he or she may play against the [[Title role|titular]] \"Jones\".\n\nEach player is represented by a coloured marble on the board. Players are free to move around in either direction, only limited by the time remaining per turn. Time is used up by moving to a new location and by performing actions like working, attending class, or resting. Each turn represents a week of the character's life, during which the player decides what the character does.\n\nOn weekends, each character experiences an \"Oh What a Weekend\" event, which uses up some money (usually less than $200), or, if the player has got a [[computer]], creates some money in the form of earnings. These events are usually based on a purchase that the player made during his or her previous week, such as attending a show if the player purchased theater or concert tickets. The event can also be random, described to the player with traditional [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]] humor, e.g. \"You went to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in a $20,000 car and came back in a $200,000 [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus.\" If the player chooses to deposit all his or her cash in the bank at the end of week or simply ends the week with no cash then no money will be spent over the weekend.\n\nThe object of the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this is achieved by reaching the top of four goals. The goals are wealth, happiness, education and career. Wealth is achieved by having a certain level of money in the bank, shares and cash in the hand, the player normally would earn this money by going to work. Happiness is achieved by achieving other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work. Education is achieved by completing the available university qualifications, the number of qualifications the player must complete will be dependent on how high the goal level is set. Career is achieved by climbing the career ladder into a management position in a particular job.\n\nThe game does have several fail states such as when a player exits the bank or Black's Market the player may have his or her money stolen by Wild Willy. Wild Willy, from time to time, may also rip off the Low Cost Housing apartments, taking items from all players living there, such as TV sets and VCRs. Wild Willy will never rip off the Security Apartments. Other fail states may include a bank glitch causing the loss of savings in the banks and also the loss of the players' jobs. The game also has a changing economy where prices may increase or drop including rents and wages. If prices drop the player will normally stay on the same wage but if the player changes jobs he or she may be forced to take a pay cut. The player can also choose to lock in a lower rent when prices are low and continue to pay that price for the remainder of the game regardless of increases to prices.\n\nMost buildings feature a live-action clerk or store person who greets the player with a variety of humorous phrases, complete with lip-syncing.\n\n==Development==\nThe game's working title was ''Keeping Up with Jones''.<ref name=CGW>{{cite magazine |last= Wilson |first= Johnny L. |date=June 1990 |title= Keeping Up With Jones |magazine= Computer Gaming World |issue=72 |page=16 }}</ref> ''Jones in the Fast Lane'' was entirely developed as a set of storyboards before artwork or coding commenced.

The objective of the game is to attain certain amounts of money, happiness, status, and education.<ref name=TopSecret>{{cite journal |last=Przasnyski |first=Mateusz |date=September\u2013October 1991 |title= Jones in the Fast Lane|journal= Top Secret |issue=7 |page=14 |language=Polish}}</ref> The exact amounts needed are defined by the player(s) when the game begins. The game's name and goals are a play on the concept of [[keeping up with the Joneses]].\n\nIn 2006, the game was unofficially ported to [[Adobe Flash]]. <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.broadpark.no/~kboye/jones/jones.html |title=''Jones in the Fast Lane'' Flash Port (SWF) |access-date=2008-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027174718/http://home.broadpark.no/~kboye/jones/jones.html |archive-date=2017-10-27 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Jones in the Fast Lane.png|200px|left|thumb|Screenshot from video game]]\nThe game world is represented by a board game-like ring of buildings in squares, resembling a cross between ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' and ''[[Careers (board game)|Careers]]''. The game can be played by up to four players, who take turns  \"living\" their respective weeks. If only one player is present, he or she may play against the [[Title role|titular]] \"Jones\".\n\nEach player is represented by a coloured marble on the board. Players are free to move around in either direction, only limited by the time remaining per turn. Time is used up by moving to a new location and by performing actions like working, attending class, or resting. Each turn represents a week of the character's life, during which the player decides what the character does.\n\nOn weekends, each character experiences an \"Oh What a Weekend\" event, which uses up some money (usually less than $200), or, if the player has got a [[computer]], creates some money in the form of earnings. These events are usually based on a purchase that the player made during his or her previous week, such as attending a show if the player purchased theater or concert tickets. The event can also be random, described to the player with traditional [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]] humor, e.g. \"You went to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in a $20,000 car and came back in a $200,000 [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus.\" If the player chooses to deposit all his or her cash in the bank at the end of week or simply ends the week with no cash then no money will be spent over the weekend.\n\nThe object of the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this is achieved by reaching the top of four goals. The goals are wealth, happiness, education and career. Wealth is achieved by having a certain level of money in the bank, shares and cash in the hand, the player normally would earn this money by going to work. Happiness is achieved by achieving other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work. Education is achieved by completing the available university qualifications, the number of qualifications the player must complete will be dependent on how high the goal level is set. Career is achieved by climbing the career ladder into a management position in a particular job.\n\nThe game does have several fail states such as when a player exits the bank or Black's Market the player may have his or her money stolen by Wild Willy. Wild Willy, from time to time, may also rip off the Low Cost Housing apartments, taking items from all players living there, such as TV sets and VCRs. Wild Willy will never rip off the Security Apartments. Other fail states may include a bank glitch causing the loss of savings in the banks and also the loss of the players' jobs. The game also has a changing economy where prices may increase or drop including rents and wages. If prices drop the player will normally stay on the same wage but if the player changes jobs he or she may be forced to take a pay cut. The player can also choose to lock in a lower rent when prices are low and continue to pay that price for the remainder of the game regardless of increases to prices.\n\nMost buildings feature a live-action clerk or store person who greets the player with a variety of humorous phrases, complete with lip-syncing.\n\n==Development==\nThe game's working title was ''Keeping Up with Jones''.<ref name=CGW>{{cite magazine |last= Wilson |first= Johnny L. |date=June 1990 |title= Keeping Up With Jones |magazine= Computer Gaming World |issue=72 |page=16 }}</ref> ''Jones in the Fast Lane'' was entirely developed as a set of storyboards before artwork or coding commenced.
