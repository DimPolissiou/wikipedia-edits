His father was a physician; his mother was a pianist of English-Scottish-Irish (British) descent whose family had lived in the United States since the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Heyman 1992, 8.</ref> His maternal aunt, [[Louise Homer]], was a leading [[contralto]] at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]; his uncle, [[Sidney Homer]], was a composer of American [[art song]]s. Louise Homer is known to have influenced Barber's interest in voice. Through his aunt, Barber was introduced to many great singers and songs.\n\nAt a very early age, Barber became profoundly interested in music, and it was apparent that he had great musical talent and ability.

At the Curtis Institute, Barber was a triple prodigy in composition, voice, and piano. He soon became a favorite of the conservatory's founder, [[Mary Louise Curtis Bok]]. It was through Mrs. Bok that Barber was introduced to his lifelong publishers, the Schirmer family. At the age of 18, Barber won the [[Joseph H. Bearns Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] for his [[violin sonata]] (now lost or destroyed by the composer).<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\n===Middle years===\n\nFrom his early to late twenties, Barber wrote a flurry of successful compositions, launching him into the spotlight of the classical music world. His first orchestral work, [[The School for Scandal (Barber)|an overture]] to ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', was composed in 1931 when he was 21 years old. It premiered successfully two years later in a performance given by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] under the direction of conductor [[Alexander Smallens]].<ref name=\"obit\"/> Many of his compositions were [[commission (music)|commissioned]] or first performed by such noted artists as [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Raya Garbousova]], [[John Browning (pianist)|John Browning]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Pierre Bernac]], [[Francis Poulenc]], and [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]]. In 1935, at the age of 25, he was awarded the [[American Prix de Rome]]; he also received a Pulitzer traveling scholarship, which allowed him to study abroad in 1935\u20131936. He was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1946.<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\nIn 1938, when Barber was 28, his ''[[Adagio for Strings]]'' was performed by the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Arturo Toscanini]], along with his first ''[[Essay for Orchestra]]''. The Adagio had been arranged from the slow movement of Barber's [[String Quartet (Barber)|String Quartet, Op. 11]]. Toscanini had rarely performed music by American composers before (an exception was [[Howard Hanson]]'s ''Second Symphony,'' which he conducted in 1933).<ref>Heyman 1992, 164.</ref> At the end of the first rehearsal of the piece, Toscanini remarked, \"''Semplice e bella''\" (simple and beautiful).\n\nIn 1942, after the US entered World War II, Barber joined the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]]; there, he was commissioned to write his ''Second Symphony'', a work he later suppressed. Composed in 1943, the symphony was originally titled ''Symphony Dedicated to the Air Forces'' and was premiered in early 1944 by [[Serge Koussevitsky]] and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. Barber revised the symphony in 1947 and it was subsequently published by G. Schirmer in 1950<ref>Samuel Barber, ''Second Symphony'', op. 19, G.

He also wrote a concertante work for organ and orchestra entitled ''Toccata Festiva'' (1960).\n\nBarber's final opus was the ''Canzonetta'' for oboe and string orchestra (1977\u201378), Op. 48, originally intended as the second movement of an oboe concerto.<ref>Heyman 2001.</ref>\n\n===Piano===\nBarber's most important and most played works for the piano include his ''Excursions,'' Op. 20, which emulate four styles of classic American idioms, including the boogie woogie and blues, and the [[Piano Sonata (Barber)|''Piano Sonata in E-flat minor'']], Op. 26. ''The Nocturne'' (\"Homage to John Field\"), Op. 33, is another respected piece which he composed for the instrument.\n\n===Opera===\nMenotti supplied the [[libretto]] for Barber's opera ''[[Vanessa (opera)|Vanessa]].''<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Opera Lover's Companion|last=Osborne|first=Charles|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-300-10440-0|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=|chapter=Samuel Barber}}</ref> (Menotti also contributed the libretto for Barber's chamber opera ''A Hand of Bridge''.) In 1956, using his vocal training, Barber played and sang the score of ''Vanessa'' for the Metropolitan Opera's General Manager, [[Rudolf Bing]], who accepted the work. It premiered in January 1958. ''Vanessa'' won the 1958 [[Pulitzer Prize]] and gained acclaim as the first American grand opera.\n\nBarber's ''Antony and Cleopatra'' was commissioned for the new [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] at [[Lincoln Center]], and premiered at the opening of Opera House on September 16, 1966. The elaborate production, designed by [[Franco Zeffirelli]], was plagued with technical disasters; it also overwhelmed and obscured Barber's music, which most critics derided as uncharacteristically weak and unoriginal. The critical rejection of music that Barber considered to be among his best sent him into a deep depression.

He was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] twice: for his opera ''[[Vanessa (opera)|Vanessa]]'' (1956\u201357) and for the [[Piano Concerto (Barber)|Concerto for Piano and Orchestra]] (1962). Also widely performed is his ''[[Knoxville: Summer of 1915]]'' (1947), a setting for soprano and orchestra of a prose text by [[James Agee]]. At the time of Barber's death, nearly all of his compositions had been recorded.<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\n[[File:SamBarberWChesterPA.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Childhood home of Samuel Barber in West Chester, Pennsylvania]]\n\nBarber was born in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], the son of Marguerite McLeod (n\u00e9e Beatty) and Samuel Le Roy Barber.{{sfn|Broder|1985|pp=9\u201310}} He was born into a comfortable, educated, social, and distinguished American family. His father was a physician; his mother was a pianist of English-Scottish-Irish (British) descent whose family had lived in the United States since the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Heyman 1992, 8.</ref> His maternal aunt, [[Louise Homer]], was a leading [[contralto]] at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]; his uncle, [[Sidney Homer]], was a composer of American [[art song]]s. Louise Homer is known to have influenced Barber's interest in voice. Through his aunt, Barber was introduced to many great singers and songs.\n\nAt a very early age, Barber became profoundly interested in music, and it was apparent that he had great musical talent and ability. He began studying the piano at the age of six and at age seven composed his first work, ''Sadness'', a 23-measure solo piano piece in C minor.<ref name=\"obit\"/> Despite Barber's interest in music, his family wanted him to become a typical extroverted, athletic American boy. This meant, in particular, they encouraged his playing football. However, Barber was in no way a typical boy, and at the age of nine he wrote to his mother:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Great Lives From History: The 20th Century|last=Gorman|first=Robert F.|publisher=Salem Press|year=2008|isbn=9781587653452|location=Pasadena, California|pages=[https://archive.org/details/greatlivesfromhi0000unse_o5s6/page/230 230]|url=https://archive.org/details/greatlivesfromhi0000unse_o5s6/page/230}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Dear Mother: I have written this to tell you my worrying secret.

At the age of 12, he became an [[organist]] at a local church. When he was 14, he enrolled in and subsequently graduated from West Chester High School (now [[West Chester Henderson High School]]), later composing the school's alma mater.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alma%20mater|title=Alma Mater Definition|last=|first=|date=|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2019|reason=Dictionary does not mention Barber or West Chester High School, let alone his first opera or activity as an organist}} Also at the age of 14, he entered the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in Philadelphia, where he studied piano with [[Isabelle Vengerova]], [[Musical form|composition]] with [[Rosario Scalero]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/18/124272297/the-life-and-music-of-samuel-barber|title=The Life and Music of Samuel Barber|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[George Frederick Boyle]],<ref>\"[http://www.recordsinternational.com/cd.php?cd=09O052 George Frederick Boyle (1886\u20131948): Piano\u2008Sonata, 5 Pieces, Ballade]\".

At the Curtis Institute, Barber was a triple prodigy in composition, voice, and piano. He soon became a favorite of the conservatory's founder, [[Mary Louise Curtis Bok]]. It was through Mrs. Bok that Barber was introduced to his lifelong publishers, the Schirmer family. At the age of 18, Barber won the [[Joseph H. Bearns Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] for his [[violin sonata]] (now lost or destroyed by the composer).<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\n===Middle years===\n\nFrom his early to late twenties, Barber wrote a flurry of successful compositions, launching him into the spotlight of the classical music world. His first orchestral work, [[The School for Scandal (Barber)|an overture]] to ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', was composed in 1931 when he was 21 years old. It premiered successfully two years later in a performance given by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] under the direction of conductor [[Alexander Smallens]].<ref name=\"obit\"/> Many of his compositions were [[commission (music)|commissioned]] or first performed by such noted artists as [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Raya Garbousova]], [[John Browning (pianist)|John Browning]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Pierre Bernac]], [[Francis Poulenc]], and [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]]. In 1935, at the age of 25, he was awarded the [[American Prix de Rome]]; he also received a Pulitzer traveling scholarship, which allowed him to study abroad in 1935\u20131936. He was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1946.<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\nIn 1938, when Barber was 28, his ''[[Adagio for Strings]]'' was performed by the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Arturo Toscanini]], along with his first ''[[Essay for Orchestra]]''. The Adagio had been arranged from the slow movement of Barber's [[String Quartet (Barber)|String Quartet, Op. 11]]. Toscanini had rarely performed music by American composers before (an exception was [[Howard Hanson]]'s ''Second Symphony,'' which he conducted in 1933).<ref>Heyman 1992, 164.</ref>  At the end of the first rehearsal of the piece, Toscanini remarked, \"''Semplice e bella''\" (simple and beautiful).\n\nIn 1942, after the US entered World War II, Barber joined the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]]; there, he was commissioned to write his ''Second Symphony'', a work he later suppressed. Composed in 1943, the symphony was originally titled ''Symphony Dedicated to the Air Forces'' and was premiered in early 1944 by [[Serge Koussevitsky]] and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. Barber revised the symphony in 1947 and it was subsequently published by G. Schirmer in 1950<ref>Samuel Barber, ''Second Symphony'', op. 19, G. Schirmer's Edition of Study Scores of Orchestral Works & Chamber Music, no. 55 (New York: G.

Schirmer, would have been unlikely to have allowed Barber into the Schirmer offices to watch him \"rip apart the music that his company had invested money in publishing\".<ref>Wright 2010, 95.</ref> The score was later reconstructed from the instrumental parts,<ref>Vox Records liner notes{{Full citation needed|date=December 2010}}<!--Presumably this means the NZSO recording; album title, catalog number, etc. is needed.--></ref> and released in a Vox Box \"Stradivari Classics\" recording by the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Andrew Schenck in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Samuel Barber: A Thematic Catalogue of The Complete Works|last=Heyman|first=Barbara B.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199744640|location=New York|pages=513}}</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Barber and Menotti purchased a house in suburban [[Mount Kisco, New York]], north of Manhattan, which served as their artistic retreat.<ref name=Smith2002/>\n\n===Later years===\nAfter the harsh rejection of his third opera ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (opera)|Antony and Cleopatra]]'', Barber left the United States and spent a number of years in seclusion in Europe, a period also marked by his estrangement from Menotti.<ref name=Smith2002/> After this setback, Barber continued to write music until he was almost 70 years old.

Barber was also influential in the successful campaign by composers against [[ASCAP]], the goal of which was to increase [[royalties]] paid to composers.\n\n==Music==\n\n===Orchestral===\nThrough the success of his Overture to ''The School for Scandal'' (1931), ''Music for a Scene from Shelley'' (1933), ''Adagio for Strings'' (1936), (First) ''[[Symphony in One Movement (Barber)|Symphony in One Movement]]'' (1936), (First) ''[[Essay for Orchestra]]'' (1937) and [[Violin Concerto (Barber)|Violin Concerto]] (1939), Barber garnered performances by the world's leading conductors such as [[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]], [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Charles M\u00fcnch]], [[George Szell]], [[Leopold Stokowski]], and [[Thomas Schippers]].\n\nAmong his works are four concertos, one each for violin (1939), [[Cello Concerto (Barber)|cello]] (1945) and piano (1962), and the [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] ''[[Capricorn Concerto]]'' for flute, oboe, trumpet and string orchestra (1944). He also wrote a concertante work for organ and orchestra entitled ''Toccata Festiva'' (1960).\n\nBarber's final opus was the ''Canzonetta'' for oboe and string orchestra (1977\u201378), Op. 48, originally intended as the second movement of an oboe concerto.<ref>Heyman 2001.</ref>\n\n===Piano===\nBarber's most important and most played works for the piano include his ''Excursions,'' Op. 20, which emulate four styles of classic American idioms, including the boogie woogie and blues, and the [[Piano Sonata (Barber)|''Piano Sonata in E-flat minor'']], Op. 26. ''The Nocturne'' (\"Homage to John Field\"), Op. 33, is another respected piece which he composed for the instrument.\n\n===Opera===\nMenotti supplied the [[libretto]] for Barber's opera ''[[Vanessa (opera)|Vanessa]].''<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Opera Lover's Companion|last=Osborne|first=Charles|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-300-10440-0|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=|chapter=Samuel Barber}}</ref> (Menotti also contributed the libretto for Barber's chamber opera ''A Hand of Bridge''.)  In 1956, using his vocal training, Barber played and sang the score of ''Vanessa'' for the Metropolitan Opera's General Manager, [[Rudolf Bing]], who accepted the work. It premiered in January 1958. ''Vanessa'' won the 1958 [[Pulitzer Prize]] and gained acclaim as the first American grand opera.\n\nBarber's ''Antony and Cleopatra'' was commissioned for the new [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] at [[Lincoln Center]], and premiered at the opening of Opera House on September 16, 1966. The elaborate production, designed by [[Franco Zeffirelli]], was plagued with technical disasters; it also overwhelmed and obscured Barber's music, which most critics derided as uncharacteristically weak and unoriginal. The critical rejection of music that Barber considered to be among his best sent him into a deep depression. In recent years, a revised version of ''Antony and Cleopatra'', for which Menotti provided collaborative assistance, has enjoyed some success.<ref name=Smith2002>Smith 2002, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20050411190345/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/barber_s.html Barber, Samuel]\", citing Heyman 1992 as a general reference.</ref><ref name=Heymann1992>Heyman 1992, 455\u201358, citing {{harvnb|Henahan|1975}} and Valente 1983.</ref>\n\n===Violin===\nIn 1939 Philadelphia industrialist [[Samuel Simeon Fels]] commissioned Barber to write a [[violin concerto]] for Fels's ward, Iso Briselli, a 1934 graduate from the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] (as Barber was).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curtis.edu/alumni/about-alumni/full-alumni-listing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210105243/https://www.curtis.edu/alumni/about-alumni/full-alumni-listing/ |archivedate=2012-12-10 }}</ref> The Barber biographies written by Nathan Broder (1954) and Barbara B.

This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find the new situation relieving.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust.

The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. \n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20.

Clancy decides to interview the sim Glasses Man, who he discovers is, in fact, the President in this universe. In front of the White House, a group of anti-marijuana protesters are gathered, seemingly unbothered by the zombies around them. This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find the new situation relieving. This does not last long as they are hit with a cure that, ironically, causes those still left as zombies to devour them.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|publisher=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. \n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The Date is Trussell's birthday and cannabis-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20. <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Prince Silversaddle", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}
