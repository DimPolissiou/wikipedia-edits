Created by [[Jim Henson|Jim]] and [[Jane Henson]] in 1955, they are the namesakes of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned [[media franchise]] that encompasses television, music, film, and other media associated with the characters.\n\nThe Muppets originated in the short-form television series ''[[Sam and Friends]]'', which aired from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969, and attained [[Celebrity|celebrity status]] and international recognition through ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (1976\u20131981), which received four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical [[film]]s, including ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979); ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' (1981); and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' (1984). The Walt Disney Company began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell [[The Jim Henson Company]]. The Muppets continued their media presence in the 1990s with ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]'' (1989) and ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' (1996\u201398), both of which were similar in format to ''The Muppet Show'', and three films: ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992), ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' (1996), and ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (1999).\n\nDisney acquired the Muppets in February 2004, allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years.<ref name=\"Disney2004Press\">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy The \"Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html |work=Press release |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=16 January 2013 |quote=In the months before his death in 1990, my father Jim Henson pursued extensive discussions with The Walt Disney Company based on his strong belief that Disney would be a perfect home for the Muppets. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207182316/http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004 }}</ref><ref name=\"agreement\">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy the  \"Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\"|url=http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|work=Press release|publisher=[[The Jim Henson Company]]|accessdate=16 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616224354/http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disney-buys-muppets-as-bid-prospect-fades-69711.html|title=Disney buys Muppets as bid prospect fades|work=The Independent|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=December 31, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203185919/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disney-buys-muppets-as-bid-prospect-fades-69711.html|archivedate=December 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Under Disney, subsequent projects included two films: ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' (2011) and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' (2014);

Rowlf became the first Muppet character to appear regularly on network television when he began appearing with [[Jimmy Dean]] on ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]''. In 1966, [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Lloyd Morrisett]] began developing a children's [[educational television]] program and approached Henson to design a cast of Muppet characters during this stage. Produced by the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the program debuted as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969.\n\nHenson and his creative team became closely involved with ''Sesame Street'' during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. ''Sesame Street'' garnered a positive response, and the Muppets' involvement in the series was said to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an \"effective and pleasurable viewing\" method of presentation for its educational curriculum.<ref>Morrow, p. 93</ref><ref>Davis, p. 163</ref>\n\n===1970s: ''The Muppet Show'' and foray into film===\nIn the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in ''[[The Land of Gorch]]'' segments during the first season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. As his involvement with ''Sesame Street'' continued, Henson began developing a network television series focusing on the Muppets;<ref>Finch, p. 5</ref> as opposed to ''Sesame Street'', however, this series would be aimed at a more adult audience and focus largely on [[sketch comedy]]. Two [[Pilot (television episode)|television pilots]], ''[[The Muppets Valentine Show]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence]]'', aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1974 and 1975, respectively.\n\nAfter ABC passed on the pilots and other networks in the United States expressed little interest in the project, British producer [[Lew Grade, Baron Grade|Lew Grade]] approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for [[Associated Television]]. Debuting in 1976, ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' introduced new characters such as [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]], and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] alongside existing characters such as Kermit and Rowlf. Aired in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]] in the United States, ''The Muppet Show'' became increasingly popular due to its sketch-[[Variety show|variety]] format, unique form of humor, and prolific roster of [[Guest appearance|guest stars]]. It was nominated for twenty-one [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s during its run, winning four, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series|Outstanding Variety Series]] in 1978. The success of ''The Muppet Show'' allowed [[The Jim Henson Company|Henson Associates]] to diversify into theatrical [[film]]s, the first of which, ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', was released in 1979.\n\n=== 1980s\u20131990s: Subsequent projects ===\nFollowing ''The Muppet Movie'' were ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'', released in 1981 and 1984, respectively.

In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim came into contact with [[Frank Oz]] that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested [[Jerry Juhl]], who worked with Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in [[Oakland, California]]. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. By the time ''The Muppet Show'' began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz; [[Dave Goelz]]; [[Jerry Nelson]]; [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]; and later, [[Steve Whitmire]], while Juhl became head writer for the series. From ''The Muppet Show'' onward, [[Kevin Clash]]; [[Kathryn Mullen]]; [[Louise Gold]]; [[Karen Prell]]; [[Fran Brill]], [[Caroll Spinney]]; and [[Brian Henson]] performed several minor characters and assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across ''The Muppet Show,'' ''Sesame Street'', ''Fraggle Rock'', and other Henson-related projects.\n\nHenson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Whitmire, Goelz, and [[Bill Barretta]], who joined the main cast of performers in the mid-1990s, assumed Henson's characters, with Whitmire also assuming the role of Beaker. The remainder of Hunt's characters were left without a stable performer until [[David Rudman]] was cast in those roles in the late 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000; [[Eric Jacobson]] assumed his characters beginning in 2002.<ref name=VarMojo/> At Nelson's behest, [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]] gradually began performing his characters in 2008.\n\nWhitmire was [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and most of Whitmire's other characters assumed by the remainder of the cast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kermit-frog-muppeteer-says-he-was-fired-by-disney-1020466|title=Kermit the Frog Muppeteer Says Disney Fired Him|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=July 13, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713213313/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kermit-frog-muppeteer-says-he-was-fired-by-disney-1020466|archive-date=July 13, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Muppets are currently performed by a cast of six principal puppeteers: Jacobson, Goelz, Barretta, Rudman, Vogel and [[Peter Linz]].<ref name=\"VarMojo\" />\n\n==Design and performance==\n[[File:Rowlf the Dog in Jim Henson's Fantastic World Touring exhibit (in Little Rock, Arkansas).jpg|225px|thumb|A [[Rowlf the Dog]] puppet on display at an exhibit in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. Common design elements appear on this puppet, including glove-like \u201clive hands\u201d.]]\n\nThe majority of the Muppets are designed as [[hand puppets]], with several characters utilizing [[hand puppet#Rod puppets|rods]]. Common design elements of the Muppets include wide mouths and large protruding eyes. Most of the Muppets are molded or carved out of various types of foam and covered with any felt-like material. The characters may represent humans; [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] characters; realistic animals; robots; extraterrestrial or mythical creatures; or other forms of abstract characters.\n\nThe Muppets are distinguished from [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] dummies, which are usually animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. They are also generally made of softer material. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, officially known as a \"Muppet performer\", who is usually hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, a stage was used to mask the performers, as would be the case in a live performance. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; in most cases, invisible strings are used to manipulate these puppets, with vocals added at a later point.<ref>Christopher Finch ''Jim Henson: The Works'' 1993, {{ISBN|0-679-41203-4}}.</ref>\n\nSince 2006, Disney has contracted [[Puppet Heap]] to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Wocka, Wocka, Wocka!

One consequence of this design is that most of the Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.\n\nFor more complex Muppets, several performers may operate a single character, with the performer controlling the mouth usually voicing the character. As technology has advanced, the Jim Henson team and other performers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, [[remote manipulators]], and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to exhibit complex movements wholly independently of the performer.\n\nIn his book ''[[Street Gang]]'', author Michael Davis wrote that the characters tend to develop \"organically\", alluding to the performers taking up to a year to develop their characters and voices. They are also \"test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davis |first=Michael |title=Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street |publisher=Viking Press |year=2008 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/streetgangcomple00davi/page/166 166] |isbn=978-0-670-01996-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/streetgangcomple00davi/page/166 }}</ref> When interacting with them, children believed that Muppets were living beings, even when the performers were present.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morrow |first=Robert W. |title=Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |page=[https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/84 84] |isbn=0-8018-8230-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/84 }}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n=== Filmography and television ===\n{{main|List of The Muppets productions}}\n\n===Discography===\n{{main|The Muppets discography}}\nOn September 17, 2002, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released ''[[The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More]]'', a compilation album of music from ''The Muppet Show'' and subsequent film releases.

Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969, and attained [[Celebrity|celebrity status]] and international recognition through ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (1976\u20131981), which received four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical [[film]]s, including ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979); ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' (1981); and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' (1984). The Walt Disney Company began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell [[The Jim Henson Company]]. The Muppets continued their media presence in the 1990s with ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]'' (1989) and ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' (1996\u201398), both of which were similar in format to ''The Muppet Show'', and three films: ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992), ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' (1996), and ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (1999).\n\nDisney acquired the Muppets in February 2004, allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years.<ref name=\"Disney2004Press\">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy The \"Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html |work=Press release |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=16 January 2013 |quote=In the months before his death in 1990, my father Jim Henson pursued extensive discussions with The Walt Disney Company based on his strong belief that Disney would be a perfect home for the Muppets. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207182316/http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004 }}</ref><ref name=\"agreement\">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy the  \"Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\"|url=http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|work=Press release|publisher=[[The Jim Henson Company]]|accessdate=16 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616224354/http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disney-buys-muppets-as-bid-prospect-fades-69711.html|title=Disney buys Muppets as bid prospect fades|work=The Independent|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=December 31, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203185919/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disney-buys-muppets-as-bid-prospect-fades-69711.html|archivedate=December 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Under Disney, subsequent projects included two films: ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' (2011) and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' (2014);

Rowlf became the first Muppet character to appear regularly on network television when he began appearing with [[Jimmy Dean]] on ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]''. In 1966, [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Lloyd Morrisett]] began developing a children's [[educational television]] program and approached Henson to design a cast of Muppet characters during this stage. Produced by the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the program debuted as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969.\n\nHenson and his creative team became closely involved with ''Sesame Street'' during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. ''Sesame Street'' garnered a positive response, and the Muppets' involvement in the series was said to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an \"effective and pleasurable viewing\" method of presentation for its educational curriculum.<ref>Morrow, p. 93</ref><ref>Davis, p. 163</ref>\n\n===1970s: ''The Muppet Show'' and foray into film===\nIn the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in ''[[The Land of Gorch]]'' segments during the first season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. As his involvement with ''Sesame Street'' continued, Henson began developing a network television series focusing on the Muppets;<ref>Finch, p. 5</ref> as opposed to ''Sesame Street'', however, this series would be aimed at a more adult audience and focus largely on [[sketch comedy]]. Two [[Pilot (television episode)|television pilots]], ''[[The Muppets Valentine Show]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence]]'', aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1974 and 1975, respectively.\n\nAfter ABC passed on the pilots and other networks in the United States expressed little interest in the project, British producer [[Lew Grade, Baron Grade|Lew Grade]] approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for [[Associated Television]]. Debuting in 1976, ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' introduced new characters such as [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]], and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] alongside existing characters such as Kermit and Rowlf. Aired in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]] in the United States, ''The Muppet Show'' became increasingly popular due to its sketch-[[Variety show|variety]] format, unique form of humor, and prolific roster of [[Guest appearance|guest stars]]. It was nominated for twenty-one [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s during its run, winning four, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series|Outstanding Variety Series]] in 1978. The success of ''The Muppet Show'' allowed [[The Jim Henson Company|Henson Associates]] to diversify into theatrical [[film]]s, the first of which, ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', was released in 1979.\n\n=== 1980s\u20131990s: Subsequent projects ===\nFollowing ''The Muppet Movie'' were ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'', released in 1981 and 1984, respectively.

In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim came into contact with [[Frank Oz]] that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested [[Jerry Juhl]], who worked with Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in [[Oakland, California]]. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. By the time ''The Muppet Show'' began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz; [[Dave Goelz]]; [[Jerry Nelson]]; [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]; and later, [[Steve Whitmire]], while Juhl became head writer for the series. From ''The Muppet Show'' onward, [[Kevin Clash]]; [[Kathryn Mullen]]; [[Louise Gold]]; [[Karen Prell]]; [[Fran Brill]], [[Caroll Spinney]]; and [[Brian Henson]] performed several minor characters and assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across ''The Muppet Show,'' ''Sesame Street'', ''Fraggle Rock'', and other Henson-related projects.\n\nHenson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Whitmire, Goelz, and [[Bill Barretta]], who joined the main cast of performers in the mid-1990s, assumed Henson's characters, with Whitmire also assuming the role of Beaker. The remainder of Hunt's characters were left without a stable performer until [[David Rudman]] was cast in those roles in the late 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000; [[Eric Jacobson]] assumed his characters beginning in 2002.<ref name=VarMojo/> At Nelson's behest, [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]] gradually began performing his characters in 2008.\n\nWhitmire was [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and most of Whitmire's other characters assumed by the remainder of the cast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kermit-frog-muppeteer-says-he-was-fired-by-disney-1020466|title=Kermit the Frog Muppeteer Says Disney Fired Him|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=July 13, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713213313/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kermit-frog-muppeteer-says-he-was-fired-by-disney-1020466|archive-date=July 13, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Muppets are currently performed by a cast of six principal puppeteers: Jacobson, Goelz, Barretta, Rudman, Vogel and [[Peter Linz]].<ref name=\"VarMojo\" />\n\n==Design and performance==\n[[File:Rowlf the Dog in Jim Henson's Fantastic World Touring exhibit (in Little Rock, Arkansas).jpg|225px|thumb|A [[Rowlf the Dog]] puppet on display at an exhibit in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. Common design elements appear on this puppet, including glove-like \u201clive hands\u201d.]]\n\nThe majority of the Muppets are designed as [[hand puppets]], with several characters utilizing [[hand puppet#Rod puppets|rods]]. Common design elements of the Muppets include wide mouths and large protruding eyes. Most of the Muppets are molded or carved out of various types of foam and covered with any felt-like material. The characters may represent humans; [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] characters; realistic animals; robots; extraterrestrial or mythical creatures; or other forms of abstract characters.\n\nThe Muppets are distinguished from [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] dummies, which are usually animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. They are also generally made of softer material. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, officially known as a \"Muppet performer\", who is usually hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, a stage was used to mask the performers, as would be the case in a live performance. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; in most cases, invisible strings are used to manipulate these puppets, with vocals added at a later point.<ref>Christopher Finch ''Jim Henson: The Works'' 1993, {{ISBN|0-679-41203-4}}.</ref>\n\nSince 2006, Disney has contracted [[Puppet Heap]] to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Wocka, Wocka, Wocka!

One consequence of this design is that most of the Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.\n\nFor more complex Muppets, several performers may operate a single character, with the performer controlling the mouth usually voicing the character. As technology has advanced, the Jim Henson team and other performers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, [[remote manipulators]], and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to exhibit complex movements wholly independently of the performer.\n\nIn his book ''[[Street Gang]]'', author Michael Davis wrote that the characters tend to develop \"organically\", alluding to the performers taking up to a year to develop their characters and voices. They are also \"test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davis |first=Michael |title=Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street |publisher=Viking Press |year=2008 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/streetgangcomple00davi/page/166 166] |isbn=978-0-670-01996-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/streetgangcomple00davi/page/166 }}</ref> When interacting with them, children believed that Muppets were living beings, even when the performers were present.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morrow |first=Robert W. |title=Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |page=[https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/84 84] |isbn=0-8018-8230-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/84 }}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n=== Filmography and television ===\n{{main|List of The Muppets productions}}\n\n===Discography===\n{{main|The Muppets discography}}\nOn September 17, 2002, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released ''[[The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More]]'', a compilation album of music from ''The Muppet Show'' and subsequent film releases.

Being told once by Chloe, that she cannot sleep in the same bed as Marc, she then eventually gave way later on and packed her bags and booked a taxi back home.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; line-height:13px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14.28%;\"|\n! style=\"width:14.28%;\"| Episode 1\n! style=\"width:14.28%;\"| Episode 2\n! style=\"width:14.28%;\"| Episode 3\n! style=\"width:14.28%;\"| Episode 4\n! style=\"width:14.28%;\"| Episode 5\n! style=\"width:14.28%;\"| Episode 6\n|-\n! style=\"background:#000;\" colspan=\"7\"|\n|-\n!
