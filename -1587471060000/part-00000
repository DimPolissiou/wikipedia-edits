{"title_page": "Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox Sports league|title=Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup|sport=Rugby Union|founded=1887|teams=16 (season 2018\u201319)|most_champs=[[Blackrock College]]<br>69|}}\n\n[[File:Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup.jpg|right|275px|The Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup]]\nThe '''Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup''' is the premier [[rugby union]] competition for secondary schools affiliated to the [[Leinster Branch]] of the [[IRFU]]. First held in 1887, the Cup celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2007.\n\nSchools Senior Cup Rugby is divided into 4 tiers in two sections and each cup competition bears a name as follows: Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]] (effectively division 4), Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]] (effectively division 3), Section B [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]] (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1).\n\nAttendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25,000 present at the final. This match traditionally takes place on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] at [[Aviva Stadium|Lansdowne Road]] (now known as the [[Aviva Stadium]]). In 2008, the final was played at the [[RDS Arena|Royal Dublin Society Grounds]] (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be way too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000- 14,000.\n\nThe competition has been subject to criticism from various quarters as being \"elitist\" (as most of the competing schools are fee-paying; in fact only one non fee-paying school has won the cup, De La Salle Churchtown) and for putting undue pressure on its participants. It is also the subject of satire through the [[Ross O'Carroll Kelly]] newspaper column and novels. The competition and schools rugby in the four provinces has been praised though with \"Irish (rugby) game in debt to schools rugby\".<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/edmund-van-esbeck-irish-game-in-debt-to-schools-rugby-182795.html Irish game in debt to schools rugby]</ref>\n\n[[Blackrock College]] are the most successful school in the Cup's history, having lifted the Cup 69 times, an accumulative total larger than all other teams combined.<ref name=\"multiple\">\n[http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThree schools have won the Cup at their first attempt; [[Blackrock College]] in the competition's maiden year in 1887, [[Castleknock College]] who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. [[St. Fintan's High School]] are the most recent 'new' school to the competition, making their debut in 2016/17 season and are coached by Belvedere College 2008 Senior Cup winning captain Thomas Sexton and vice-captain Peter Synnott.\n\nTo date only six schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \"double\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 27 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935\u201336, 1942\u201343, 1945, 1948, 1953\u201354, 1956\u201357, 1962, 1964, 1981\u201382, 1986\u201387, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013\u201314, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 & 2019), Newbridge College (2020), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920).\n\nEven more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This depressing feat has been achieved by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 & 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 & 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), [[Newbridge College]] (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and [[Blackrock College]] (2017) with 1 each. This happened to [[Blackrock College]] for the first time in 2017.\n\nBlackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 & 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 & 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College.\n\nThe 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 between Blackrock College and St Mary\u2019s College finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try from fullback Patrick Hinkson. Hugo MacNeill kicked the sideline conversion. Two further MacNeill penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. Among the future Irish senior internationals playing that day were Hugo MacNeill and Paul Dean. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick\u2019s Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on the 19 March. \n\nGrainey video footage is available on archives on www.rte.ie. The edition of Sports Club was broadcast 31 March 1977. The commentator is Fred Cogley.\n\nIn September 1967 The then Minister for Education Donogh O\u2019Malley\u2019s introduced free secondary school education. Only very few Rugby Playing secondary schools opted to join the \"Free Education\" scheme. To date only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985 De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College to bring the cup to Churchtown. In 2020 the daughter of the De La Salle coach, Jane Farley produced a wonderful Newstalk podcast documentary called \"Class Rugby\" which in a blast of music, memories and politics takes you back to the 1980's with a band of Churchtown teenagers as they take on the established rugby-playing private schools of Leinster.\n\nIn 2020 the final between Newbridge College and Clongowes Wood College had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, as a result the title has been shared for the first time. 2020 was also the year that for the first time in the 133 year history of the competition that no Dublin School reached the final.\n\nFour captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College, <ref>Leinster Schools Senior Rugby Cup Centenary Celebration 1886-1986</ref>1962 and 1963), Jonny Mion ([[Blackrock College]]) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe Cup, and the Schools who play for it, have a history of producing fine rugby players, many of whom go on to play for [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Players such as [[Denis Hickie]], who captained his [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]] team to win the cup in 1994, and [[Gordon D'Arcy]] have impressive senior cup records. The most international players produced have come from [[Blackrock College]], with players such as [[Hugo_MacNeill_(rugby_union)|Hugo MacNeill]], [[Brendan Mullin]], [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Victor Costello]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Bob Casey (rugby player)|Bob Casey]], [[Leo Cullen (rugby player)|Leo Cullen]] and more recently [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Ian Madigan]], [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]] and [[Joey Carbery]]. Terenure College has also produced many Irish international players including Mick Hipwell (also Lion's 1971), Kevin Flynn, Paul Haycock, Niall Hogan (Irish Captain 1995), Conor O'Shea (former head coach Italian national team), Ciaran Clarke, and Girvan Dempsey. De La Salle Churchtown produced the following Internationals - Des Fitzgerald (34 caps) played in 2 RWCs. Named to Lions Team to mark centenary of IRB\nTom Clancy (9 caps), Brian Glennon (1 cap), Niyi Adeolokun (1 cap), Lar Hudson (7 caps) and Austin Quirke (6 caps for France).\n\n==ROLL OF HONOUR - If number of wins are equal - most recent win denotes order in roll of honour==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"width:25%; background:silver;\"| '''School'''\n!  style=\"width:30%; background:silver;\"| '''Location'''\n!  style=\"width:5%; background:silver;\"| '''Titles'''\n!  style=\"width:40%; background:silver;\"| '''Winning years'''\n\n|-\n|[[File:sq3 skywhitesky.svg|23x23px]] [[Blackrock College]]\n|[[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n| 69 \n|1887-88, 1890, 1893\u201397, 1900\u201305, 1907-1910, 1912, 1915-1919, 1925, 1927-1930, 1933-1936, 1939, 1940, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1956, 1957, 1960, 1962,1964, 1967, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018\n'''SCT & JCT''' '''Double''' 27 times - '''1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, proof 1935, 1936, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 blackwhiteblack.svg|23x23px]] [[Belvedere College]]\n| [[Great Denmark Street]] , [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 12\n|1923\u201324, 1938, 1946, 1951, 1968, 1971\u201372, '''2005 (Double)''', 2008, 2016\u201317\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 blackpurplewhite.svg|23x23px]] [[Terenure College]]\n|[[Terenure]], [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 10\n|1952, '''1958 (Double)''', 1979\u201380, 1984, 1992\u201393, 1997, 2001, 2003\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 purplewhitepurple.svg|23x23px]] [[Clongowes Wood College]]\n| [[Clane]], [[County Kildare]]\n| 9\n|1926, 1978, 1988, 1991, 1998, 2000, 2010\u201311, '''2020 (Shared)'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 navyskyyellow.svg|23x23px]] [[Castleknock College]]\n| [[Castleknock]], [[Dublin]]\n| 8\n|1913, '''1920 (Double)''', 1931, 1937, 1944, 1947, 1959, 1965\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 bluewhite.svg|23x23px]] [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]]\n|[[Rathmines]], [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 5\n|1961, 1966, 1969, 1994, 2002\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 bluewhiteblue.svg|23x23px]] [[St. Andrew's College (Ireland)|St. Andrew's College]]\n| [[Booterstown]], [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n| 4\n| 1906, 1911, 1921\u201322\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 skynavy.svg|23x23px]] [[St Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]]\n|[[Ailesbury Road]], [[Dublin 4]]\n| 3\n|2007, '''2012(Double)''', '''2019(Double)'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 whiteblack.svg|23x23px]] [[Newbridge College]]\n| [[Newbridge, County Kildare|Newbridge]], [[County Kildare]]\n| 3\n|1941, 1970, '''2020 (Shared) Double'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 maroonyellowmaroon.svg|23x23px]] [[De La Salle College Churchtown|De La Salle Churchtown]]\n| [[Churchtown, Dublin|Churchtown]], [[Dublin]]\n| 2\n|1983, 1985\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 redyellowblack.svg|23x23px]] [[C.B.C.

In September 2013, [http://www.beauchamps.ie Beauchamps Solicitors] became the new title sponsor for the Leinster Schools Senior Cup. For the duration of this partnership with Beauchamps, the Senior Cup will be known as the \"Beauchamps Leinster Schools Senior Cup\".<ref>http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/domestic/10954.php#.Us166rR0mPx</ref>\n\nThe competition receives extensive coverage in Ireland's broadsheets, in particular ''[[The Irish Independent]]'' and ''[[The Irish Times]]''. Both publish previews of each year's competition and provide match reports for each game played.\n\nIn years gone by the competition's final on St Patrick's Day would sometimes be broadcast on [[TG4]], however, this was discontinued in the early 2000s. From 2005 onwards, however, [[Setanta Sports]] began extensive coverage of school's rugby. This included the finals of all provincial finals and coverage of the Leinster Schools Junior Cup. The Leinster Senior Cup was most prominent, however, with coverage from every game played at Donnybrook and every round of the competition.\n\n[[FreeSports]] replaced [[Eir Sport]] as the competition broadcaster ahead of the 2019 competition where they will broadcast eight games live.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.the42.ie/leinster-senior-schools-cup-freesports-tv-coverage-4433241-Jan2019/|title =Leinster Rugby announces new TV deal for 2019 Senior Schools Cup|date=11 January 2019|work=The 42|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Leinster School of the Year Award==\nIn 2008, Leinster Rugby instituted a new award for overall performance of a school at every level of schools rugby.

He takes part in several campaigns with the school, including the Leinster Junior Cup. The school's name is an homage to that in Paul Howard's books, as Siggins had coined the name \"Ross O'Carroll Kelly\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Junior Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Rugby]]\n* [[Connacht Schools Senior Cup]]\n* [[Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup]]\n* [[Ulster Schools Senior Cup]]\n* [[Ireland national schoolboy rugby union team]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090629185401/http://www.cbcrugby.com/ CBC Monkstown Rugby]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=20&docID=1436 This Year's Draw]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie Leinster Rugby]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]\n* [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2009/0121/1232474670860.html 2009 Irish Times Preview]\n* [https://www.leinsterrugby.ie/irfu-conclude-incomplete-201920-season-immediate-effect/]\n\n{{Rugby union in Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:High school rugby union competitions in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Rugby union competitions in Leinster]]\n[[Category:1887 establishments in Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox Sports league|title=Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup|sport=Rugby Union|founded=1887|teams=16 (season 2018\u201319)|most_champs=[[Blackrock College]]<br>69|}}\n\n[[File:Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup.jpg|right|275px|The Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup]]\nThe '''Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup''' is the premier [[rugby union]] competition for secondary schools affiliated to the [[Leinster Branch]] of the [[IRFU]]. First held in 1887, the Cup celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2007.\n\nSchools Senior Cup Rugby is divided into 4 tiers in two sections and each cup competition bears a name as follows: Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]] (effectively division 4), Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]] (effectively division 3), Section B [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]] (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1).\n\nAttendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25,000 present at the final. This match traditionally takes place on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] at [[Aviva Stadium|Lansdowne Road]] (now known as the [[Aviva Stadium]]). In 2008, the final was played at the [[RDS Arena|Royal Dublin Society Grounds]] (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be way too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000- 14,000.\n\nThe competition has been subject to criticism from various quarters as being \"elitist\" (as most of the competing schools are fee-paying; in fact only one non fee-paying school has won the cup, De La Salle Churchtown) and for putting undue pressure on its participants. It is also the subject of satire through the [[Ross O'Carroll Kelly]] newspaper column and novels. The competition and schools rugby in the four provinces has been praised though with \"Irish (rugby) game in debt to schools rugby\".<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/edmund-van-esbeck-irish-game-in-debt-to-schools-rugby-182795.html Irish game in debt to schools rugby]</ref>\n\n[[Blackrock College]] are the most successful school in the Cup's history, having lifted the Cup 69 times, an accumulative total larger than all other teams combined.<ref name=\"multiple\">\n[http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThree schools have won the Cup at their first attempt; [[Blackrock College]] in the competition's maiden year in 1887, [[Castleknock College]] who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. [[St. Fintan's High School]] are the most recent 'new' school to the competition, making their debut in 2016/17 season and are coached by Belvedere College 2008 Senior Cup winning captain Thomas Sexton and vice-captain Peter Synnott.\n\nTo date only six schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \"double\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 27 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935\u201336, 1942\u201343, 1945, 1948, 1953\u201354, 1956\u201357, 1962, 1964, 1981\u201382, 1986\u201387, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013\u201314, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 & 2019), Newbridge College (2020), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920).\n\nEven more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This depressing feat has been achieved by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 & 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 & 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), [[Newbridge College]] (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and [[Blackrock College]] (2017) with 1 each. This happened to [[Blackrock College]] for the first time in 2017.\n\nBlackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 & 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 & 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College.\n\nThe 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 between Blackrock College and St Mary\u2019s College finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try from fullback Patrick Hinkson. Hugo MacNeill kicked the sideline conversion. Two further MacNeill penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. Among the future Irish senior internationals playing that day were Hugo MacNeill and Paul Dean. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick\u2019s Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on the 19 March. \n\nGrainey video footage is available on archives on www.rte.ie. The edition of Sports Club was broadcast 31 March 1977. The commentator is Fred Cogley.\n\nIn September 1967 The then Minister for Education Donogh O\u2019Malley\u2019s introduced free secondary school education. Only very few Rugby Playing secondary schools opted to join the \"Free Education\" scheme. To date only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985 De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College to bring the cup to Churchtown. In 2020 the daughter of the De La Salle coach, Jane Farley produced a wonderful Newstalk podcast documentary called \"Class Rugby\" which in a blast of music, memories and politics takes you back to the 1980's with a band of Churchtown teenagers as they take on the established rugby-playing private schools of Leinster.\n\nIn 2020 the final between Newbridge College and Clongowes Wood College had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, as a result the title has been shared for the first time. 2020 was also the year that for the first time in the 133 year history of the competition that no Dublin School reached the final.\n\nFour captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College, <ref>Leinster Schools Senior Rugby Cup Centenary Celebration 1886-1986</ref>1962 and 1963), Jonny Mion ([[Blackrock College]]) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe Cup, and the Schools who play for it, have a history of producing fine rugby players, many of whom go on to play for [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Players such as [[Denis Hickie]], who captained his [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]] team to win the cup in 1994, and [[Gordon D'Arcy]] have impressive senior cup records. The most international players produced have come from [[Blackrock College]], with players such as [[Hugo_MacNeill_(rugby_union)|Hugo MacNeill]], [[Brendan Mullin]], [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Victor Costello]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Bob Casey (rugby player)|Bob Casey]], [[Leo Cullen (rugby player)|Leo Cullen]] and more recently [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Ian Madigan]], [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]] and [[Joey Carbery]].

It was fought near [[Edge Hill, Warwickshire|Edge Hill]] and [[Kineton]] in southern [[Warwickshire]] on Sunday, 23 October 1642.\n\nAll attempts at constitutional compromise between [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliament]] broke down early in 1642. Both King and Parliament raised large armies to gain their way by force of arms. In October, at his temporary base near [[Shrewsbury]], the King decided to march to [[London]] in order to force a decisive confrontation with Parliament's main army, commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\nLate on 22 October, both armies unexpectedly found the enemy to be close by. The next day, the Royalist army descended from Edge Hill to force battle. After the \nParliamentarian artillery opened a cannonade, the Royalists attacked. Both armies consisted mostly of inexperienced and sometimes ill-equipped troops. Many men from both sides fled or fell out to loot enemy baggage, and neither army was able to gain a decisive advantage.\n\nAfter the battle, the King resumed his march on London, but was not strong enough to overcome the defending militia before Essex's army could reinforce them. The inconclusive result of the Battle of Edgehill prevented either faction gaining a quick victory in the war, which eventually lasted four years.with Oliver Cromwell as the victor\n\n==Background==\nWhen it appeared to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] that no agreement with Parliament over the government of the kingdom was possible, he left [[London]] on 2 March 1642 and headed for the [[north of England]]. Both Parliament and King realised that armed conflict was inevitable, and prepared to raise forces. Parliament enacted a [[Militia Ordinance]], by which it claimed authority over the country's [[Trainband|trained bands]], while from his temporary capital of [[York]], Charles rejected Parliament's [[Nineteen Propositions]] and issued [[Commissions of Array]], directing the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of each county to raise forces for the King.\n\nThe King then attempted to seize the port of [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] where arms and equipment previously collected for the [[Bishops' Wars]] had been gathered. In the [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Siege of Hull]], the Parliamentarian garrison defied the King's authority and drove his forces away from the city. In early August the King moved south, to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Leicester]], where he secured the contents of the local armouries. On 22 August, he took a decisive step by raising the royal standard in [[Nottingham]], effectively declaring war on Parliament. The [[English Midlands|Midlands]] were generally Parliamentarian in sympathy, and few people rallied to the King there, so having again secured the arms and equipment of the local trained bands, Charles moved to [[Chester]] and subsequently to [[Shrewsbury]], where large numbers of recruits from [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Welsh border]] were expected to join him. (By this time, there was conflict in almost every part of England, as local commanders attempted to seize the main cities, ports and castles for their respective factions.)\n\nHaving learned of the King's actions in Nottingham, Parliament dispatched its own army northward under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], to confront the King. Essex marched first to [[Northampton]], where he mustered almost 20,000 men. Learning of the King's move westwards, Essex then marched north-westwards towards [[Worcester]]. On 23 September, in the first clash between the main Royalist and Parliamentarian armies, Royalist cavalry under [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] routed the cavalry of Essex's vanguard at the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]]. Nevertheless, lacking infantry, the Royalists abandoned Worcester.\n\n==Prelude==\nBy early October, the King's army was almost complete at Shrewsbury. He held a [[council of war]], at which two courses of action were considered. The first was to attack Essex's army at Worcester, which had the drawback that the close country around the city would put the superior Royalist cavalry at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=71}} The second course, which was adopted, was to advance towards London. The intention was not to avoid battle with Essex, but to force one at an advantage. In the [[Earl of Clarendon]]'s words: \"''it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way.''\" Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east. Essex followed, but neither army had much information on the location of their enemy.\n\n[[File:Charles Landseer - The Eve of the Battle of Edge Hill, 1642 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Interpretation of Charles I holding a [[council of war]] before the Battle of Edgehill, by [[Charles Landseer]] (1845)]]\nBy 22 October, the Royalist army was quartered in the villages around [[Edgcote]], and was threatening the Parliamentarian post at [[Banbury]]. The garrison of Banbury sent messengers pleading for help to the garrison of [[Warwick Castle]]. Essex, who had just reached there, ordered an immediate march to Kineton to bring relief to Banbury, even though his army had straggled and not all his troops were present. That evening, there were clashes between outposts and quartermasters' parties in Kineton and the villages nearby, and the Royalists had their first inkling that Essex's army was close by.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=75}} The King issued orders for his army to muster for battle on top of the [[escarpment]] of Edgehill the following day.\n\nEssex originally intended marching straight to the relief of Banbury, but at about 8 a.m. on 23 October, his outposts reported that the [[Cavaliers]] were massed on Edgehill, {{convert|4.5|mi}} from Kineton. Essex deployed his army about halfway between Kineton and the Royalist army, where [[hedge (barrier)|hedges]] formed a natural position.\n\nThe well known \"Soldiers' Prayer\" was given by [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] before the battle, \"O Lord, Thou Knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not Thou forget me\".<ref name=\"OxfordDictQ\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Knowles |editor1-first=Elizabeth |title=Oxford Dictionary of Quotations |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199237173 |edition=7th |quote=O Lord! thou knowest how busy I must be this day: if I forget thee, do not thou forget me.}}</ref>\n\n==The opposing forces==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nThere were some significant differences between the opposing armies, which were to be important to the course of the battle and its outcome. Although both armies were composed of very raw soldiers, they had several experienced officers who had previously fought in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] or [[Sweden|Swedish]] armies during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Several of them had been recruited to lead English forces which were intended to be sent to Ireland following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. Both King and Parliament had bid highly for their services.\n\nThe Royalist cavalry was superior to Parliament's cavalry at this stage of the war. [[Oliver Cromwell]], who arrived too late in the day to take part in the battle, later wrote disparagingly to [[John Hampden]], \"''Your troopers are most of them old decayed servingmen and tapsters; and their ''[the Royalists]'' troopers are gentlemen's sons, younger sons and persons of quality....''\" Not only were the Parliamentarian cavalry not so naturally accustomed to mounted action, but they were drilled in the Dutch tactic of firing pistols and carbines from the saddle, whereas under Rupert, the Royalist cavalry would charge sword in hand, relying on shock and weight.\n\nThe Parliamentarian foot soldiers, however, were better equipped than their Royalist counterparts. The Royalist pikemen were said to lack armour, and the musketeers lacked swords, making the Royalist infantry more vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat. Several hundred of them lacked any sort of weapon apart from clubs or improvised polearms.\n\n==Deployments==\n\n===Royalist Army===\nThe Royalist right wing of cavalry and dragoons was led by Prince Rupert, with Sir [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]] in support. The King's own Lifeguard of Horse insisted on joining Rupert's front line, leaving the King with no cavalry reserve under his own command.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=79}}\n\nThe centre consisted of five \"tertias\" of infantry. There was a last-minute change of command when the Colonel General, [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Lord Lindsey]], was overruled when he wished to deploy them in \"Dutch\" formation, simple phalanxes eight ranks deep. Affronted, he resigned his command and took his place at the head of his own regiment of foot. He was replaced by the Lieutenant General, [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Patrick Ruthven]], who drew up the infantry in chequerboard \"Swedish\" formation, which was potentially more effective but also more difficult to control, particularly with inexperienced soldiers.<ref>For the earl of Forth as commander on the day rather than Rupert or the king see Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, ''[[Alexander Leslie]] and the Scottish Generals of the [[Thirty Years' War]], 1618\u20131648'' (Pickering & Chatto, London, 2014), pp.120\u2013123</ref> The centre was led in battle by Sergeant Major General [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]].\n\nThe left wing consisted of horse under Sir [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry Wilmot]], with [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol|Lord Digby]], the King's secretary of state, in support and Colonel [[Arthur Aston]]'s dragoons on his left flank.\n\n===Parliamentarians===\nThe Parliamentarian left wing consisted of a loosely organised cavalry brigade of twenty unregimented troops under Sir James Ramsay, supported by 600 musketeers and several cannon, deployed behind a hedge.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}}\n\nIn the centre, the infantry brigade of Sir [[John Meldrum]] was drawn up on the left of the front line and Colonel Charles Essex's brigade on the right. Sir Thomas Ballard's infantry brigade was deployed behind Meldrum and the cavalry regiments under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]] and Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] behind Charles Essex.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}} The presence of these two regiments was to be important in the coming battle.\n\nA regiment of infantry under Colonel [[William Fairfax (soldier)|William Fairfax]] linked the centre to the right wing. The right wing consisted of cavalry under [[Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh|Lord Feilding]], posted on some rising ground, with two regiments of dragoons in support.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Edgehill map.svg|thumb|right|500px|Interpretation of the Battle of Edgehill within Radway field \u2013 Royalists blue, Parliamentarians red]]\nAs Essex showed no signs of wishing to attack, the Royalists began to descend the slope of Edgehill some time after midday. Even when they had completed this manoeuvre at about two o'clock, the battle did not begin until the sight of the King with his large entourage riding from regiment to regiment to encourage his soldiers, apparently goaded the Parliamentarians into opening fire.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=104}}\n\nThe King's party withdrew out of range and an artillery duel started. The Royalist guns were trash as most of them were deployed some way up the slope, and from this height most of their shot plunged harmlessly into the earth. While the bombardment continued however, the Royalist dragoons advanced on each flank and drove back the Parliamentarian dragoons and musketeers covering their wings of horse.\n\nOn the right flank, Rupert gave the order to attack. As his charge gathered momentum, a troop of Parliamentarian horse under Faithfull Fortescue abruptly defected. The rest of Ramsay's brigade gave an ineffectual volley of pistol fire from the saddle before turning to flee. Rupert's and Byron's troopers rapidly overran the Parliamentarian guns and musketeers on this flank and galloped jubilantly in pursuit of Ramsay's men, to the detriment of the infantry.\n\nWilmot charged about the same time on the other flank. Feilding's outnumbered troops quickly gave way, and Wilmot and Digby also chased them to Kineton where the Royalist horse fell out to loot the Parliamentarian baggage. Sir [[Charles Lucas]] and Lord Grandison rallied about 200 men, but when they tried to charge the Parliamentarian rear, they were distracted by fugitives from Charles Essex's routed brigade.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|pages=78\u201379}}\n\nThe Royalist infantry also advanced in the centre under Ruthven. Many of the Parliamentarian foot had already run away as their cavalry disappeared, and others fled as the infantry came to close quarters. The brigades of Sir Thomas Ballard and Sir [[John Meldrum]] nevertheless stood their ground. The Parliamentarian cavalry regiments of Stapleton and Balfour emerged through gaps in the line of Parliamentarian foot soldiers, and charged the Royalist infantry. With no Royalist cavalry to oppose them, they put many units to flight.\n\nThe King had left himself without any proper reserve. As his centre gave way, he ordered one of his officers to conduct his sons [[Charles II of England|Charles]] (the Prince of Wales) and [[James II of England|James]] (the Duke of York) to safety while Ruthven rallied his infantry. Some of Balfour's men charged so far into the Royalist position that they menaced the princes' escort and briefly overran the Royalist artillery before withdrawing.{{sfn|Young|1995|pp=114\u2013115}} In the front ranks, Lord Lindsey was killed, and Sir [[Edmund Verney (Cavalier)|Edmund Verney]] died defending the Royal Standard, which was captured by Parliamentarian [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Arthur Young.\n[[File:Prince Rupert at Edgehill.jpg|alt=A drawing of a fight between two groups of cavalry.

Platt}}</ref> of Wilmot's Horse recaptured the Royal Standard by a subterfuge as it was being taken to the Parliamentarian rear as a trophy. Welch also captured two Parliamentarian cannon. As the light began to fade, the battle ended with a fire fight from either side of a dividing ditch, before nightfall eventually brought a natural close to hostilities. The Royalists had been forced back to the position they had originally advanced from, but had regrouped.\n\n==Outcome==\nBy the following morning the King and his army returned to the Edgehill escarpment and Essex's army returned to Kineton. It was a bitterly cold night with a hard frost. This was suggested by contemporary reports as the reason many of the wounded survived, since the cold allowed many wounds to congeal, saving the wounded from bleeding to death or succumbing to infection.\n\nThe following day, both armies partially formed up again, but neither was willing to resume the battle. Charles sent a [[herald]] to Essex with a message of pardon if he would agree to the King's terms, but the [[Courier|messenger]] was roughly handled and forced to return without delivering his message. Although Essex had been reinforced by some of his units which had lagged behind on the march, he withdrew during the evening and the majority of his army marched to Warwick Castle, abandoning seven guns on the battlefield.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday 25th, Prince Rupert led a strong detachment of horse and dragoons and launched a surprise attack upon what remained of the Parliamentarian baggage train at Kineton and killed many of the battle's wounded survivors discovered within the village.\n\nEssex's decision to return northwards to Warwick allowed the King to continue southwards in the direction of London. Rupert urged this course, and was prepared to undertake it with his cavalry alone. With Essex's army still intact, the King chose to move more deliberately, with the whole army. After capturing Banbury on 27 October, he advanced via [[Oxford]], [[Battle of Aylesbury|Aylesbury]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Essex meanwhile had moved directly to London. Reinforced by the London Trained Bands and many citizen volunteers, his army proved to be too strong for the King to contemplate another battle when the Royalists advanced to [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]]. The King withdrew to Oxford, which he made his capital for the rest of the war. With both sides almost evenly matched, it would drag on ruinously for years.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that the Royalist cavalry's lack of discipline prevented a clear Royalist victory at Edgehill. Not for the last time in the war, they would gallop after fleeing enemy and then break ranks to plunder, rather than rally to attack the enemy infantry. Byron's and Digby's men in particular, were not involved in the first clashes and should have been kept in hand rather than allowed to gallop off the battlefield. Patrick Ruthven was elevated to the rank of Lord General of the King's Army, confirming his role as acting commander in the battle.<ref>Murdoch and Grosjean, p.122</ref>\n\nOn the Parliamentarian side, Sir James Ramsay who had commanded the left wing horse which had been routed during the battle, was tried by court-martial at St. Albans on 5 November. The court reported that he had done all that it became a gallant man to do.\n\nThe last survivor of the battle, [[William Hiseland]], fought also at [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] sixty-seven years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Winder|2006}}; {{harvnb|The Scotsman staff|2006}}</ref>\n\n==The Welch medal==\nLieutenant Colonel Robert Welch, who had recaptured the royal standard, was knighted [[knight banneret|banneret]] on the field by King Charles I next morning. The King also granted a patent for a gold medal to be made (the first to be awarded to an individual for action on a battlefield) commemorating the event in Welch's honour. Captain [[John Smith (banneret)|John Smith]] also claimed a supporting part in the rescue of the royal standard and was accordingly also knighted banneret, but the medal was minted in Sir Robert Welch's name and honour.<ref>The British Library, London.

Civil War}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Edgehill''' (or '''Edge Hill''') was a [[pitched battle]] of the [[First English Civil War]]. It was fought near [[Edge Hill, Warwickshire|Edge Hill]] and [[Kineton]] in southern [[Warwickshire]] on Sunday, 23 October 1642.\n\nAll attempts at constitutional compromise between [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliament]] broke down early in 1642. Both King and Parliament raised large armies to gain their way by force of arms. In October, at his temporary base near [[Shrewsbury]], the King decided to march to [[London]] in order to force a decisive confrontation with Parliament's main army, commanded by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].\n\nLate on 22 October, both armies unexpectedly found the enemy to be close by. The next day, the Royalist army descended from Edge Hill to force battle. After the Parliamentarian artillery opened a cannonade, the Royalists attacked. Both armies consisted mostly of inexperienced and sometimes ill-equipped troops. Many men from both sides fled or fell out to loot enemy baggage, and neither army was able to gain a decisive advantage.\n\nAfter the battle, the King resumed his march on London, but was not strong enough to overcome the defending militia before Essex's army could reinforce them. The inconclusive result of the Battle of Edgehill prevented either faction gaining a quick victory in the war, which eventually lasted four years.\n\n==Background==\nWhen it appeared to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] that no agreement with Parliament over the government of the kingdom was possible, he left [[London]] on 2 March 1642 and headed for the [[north of England]]. Both Parliament and King realised that armed conflict was inevitable, and prepared to raise forces. Parliament enacted a [[Militia Ordinance]], by which it claimed authority over the country's [[Trainband|trained bands]], while from his temporary capital of [[York]], Charles rejected Parliament's [[Nineteen Propositions]] and issued [[Commissions of Array]], directing the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of each county to raise forces for the King.\n\nThe King then attempted to seize the port of [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] where arms and equipment previously collected for the [[Bishops' Wars]] had been gathered. In the [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Siege of Hull]], the Parliamentarian garrison defied the King's authority and drove his forces away from the city. In early August the King moved south, to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Leicester]], where he secured the contents of the local armouries. On 22 August, he took a decisive step by raising the royal standard in [[Nottingham]], effectively declaring war on Parliament. The [[English Midlands|Midlands]] were generally Parliamentarian in sympathy, and few people rallied to the King there, so having again secured the arms and equipment of the local trained bands, Charles moved to [[Chester]] and subsequently to [[Shrewsbury]], where large numbers of recruits from [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Welsh border]] were expected to join him. (By this time, there was conflict in almost every part of England, as local commanders attempted to seize the main cities, ports and castles for their respective factions.)\n\nHaving learned of the King's actions in Nottingham, Parliament dispatched its own army northward under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], to confront the King. Essex marched first to [[Northampton]], where he mustered almost 20,000 men. Learning of the King's move westwards, Essex then marched north-westwards towards [[Worcester]]. On 23 September, in the first clash between the main Royalist and Parliamentarian armies, Royalist cavalry under [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] routed the cavalry of Essex's vanguard at the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]]. Nevertheless, lacking infantry, the Royalists abandoned Worcester.\n\n==Prelude==\nBy early October, the King's army was almost complete at Shrewsbury. He held a [[council of war]], at which two courses of action were considered. The first was to attack Essex's army at Worcester, which had the drawback that the close country around the city would put the superior Royalist cavalry at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=71}} The second course, which was adopted, was to advance towards London. The intention was not to avoid battle with Essex, but to force one at an advantage. In the [[Earl of Clarendon]]'s words: \"''it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way.''\" Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east. Essex followed, but neither army had much information on the location of their enemy.\n\n[[File:Charles Landseer - The Eve of the Battle of Edge Hill, 1642 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Interpretation of Charles I holding a [[council of war]] before the Battle of Edgehill, by [[Charles Landseer]] (1845)]]\nBy 22 October, the Royalist army was quartered in the villages around [[Edgcote]], and was threatening the Parliamentarian post at [[Banbury]]. The garrison of Banbury sent messengers pleading for help to the garrison of [[Warwick Castle]]. Essex, who had just reached there, ordered an immediate march to Kineton to bring relief to Banbury, even though his army had straggled and not all his troops were present. That evening, there were clashes between outposts and quartermasters' parties in Kineton and the villages nearby, and the Royalists had their first inkling that Essex's army was close by.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=75}} The King issued orders for his army to muster for battle on top of the [[escarpment]] of Edgehill the following day.\n\nEssex originally intended marching straight to the relief of Banbury, but at about 8 a.m. on 23 October, his outposts reported that the [[Cavaliers]] were massed on Edgehill, {{convert|4.5|mi}} from Kineton. Essex deployed his army about halfway between Kineton and the Royalist army, where [[hedge (barrier)|hedges]] formed a natural position.\n\nThe well known \"Soldiers' Prayer\" was given by [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] before the battle, \"O Lord, Thou Knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not Thou forget me\".<ref name=\"OxfordDictQ\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Knowles |editor1-first=Elizabeth |title=Oxford Dictionary of Quotations |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199237173 |edition=7th |quote=O Lord! thou knowest how busy I must be this day: if I forget thee, do not thou forget me.}}</ref>\n\n==The opposing forces==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nThere were some significant differences between the opposing armies, which were to be important to the course of the battle and its outcome. Although both armies were composed of very raw soldiers, they had several experienced officers who had previously fought in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] or [[Sweden|Swedish]] armies during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Several of them had been recruited to lead English forces which were intended to be sent to Ireland following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. Both King and Parliament had bid highly for their services.\n\nThe Royalist cavalry was superior to Parliament's cavalry at this stage of the war. [[Oliver Cromwell]], who arrived too late in the day to take part in the battle, later wrote disparagingly to [[John Hampden]], \"''Your troopers are most of them old decayed servingmen and tapsters; and their ''[the Royalists]'' troopers are gentlemen's sons, younger sons and persons of quality....''\" Not only were the Parliamentarian cavalry not so naturally accustomed to mounted action, but they were drilled in the Dutch tactic of firing pistols and carbines from the saddle, whereas under Rupert, the Royalist cavalry would charge sword in hand, relying on shock and weight.\n\nThe Parliamentarian foot soldiers, however, were better equipped than their Royalist counterparts. The Royalist pikemen were said to lack armour, and the musketeers lacked swords, making the Royalist infantry more vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat. Several hundred of them lacked any sort of weapon apart from clubs or improvised polearms.\n\n==Deployments==\n\n===Royalist Army===\nThe Royalist right wing of cavalry and dragoons was led by Prince Rupert, with Sir [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]] in support. The King's own Lifeguard of Horse insisted on joining Rupert's front line, leaving the King with no cavalry reserve under his own command.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=79}}\n\nThe centre consisted of five \"tertias\" of infantry. There was a last-minute change of command when the Colonel General, [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Lord Lindsey]], was overruled when he wished to deploy them in \"Dutch\" formation, simple phalanxes eight ranks deep. Affronted, he resigned his command and took his place at the head of his own regiment of foot. He was replaced by the Lieutenant General, [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Patrick Ruthven]], who drew up the infantry in chequerboard \"Swedish\" formation, which was potentially more effective but also more difficult to control, particularly with inexperienced soldiers.<ref>For the earl of Forth as commander on the day rather than Rupert or the king see Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, ''[[Alexander Leslie]] and the Scottish Generals of the [[Thirty Years' War]], 1618\u20131648'' (Pickering & Chatto, London, 2014), pp.120\u2013123</ref> The centre was led in battle by Sergeant Major General [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]].\n\nThe left wing consisted of horse under Sir [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry Wilmot]], with [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol|Lord Digby]], the King's secretary of state, in support and Colonel [[Arthur Aston]]'s dragoons on his left flank.\n\n===Parliamentarians===\nThe Parliamentarian left wing consisted of a loosely organised cavalry brigade of twenty unregimented troops under Sir James Ramsay, supported by 600 musketeers and several cannon, deployed behind a hedge.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}}\n\nIn the centre, the infantry brigade of Sir [[John Meldrum]] was drawn up on the left of the front line and Colonel Charles Essex's brigade on the right. Sir Thomas Ballard's infantry brigade was deployed behind Meldrum and the cavalry regiments under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]] and Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] behind Charles Essex.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}} The presence of these two regiments was to be important in the coming battle.\n\nA regiment of infantry under Colonel [[William Fairfax (soldier)|William Fairfax]] linked the centre to the right wing. The right wing consisted of cavalry under [[Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh|Lord Feilding]], posted on some rising ground, with two regiments of dragoons in support.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|page=74}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Edgehill map.svg|thumb|right|500px|Interpretation of the Battle of Edgehill within Radway field \u2013 Royalists blue, Parliamentarians red]]\nAs Essex showed no signs of wishing to attack, the Royalists began to descend the slope of Edgehill some time after midday. Even when they had completed this manoeuvre at about two o'clock, the battle did not begin until the sight of the King with his large entourage riding from regiment to regiment to encourage his soldiers, apparently goaded the Parliamentarians into opening fire.{{sfn|Young|1995|p=104}}\n\nThe King's party withdrew out of range and an artillery duel started. The Royalist guns were trash as most of them were deployed some way up the slope, and from this height most of their shot plunged harmlessly into the earth. While the bombardment continued however, the Royalist dragoons advanced on each flank and drove back the Parliamentarian dragoons and musketeers covering their wings of horse.\n\nOn the right flank, Rupert gave the order to attack. As his charge gathered momentum, a troop of Parliamentarian horse under Faithfull Fortescue abruptly defected. The rest of Ramsay's brigade gave an ineffectual volley of pistol fire from the saddle before turning to flee. Rupert's and Byron's troopers rapidly overran the Parliamentarian guns and musketeers on this flank and galloped jubilantly in pursuit of Ramsay's men, to the detriment of the infantry.\n\nWilmot charged about the same time on the other flank. Feilding's outnumbered troops quickly gave way, and Wilmot and Digby also chased them to Kineton where the Royalist horse fell out to loot the Parliamentarian baggage. Sir [[Charles Lucas]] and Lord Grandison rallied about 200 men, but when they tried to charge the Parliamentarian rear, they were distracted by fugitives from Charles Essex's routed brigade.{{sfn|Young|Holmes|2000|pages=78\u201379}}\n\nThe Royalist infantry also advanced in the centre under Ruthven. Many of the Parliamentarian foot had already run away as their cavalry disappeared, and others fled as the infantry came to close quarters. The brigades of Sir Thomas Ballard and Sir [[John Meldrum]] nevertheless stood their ground. The Parliamentarian cavalry regiments of Stapleton and Balfour emerged through gaps in the line of Parliamentarian foot soldiers, and charged the Royalist infantry. With no Royalist cavalry to oppose them, they put many units to flight.\n\nThe King had left himself without any proper reserve. As his centre gave way, he ordered one of his officers to conduct his sons [[Charles II of England|Charles]] (the Prince of Wales) and [[James II of England|James]] (the Duke of York) to safety while Ruthven rallied his infantry. Some of Balfour's men charged so far into the Royalist position that they menaced the princes' escort and briefly overran the Royalist artillery before withdrawing.{{sfn|Young|1995|pp=114\u2013115}} In the front ranks, Lord Lindsey was killed, and Sir [[Edmund Verney (Cavalier)|Edmund Verney]] died defending the Royal Standard, which was captured by Parliamentarian [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Arthur Young.\n[[File:Prince Rupert at Edgehill.jpg|alt=A drawing of a fight between two groups of cavalry. Prince Rupert is on the left side of the image pointing his sword.|left|thumb|Prince Rupert leads the Royalist cavalry]]\nBy this time, some of the Royalist horse had rallied and were returning from Kineton.

John Smith and Sir Robert Welch (or Welsh, Walsh). |author=Struan Bates, quoting Jerome J. Platt}}</ref> of Wilmot's Horse recaptured the Royal Standard by a subterfuge as it was being taken to the Parliamentarian rear as a trophy. Welch also captured two Parliamentarian cannon. As the light began to fade, the battle ended with a fire fight from either side of a dividing ditch, before nightfall eventually brought a natural close to hostilities. The Royalists had been forced back to the position they had originally advanced from, but had regrouped.\n\n==Outcome==\nBy the following morning the King and his army returned to the Edgehill escarpment and Essex's army returned to Kineton. It was a bitterly cold night with a hard frost. This was suggested by contemporary reports as the reason many of the wounded survived, since the cold allowed many wounds to congeal, saving the wounded from bleeding to death or succumbing to infection.\n\nThe following day, both armies partially formed up again, but neither was willing to resume the battle. Charles sent a [[herald]] to Essex with a message of pardon if he would agree to the King's terms, but the [[Courier|messenger]] was roughly handled and forced to return without delivering his message. Although Essex had been reinforced by some of his units which had lagged behind on the march, he withdrew during the evening and the majority of his army marched to Warwick Castle, abandoning seven guns on the battlefield.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday 25th, Prince Rupert led a strong detachment of horse and dragoons and launched a surprise attack upon what remained of the Parliamentarian baggage train at Kineton and killed many of the battle's wounded survivors discovered within the village.\n\nEssex's decision to return northwards to Warwick allowed the King to continue southwards in the direction of London. Rupert urged this course, and was prepared to undertake it with his cavalry alone. With Essex's army still intact, the King chose to move more deliberately, with the whole army. After capturing Banbury on 27 October, he advanced via [[Oxford]], [[Battle of Aylesbury|Aylesbury]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Essex meanwhile had moved directly to London. Reinforced by the London Trained Bands and many citizen volunteers, his army proved to be too strong for the King to contemplate another battle when the Royalists advanced to [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]]. The King withdrew to Oxford, which he made his capital for the rest of the war. With both sides almost evenly matched, it would drag on ruinously for years.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that the Royalist cavalry's lack of discipline prevented a clear Royalist victory at Edgehill. Not for the last time in the war, they would gallop after fleeing enemy and then break ranks to plunder, rather than rally to attack the enemy infantry. Byron's and Digby's men in particular, were not involved in the first clashes and should have been kept in hand rather than allowed to gallop off the battlefield. Patrick Ruthven was elevated to the rank of Lord General of the King's Army, confirming his role as acting commander in the battle.<ref>Murdoch and Grosjean, p.122</ref>\n\nOn the Parliamentarian side, Sir James Ramsay who had commanded the left wing horse which had been routed during the battle, was tried by court-martial at St. Albans on 5 November. The court reported that he had done all that it became a gallant man to do.\n\nThe last survivor of the battle, [[William Hiseland]], fought also at [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] sixty-seven years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Winder|2006}}; {{harvnb|The Scotsman staff|2006}}</ref>\n\n==The Welch medal==\nLieutenant Colonel Robert Welch, who had recaptured the royal standard, was knighted [[knight banneret|banneret]] on the field by King Charles I next morning. The King also granted a patent for a gold medal to be made (the first to be awarded to an individual for action on a battlefield) commemorating the event in Welch's honour. Captain [[John Smith (banneret)|John Smith]] also claimed a supporting part in the rescue of the royal standard and was accordingly also knighted banneret, but the medal was minted in Sir Robert Welch's name and honour.<ref>The British Library, London.

Accompanied by one or two of his comrades similarly attired, he slipped in amongst the ranks of the enemy.... Protected by his scarf, Smith succeeded in escaping hostile notice, and triumphantly laid the recovered standard at the feet of the King.
