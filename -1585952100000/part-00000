In 1948 after his father's death from [[bladder cancer]], Savalas married his college sweetheart, Katherine Nicolaides. Daughter Christina, named after his mother, was born in 1950. In 1957 Katherine filed for divorce. She urged him to move back to his mother's house during that same year. While Savalas was going broke, he founded the Garden City Theater Center in his native Garden City. While working there he met Marilyn Gardner, a theater teacher. They married in 1960. Marilyn gave birth to daughter Penelope in 1961. A second daughter, Candace, was born in 1963.

He was also a motorcycle racer and lifeguard. His other hobbies and interests included golfing, swimming, reading romantic books, watching football, traveling, collecting luxury cars, and gambling. He loved horse racing and bought a racehorse with movie director and producer [[Howard W. Koch]]. Naming the horse [[Telly's Pop]], it won several races in 1975 including the [[Norfolk Stakes (United States)|Norfolk Stakes]] and [[Del Mar Futurity]].<ref>{{cite news |date=February 23, 1976 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918073-3,00.html |title= People, Feb. 23, 1976|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |access-date=December 10, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/national-news/2001/February/17/Owner-Koch-dead-at-84.aspx |title=Owner Koch dead at 84 |work=Thoroughbred Times |date=February 17, 2001 |access-date=December 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn his capacity as producer for ''Kojak,'' he gave many stars their first break, as [[Burt Lancaster]] did for him. He was considered by those who knew him to be a generous, graceful, compassionate man. He was also a strong contributor to his Greek Orthodox roots through the Saint Sophia and Saint Nicholas cathedrals in Los Angeles and was the sponsor of bringing electricity in the 1970s to his ancestral home, [[Ierakas]], Greece.\n\nSavalas had a minor physical handicap in that his left index finger was deformed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981203001016/http://who2.com/missingdigits.html Who2: Celebs Missing Fingers], accessed January 15, 2010</ref> This deformed digit was often indicated on screen; the ''Kojak'' episode \"Conspiracy of Fear\" in which a close-up of Savalas holding his chin in his hand clearly shows the permanently bent finger.\n\nAs a philanthropist and philhellene, Savalas supported many Hellenic causes and made friends in major cities around the world. In Chicago, he often met with Illinois state senators Steven G. Nash and Samuel Maragos, also Greeks, as well as Greek millionaire Simeon Frangos, who owned the Athens North nightclub and the Flying Carpet Hotel near [[O'Hare Airport]].\n\nIn 1993 Savalas appeared on an Australian TV show, ''[[The Extraordinary]]'', with a paranormal tale where he talked about an experience that he had that he could not explain.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axdkv0_kJZQ|title=Telly Savalas' Ghost Story|date=July 25, 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.girlclumsy.com/2010/07/ill-give-you-ride-remembering.html|title=The Bruising Adventures of Girl Clumsy: I'll Give You a Ride - Remembering \"The Extraordinary\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Deaths of relatives and later years==\nAfter Savalas reprised his ''Kojak'' role in the 1980s, he began to lose close relatives.

The lollipops had apparently given him three [[Dental caries|cavities]], and were part of an (unsuccessful) effort by Kojak (and Savalas himself) to curb his smoking. The critic [[Clive James]] explained the lead actor's appeal as Kojak: \"Telly Savalas can make bad slang sound like good slang and good slang sound like lyric poetry.

It was required viewing in Britain every Saturday evening for eight years.

The domain name was the focus of one of the most publicized legal actions about ownership of domain names. Kieren McCarthy, a journalist who followed the case, wrote the book ''Sex.com'', which was published in 2007.\n\n==History==\nOn May 9, 1994, entrepreneur [[Gary Kremen]] (who also founded [[Match.com]]) registered sex.com with [[Network Solutions]], but did not develop the site as he focused on growing Match.com.\n\nOn October 18, 1995, Network Solutions transferred, without permission, the domain to [[Stephen M. Cohen]], who had been trying to gain control of the domain for some time by [[misrepresentation]], using phone calls, e-mails and forged letters. He eventually persuaded an employee of Network Solutions to change the ownership details by submitting a fake [[fax]]. After gaining control of the domain, Cohen produced an advertising-heavy site that received up to 25 million hits a day. From payments for [[click-through]]s and other advertising, Cohen was reportedly making $50,000 to $500,000 per month. Kremen undertook steps to recover the domain, while Cohen claimed he obtained the domain legally from Online Classifieds (OCI). A five-year legal battle ensued, led by [[cyberlaw]]yer [[Charles Carreon]].<ref name=\"mccarthy\">McCarthy, Kieren (2007).

According to the record of ''Kremen v. Cohen'',<ref>99 F. Supp. 2d 1168 (N.D. Cal. 200), ''aff\u2019d'', 2002 WL 2017073 (9th Cir. Aug. 30, 2002)</ref> Cohen was ordered to pay $25 million into court; in April 2001, the California District Court awarded Kremen an additional $40 million for lost earnings, for a total judgment of $65 million. Cohen appealed the judgment and refused to allow assessment of his business: he provided false information and declared most of his companies bankrupt while illegally moving assets out of US jurisdiction. When an [[arrest warrant]] was issued, Cohen fled to Mexico. Kremen offered a $50,000 reward for information,<ref>{{cite news |title=$50,000 Reward For Arrest Of Man Who Stole Sex.Com |url=http://www.offshore-e-com.com/asp/story/story.asp?storyname=3850 |newspaper=Offshore-e-com |date=5 June 2001 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005075018/http://www.offshore-e-com.com/asp/story/story.asp?storyname=3850 |archive-date=5 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> but Cohen remained at large while continuing to file appeals that were rejected.

The domain name was the focus of one of the most publicized legal actions about ownership of domain names. Kieren McCarthy, a journalist who followed the case, wrote the book ''Sex.com'', which was published in 2007.\n\n==History==\nOn May 9, 1994, entrepreneur [[Gary Kremen]] (who also founded [[Match.com]]) registered sex.com with [[Network Solutions]], but did not develop the site as he focused on growing Match.com.\n\nOn October 18, 1995, Network Solutions transferred, without permission, the domain to [[Stephen M. Cohen]], who had been trying to gain control of the domain for some time by [[misrepresentation]], using phone calls, e-mails and forged letters. He eventually persuaded an employee of Network Solutions to change the ownership details by submitting a fake [[fax]]. After gaining control of the domain, Cohen produced an advertising-heavy site that received up to 25 million hits a day. From payments for [[click-through]]s and other advertising, Cohen was reportedly making $50,000 to $500,000 per month. Kremen undertook steps to recover the domain, while Cohen claimed he obtained the domain legally from Online Classifieds (OCI). A five-year legal battle ensued, led by [[cyberlaw]]yer [[Charles Carreon]].<ref name=\"mccarthy\">McCarthy, Kieren (2007). ''Sex.com: One Domain, Two Men, Twelve Years and the Brutal Battle for the Jewel in the Internet's Crown''. Quercus. {{ISBN|978-1-905204-66-3}}</ref>\n\nKremen was victorious in November 2000, when Network Solutions was ordered to return the domain to the [[plaintiff]]. According to the record of ''Kremen v. Cohen'',<ref>99 F. Supp. 2d 1168 (N.D. Cal. 200), ''aff\u2019d'', 2002 WL 2017073 (9th Cir. Aug. 30, 2002)</ref> Cohen was ordered to pay $25 million into court; in April 2001, the California District Court awarded Kremen an additional $40 million for lost earnings, for a total judgment of $65 million. Cohen appealed the judgment and refused to allow assessment of his business: he provided false information and declared most of his companies bankrupt while illegally moving assets out of US jurisdiction. When an [[arrest warrant]] was issued, Cohen fled to Mexico. Kremen offered a $50,000 reward for information,<ref>{{cite news |title=$50,000 Reward For Arrest Of Man Who Stole Sex.Com |url=http://www.offshore-e-com.com/asp/story/story.asp?storyname=3850 |newspaper=Offshore-e-com |date=5 June 2001 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005075018/http://www.offshore-e-com.com/asp/story/story.asp?storyname=3850 |archive-date=5 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> but Cohen remained at large while continuing to file appeals that were rejected.
