{"title_page": "Form W-2", "text_new": "[[File:Form_W-2,_2016.pdf|thumb|right|Form W-2, 2016|page=2]]\n\n'''Form W-2''' (officially, the \"'''Wage and Tax Statement'''\") is an [[IRS tax forms|Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form]] used in the United States to report wages paid to employees and the [[Tax withholding in the United States|taxes withheld]] from them.<ref>See generally {{usc|26|6051}}, 26 C.F.R. sec. 31.6051-1 and sec. 31.6051-2.</ref> Employers must complete a Form W-2 for each employee to whom they pay a salary, wage, or other compensation as part of the employment relationship. An employer must mail out the Form W-2 to employees on or before January 31. This deadline gives these taxpayers about 2 months to prepare their returns before the April 15 income tax due date. The form is also used to report [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA taxes]] to the [[Social Security Administration]]. The Form W-2, along with Form W-3, generally must be filed by the employer with the Social Security Administration by the end of February. Relevant amounts on Form W-2 are reported by the Social Security Administration to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. In territories, the W-2 is issued with a two letter code indicating which territory, such as W-2GU for Guam. If corrections are made, it can be done on a W-2c.\n\n==Significance for employee's tax return==\n\nForm W-2 includes wage and salary information as well as federal, state, and other taxes that were withheld. This information is used by the employee when they complete their individual tax return using [[Form 1040]].<ref name=\"turbo_w2\">{{cite web |url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/IRS-Tax-Forms/What-is-a-W-2-Form-/INF14812.html |title=What is a W-2 Form? |accessdate=January 25, 2016 |date=2015}}</ref>\n\nAn employer must mail out the Form W-2 to employees on or before January 31. This deadline gives these taxpayers about 2 months to prepare their returns before the [[Tax Day|April 15 income tax due date]].<ref name=\"turbo_w2\" />\n\nWhen an employee prepares their individual tax return for a tax year, the withholding amount from Form W-2 is subtracted from the tax due. It is possible to receive a refund from the IRS if more income was withheld than necessary.<ref name=\"turbo_w2\" />\n\nSince the IRS receives a copy of the W-2 from the employer, if the amount reported on the W-2 does not match the amount reported on Form 1040, the IRS may get suspicious. In addition, if an individual does not pay the required amount of taxes, the IRS will also know this.<ref name=\"turbo_w2\" /> In this way, the IRS uses Form W-2 as a way to track an employee's tax liability, and the form has come to be seen as a formal proof of income. The [[Social Security Administration]], court proceedings, and applications for federal financial aid for college may all use Form W-2 as proof of income.<ref name=\"ambar\" />\n\nThe employee receives three copies of Form W-2: one for the record, one for the federal tax return, and one for the state tax return.<ref name=\"ambar\" /> Form W-2 must be attached to one's individual tax return; this is to substantiate claims of withholding.<ref name=\"turbo_w2\" />\n\nEmployees are required to report their wage, salary, and tip income even if they don't receive a Form W-2 for it.\n\n===Tip income===\n\nEmployees are required to report their tip income to their employers (usually using Form 4070). Tips are subject to income withholding. There are various other requirements when handling tips for tax purposes.<ref name=\"irs_tips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-%26-Self-Employed/Reporting-Tip-Income-Restaurant-Tax-Tips |title=Reporting Tip Income - Restaurant Tax Tips |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Filing requirements==\n\nForm W-2 must be completed by the employers and be in the mail to be sent to employees by January 31. The deadline for filing electronic of paper Forms W-2 to the Social Security Administration (SSA) is also January 31.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/filingDeadlines.htm|title=Deadline Dates to File W-2s|website=www.ssa.gov|language=English|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> \n\nIf over 250 instances of Form W-2 are being filed for the year, electronic filing is required.<ref name=\"tc801\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc801.html |title=Topic 801 - Who Must File Information Returns Electronically |accessdate=January 24, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>\n\nThe form consists of six copies:\n\n*Copy A \u2013 Submitted by the employer to the Social Security Administration. (In addition, the employer must also submit Form W-3, which is a summary of all Forms W-2 completed, along with all Copies A submitted.  The Form W-3 must be signed by the employer.)\n*Copy B \u2013 To be sent to the employee and filed by the employee with the employee's federal income tax returns.\n*Copy C \u2013 To be sent to the employee, to be retained by the employee for the employee's records.\n*Copy D \u2013 To be retained by the employer, for the employer's records.\n*Copy 1 \u2013 To be filed with the employer's state or local income tax returns (if any).\n*Copy 2 \u2013 To be filed with the employee's state or local income tax returns (if any).\n\nEmployers are instructed to send copies B, C, 1, and 2 to their employees generally by [[January 31]] of the year immediately following the year of income to which the Form W-2 relates, which gives these taxpayers about 2 1/2 months before the [[April 15]] income tax due date. The Form W-2, with Form W-3, generally must be filed by the employer with the Social Security Administration by the end of February.\n\n===Filing modalities===\n\nTraditionally Form W-2 has been completed by paper. [[Tax compliance software]] such as [[TurboTax]] allow the form to be completed electronically.<ref name=\"investopedia_w2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w2form.asp |title=W-2 Form |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref> For paper filing, Form W-2 can be ordered from the IRS website.\n\nWhen filing by paper, Copy A of the form cannot be printed from the IRS website. In other words, the official form ordered from the IRS must be used.<ref name=\"actual_form_w2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf |title=Form W-2 |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>\n\n==Penalties==\n\nLate filings within 30 days of the due date incur a penalty of $30 per form. After 30 days but before August 1, the penalty increases to $60 per form (capped between $200\u2013500 depending on size of business).

This phishing scheme is particularly characterized by its use of [[spear-phishing]] (emails [[Salutation|sent to specific individuals]]) and [[email spoofing]] to pose as a company executive requesting the W-2 information, thereby increasing the urgency of the response and catching payroll staff off-guard:\n\n* \"Can you send me the updated list of employees with full details (Name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Home Address, Salary).\"\n* \"Kindly send me the individual 2015 W-2 (PDF) and earnings summary of all W-2 of our company staff for a quick review.\"\n* \"I want you to send me the list of W-2 copy of employees wage and tax statement for 2015, I need them in PDF file type, you can send it as an attachment.

An employer must mail out the Form W-2 to employees on or before January 31. This deadline gives these taxpayers about 2 months to prepare their returns before the April 15 income tax due date. The form is also used to report [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA taxes]] to the [[Social Security Administration]]. The Form W-2, along with Form W-3, generally must be filed by the employer with the Social Security Administration by the end of February. Relevant amounts on Form W-2 are reported by the Social Security Administration to the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

There are 6 Chin major tribes living in the Matupi township such as [[Nga La language|Matu]], [[Mara people|Mara]], [[Daai Chin|Dai]], [[Zotung people|Zotung]], [[Lautu language|Lautu]] and [[Khumi people|Khumi]]. Matupi, formerly known as Batupuei or Batu Village before it was promoted to the status of township, occupies a large portion of land and includes over 100 major villages in the southern part of Chin State. According to some local experts from Batu tribe, who settlement in Ngala ward, the name ''Matupi'' is derived from ''Batupuei'' (Badupi); however, due to misreading of the spellings: ''Ba'' into ''Ma'' and ''Puei'' into ''Pi'' in Burmese characters, however this theory is kept in discussion. Matupi appeared to be the widely used name without any historical significance in its terminology. The Matupi (Chin) tribe is one of the biggest tribes among the [[Kuki-Chin-Mizo languages|Kuki-Chin-Mizo]]. From the very beginning of all the Chins, including [[Kuki people|Kuki]], [[Mizo people|Mizo]], [[Zomi]], [[Naga people|Naga]], [[Laimi]], and [[Asho Chin people|Asho]], Kcho and [[Khumi people|Khumi]] lived on the hillsides or riverbanks, constituting villages or groups. Among the villages, Matupi (formerly known as Batu Village) was the biggest and most populous. The ''British Gazette'' mentioned that there were over 1,000 houses including paddy barns in the village of Batupuei in the period between 1900 and 1930. [[Hakha]] book recorded that during those days \u201cMatupi\u201d was the biggest and most populous village in the Chin Hills.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nMatupi township is located at the western part of Myanmar. The town is situated between latitudes 21.36'57.93 north and longitude 93.26'21.09 east. Matupi township is bordered on all sides: to the east by the [[Magway Division|Magwe]] division; to the south by [[Mindat Township]]; to the south-west by [[Paletwa]] township; to the north-west by [[Mizoram State]], India; and to the North by [[Thantlang]] and [[Hakha]] townships.\n\n===Environment===\nThe whole region is made up of high hills and deep valleys, and there is hardly any plain or plateau. Matupi township measures about {{convert|68|mi}} from north to south, {{convert|47|mi}} from east to west. It has an area of about {{convert|2316.8|mi2}}.  The township sits at {{convert|3560|ft}} above sea level.  The highest mountain located in the township is Awtaraw Mountain (9,009 feet), and the second highest is Lukil Mountain standing at (8,408 feet), followed by Mount [[Kaisitlang]], which is also in the region.\n\nMost streams in the township are fed by water from the hills and mountain ranges. The famous rivers of the township are Bunglong ([[Lemro River|Lemro]]) and Bawinu Rivers. The streams or rivers contain rapids and [[whitewater]], thus are not suitable for navigation. Only small boats and canoes can travel in certain sections, mainly downstream. The famous streams are Pengsawng, Kadi, Leatsa, Tilak, Tisi and Vawmpu Streams. Bungtla waterfall, the famous waterfall of Chin state, is located in Matupi township. Awisi lake, well known in Matupi township, is located near Rhueng village.\n\n===Weather===\nDecember and January are the coldest months of the year with a mean temperature of around 10\u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C, the winter months are generally colder and windy. April is the hottest month at a mean of 37&nbsp;\u00b0C. The total rainfall is about {{convert|89.22|in}} every year. Occasionally the temperature can drop to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Agriculture===\nMatupi is rich in plant life and vegetation. About one-eighth of Matupi is covered by tropical and sub-tropical forests, containing palm and bamboo among others.  Areas of the forest have been cleared for cultivation but many scrub forests, high grass areas and reeds remain.  [[Dog]]s, [[pangolin]], [[porcupine]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[bear]]s, many species of [[monkey]]s, and other species thrive across the region forests. The [[hornbill]] is one of the most famous birds found in the forests of Matupi township.\n\nAgriculture is the most essential and profitable industry in the Matupi Township, employing more than 90% of the population. The usual crops include [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[millet]], [[pulses]], [[oilseeds]], [[coffee]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[damson]], [[potatoes]], and natural fibres. However, Matupi still depends on the import of rice supplies from the lowlands.  Although the primary occupation is agriculture, it is not well developed due to the scarcity of large valleys and plains. [[Shifting cultivation]] is still prevalent. Terraced cultivation is slowly being introduced along the hillsides. Due to difficult terrain, human labor is the main driving force of work done. Teak and other hardwoods are found at elevation below 900 meters. Above 900 meters there are oaks and pines. [[Teak]], [[pine]]s, [[Arundo donax|canes]], [[resin]] and [[turpentine]] are important forest products. Since electricity is not available in most villages, people depend on the wood for cooking.  [[Forestry]] is also an imperative resource of income.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe main roads from Matupi are: one that goes to [[Mindat, Chin State|Mindat]] (102 miles long) and the other one goes to [[Hakha]] township (173 miles long). Then the distance between Matupi and Paletwa are 135 miles and three furlongs as well. Depending on the weather, there are buses that go back and forth between [[Pakokku]] located in Magway or Magwe Division and Matupi on a weekly basis. There may be even times when buses would go back and forth between Matupi and [[Pakokku]] more than once a week.\n\nMinibuses from Pakkokku's Junction 8 bus station depart for Matupi most mornings starting at 7am, passing through Mindat. The road is paved and windy to Mindat and then semi-paved and much more bumpy from Mindat to Matupi. Motion sickness medicine is recommended, if needed. The front seat can be requested when purchasing your ticket. The minibuses also return from Matupi to Pakokku each morning. The minibus from Pakokku to Matupi takes 12 to 18 hours depending on weather, engine trouble, etc. Minibuses often caravan in group of 2 to 4 or more in order to support each other in case of engine trouble, etc. between Mindat to Matupi. Two large bridges over rivers have been constructed in the past 18 months, increasing the accessibility between Pakokku and Matupi [as of May 2016].\n\nFrom time to time, private cars would also go between [[Pakokku]] and Matupi and vice versa. Usually, as Matu people are friendly and considerate, you may even be able to hitch a ride with those traveling by privately owned cars just by simply asking them or by paying a small amount of money to help cover for the gas cost.\n\nBoth roads leading to Matupi are not well-paved roads.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Mindat, Myanmar, road IMG 0638.jpg|alt= Road near Mindat, which lies between Matupi and Pakokku.|thumb|Road near Mindat, which lies between Matupi and Pakokku.]]\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\nUnder [[British rule in Burma|British rule,]] the township was included in [[Hakha District|Hakha district]] Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs issued and ordered to be Matupi township on March 22, 1948.\n\n''Batupuei'' refers to the inhabitants of Matupi, [[Chin State]], Myanmar (Burma). Batu is an ethnic group in Southern Chin State, descendants of Batu, the first settler at Batu village; the group is also referred to as Batupuei\u2014 ''Batu'' being the name of a person (later it is known as a tribe) and 'Puei' meaning \"great\". The tribe migrated from Central Burma (Myanmar) or northern Matupi after moving place to place as the Chin people migrated from [[China]]. [[Kachin people|Kachin]] and [[Chin people|Chin]] were siblings who were from [[Mongoloid]] in China. Some Chin people settled along the [[Chindwin River]] and Central Burma (Myanmar), while some continued to find the place too mountainous area and hilly. Those Chin People who lived in plain areas called themselves \"[[Asho Chin people|Asho Chin]]\" and those settling in Western Burma (Myanmar) called themselves \"Hilly Chin\". This Batu tribe is one of the Chin tribes which originated in Mongolian who were living on the delta of the Chindwin River, but then moved to western Burma. There were three other members among their siblings and Batu is one of them. Others are Lungngo or Tingpaw and Thaiphum.  Each of them are settled in the present places and areas.  This particular place became Batupuei, which was named Matupi officially later.  These are the four wards in Matupi: Ngala Ward, Longvan ward, Khoboi ward, and Cangbong ward. Among these ward Ngala, Longvan and Khoboi ward are the major places where the following clans reside: Zungpoeih, Laithang, Tuimuk, Taknan, Rhinguet, Takluem, Thintuep, Hmanrhing, Thanghul, Rhalawk, Sampok, Tlungmaa, Thangkhoeng, Oitoe and Longla. These fourteen clans are called Batu. They speak the same language, Batu or Batupuei. This Batupuei (Matupi) is a main centre for all Matu people. Whenever the people of Batupuei shot wild animals such as tiger, bear and boar, they will call proudly saying \"Khuih Haihdamca\", showing the significance of their own braveness, glory and ability.\n\n==Occupants==\nThe occupants in Matupi township is very diverse with many different Chin tribes residing in the area, thus making Matupi township a very popular place to be throughout Chin State. In the Matupi township, there are 6 major tribes namely Matu, [[Dai (Yindu)|Dai]], [[Zotung people|Zotung]], [[Lautu language|Lautu]], [[Khumi people|Khumi]] and [[Mara people|Mara]] (Miram). All these major tribes in the Matu township have their own unique culture and language, which is common in Chin State. For example, However, all these tribes also speak the Matupi language (\"[[Nga_La_language|Nga La]]\") dialect to communicate with the locals and majority of occupants in Matupi. According to 2009 registration, the total population of Matupi township was 50,580 and 6,630 houses in Matupi township.  However the occupants of people in Matupi has increased overtime. The four wards in Matupi are Longvan ward, Ngala ward, Khoboi ward, and Cangbong ward.\n\n===Religious make-up===\nChristianity is adhered by an overwhelming majority (approximately 98% of the population) {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and the rest are mainly Buddhists or Animist. Many Matupi people have also served as missionaries and pastors in places like the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[India]], [[Southeast Asia|south-east Asia]], and in the [[Pacific region|Pacific island nations]]. They also carry out missionary activity inside Myanmar. Due to the current political situations in Myanmar, hundreds of Matupi are scattered in [[Europe]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[India]], [[East Asia]] and [[south-east Asia]].  Among [[Christians]], [[Baptists]] are the predominant group constituting more than 60 percent of the township population. [[Christian Reformed]], [[Catholics]], [[Revivalism|Revivalists]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], The Church of The Living God (thlangbol) and [[Pentecostals]] are the other Christian denominations. [[Catholics]] are found in significant numbers in parts of the township.The churches in Matupi (Matupi kah thlangbol) as all Christian believers must be represent the locality in Matupi. Matupi is the fastest growing Christian area in Chin State. There is one Theological College in Matupi.\n-\n\n===Language===\nThe people in Matu speak several Matupi dialects, and they generally call those dialects as \"Matupi ol\u201d or \u201dMatu Lai\u201d. Almost all the tribes of Matupi have their own dialect or language.  The traditional languages do not have any script of their own. The Christian Missionaries used Roman script for these languages.  Along with Chin Dialects in Myanmar, the Matupi dialect is distinctive, therefore some words are the same with other Chin dialects. However, the most common Matu dialect spoken in Matupi is the \"[[Nga_La_language|Nga La]]\" dialect, as the main occupants are the Batu people. The people of Matupi village call themselves \"Matupi\" (pronounced locally as Batupuei ). Most commonly used Matupi greetings are: \"How are you doing?\" (Na sa ding ah?) or \"Have you eaten rice?\" (Buh na caak coeng ah?). Other common sentences are \"I thirst water\" (Tui ka hal), \"Have you slept?\" (Na ip coeng ah), \"Have u arrived?\" (Na pha coeng ah) or \"You are taking long\" (Na rau lai), which is the Batu dialect or known as \"[[Nga_La_language|Nga La]]\" dialect. Among Chin Dialects in Myanmar, Matupi Chin dialect is unique. Some words are the same with other Chin dialects. Commonly, one type of Chin dialect can communicate with another type of Chin dialect ([[Haka language|Haka dialect]] can be understood by [[Than Tlang|Htantlang]], [[Tiddim Chin language|Tiddim dialect]] can be used to communicate with [[Tonzang|Ton Zang dialect]], etc.). The Matu dialect is moderate to learn and can be quite easy for some Chins to learn as it has similarity here and there with all other Chin dialects.\n\n\nGenerally, a speaker of one Chin dialect can communicate with a speaker of another Chin dialect (Haka dialect can be understood by Htantlang, Tiddim dialect can be used to exchange a few words with Ton Zang dialect etc...). The Chin Matupi dialect ([[Nga_La_language|Nga La]]) is more easy to learn than other local dialects in Matupi {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and has more in common with other Chin dialects than they do with other dialects spoken in Matupi. \n\n===Appearance===\nThe Matupi people are of vice-average tallness, having the stumpy facial features, the hair is straight, black, the color of the skin is brownish yellow. The eyes of the Matupi people are similar to the Mongolian outward appearance.\n\n===Tourism===\nTourism is important, but largely limited due to insurgency but it has been now open for the tourists recently after the transforming of a new government. As of May 2016 the [[Mindat, Chin State|Mindat]] and Matupi area has been open to foreigners approximately 18 months more than ever. Travel to Matupi Township is mainly by car on poor roads that cut along the mountainsides and valleys.  Due to stiff terrain and very rugged nature of the landscape, travel can be difficult. [[Landslide]]s are common especially during the rainy season.  In certain areas cars have to carry shovels to clear landslides and/or fallen rocks. Normally Matu villagers would travel daily on foot from village to village and/or to and from the farms.\n\n\"Matupi is extremely amiable and affectionately beautiful. It is home to several tribes. The township has much to be explored. The virgin environments of the township are breathtakingly charming. You must visit Matupi Township to experience the panorama of nature, the tenderness and hospitality of the people, generous blossoms and bashful rivers making their ways through the rugged terrains. If you love nature, adventures, hiking, trail blazing, and are excited about tedious lifestyle...then a tour to Matupi Township would be a fantastic choice. Lovely drive through the Jungles & Villages will take you to the Gateway of the friendly people of Matupi.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Economic, education and social development potential==\nTown Market\n\nThe market is busy with many vendors 6am-8am, but may vary by sunrise time. [May, 2016]\n\n===Economic potentials===\n\nMatupi is located in a potential but untapped trade route between India and Myanmar. There is so much room for growth. Modernization of transportation and communication infrastructures are definitely required. Reliable, and affordable electricity is necessary in order to run local manufacturing and service industries as well as homes. Efficient utilization of hydroelectric power harnessed from local streams and waterfalls, and wind power by the establishment of wind farms need to be formulated and implemented. These modernization efforts will pave ways for establishment of hotels, motels, storage facilities for goods, reliable financial systems, saving trees from being used as firewood, and allow  better competitive service for the benefit of local consumers. At the moment, due to various constraints and lack of well-implemented strategies for long-term improvement of the local economy, many local people must rely on government jobs, slash and burn agricultural tactics, and/or remittances that are sent by relatives living abroad.\n\nPotentials also include setting up businesses that tap into service, manufacturing, and agricultural industries. Service industries can be but are not limited to ecotourism, and establishment of non-governmental public service organizations or providers. Due to rampant deforestation that has taken place as a result of the need for firewood, for agricultural needs, or for economic consumption, there is a great need for reforestation projects. These start-up businesses as well as development projects can be supported through grants such as: Japanese Grass-Root Grant, NZ Aid, Australia Aid, Canada Fund, US Aid, Switzerland Fund, as well as other funds and grants from other governments, foundations, and entities.\n\nPotentials in manufacturing industries (cottage industry, small-scale industry, medium-scale industry) can include production of perfume, soap, shampoo, herbal tea, medicine (both herbal and non-traditional), cloth and blankets (traditional as well as non-traditional), handicrafts, furniture (both wood and cane), water bottling and other goods. These services in turn will provide jobs in the field of logistic, marketing, packaging, communication, and human resources. Since most of the needed raw materials are readily available, the industries would have an advantage in the cost factor, as well as reliable and timely procurement of raw materials. Demands for raw materials can, in turn, promote development of sustainable agriculture, horticulture, and other service related industries.\n\nBecause of the weather and topography, Matupi's mild and cool climate is a blessing for those that want to have orchards, grow vegetables, flowers, medicinal plants, and other agricultural activities. As such, with the realization of reliable transportation network, farmers can grow orchards such as orange, tangerine, avocado, pear, peach and other fruits. The fruits can be marketed to Bangladesh, India, cities in Myanmar, and to foreign countries either as fresh products or after they have been canned, or simply as fruit jams, dried fruits, and fruit juice. Development of greenhouses will make it possible for growing vegetables, flowers and medicinal plants all-year round. The flowers and medicinal plants then can even be exported to foreign countries, use as raw materials for perfume, medicine, herbal tea, etc. Vegetables once available all year-round as a result of the green houses, will help fight nutrition deficiencies among the local population, export to markets in Myanmar or can be even be exported other countries if they are dried, canned, or bottled. These business activities in turn will support the local service industries.\n\nWith fresh springs, and streams readily available, local enterprises in Matupi can set up water bottling plants using the local fresh springs and streams. The Pacific nation of Fiji has established a successful example in exporting bottled \"Fiji Water\" to nations abroad. All of the possibilities for economic development mentioned above cannot be materialized without the role and support of the newly elected leaders from both the state and central government.\n\nHenceforth, the newly elected leaders at both the state legislature as well as those in Pyidaungsu Hluttaw will have to prove their genuine commitment for the development of the whole country especially ethnic and nationality regions such as Chin State of which Matupi is a part. Establishing special economic zones (SEZ) in both the northern and southern regions of Chin state will not only alleviate the poverty of the people living in Chin State but will also boost the economic well-being of the whole country.\n\nMatupi has two main high schools: No. 1 Basic Education of Matupi and No 2. Basic Education of Matupi, the one is located at Longvan ward and the other is located at Cangbong ward.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Township capitals of Myanmar]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Chin State]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|settlement_type = Town\n|native_name = {{my|\u1019\u1010\u1030\u1015\u102e}}\n|nickname = Batupuei\n|official_name = Matupi\n|pushpin_label_position = bottom\n|pushpin_map_caption = Location in Burma\n|pushpin_map  = Myanmar\n|image_skyline =\n|image_map =\n|map_caption =\n|subdivision_type = Myanmar\n|subdivision_name = {{Flag|Myanmar}}\n|subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Burma|Division]]\n|subdivision_name1 = {{flag|Chin State}}\n|subdivision_type2 = [[Districts of Myanmar#Chin State|District]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Matupi District]]\n|subdivision_type3 = Township\n|subdivision_name3 = [[Matupi Township]]\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n|area_total_km2 =\n|area_total_sq_mi = 2316.8\n|population =\n|population_as_of = 2009\n|population_blank1_title = Ethnicities\n|population_blank2 = [[Christianity]]\n|population_blank2_title = Religions\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|coordinates = {{coord|21.6|N|93.4432|E|display=inline}}\n|leader_title = Mayor\n|elevation_ft = 3560\n|elevation_m =\n|timezone = [[Time in Burma|MST]]\n|utc_offset = +6.30\n|blank_name = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n|blank_info = [[Humid subtropical climate|Cwa]]\n|website =\n}}\n''' Matupi ''' ({{lang-my|\u1019\u1010\u1030\u1015\u102e\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}) is a town in [[Chin State]] in western [[Myanmar]], in [[south-east Asia]].\n\n'''Matupi (Batupuei)''' is the second capital city, one of the townships of [[Chin State]] of West Myanmar, southeast Asia. There are 6 Chin major tribes living in the Matupi township such as [[Nga La language|Matu]], [[Mara people|Mara]], [[Daai Chin|Dai]], [[Zotung people|Zotung]], [[Lautu language|Lautu]] and [[Khumi people|Khumi]]. Matupi, formerly known as Batupuei or Batu Village before it was promoted to the status of township, occupies a large portion of land and includes over 100 major villages in the southern part of Chin State. According to some local experts from Batu tribe, who settlement in Ngala ward, the name ''Matupi'' is derived from ''Batupuei'' (Badupi); however, due to misreading of the spellings: ''Ba'' into ''Ma'' and ''Puei'' into ''Pi'' in Burmese characters, however this theory is kept in discussion. Matupi appeared to be the widely used name without any historical significance in its terminology. The Matupi (Chin) tribe is one of the biggest tribes among the [[Kuki-Chin-Mizo languages|Kuki-Chin-Mizo]]. From the very beginning of all the Chins, including [[Kuki people|Kuki]], [[Mizo people|Mizo]], [[Zomi]], [[Naga people|Naga]], [[Laimi]], and [[Asho Chin people|Asho]], Kcho and [[Khumi people|Khumi]] lived on the hillsides or riverbanks, constituting villages or groups. Among the villages, Matupi (formerly known as Batu Village) was the biggest and most populous. The ''British Gazette'' mentioned that there were over 1,000 houses including paddy barns in the village of Batupuei in the period between 1900 and 1930. [[Hakha]] book recorded that during those days \u201cMatupi\u201d was the biggest and most populous village in the Chin Hills.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nMatupi township is located at the western part of Myanmar. The town is situated between latitudes 21.36'57.93 north and longitude 93.26'21.09 east. Matupi township is bordered on all sides: to the east by the [[Magway Division|Magwe]] division; to the south by [[Mindat Township]]; to the south-west by [[Paletwa]] township; to the north-west by [[Mizoram State]], India; and to the North by [[Thantlang]] and [[Hakha]] townships.\n\n===Environment===\nThe whole region is made up of high hills and deep valleys, and there is hardly any plain or plateau. Matupi township measures about {{convert|68|mi}} from north to south, {{convert|47|mi}} from east to west. It has an area of about {{convert|2316.8|mi2}}.  The township sits at {{convert|3560|ft}} above sea level.  The highest mountain located in the township is Awtaraw Mountain (9,009 feet), and the second highest is Lukil Mountain standing at (8,408 feet), followed by Mount [[Kaisitlang]], which is also in the region.\n\nMost streams in the township are fed by water from the hills and mountain ranges. The famous rivers of the township are Bunglong ([[Lemro River|Lemro]]) and Bawinu Rivers. The streams or rivers contain rapids and [[whitewater]], thus are not suitable for navigation. Only small boats and canoes can travel in certain sections, mainly downstream. The famous streams are Pengsawng, Kadi, Leatsa, Tilak, Tisi and Vawmpu Streams. Bungtla waterfall, the famous waterfall of Chin state, is located in Matupi township. Awisi lake, well known in Matupi township, is located near Rhueng village.\n\n===Weather===\nDecember and January are the coldest months of the year with a mean temperature of around 10\u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C, the winter months are generally colder and windy. April is the hottest month at a mean of 37&nbsp;\u00b0C. The total rainfall is about {{convert|89.22|in}} every year. Occasionally the temperature can drop to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Agriculture===\nMatupi is rich in plant life and vegetation. About one-eighth of Matupi is covered by tropical and sub-tropical forests, containing palm and bamboo among others.  Areas of the forest have been cleared for cultivation but many scrub forests, high grass areas and reeds remain.  [[Dog]]s, [[pangolin]], [[porcupine]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[bear]]s, many species of [[monkey]]s, and other species thrive across the region forests. The [[hornbill]] is one of the most famous birds found in the forests of Matupi township.\n\nAgriculture is the most essential and profitable industry in the Matupi Township, employing more than 90% of the population. The usual crops include [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[millet]], [[pulses]], [[oilseeds]], [[coffee]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[damson]], [[potatoes]], and natural fibres. However, Matupi still depends on the import of rice supplies from the lowlands.  Although the primary occupation is agriculture, it is not well developed due to the scarcity of large valleys and plains. [[Shifting cultivation]] is still prevalent. Terraced cultivation is slowly being introduced along the hillsides. Due to difficult terrain, human labor is the main driving force of work done. Teak and other hardwoods are found at elevation below 900 meters. Above 900 meters there are oaks and pines. [[Teak]], [[pine]]s, [[Arundo donax|canes]], [[resin]] and [[turpentine]] are important forest products. Since electricity is not available in most villages, people depend on the wood for cooking.  [[Forestry]] is also an imperative resource of income.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe main roads from Matupi are: one that goes to [[Mindat, Chin State|Mindat]] (102 miles long) and the other one goes to [[Hakha]] township (173 miles long). Then the distance between Matupi and Paletwa are 135 miles and three furlongs as well. Depending on the weather, there are buses that go back and forth between [[Pakokku]] located in Magway or Magwe Division and Matupi on a weekly basis. There may be even times when buses would go back and forth between Matupi and [[Pakokku]] more than once a week.\n\nMinibuses from Pakkokku's Junction 8 bus station depart for Matupi most mornings starting at 7am, passing through Mindat. The road is paved and windy to Mindat and then semi-paved and much more bumpy from Mindat to Matupi. Motion sickness medicine is recommended, if needed. The front seat can be requested when purchasing your ticket. The minibuses also return from Matupi to Pakokku each morning. The minibus from Pakokku to Matupi takes 12 to 18 hours depending on weather, engine trouble, etc. Minibuses often caravan in group of 2 to 4 or more in order to support each other in case of engine trouble, etc. between Mindat to Matupi. Two large bridges over rivers have been constructed in the past 18 months, increasing the accessibility between Pakokku and Matupi [as of May 2016].\n\nFrom time to time, private cars would also go between [[Pakokku]] and Matupi and vice versa. Usually, as Matu people are friendly and considerate, you may even be able to hitch a ride with those traveling by privately owned cars just by simply asking them or by paying a small amount of money to help cover for the gas cost.\n\nBoth roads leading to Matupi are not well-paved roads.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Mindat, Myanmar, road IMG 0638.jpg|alt= Road near Mindat, which lies between Matupi and Pakokku.|thumb|Road near Mindat, which lies between Matupi and Pakokku.]]\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\nUnder [[British rule in Burma|British rule,]] the township was included in [[Hakha District|Hakha district]] Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs issued and ordered to be Matupi township on March 22, 1948.\n\n''Batupuei'' refers to the inhabitants of Matupi, [[Chin State]], Myanmar (Burma). Batu is an ethnic group in Southern Chin State, descendants of Batu, the first settler at Batu village; the group is also referred to as Batupuei\u2014 ''Batu'' being the name of a person (later it is known as a tribe) and 'Puei' meaning \"great\". The tribe migrated from Central Burma (Myanmar) or northern Matupi after moving place to place as the Chin people migrated from [[China]]. [[Kachin people|Kachin]] and [[Chin people|Chin]] were siblings who were from [[Mongoloid]] in China. Some Chin people settled along the [[Chindwin River]] and Central Burma (Myanmar), while some continued to find the place too mountainous area and hilly. Those Chin People who lived in plain areas called themselves \"[[Asho Chin people|Asho Chin]]\" and those settling in Western Burma (Myanmar) called themselves \"Hilly Chin\". This Batu tribe is one of the Chin tribes which originated in Mongolian who were living on the delta of the Chindwin River, but then moved to western Burma. There were three other members among their siblings and Batu is one of them. Others are Lungngo or Tingpaw and Thaiphum.  Each of them are settled in the present places and areas.  This particular place became Batupuei, which was named Matupi officially later.  These are the four wards in Matupi: Ngala Ward, Longvan ward, Khoboi ward, and Cangbong ward. Among these ward Ngala, Longvan and Khoboi ward are the major places where the following clans reside: Zungpoeih, Laithang, Tuimuk, Taknan, Rhinguet, Takluem, Thintuep, Hmanrhing, Thanghul, Rhalawk, Sampok, Tlungmaa, Thangkhoeng, Oitoe and Longla. These fourteen clans are called Batu. They speak the same language, Batu or Batupuei. This Batupuei (Matupi) is a main centre for all Matu people. Whenever the people of Batupuei shot wild animals such as tiger, bear and boar, they will call proudly saying \"Khuih Haihdamca\", showing the significance of their own braveness, glory and ability.\n\n==Occupants==\nThe occupants in Matupi township is very diverse with many different Chin tribes residing in the area, thus making Matupi township a very popular place to be throughout Chin State. In the Matupi township, there are 6 major tribes namely Matu, [[Dai (Yindu)|Dai]], [[Zotung people|Zotung]], [[Lautu language|Lautu]], [[Khumi people|Khumi]] and [[Mara people|Mara]] (Miram). All these major tribes in the Matu township have their own unique culture and language, which is common in Chin State. For example, However, all these tribes also speak the Matupi language (\"[[Nga_La_language|Nga La]]\") dialect to communicate with the locals and majority of occupants in Matupi. According to 2009 registration, the total population of Matupi township was 50,580 and 6,630 houses in Matupi township.  However the occupants of people in Matupi has increased overtime. The four wards in Matupi are Longvan ward, Ngala ward, Khoboi ward, and Cangbong ward.\n\n===Religious make-up===\nChristianity is adhered by an overwhelming majority (approximately 98% of the population) {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and the rest are mainly Buddhists or Animist. Many Matupi people have also served as missionaries and pastors in places like the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[India]], [[Southeast Asia|south-east Asia]], and in the [[Pacific region|Pacific island nations]]. They also carry out missionary activity inside Myanmar.
