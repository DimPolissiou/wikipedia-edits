He was grand [[vizier]] from 1289 to 1291 under the [[Mongol]]ian [[Ilkhan]] in Persia, [[Arghun Khan]]. According to [[Bar-Hebraeus|Abu al-Faraj]], Sa'ad was father-in-law of the prefect of [[Baghdad]]. Sa'ad held a position in the [[treasury]] department, where he so distinguished himself that the Mongolian governor was jealous and recommended him to court as a physician. Here Sa'ad made a friend of [[Ordu Kia]], a powerful general, and through his influence was sent to collect the arrears of taxes in Baghdad. He was so successful in raising money that Arghun appointed him assistant (''musharrif'') in the department of finances at Baghdad, Ordu Kia being appointed military governor, or ''[[emir]]'', of that province. The historian [[Wassaf]] says that Sa'ad cured Arghun of an illness, and, having thus gained his confidence, informed the Ilkhan of the corruption among the officials at Baghdad. At the same time he impressed Arghun with his own ability by his knowledge of the [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and [[Turkish language]]s, and by his intimate acquaintance with the conditions existing in the province. He was soon made general controller of the finances of Baghdad, and then of the whole empire, becoming grand vizier. \"Thus,\" remarks Abu al-Faraj, \"were the Muslims reduced to having a Jew in the place of honor,\" a situation which they greatly resented. Arghun, as a [[Lamaism|Lamaist]] [[Buddhist]], had no such compunctions.\n\nThe administration of Sa'ad al-Daulah ([[Arabic]] for \"Felicity of the Empire,\" an [[laqab|honorific name]] which he took as vizier) appears to have been wise and just, although Von Hammer calls it \"sanguinary and golden.\" He instituted regulations which, although strict, were wise and aimed at a sure increase of the revenue. The taxes were on a fixed basis, and no extraordinary requisitions\u2014of food or animals\u2014were allowed. He employed only Jews and [[Christians]] in office, and, as was natural, a large share of the positions fell into the hands of his own relatives. Under him the Jews enjoyed a short period of prosperity, and Abu al-Faraj says they flocked to Baghdad from all parts of the world. It is possible that Sa'ad was instrumental in establishing diplomatic relations with [[Europe]]. Besides, he patronized the arts and literature; and a collection of poems and eulogies dedicated to him was made and circulated in Baghdad. On account of this work, mentioned by Wassaf, [[Heinrich Gr\u00e4tz]] identifies Sa'ad with [[Mordecai ibn al-Kharbiya]], who is described in a poem (still extant) dedicated to him in terms that might well apply to Sa'ad (Gr\u00e4tz, \"Gesch.\" vii, note 10).\n\nSa'ad had many enemies. The Mongolian officials hated him because they could no longer divert the revenues to their own use; and the Muslims felt it a degradation to have a Jew placed over them. Sa'ad had moreover made an enemy of Arghun's favorites. He himself was proud and haughty in his bearing. False reports were circulated about him; and no opportunity was lost of maligning him to Arghun, although without effect. It was said that Sa'ad was trying to introduce a new religion at the head of which was to be the Ilkhan. Finally Arghun fell ill, and Sa'ad's enemies took advantage of the opportunity to get rid of the Jew. He was killed, as stated above, on March 5, 1291; his goods were confiscated; and his family and the Jews in general were persecuted. Arghun died soon after.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Samuel ibn Naghrela]]\n\n==Resources==\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=38&letter=S&search=Sa'ad%20al-Daulah Jacobs, Joseph and Mary W.

Bucharest|sectors]], each governed by a local mayor.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe Romanian name ''Bucure\u0219ti'' has an unverified origin. Tradition connects the [[founding of Bucharest]] with the name of ''[[Bucur (legendary shepherd)|Bucur]]'', who was a prince, an outlaw, a fisherman, a [[Bucur (legendary shepherd)|shepherd]] or a hunter, according to different legends. In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the word stem ''bucurie'' means 'joy' ('happiness'),<ref>Rosetti, II. p.110</ref> and it is believed to be of [[List of Romanian words of possible Dacian origin|Dacian origin]],<ref>Ion I.

In 1781, Austrian historian Franz Sulzer claimed that it was related to ''bucurie'' (joy), ''bucuros'' (joyful), or ''a se bucura'' (to be joyful), while an early 19th-century book published in [[Vienna]] assumed its name to be derived from 'Bukovie', a beech forest.<ref name=Georgescu77>Georgescu et al., p.76-77</ref> In English, the city's name was formerly rendered as ''Bukarest''.\n\n<!-- repeat The full official city name is \"The Municipality of Bucharest\" ({{lang-ro|Municipiul Bucure\u0219ti}}). -->A native or resident of Bucharest is called a 'Bucharester' ({{lang-ro|bucure\u0219tean}}).\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of Bucharest|Timeline of Bucharest}}\n\nBucharest's history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century. First mentioned as the '[[Citadel]] of Bucure\u0219ti' in 1459, it became the residence of the famous [[Wallachia]]n [[List of rulers of Wallachia|prince]] [[Vlad III the Impaler]].<ref name=Giurescu>Giurescu, C.C., 1976, History of Bucharest, Bucharest: The Publishing House for Sports and Tourism</ref>{{rp|23}}\n\n[[File:Bucharest, woodcut, published in Leipzig in 1717.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest (1717)]]\n\nThe Ottomans appointed Greek administrators ([[Phanariotes]]) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest.<ref>{{Cite book|title = \u00centre Orient \u0219i Occident. \u021a\u0103rile rom\u00e2ne la \u00eenceputul epocii moderne (1800\u20131848)|last = Djuvara|first = Neagu|publisher = Humanitas|year = 2013|isbn = 978-973-50-4083-3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Curtea Veche|Old Princely Court]] (''Curtea Veche'') was erected by [[Mircea Ciobanul]] in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern [[Muntenia]] brought about by the demands of the [[suzerainty|''suzerain'']] power \u2013 the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nBucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]]).\n\nPartly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by [[Caragea's plague]] in 1813\u201314, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (1716, 1737, 1789) and [[Imperial Russia]] (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under [[Regulamentul Organic|Russian administration]] between 1828 and the [[Crimean War]], with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred [[1848 Wallachian revolution]]. Later, an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city.\n\nIn 1862, after [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] were united to form the [[United Principalities|Principality of Romania]], Bucharest became the new nation's capital city. In 1881, it became the political centre of the newly proclaimed [[Kingdom of Romania]] under King [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]]. During the second half of the 19th century, the city's population increased dramatically, and a new period of urban development began. During this period, [[gas lighting]], [[Horsecar|horse-drawn trams]], and limited [[electrification]] were introduced.<ref>Giurescu, p.154-161, 169\u2013171</ref> The D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba River was also massively channelled in 1883, thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods like the [[1865 flooding of Bucharest]].<ref>Giurescu, p.157, 161, 163</ref> The [[Fortifications of Bucharest]] were built. The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of 'Little Paris' (''Micul Paris'') of the east, with [[Calea Victoriei]] as its [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]].\n\n[[File:Mihai Viteazul statue.jpg|thumb|right|Monument dedicated to Wallachian Prince [[Michael the Brave]] (photograph taken between 1890 and 1905).]]\n\nBetween 6 December 1916 and November 1918, the city was occupied by [[German Empire|German]] forces as a result of the [[Battle of Bucharest]], with the official capital temporarily moved to [[Ia\u0219i]] (also called Jassy), in the Moldavia region. After World War I, Bucharest became the capital of [[Greater Romania]]. In the interwar years, Bucharest's urban development continued, with the city gaining an average of 30,000 new residents each year. Also, some of the city's main landmarks were built in this period, including [[Arcul de Triumf]] and [[Palatul Telefoanelor]].<ref>Giurescu, p.191-195</ref> However, the [[Great Depression]] took its toll on Bucharest's citizens, culminating in the [[Grivi\u021ba Strike of 1933]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/irongua.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025083507/http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/irongua.html|archive-date=25 October 2009 |url-status=dead|title=Data |website=www.geocities.com}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1941, the city was the scene of the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom]]. As the capital of an [[Axis Powers|Axis]] country and a major transit point for Axis troops en route to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Bucharest suffered heavy damage during World War II due to [[Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|Allied bombings]]. On 23 August 1944, Bucharest was the site of [[Romania during World War II#The royal coup|the royal coup]] which brought Romania into the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] camp. The city suffered a short period of Nazi [[Luftwaffe]] bombings, as well as a failed attempt by German troops to regain the city.\n\n[[File:Bratianu si Magheru2.jpg|thumb|right|I.C. Br\u0103tianu Boulevard during the 1930s.]]\n\nAfter the establishment of [[Communist Romania|communism in Romania]], the city continued growing. New districts were constructed, most of them dominated by [[tower block]]s. During [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s leadership (1965\u201389), much of the historic part of the city was demolished and replaced by '[[Socialist realism]]' style development: (1) the [[Centrul Civic]] (the Civic Centre) and (2) the [[Palace of the Parliament]], for which an entire historic quarter was razed to make way for Ceau\u0219escu's megalomaniac plans. On 4 March 1977, an [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|earthquake centred in Vrancea]], about {{convert|135|km|2|abbr=on}} away, claimed 1,500 lives and caused further damage to the historic centre.\n\nThe [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] began with massive anti-Ceau\u0219escu protests in [[Timi\u0219oara]] in December 1989 and continued in Bucharest, leading to the overthrow of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].

As with many cities, Bucharest is traditionally considered to be built upon seven hills, similar to the seven hills of Rome. Bucharest's seven hills are: Mihai Vod\u0103, [[Dealul Mitropoliei]], Radu Vod\u0103, [[Cotroceni]], [[Dealul Spirii]], [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti, Bucharest|V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti]], and Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe Nou.\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|226|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.

The city has a roughly round shape, with the centre situated in the cross-way of the main north\u2013south/east-west axes at [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. The milestone for Romania's [[Kilometre Zero (Bucharest)|Kilometre Zero]] is placed just south of University Square in front of the New St. George Church (Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe Nou) at St. George Square (Pia\u021ba Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe). Bucharest's radius, from University Square to the city limits in all directions, varies from  {{convert|10|to|12|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nUntil recently, the regions surrounding Bucharest were largely rural, but after 1989, suburbs started to be built around Bucharest, in the surrounding [[Ilfov County]]. Further urban consolidation is expected to take place in the late 2010s, when the 'Bucharest Metropolitan Area' plan will become operational, incorporating additional communes and cities from the Ilfov and other neighbouring counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=BMA will be extended to the Danube|url=http://www.cotidianul.ro/zona-metropolitana-bucuresti-ilfov-se-va-intinde-pana-la-dunare-148959/|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517125859/http://www.cotidianul.ro/zona-metropolitana-bucuresti-ilfov-se-va-intinde-pana-la-dunare-148959/|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 May 2016|date=13 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n\nBucharest has a [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfa,'' by the -3&nbsp;\u00b0C isotherm), but close to [[continental climate]]s (''Dfa/Dfb'') and mild summer climates (''Cfb/Dfb''), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters.

since it is the only municipal area that is not part of a [[counties of Romania|county]]. Its population, however, is larger than that of any other [[List of Romanian counties by population|Romanian county]], hence the power of the Bucharest General Municipality (''Prim\u0103ria General\u0103''), which is the capital's local government body, is the same as any other Romanian county council.\n\nThe Municipality of Bucharest, along with the surrounding Ilfov County, is part of the [[Bucure\u0219ti - Ilfov (development region)|Bucure\u0219ti \u2013 Ilfov development region]] project, which is equivalent to [[NUTS-II]] regions in the European Union and is used both by the EU and the Romanian government for statistical analysis, and to co-ordinate regional development projects and manage funds from the EU. The Bucharest-Ilfov development region is not, however, an administrative entity yet.\n\nThe city government is headed by a [[Mayor of Bucharest|general mayor]] (''Primar General''). Decisions are approved and discussed by the capital's [[General Council of Bucharest|General Council]] (''Consiliu General'') made up of 55 elected councilors. Furthermore, the city is divided into six administrative [[Sectors of Bucharest|sectors]] (''sectoare''), each of which has its own 27-seat sectoral council, town hall, and mayor. The powers of the local government over a certain area are, therefore, shared both by the Bucharest municipality and the local sectoral councils with little or no overlapping of authority. The general rule is that the main capital municipality is responsible for citywide utilities such as the water and sewage system, the overall transport system, and the main boulevards, while sectoral town halls manage the contact between individuals and the local government, secondary streets and parks maintenance, schools administration, and cleaning services.\n\nThe six sectors are numbered from one to six and are disposed radially so that each one has under its administration a certain area of the city centre. They are numbered clockwise and are further divided into sectoral quarters (''cartiere'') which are not part of the official administrative division:\n*'''[[Sector 1 (Bucharest)|Sector 1]]''' (population 227,717): [[Doroban\u021bi]], [[B\u0103neasa]], [[Avia\u021biei]], [[Pipera]], Aviatorilor, Prim\u0103verii, Roman\u0103, Victoriei, [[Her\u0103str\u0103u Park]], [[Bucure\u0219tii Noi]], D\u0103m\u0103roaia, Str\u01ceule\u0219ti, [[Grivi\u021ba]], 1 Mai, [[B\u0103neasa Forest]], Pajura, Domenii, Chibrit\n*'''[[Sector 2 (Bucharest)|Sector 2]]''' (population 357,338): [[Pantelimon, Bucharest|Pantelimon]], [[Colentina, Bucharest|Colentina]], [[Iancului]], [[Tei, Bucharest|Tei]], [[Floreasca]], [[Mo\u0219ilor]], [[Obor]], Vatra Luminoas\u0103, Fundeni, [[T\u0103m\u0103d\u0103u Mare|Plumbuita]], \u0218tefan cel Mare, Baicului\n*'''[[Sector 3 (Bucharest)|Sector 3]]''' (population 399,231): [[Vitan, Bucharest|Vitan]], [[Dude\u0219ti, Bucharest|Dude\u0219ti]], [[Titan, Bucharest|Titan]], [[Centrul Civic]], [[Dristor]], [[Lipscani]], Muncii, Unirii\n*'''[[Sector 4 (Bucharest)|Sector 4]]''' (population 300,331): [[Berceni, Bucharest|Berceni]], [[Olteni\u021bei]], [[Giurgiului]], [[Progresul]], [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti, Bucharest|V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti]], Timpuri Noi, Tineretului\n*'''[[Sector 5 (Bucharest)|Sector 5]]''' (population 288,690): [[Rahova]], [[Ferentari]], [[Giurgiului]], [[Cotroceni]], 13 Septembrie, Dealul Spirii\n*'''[[Sector 6 (Bucharest)|Sector 6]]''' (population 371,060): [[Giule\u0219ti]], [[Cr\u00e2nga\u0219i]], [[Drumul Taberei]], [[Militari]], Groz\u0103ve\u0219ti (also known as Regie), [[Ghencea]]\n\n[[File:Dambovita near Ciurel Bridge in Bucharest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mayor of Bucharest|Bucharest City Hall]] (PMB)]]\n\nEach sector is governed by a local mayor, as follows: Sector 1 \u2013 Daniel Tudorache ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016), Sector 2 \u2013 Mihai Mugur Toader ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016), Sector 3 \u2013 [[Robert Negoi\u021b\u0103]] ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2012), Sector 4 \u2013 Daniel B\u0103lu\u021b\u0103 ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016), Sector 5 \u2013 Daniel Florea ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/observator/marian-vanghelie-suspendat-din-functia-de-primar-al-sectorului-5-cine-ii-va-prelua-atributiile-686747.html |title=Marian Vanghelie, suspendat din func\u021bia de primar al sectorului 5.

Works on the canal were suspended in 1989, but proposals have been made to resume construction as part of the European Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/forbes/out_front/Forbes-Canalul-Dunare-Bucuresti-Criza-mondiala_0_389361252.html|title=Danube-Bucharest Canal vs. the Global Crisis|date=13 December 2010|access-date=5 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911141425/http://www.adevarul.ro/forbes/out_front/Forbes-Canalul-Dunare-Bucuresti-Criza-mondiala_0_389361252.html|archive-date=11 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Romania}}\n\nBucharest has a growing cultural scene, in fields including the visual arts, performing arts, and nightlife. Unlike other parts of Romania, such as the Black Sea coast or [[Transylvania]], Bucharest's cultural scene has no defined style, and instead incorporates elements of Romanian and international culture.\n\n===Landmarks===\n\nBucharest has landmark buildings and monuments. Perhaps the most prominent of these is the [[Palace of the Parliament]], built in the 1980s during the reign of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu. The [[List of largest buildings in the world#Special categories|largest Parliament building]] in the world, the palace houses the Romanian Parliament (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]], and the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]]), as well as the [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The building boasts one of the largest convention centres in the world.\n\nAnother landmark in Bucharest is [[Arcul de Triumf]] (The Triumphal Arch), built in its current form in 1935 and modelled after the ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in Paris. A newer landmark of the city is the [[Memorial of Rebirth]], a stylised marble pillar unveiled in 2005 to commemorate the victims of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which overthrew Communism. The abstract monument sparked controversy when it was unveiled, being dubbed with names such as 'the olive on the toothpick', (''m\u0103slina-n scobitoare''), as many argued that it does not fit in its surroundings and believed that its choice was based on political reasons.<ref>[http://www.sfin.ro/articol_1992/_memorialul_renasterii___ce_oribilitate_.html \"Memorialul Renasterii\", ce oribilitate!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217024722/http://www.sfin.ro/articol_1992/_memorialul_renasterii___ce_oribilitate_.html |date=17 February 2006 }} (\"The Monument of Rebirth \u2013 how horrible!\"), ''S\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2na Financiar\u0103'', August 2005 {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Romanian Athenaeum]] building is considered to be a symbol of Romanian culture and since 2007 is on the list of the Label of European Heritage sites.<ref>[http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&id=31&s=23698&arhiva=true Romanian Athenaeum awarded Label of European Heritage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415042903/http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&id=31&s=23698&arhiva=true |date=15 April 2008 }}, Romania's Permanent Delegation to NATO</ref>\n\n[[InterContinental Bucharest]] is a high-rise five-star hotel situated near University Square and is also a landmark of the city.

This edifice built in the characteristic style of the large-scale Soviet projects, was intended to be representative to the new political regime and to assert the superiority of the Communist doctrine. Construction started in 1952 and was completed in 1957, a few years after Stalin's death that occurred in 1953. Popularly known as Casa Sc\u00e2nteii ('House of the Spark') after the name of the official gazette of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, ''Sc\u00e2nteia'', it was made for the purpose of bringing together under one roof all of Bucharest's official press and publishing houses. It is the only building in Bucharest featuring the 'Hammer and Sickle', the Red Star and other communist insignia carved into medallions adorning the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nOther cultural venues include the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]], [[Grigore Antipa National Museum of Natural History]], [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]], [[National Museum of Romanian History|National History Museum]] and the [[National Military Museum (Romania)|Military Museum]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sky Tower Bucharest - panoramio.jpg|With a price tag of $250 million, [[Floreasca City Center]] opened in 2012.

The [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] is perhaps the best-known of Bucharest museums. It is located in the royal palace and features collections of medieval and modern Romanian art, including works by sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], as well as an international collection assembled by the Romanian royal family.\n\nOther, smaller, museums contain specialised collections. The [[Zambaccian Museum]], which is situated in the former home of art collector Krikor H. Zambaccian, contains works by well-known Romanian artists and international artists such as [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nThe [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]] Museum contains portraits of Romanian revolutionaries in exile such as [[Gheorghe Magheru]], [[\u0219tefan Golescu]], and [[Nicolae B\u0103lcescu]], and allegorical compositions with revolutionary (''Romania's rebirth'', 1849) and patriotic (''The [[Danubian Principalities#United Principalities|Principalities' Unification]]'', 1857) themes. Another impressive art collection gathering important Romanian painters, can be found at the Ligia and Pompiliu Macovei residence, which is open to visitors as it is now part of the Bucharest Museum patrimony.\n\nThe [[Theodor Pallady Museum]] is situated in one of the oldest surviving merchant houses in Bucharest and includes works by Romanian painter [[Theodor Pallady]], as well as European and oriental furniture pieces. The [[Museum of Art Collections]] contains the collections of Romanian art aficionados, including Krikor Zambaccian and Theodor Pallady.\n\nDespite the classical art galleries and museums in the city, a contemporary arts scene also exists. The [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MNAC), situated in a wing of the [[Palace of the Parliament]], was opened in 2004 and contains Romanian and international contemporary art. The MNAC also manages the Kalinderu MediaLab, which caters to multimedia and experimental art. Private art galleries are scattered throughout the city centre.\n\nThe palace of the [[National Bank of Romania]] houses the national [[numismatic]] collection. Exhibits include banknotes, coins, documents, photographs, maps, silver and gold bullion bars, bullion coins, and dies and moulds. The building was constructed between 1884 and 1890. The thesaurus room contains notable marble decorations.\n\n===Performing arts===\n\n[[File:Bucuresti, Romania. Teatrul ODEON. Zi de vara. Biciclista. (B-II-m-B-19854).jpg|thumb|right|[[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theatre]]]]\n\n[[Performing arts]] are some of the strongest cultural elements of Bucharest. The most famous symphony orchestra is [[National Radio Orchestra of Romania]]. One of the most prominent buildings is the neoclassical [[Romanian Athenaeum]], which was founded in 1852, and hosts classical music concerts, the [[George Enescu Festival]], and is home to the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nBucharest is home to the [[Romanian National Opera, Bucharest|Romanian National Opera]] and the [[I.L. Caragiale National Theatre]]. Another well-known theatre in Bucharest is the [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theatre]], which features plays starring world-renowned Romanian-Jewish actress [[Maia Morgenstern]]. Smaller theatres throughout the city cater to specific genres, such as the Comedy Theatre, the Nottara Theatre, the [[Bulandra Theatre]], the [[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theatre]], and the revue theatre of [[Constantin T\u0103nase]].\n\n===Music and nightlife===\n[[File:Liscani Street 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Bucharest Old Town|Old Town]] is the heart of Bucharest nightlife.]]\n\nBucharest is home to Romania's largest recording labels, and is often the residence of Romanian musicians. Romanian rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s, such as [[IRIS (Romanian band)|Iris]] and Holograf, continue to be popular, particularly with the middle-aged, while since the beginning of the 1990s, the [[hip hop music|hip hop]]/[[rapping|rap]] scene has developed. Hip-hop bands and artists from Bucharest such as [[B.U.G. Mafia]], [[Parazi\u021bii]], and [[La Familia (rap group)|La Familia]] enjoy national and international recognition.\n\nThe pop-rock band [[Taxi (Romanian band)|Taxi]] have been gaining international respect, as has [[Spitalul de Urgen\u021b\u0103]]'s raucous updating of traditional [[Music of Romania|Romanian music]]. While many neighbourhood [[discoth\u00e8que|discos]] play ''[[manele]]'', an Oriental- and Roma-influenced genre of music that is particularly popular in Bucharest's working-class districts, the city has a rich [[jazz]] and [[blues]] scene, and to an even larger extent, [[house music]]/[[trance music|trance]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]/[[punk music|punk]] scenes. Bucharest's jazz profile has especially risen since 2002, with the presence of two venues, Green Hours and Art Jazz, as well as an American presence alongside established Romanians.\n\nWith no central nightlife strip, entertainment venues are dispersed throughout the city, with clusters in [[Lipscani]] and [[Regie, Bucharest|Regie]].\n\n===Cultural events and festivals===\n\nA number of cultural festivals are held in Bucharest throughout the year, but most festivals take place in June, July, and August. The National Opera organises the International Opera Festival every year in May and June, which includes ensembles and orchestras from all over the world.\n\nThe Romanian Athaeneum Society hosts the [[George Enescu Festival]] at locations throughout the city in September every two years (odd years). The Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the Village Museum organise events throughout the year, showcasing Romanian folk arts and crafts.\n\nIn the 2000s, due to the growing prominence of the Chinese community in Bucharest, Chinese cultural events took place. The first officially organised Chinese festival was the [[Chinese New Year|Chinese New Year's Eve]] Festival of February 2005, which took place in Nichita St\u0103nescu Park and was organised by the Bucharest City Hall.<ref>[http://www.daily-news.ro/article_detail.php?idarticle=5737 Chinese New Year's Eve celebrated in Bucharest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219163629/http://www.daily-news.ro/article_detail.php?idarticle=5737 |date=19 February 2006 }}, ''[[Bucharest Daily News]]'', 7 February 2005</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Bucharest was the first city in Southeastern Europe to host the international [[CowParade]], which resulted in dozens of decorated cow sculptures being placed across the city.\n\nIn 2004, Bucharest imposed in the circle of important festivals in Eastern Europe with the Bucharest International Film Festival, an event widely acknowledged in Europe, having as guests of honour famous names from the world cinema: [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]], [[Nikita Mikhalkov]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Jerzy Skolimowski]], [[Jan Harlan]], [[Radu Mih\u0103ileanu]], and many others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://b-iff.ro/poveste/ |title=Poveste |work=BIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520215804/http://b-iff.ro/poveste/ |archivedate=20 May 2014  }}</ref>\n\nSince 2005, Bucharest has its own contemporary [[art exhibition|art biennale]], the [[Bucharest Biennale]].\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Ateneul Rom\u00e2n - Vedere Frontala.jpg|[[Romanian Athenaeum]]\nFile:Violetta in concert.

Much of the architecture of the time belongs to a Modern (rationalist) Architecture current, led by Horia Creang\u0103 and [[Marcel Iancu]].\n\nIn Romania, the tendencies of innovation in the architectural language met the need of valorisation and affirmation of the national cultural identity. The [[Art Nouveau]] movement finds expression through new architectural style initiated by [[Ion Mincu]] and taken over by other prestigious architects who capitalise important references of Romanian laic and medieval ecclesiastical architecture (for example the [[Mogo\u015foaia Palace|Mogo\u0219oaia Palace]], the [[Stavropoleos Monastery|Stavropoleos Church]] or the disappeared church of V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti Monastery) and Romanian folk motifs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.ro/2010/06/art-nouveau-in-bucuresti.html |title=Stilul arhitectural na\u021bional romantic \u0219i Art Nouveau \u00een Bucure\u0219ti |work=Unknown Bucharest |date=20 June 2010 |access-date=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904033728/http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.ro/2010/06/art-nouveau-in-bucuresti.html |archive-date=4 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nTwo notable buildings from this time are the [[Cre\u021bulescu Palace]], housing cultural institutions including [[UNESCO]]'s European Centre for Higher Education, and the [[Cotroceni Palace]], the residence of the [[President of Romania|Romanian President]]. Many large-scale constructions such as the Gara de Nord, the busiest railway station in the city, National Bank of Romania's headquarters, and the [[Telephone Palace]] date from these times. In the 2000s, historic buildings in the city centre underwent restoration. In some residential areas of the city, particularly in high-income central and northern districts, [[fin-de-siecle|turn-of-the-20th-century]] villas were mostly restored beginning in the late 1990s.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Palatul Cantacuzino, Bucure\u015fti.jpg|[[French Baroque architecture|French Baroque]] style \u2013 [[Cantacuzino palace|Cantacuzino Palace]]\nFile:Palacio del C\u00edrculo Nacional Militar, Bucarest, Ruman\u00eda, 2016-05-29, DD 66.jpg|French [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style \u2013 [[Palace of the National Military Circle]]\nFile:Museo Nacional de Historia de Ruman\u00eda, Bucarest, Ruman\u00eda, 2016-05-29, DD 63.jpg|[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style \u2013[[National Museum of Romanian History]] \nFile:Front view of Romanian Palace of the Deposits and Consignments (Palatul CEC) in Bucharest (47981424973).jpg|[[Eclecticism in architecture|Eclectic]] style \u2013 [[CEC Palace]] \nFile:Carul cu bere.jpg|[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] \u2013 [[Caru' cu Bere]] \n</gallery>\n\n===Communist era architecture===\n\nA major part of Bucharest's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the [[Communist Romania|Communist era]] replacing the historical architecture with high-density apartment blocks \u2013 significant portions of the [[Ceau\u0219ima|historic centre of Bucharest]] were demolished to construct one of the largest buildings in the world, the [[Palace of the Parliament]] (then officially called the House of the Republic). In Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's project of systematization, new buildings were built in previously historical areas, which were razed and then built upon.\n\nOne of the singular examples of this type of architecture is [[Centrul Civic]], a development that replaced a major part of Bucharest's historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings, mainly with [[marble]] or [[travertine]] fa\u00e7ades, inspired by North Korean architecture. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s, under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic centre of Bucharest were levelled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted [[Art Deco]] sports stadium, changed drastically the appearance of the city.\n\nCommunist-era architecture can also be found in Bucharest's residential districts, mainly in ''blocuri'', which are high-density apartment blocks that house the majority of the city's population. Initially, these apartment blocks started to be constructed in the 1960s, on relatively empty areas and fields (good examples include Pajura, Drumul Taberei, Berceni and Titan), however with the 1970s, they mostly targeted peripheral neighbourhoods such as Colentina, Pantelimon, Militari and Rahova. Construction of these apartment blocks were also often randomised, for instance some small streets were demolished and later widened with the blocks being built next to them, but other neighbouring streets were left intact (like in the example of Calea Mo\u0219ilor from 1978\u20131982), or built in various patterns such as the Pia\u021ba Iancului-Lizeanu apartment buildings from 1962\u20131963.\n\nThere is also communist architecture that was built in the early years of the system, in the late 1940s and 1950s. Buildings constructed in this era followed the Soviet Stalinist trend of [[Socialist Realism]], and include the [[Casa Presei Libere|House of the Free Press]] (which was named ''Casa Sc\u00eenteii'' during communism).\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Palace Of Parliament Bucharest.jpg|[[Palace of the Parliament]], the largest assembly structure in the world\nFile:Bulevardul Unirii.jpg|Apartment blocks on [[Bulevardul Unirii|Unirii Boulevard]], built in the 1980s\nFile:View_from_the_Palace_of_Parliament_in_Bucharest.jpg|[[Centrul Civic]], panoramic view\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Contemporary architecture===\n\nSince [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|the fall of Communism in 1989]], several Communist-era buildings have been refurbished, modernised, and used for other purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greateconomy.ro/povestea-fabricilor-bucurestene-transformate-in-mall-uri-sau-apartamente/|title=Fabrici comuniste, transformate in mall-uri sau apartamente|first=Redactia Great|last=Economy|date=14 September 2015|website=Greateconomy.ro|accessdate=1 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027123813/http://greateconomy.ro/povestea-fabricilor-bucurestene-transformate-in-mall-uri-sau-apartamente/|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Perhaps the best example of this is the conversion of obsolete retail complexes into shopping malls and commercial centres. These giant, circular halls, which were unofficially called [[hunger circus]]es due to the food shortages experienced in the 1980s, were constructed during the Ceau\u0219escu era to act as produce markets and [[refectory|refectories]], although most were left unfinished at the time of the revolution.\n\nModern shopping malls such as the [[Unirea Shopping Center|Unirea Shopping Centre]], [[Bucharest Mall]], [[Plaza Romania]], and [[City Mall, Romania|City Mall]] emerged on pre-existent structures of former hunger circuses. Another example is the conversion of a large utilitarian construction in Centrul Civic into a [[Marriott International|Marriott Hotel]]. This process was accelerated after 2000, when the city underwent a property boom, and many Communist-era buildings in the city centre became prime real estate due to their location. Many Communist-era apartment blocks have also been refurbished to improve urban appearance.\n\nThe newest contribution to Bucharest's architecture took place after the fall of Communism, particularly after 2000, when the city went through a period of urban renewal{{spaced ndash}}and architectural revitalization{{spaced ndash}}on the back of Romania's economic growth. Buildings from this time are mostly made of glass and steel, and often have more than 10 storeys. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the Bucharest Mall, a conversion and extension of an abandoned building), office buildings, bank headquarters, etc. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nDuring the last ten years, several high rise office buildings were built, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Additionally, a trend to add modern wings and fa\u00e7ades to historic buildings has occurred, the most prominent example of which is the Bucharest Architects' Association Building, which is a modern glass-and-steel construction built inside a historic stone fa\u00e7ade. In 2013, the Bucharest skyline enriched with a 137-m-high office building (SkyTower of [[Floreasca City Center|Floreasca City Centre]]), currently the tallest building in Romania. Examples of modern skyscrapers built in the 21st century include [[Bucharest Tower Center|Bucharest Tower Centre]], [[Euro Tower (Bucharest)|Euro Tower]], [[Nusco Tower]], [[Cathedral Plaza]], [[City Gate Towers]], [[Rin Grand Hotel]], [[Premium Plaza]],\n[[Bucharest Corporate Center|Bucharest Corporate Centre]], [[Millennium Business Center|Millennium Business Centre]], [[PGV Tower]], [[Charles de Gaulle Plaza]], Business Development Centre Bucharest, [[BRD Tower Bucharest|BRD Tower]], and [[Bucharest Financial Plaza]]. Despite this development on vertical, Romanian architects avoid designing very tall buildings due to vulnerability to earthquakes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://stiri.tvr.ro/bucurestiul-nu-este-un-oras-pentru-zgarie-nori--e-mai-degraba-un-oras-pe-orizontala_44232.html |title=Bucure\u0219tiul nu este un ora\u0219 pentru zg\u00e2rie-nori, e mai degrab\u0103 un ora\u0219 pe orizontal\u0103 |newspaper=\u0218tirile TVR |date=7 May 2014 |access-date=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520220710/http://stiri.tvr.ro/bucurestiul-nu-este-un-oras-pentru-zgarie-nori--e-mai-degraba-un-oras-pe-orizontala_44232.html |archive-date=20 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAside from buildings used for business and institutions, residential developments have also been built, many of which consist of high-rise office buildings and suburban residential communities. An example of a new high rise residential complex is [[Asmita Gardens]]. These developments are increasingly prominent in northern Bucharest, which is less densely populated and is home to middle- and upper-class Bucharesters due to the process of [[gentrification]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Cladire - Splaiul Unirii 76.jpg|Skyscraper on the Splaiul Unirii\nFile:Bd.

Bucharest' (''Municipiul Bucure\u0219ti''), and has the same administrative level as that of a national [[counties of Romania|county]], being further subdivided into six [[Sectors of Bucharest|sectors]], each governed by a local mayor.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe Romanian name ''Bucure\u0219ti'' has an unverified origin. Tradition connects the [[founding of Bucharest]] with the name of ''[[Bucur (legendary shepherd)|Bucur]]'', who was a prince, an outlaw, a fisherman, a [[Bucur (legendary shepherd)|shepherd]] or a hunter, according to different legends. In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the word stem ''bucurie'' means 'joy' ('happiness'),<ref>Rosetti, II. p.110</ref> and it is believed to be of [[List of Romanian words of possible Dacian origin|Dacian origin]],<ref>Ion I.

In 1781, Austrian historian Franz Sulzer claimed that it was related to ''bucurie'' (joy), ''bucuros'' (joyful), or ''a se bucura'' (to be joyful), while an early 19th-century book published in [[Vienna]] assumed its name to be derived from 'Bukovie', a beech forest.<ref name=Georgescu77>Georgescu et al., p.76-77</ref> In English, the city's name was formerly rendered as ''Bukarest''.\n\n<!-- repeat The full official city name is \"The Municipality of Bucharest\" ({{lang-ro|Municipiul Bucure\u0219ti}}). -->A native or resident of Bucharest is called a 'Bucharester' ({{lang-ro|bucure\u0219tean}}).\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of Bucharest|Timeline of Bucharest}}\n\nBucharest's history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century. First mentioned as the '[[Citadel]] of Bucure\u0219ti' in 1459, it became the residence of the famous [[Wallachia]]n [[List of rulers of Wallachia|prince]] [[Vlad III the Impaler]].<ref name=Giurescu>Giurescu, C.C., 1976, History of Bucharest, Bucharest: The Publishing House for Sports and Tourism</ref>{{rp|23}}\n\n[[File:Bucharest, woodcut, published in Leipzig in 1717.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest (1717)]]\n\nThe Ottomans appointed Greek administrators ([[Phanariotes]]) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest.<ref>{{Cite book|title = \u00centre Orient \u0219i Occident. \u021a\u0103rile rom\u00e2ne la \u00eenceputul epocii moderne (1800\u20131848)|last = Djuvara|first = Neagu|publisher = Humanitas|year = 2013|isbn = 978-973-50-4083-3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Curtea Veche|Old Princely Court]] (''Curtea Veche'') was erected by [[Mircea Ciobanul]] in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern [[Muntenia]] brought about by the demands of the [[suzerainty|''suzerain'']] power \u2013 the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nBucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]]).\n\nPartly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by [[Caragea's plague]] in 1813\u201314, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (1716, 1737, 1789) and [[Imperial Russia]] (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under [[Regulamentul Organic|Russian administration]] between 1828 and the [[Crimean War]], with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred [[1848 Wallachian revolution]]. Later, an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city.\n\nIn 1862, after [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] were united to form the [[United Principalities|Principality of Romania]], Bucharest became the new nation's capital city. In 1881, it became the political centre of the newly proclaimed [[Kingdom of Romania]] under King [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]]. During the second half of the 19th century, the city's population increased dramatically, and a new period of urban development began. During this period, [[gas lighting]], [[Horsecar|horse-drawn trams]], and limited [[electrification]] were introduced.<ref>Giurescu, p.154-161, 169\u2013171</ref> The D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba River was also massively channelled in 1883, thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods like the [[1865 flooding of Bucharest]].<ref>Giurescu, p.157, 161, 163</ref> The [[Fortifications of Bucharest]] were built. The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of 'Little Paris' (''Micul Paris'') of the east, with [[Calea Victoriei]] as its [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]].\n\n[[File:Mihai Viteazul statue.jpg|thumb|right|Monument dedicated to Wallachian Prince [[Michael the Brave]] (photograph taken between 1890 and 1905).]]\n\nBetween 6 December 1916 and November 1918, the city was occupied by [[German Empire|German]] forces as a result of the [[Battle of Bucharest]], with the official capital temporarily moved to [[Ia\u0219i]] (also called Jassy), in the Moldavia region. After World War I, Bucharest became the capital of [[Greater Romania]]. In the interwar years, Bucharest's urban development continued, with the city gaining an average of 30,000 new residents each year. Also, some of the city's main landmarks were built in this period, including [[Arcul de Triumf]] and [[Palatul Telefoanelor]].<ref>Giurescu, p.191-195</ref> However, the [[Great Depression]] took its toll on Bucharest's citizens, culminating in the [[Grivi\u021ba Strike of 1933]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/irongua.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025083507/http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/irongua.html|archive-date=25 October 2009 |url-status=dead|title=Data |website=www.geocities.com}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1941, the city was the scene of the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom]]. As the capital of an [[Axis Powers|Axis]] country and a major transit point for Axis troops en route to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Bucharest suffered heavy damage during World War II due to [[Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|Allied bombings]]. On 23 August 1944, Bucharest was the site of [[Romania during World War II#The royal coup|the royal coup]] which brought Romania into the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] camp. The city suffered a short period of Nazi [[Luftwaffe]] bombings, as well as a failed attempt by German troops to regain the city.\n\n[[File:Bratianu si Magheru2.jpg|thumb|right|I.C. Br\u0103tianu Boulevard during the 1930s.]]\n\nAfter the establishment of [[Communist Romania|communism in Romania]], the city continued growing. New districts were constructed, most of them dominated by [[tower block]]s. During [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s leadership (1965\u201389), much of the historic part of the city was demolished and replaced by '[[Socialist realism]]' style development: (1) the [[Centrul Civic]] (the Civic Centre) and (2) the [[Palace of the Parliament]], for which an entire historic quarter was razed to make way for Ceau\u0219escu's megalomaniac plans. On 4 March 1977, an [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|earthquake centred in Vrancea]], about {{convert|135|km|2|abbr=on}} away, claimed 1,500 lives and caused further damage to the historic centre.\n\nThe [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] began with massive anti-Ceau\u0219escu protests in [[Timi\u0219oara]] in December 1989 and continued in Bucharest, leading to the overthrow of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].

As with many cities, Bucharest is traditionally considered to be built upon seven hills, similar to the seven hills of Rome. Bucharest's seven hills are: Mihai Vod\u0103, [[Dealul Mitropoliei]], Radu Vod\u0103, [[Cotroceni]], [[Dealul Spirii]], [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti, Bucharest|V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti]], and Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe Nou.\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|226|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The altitude varies from {{convert|55.8|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} at the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba bridge in C\u0103\u021belu, southeastern Bucharest and {{convert|91.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} at the [[Militari]] church. The city has a roughly round shape, with the centre situated in the cross-way of the main north-south/east-west axes at [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. The milestone for Romania's [[Kilometre Zero (Bucharest)|Kilometre Zero]] is placed just south of University Square in front of the New St. George Church (Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe Nou) at St. George Square (Pia\u021ba Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe). Bucharest's radius, from University Square to the city limits in all directions, varies from  {{convert|10|to|12|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nUntil recently, the regions surrounding Bucharest were largely rural, but after 1989, suburbs started to be built around Bucharest, in the surrounding [[Ilfov County]]. Further urban consolidation is expected to take place in the late 2010s, when the 'Bucharest Metropolitan Area' plan will become operational, incorporating additional communes and cities from the Ilfov and other neighbouring counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=BMA will be extended to the Danube|url=http://www.cotidianul.ro/zona-metropolitana-bucuresti-ilfov-se-va-intinde-pana-la-dunare-148959/|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517125859/http://www.cotidianul.ro/zona-metropolitana-bucuresti-ilfov-se-va-intinde-pana-la-dunare-148959/|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 May 2016|date=13 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n\nBucharest has a [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfa,'' by the -3\u00b0C isotherm), but close to [[Continental climate|continental climates]] (''Dfa/Dfb'') and mild summer climates (''Cfb/Dfb''), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Owing to its position on the Romanian Plain, the city's winters can get windy, though some of the winds are mitigated due to urbanisation. Winter temperatures often dip below {{convert|0|\u00b0C}}, sometimes even to {{convert|-20|\u00b0C}}. In summer, the average temperature is {{convert|23|\u00b0C}} (the average for July and August).

Although average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[humidity]] during summer are low, occasional heavy storms occur. During spring and autumn, daytime temperatures vary between {{convert|17|and|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, and precipitation during spring tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder

since it is the only municipal area that is not part of a [[counties of Romania|county]]. Its population, however, is larger than that of any other [[List of Romanian counties by population|Romanian county]], hence the power of the Bucharest General Municipality (''Prim\u0103ria General\u0103''), which is the capital's local government body, is the same as any other Romanian county council.\n\nThe Municipality of Bucharest, along with the surrounding Ilfov County, is part of the [[Bucure\u0219ti - Ilfov (development region)|Bucure\u0219ti \u2013 Ilfov development region]] project, which is equivalent to [[NUTS-II]] regions in the European Union and is used both by the EU and the Romanian government for statistical analysis, and to co-ordinate regional development projects and manage funds from the EU. The Bucharest-Ilfov development region is not, however, an administrative entity yet.\n\nThe city government is headed by a [[Mayor of Bucharest|general mayor]] (''Primar General''). Decisions are approved and discussed by the capital's [[General Council of Bucharest|General Council]] (''Consiliu General'') made up of 55 elected councilors. Furthermore, the city is divided into six administrative [[Sectors of Bucharest|sectors]] (''sectoare''), each of which has its own 27-seat sectoral council, town hall, and mayor. The powers of the local government over a certain area are, therefore, shared both by the Bucharest municipality and the local sectoral councils with little or no overlapping of authority. The general rule is that the main capital municipality is responsible for citywide utilities such as the water and sewage system, the overall transport system, and the main boulevards, while sectoral town halls manage the contact between individuals and the local government, secondary streets and parks maintenance, schools administration, and cleaning services.\n\nThe six sectors are numbered from one to six and are disposed radially so that each one has under its administration a certain area of the city centre. They are numbered clockwise and are further divided into sectoral quarters (''cartiere'') which are not part of the official administrative division:\n*'''[[Sector 1 (Bucharest)|Sector 1]]''' (population 227,717): [[Doroban\u021bi]], [[B\u0103neasa]], [[Avia\u021biei]], [[Pipera]], Aviatorilor, Prim\u0103verii, Roman\u0103, Victoriei, [[Her\u0103str\u0103u Park]], [[Bucure\u0219tii Noi]], D\u0103m\u0103roaia, Str\u01ceule\u0219ti, [[Grivi\u021ba]], 1 Mai, [[B\u0103neasa Forest]], Pajura, Domenii, Chibrit\n\n*'''[[Sector 2 (Bucharest)|Sector 2]]''' (population 357,338): [[Pantelimon, Bucharest|Pantelimon]], [[Colentina, Bucharest|Colentina]], [[Iancului]], [[Tei, Bucharest|Tei]], [[Floreasca]], [[Mo\u0219ilor]], [[Obor]], Vatra Luminoas\u0103, Fundeni, [[T\u0103m\u0103d\u0103u Mare|Plumbuita]], \u0218tefan cel Mare, Baicului\n*'''[[Sector 3 (Bucharest)|Sector 3]]''' (population 399,231): [[Vitan, Bucharest|Vitan]], [[Dude\u0219ti, Bucharest|Dude\u0219ti]], [[Titan, Bucharest|Titan]], [[Centrul Civic]], [[Dristor]], [[Lipscani]], Muncii, Unirii\n*'''[[Sector 4 (Bucharest)|Sector 4]]''' (population 300,331): [[Berceni, Bucharest|Berceni]], [[Olteni\u021bei]], [[Giurgiului]], [[Progresul]], [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti, Bucharest|V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti]], Timpuri Noi, Tineretului\n*'''[[Sector 5 (Bucharest)|Sector 5]]''' (population 288,690): [[Rahova]], [[Ferentari]], [[Giurgiului]], [[Cotroceni]], 13 Septembrie, Dealul Spirii\n*'''[[Sector 6 (Bucharest)|Sector 6]]''' (population 371,060): [[Giule\u0219ti]], [[Cr\u00e2nga\u0219i]], [[Drumul Taberei]], [[Militari]], Groz\u0103ve\u0219ti (also known as Regie), [[Ghencea]]\n\n[[File:Dambovita near Ciurel Bridge in Bucharest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mayor of Bucharest|Bucharest City Hall]] (PMB)]]\n\nEach sector is governed by a local mayor, as follows: Sector 1 \u2013 Daniel Tudorache ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016), Sector 2 \u2013 Mihai Mugur Toader ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016), Sector 3 \u2013 [[Robert Negoi\u021b\u0103]] ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2012), Sector 4 \u2013 Daniel B\u0103lu\u021b\u0103 ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016), Sector 5 \u2013 Daniel Florea ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/observator/marian-vanghelie-suspendat-din-functia-de-primar-al-sectorului-5-cine-ii-va-prelua-atributiile-686747.html |title=Marian Vanghelie, suspendat din func\u021bia de primar al sectorului 5.

Works on the canal were suspended in 1989, but proposals have been made to resume construction as part of the European Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/forbes/out_front/Forbes-Canalul-Dunare-Bucuresti-Criza-mondiala_0_389361252.html|title=Danube-Bucharest Canal vs. the Global Crisis|date=13 December 2010|access-date=5 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911141425/http://www.adevarul.ro/forbes/out_front/Forbes-Canalul-Dunare-Bucuresti-Criza-mondiala_0_389361252.html|archive-date=11 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Romania}}\n\nBucharest has a growing cultural scene, in fields including the visual arts, performing arts, and nightlife. Unlike other parts of Romania, such as the Black Sea coast or [[Transylvania]], Bucharest's cultural scene has no defined style, and instead incorporates elements of Romanian and international culture.\n\n===Landmarks===\n\nBucharest has landmark buildings and monuments. Perhaps the most prominent of these is the [[Palace of the Parliament]], built in the 1980s during the reign of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu. The [[List of largest buildings in the world#Special categories|largest Parliament building]] in the world, the palace houses the Romanian Parliament (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]], and the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]]), as well as the [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The building boasts one of the largest convention centres in the world.\n\nAnother landmark in Bucharest is [[Arcul de Triumf]] (The Triumphal Arch), built in its current form in 1935 and modelled after the ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in Paris. A newer landmark of the city is the [[Memorial of Rebirth]], a stylised marble pillar unveiled in 2005 to commemorate the victims of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which overthrew Communism. The abstract monument sparked controversy when it was unveiled, being dubbed with names such as 'the olive on the toothpick', (''m\u0103slina-n scobitoare''), as many argued that it does not fit in its surroundings and believed that its choice was based on political reasons.<ref>[http://www.sfin.ro/articol_1992/_memorialul_renasterii___ce_oribilitate_.html \"Memorialul Renasterii\", ce oribilitate!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217024722/http://www.sfin.ro/articol_1992/_memorialul_renasterii___ce_oribilitate_.html |date=17 February 2006 }} (\"The Monument of Rebirth \u2013 how horrible!\"), ''S\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2na Financiar\u0103'', August 2005 {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Romanian Athenaeum]] building is considered to be a symbol of Romanian culture and since 2007 is on the list of the Label of European Heritage sites.<ref>[http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&id=31&s=23698&arhiva=true Romanian Athenaeum awarded Label of European Heritage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415042903/http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&id=31&s=23698&arhiva=true |date=15 April 2008 }}, Romania's Permanent Delegation to NATO</ref>\n\n[[InterContinental Bucharest]] is a high-rise five-star hotel situated near University Square and is also a landmark of the city.

This edifice built in the characteristic style of the large-scale Soviet projects, was intended to be representative to the new political regime and to assert the superiority of the Communist doctrine. Construction started in 1952 and was completed in 1957, a few years after Stalin's death that occurred in 1953. Popularly known as Casa Sc\u00e2nteii ('House of the Spark') after the name of the official gazette of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, ''Sc\u00e2nteia'', it was made for the purpose of bringing together under one roof all of Bucharest's official press and publishing houses. It is the only building in Bucharest featuring the 'Hammer and Sickle', the Red Star and other communist insignia carved into medallions adorning the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nOther cultural venues include the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]], [[Grigore Antipa National Museum of Natural History]], [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]], [[National Museum of Romanian History|National History Museum]] and the [[National Military Museum (Romania)|Military Museum]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sky Tower Bucharest - panoramio.jpg|With a price tag of $250 million, [[Floreasca City Center]] opened in 2012.

The [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] is perhaps the best-known of Bucharest museums. It is located in the royal palace and features collections of medieval and modern Romanian art, including works by sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], as well as an international collection assembled by the Romanian royal family.\n\nOther, smaller, museums contain specialised collections. The [[Zambaccian Museum]], which is situated in the former home of art collector Krikor H. Zambaccian, contains works by well-known Romanian artists and international artists such as [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nThe [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]] Museum contains portraits of Romanian revolutionaries in exile such as [[Gheorghe Magheru]], [[\u0219tefan Golescu]], and [[Nicolae B\u0103lcescu]], and allegorical compositions with revolutionary (''Romania's rebirth'', 1849) and patriotic (''The [[Danubian Principalities#United Principalities|Principalities' Unification]]'', 1857) themes. Another impressive art collection gathering important Romanian painters, can be found at the Ligia and Pompiliu Macovei residence, which is open to visitors as it is now part of the Bucharest Museum patrimony.\n\nThe [[Theodor Pallady Museum]] is situated in one of the oldest surviving merchant houses in Bucharest and includes works by Romanian painter [[Theodor Pallady]], as well as European and oriental furniture pieces. The [[Museum of Art Collections]] contains the collections of Romanian art aficionados, including Krikor Zambaccian and Theodor Pallady.\n\nDespite the classical art galleries and museums in the city, a contemporary arts scene also exists. The [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MNAC), situated in a wing of the [[Palace of the Parliament]], was opened in 2004 and contains Romanian and international contemporary art. The MNAC also manages the Kalinderu MediaLab, which caters to multimedia and experimental art. Private art galleries are scattered throughout the city centre.\n\nThe palace of the [[National Bank of Romania]] houses the national [[numismatic]] collection. Exhibits include banknotes, coins, documents, photographs, maps, silver and gold bullion bars, bullion coins, and dies and moulds. The building was constructed between 1884 and 1890. The thesaurus room contains notable marble decorations.\n\n===Performing arts===\n\n[[File:Bucuresti, Romania. Teatrul ODEON. Zi de vara. Biciclista. (B-II-m-B-19854).jpg|thumb|right|[[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theatre]]]]\n\n[[Performing arts]] are some of the strongest cultural elements of Bucharest. The most famous symphony orchestra is [[National Radio Orchestra of Romania]]. One of the most prominent buildings is the neoclassical [[Romanian Athenaeum]], which was founded in 1852, and hosts classical music concerts, the [[George Enescu Festival]], and is home to the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nBucharest is home to the [[Romanian National Opera, Bucharest|Romanian National Opera]] and the [[I.L. Caragiale National Theatre]]. Another well-known theatre in Bucharest is the [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theatre]], which features plays starring world-renowned Romanian-Jewish actress [[Maia Morgenstern]]. Smaller theatres throughout the city cater to specific genres, such as the Comedy Theatre, the Nottara Theatre, the [[Bulandra Theatre]], the [[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theatre]], and the revue theatre of [[Constantin T\u0103nase]].\n\n===Music and nightlife===\n[[File:Liscani Street 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Bucharest Old Town|Old Town]] is the heart of Bucharest nightlife.]]\n\nBucharest is home to Romania's largest recording labels, and is often the residence of Romanian musicians. Romanian rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s, such as [[IRIS (Romanian band)|Iris]] and Holograf, continue to be popular, particularly with the middle-aged, while since the beginning of the 1990s, the [[hip hop music|hip hop]]/[[rapping|rap]] scene has developed. Hip-hop bands and artists from Bucharest such as [[B.U.G. Mafia]], [[Parazi\u021bii]], and [[La Familia (rap group)|La Familia]] enjoy national and international recognition.\n\nThe pop-rock band [[Taxi (Romanian band)|Taxi]] have been gaining international respect, as has [[Spitalul de Urgen\u021b\u0103]]'s raucous updating of traditional [[Music of Romania|Romanian music]]. While many neighbourhood [[discoth\u00e8que|discos]] play ''[[manele]]'', an Oriental- and Roma-influenced genre of music that is particularly popular in Bucharest's working-class districts, the city has a rich [[jazz]] and [[blues]] scene, and to an even larger extent, [[house music]]/[[trance music|trance]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]/[[punk music|punk]] scenes. Bucharest's jazz profile has especially risen since 2002, with the presence of two venues, Green Hours and Art Jazz, as well as an American presence alongside established Romanians.\n\nWith no central nightlife strip, entertainment venues are dispersed throughout the city, with clusters in [[Lipscani]] and [[Regie, Bucharest|Regie]].\n\n===Cultural events and festivals===\n\nA number of cultural festivals are held in Bucharest throughout the year, but most festivals take place in June, July, and August. The National Opera organises the International Opera Festival every year in May and June, which includes ensembles and orchestras from all over the world.\n\nThe Romanian Athaeneum Society hosts the [[George Enescu Festival]] at locations throughout the city in September every two years (odd years). The Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the Village Museum organise events throughout the year, showcasing Romanian folk arts and crafts.\n\nIn the 2000s, due to the growing prominence of the Chinese community in Bucharest, Chinese cultural events took place. The first officially organised Chinese festival was the [[Chinese New Year|Chinese New Year's Eve]] Festival of February 2005, which took place in Nichita St\u0103nescu Park and was organised by the Bucharest City Hall.<ref>[http://www.daily-news.ro/article_detail.php?idarticle=5737 Chinese New Year's Eve celebrated in Bucharest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219163629/http://www.daily-news.ro/article_detail.php?idarticle=5737 |date=19 February 2006 }}, ''[[Bucharest Daily News]]'', 7 February 2005</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Bucharest was the first city in Southeastern Europe to host the international [[CowParade]], which resulted in dozens of decorated cow sculptures being placed across the city.\n\nIn 2004, Bucharest imposed in the circle of important festivals in Eastern Europe with the Bucharest International Film Festival, an event widely acknowledged in Europe, having as guests of honour famous names from the world cinema: [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]], [[Nikita Mikhalkov]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Jerzy Skolimowski]], [[Jan Harlan]], [[Radu Mih\u0103ileanu]], and many others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://b-iff.ro/poveste/ |title=Poveste |work=BIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520215804/http://b-iff.ro/poveste/ |archivedate=20 May 2014  }}</ref>\n\nSince 2005, Bucharest has its own contemporary [[art exhibition|art biennale]], the [[Bucharest Biennale]].\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Ateneul Rom\u00e2n - Vedere Frontala.jpg|[[Romanian Athenaeum]]\nFile:Violetta in concert.

Much of the architecture of the time belongs to a Modern (rationalist) Architecture current, led by Horia Creang\u0103 and [[Marcel Iancu]].\n\nIn Romania, the tendencies of innovation in the architectural language met the need of valorisation and affirmation of the national cultural identity. The [[Art Nouveau]] movement finds expression through new architectural style initiated by [[Ion Mincu]] and taken over by other prestigious architects who capitalise important references of Romanian laic and medieval ecclesiastical architecture (for example the [[Mogo\u015foaia Palace|Mogo\u0219oaia Palace]], the [[Stavropoleos Monastery|Stavropoleos Church]] or the disappeared church of V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti Monastery) and Romanian folk motifs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.ro/2010/06/art-nouveau-in-bucuresti.html |title=Stilul arhitectural na\u021bional romantic \u0219i Art Nouveau \u00een Bucure\u0219ti |work=Unknown Bucharest |date=20 June 2010 |access-date=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904033728/http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.ro/2010/06/art-nouveau-in-bucuresti.html |archive-date=4 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nTwo notable buildings from this time are the [[Cre\u021bulescu Palace]], housing cultural institutions including [[UNESCO]]'s European Centre for Higher Education, and the [[Cotroceni Palace]], the residence of the [[President of Romania|Romanian President]]. Many large-scale constructions such as the Gara de Nord, the busiest railway station in the city, National Bank of Romania's headquarters, and the [[Telephone Palace]] date from these times. In the 2000s, historic buildings in the city centre underwent restoration. In some residential areas of the city, particularly in high-income central and northern districts, [[fin-de-siecle|turn-of-the-20th-century]] villas were mostly restored beginning in the late 1990s.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Palatul Cantacuzino, Bucure\u015fti.jpg|[[French Baroque architecture|French Baroque]] style \u2013 [[Cantacuzino palace|Cantacuzino Palace]]\nFile:Palacio del C\u00edrculo Nacional Militar, Bucarest, Ruman\u00eda, 2016-05-29, DD 66.jpg|French [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style \u2013 [[Palace of the National Military Circle]]\nFile:Museo Nacional de Historia de Ruman\u00eda, Bucarest, Ruman\u00eda, 2016-05-29, DD 63.jpg|[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style \u2013[[National Museum of Romanian History]] \nFile:Front view of Romanian Palace of the Deposits and Consignments (Palatul CEC) in Bucharest (47981424973).jpg|[[Eclecticism in architecture|Eclectic]] style \u2013 [[CEC Palace]] \nFile:Carul cu bere.jpg|[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] \u2013 [[Caru' cu Bere]] \n</gallery>\n\n===Communist era architecture===\n\nA major part of Bucharest's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the [[Communist Romania|Communist era]] replacing the historical architecture with high-density apartment blocks \u2013 significant portions of the [[Ceau\u0219ima|historic centre of Bucharest]] were demolished to construct one of the largest buildings in the world, the [[Palace of the Parliament]] (then officially called the House of the Republic). In Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's project of systematization, new buildings were built in previously historical areas, which were razed and then built upon.\n\nOne of the singular examples of this type of architecture is [[Centrul Civic]], a development that replaced a major part of Bucharest's historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings, mainly with [[marble]] or [[travertine]] fa\u00e7ades, inspired by North Korean architecture. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s, under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic centre of Bucharest were levelled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted [[Art Deco]] sports stadium, changed drastically the appearance of the city.\n\nCommunist-era architecture can also be found in Bucharest's residential districts, mainly in ''blocuri'', which are high-density apartment blocks that house the majority of the city's population. Initially, these apartment blocks started to be constructed in the 1960s, on relatively empty areas and fields (good examples include Pajura, Drumul Taberei, Berceni and Titan), however with the 1970s, they mostly targeted peripheral neighbourhoods such as Colentina, Pantelimon, Militari and Rahova. Construction of these apartment blocks were also often randomised, for instance some small streets were demolished and later widened with the blocks being built next to them, but other neighbouring streets were left intact (like in the example of Calea Mo\u0219ilor from 1978\u20131982), or built in various patterns such as the Pia\u021ba Iancului-Lizeanu apartment buildings from 1962\u20131963.\n\nThere is also communist architecture that was built in the early years of the system, in the late 1940s and 1950s. Buildings constructed in this era followed the Soviet Stalinist trend of [[Socialist Realism]], and include the [[Casa Presei Libere|House of the Free Press]] (which was named ''Casa Sc\u00eenteii'' during communism).\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Palace Of Parliament Bucharest.jpg|[[Palace of the Parliament]], the largest assembly structure in the world\nFile:Bulevardul Unirii.jpg|Apartment blocks on [[Bulevardul Unirii|Unirii Boulevard]], built in the 1980s\nFile:View_from_the_Palace_of_Parliament_in_Bucharest.jpg|[[Centrul Civic]], panoramic view\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Contemporary architecture===\n\nSince [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|the fall of Communism in 1989]], several Communist-era buildings have been refurbished, modernised, and used for other purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greateconomy.ro/povestea-fabricilor-bucurestene-transformate-in-mall-uri-sau-apartamente/|title=Fabrici comuniste, transformate in mall-uri sau apartamente|first=Redactia Great|last=Economy|date=14 September 2015|website=Greateconomy.ro|accessdate=1 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027123813/http://greateconomy.ro/povestea-fabricilor-bucurestene-transformate-in-mall-uri-sau-apartamente/|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Perhaps the best example of this is the conversion of obsolete retail complexes into shopping malls and commercial centres. These giant, circular halls, which were unofficially called [[hunger circus]]es due to the food shortages experienced in the 1980s, were constructed during the Ceau\u0219escu era to act as produce markets and [[refectory|refectories]], although most were left unfinished at the time of the revolution.\n\nModern shopping malls such as the [[Unirea Shopping Center|Unirea Shopping Centre]], [[Bucharest Mall]], [[Plaza Romania]], and [[City Mall, Romania|City Mall]] emerged on pre-existent structures of former hunger circuses. Another example is the conversion of a large utilitarian construction in Centrul Civic into a [[Marriott International|Marriott Hotel]]. This process was accelerated after 2000, when the city underwent a property boom, and many Communist-era buildings in the city centre became prime real estate due to their location. Many Communist-era apartment blocks have also been refurbished to improve urban appearance.\n\nThe newest contribution to Bucharest's architecture took place after the fall of Communism, particularly after 2000, when the city went through a period of urban renewal{{spaced ndash}}and architectural revitalization{{spaced ndash}}on the back of Romania's economic growth. Buildings from this time are mostly made of glass and steel, and often have more than 10 storeys. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the Bucharest Mall, a conversion and extension of an abandoned building), office buildings, bank headquarters, etc. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nDuring the last ten years, several high rise office buildings were built, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Additionally, a trend to add modern wings and fa\u00e7ades to historic buildings has occurred, the most prominent example of which is the Bucharest Architects' Association Building, which is a modern glass-and-steel construction built inside a historic stone fa\u00e7ade. In 2013, the Bucharest skyline enriched with a 137-m-high office building (SkyTower of [[Floreasca City Center|Floreasca City Centre]]), currently the tallest building in Romania. Examples of modern skyscrapers built in the 21st century include [[Bucharest Tower Center|Bucharest Tower Centre]], [[Euro Tower (Bucharest)|Euro Tower]], [[Nusco Tower]], [[Cathedral Plaza]], [[City Gate Towers]], [[Rin Grand Hotel]], [[Premium Plaza]],\n[[Bucharest Corporate Center|Bucharest Corporate Centre]], [[Millennium Business Center|Millennium Business Centre]], [[PGV Tower]], [[Charles de Gaulle Plaza]], Business Development Centre Bucharest, [[BRD Tower Bucharest|BRD Tower]], and [[Bucharest Financial Plaza]]. Despite this development on vertical, Romanian architects avoid designing very tall buildings due to vulnerability to earthquakes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://stiri.tvr.ro/bucurestiul-nu-este-un-oras-pentru-zgarie-nori--e-mai-degraba-un-oras-pe-orizontala_44232.html |title=Bucure\u0219tiul nu este un ora\u0219 pentru zg\u00e2rie-nori, e mai degrab\u0103 un ora\u0219 pe orizontal\u0103 |newspaper=\u0218tirile TVR |date=7 May 2014 |access-date=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520220710/http://stiri.tvr.ro/bucurestiul-nu-este-un-oras-pentru-zgarie-nori--e-mai-degraba-un-oras-pe-orizontala_44232.html |archive-date=20 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAside from buildings used for business and institutions, residential developments have also been built, many of which consist of high-rise office buildings and suburban residential communities. An example of a new high rise residential complex is [[Asmita Gardens]]. These developments are increasingly prominent in northern Bucharest, which is less densely populated and is home to middle- and upper-class Bucharesters due to the process of [[gentrification]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Cladire - Splaiul Unirii 76.jpg|Skyscraper on the Splaiul Unirii\nFile:Bd.

Players have to kill a certain number of enemies in order to pass the other side of a level. Players can save the progress at the fountains, where they can also buy new weapons and armours. The game also has a four-on-four online multiplayer with [[Capture the Flag]] and [[Team Deathmatch]] modes.\n\n==Plot==\n''Wild Blood'' is inspired by Arthurian legends. In the game, the player controls Sir [[Lancelot]] in his fight against the jealous and mad [[King Arthur]] who, enraged by Lancelot's affair with Queen [[Guinevere]], has given the power over the kingdom to his evil sorceress sister [[Morgan la Fay|Morgana]] to punish his wife and his former friend. The dark witch in turn opened a portal to Hell, unleashing legions of demonic beasts to serve as her minions, and also captured Guinevere and holds her hostage in a tower on the magical island of [[Avalon]].

Players have to kill a certain number of enemies in order to pass the other side of a level. Players can save the progress at the fountains, where they can also buy new weapons and armours. The game also has a four-on-four online multiplayer with [[Capture the Flag]] and [[Team Deathmatch]] modes.\n\n==Plot==\n''Wild Blood'' is inspired by Arthurian legends. In the game, the player controls Sir [[Lancelot]] in his fight against the jealous and mad [[King Arthur]] who, enraged by Lancelot's affair with Queen [[Guinevere]], has given the power over the kingdom to his evil sorceress sister [[Morgan la Fay|Morgana]] to punish his wife and his former friend. The dark witch in turn opened a portal to Hell, unleashing legions of demonic beasts to serve as her minions, and also captured Guinevere and holds her hostage in a tower on the magical island of [[Avalon]]. In order to save his beloved, Lancelot needs to take on hellpawn hordes to defeat the King and then Morgana, who is able to turn into dragon.

Members formed the party on 1 October 1993, but did not register with the Justice Ministry until 16 December 1994. Abdygany Erkebaev served as the party's first chairman. [[Almazbek Atambayev]] replaced him on 30 July 1999. The majority of the party's membership is drawn from the country's entrepreneurs.\n\nOn 20 May 2004, the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan (SDPK) agreed to join the [[For Fair Elections]] electoral alliance. In October 2004, the larger El Party led by Melis Eshimkanov merged with the SDPK in preparation for the February 2005 parliamentary elections.\n\nThe party played a visible role in the [[Tulip Revolution]] and in large scale rallies in [[Bishkek]] in April and November 2006. A leading MP [[Temir Sariev]] who joined SDPK in 2006 left the party due to his disagreement with [[Almazbek Atambaev]] becoming a prime minister in March 2007.\n\nThe SDPK received the votes of 8% of eligible voters in the [[Kyrgyzstani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]], giving it 26 of 120 seats in parliament.

Members formed the party on 1 October 1993, but did not register with the Justice Ministry until 16 December 1994. Abdygany Erkebaev served as the party's first chairman. [[Almazbek Atambayev]] replaced him on 30 July 1999. The majority of the party's membership is drawn from the country's entrepreneurs.\n\nOn 20 May 2004, the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan (SDPK) agreed to join the [[For Fair Elections]] electoral alliance. In October 2004, the larger El Party led by Melis Eshimkanov merged with the SDPK in preparation for the February 2005 parliamentary elections.\n\nThe party played a visible role in the [[Tulip Revolution]] and in large scale rallies in [[Bishkek]] in April and November 2006. A leading MP [[Temir Sariev]] who joined SDPK in 2006 left the party due to his disagreement with [[Almazbek Atambaev]] becoming a prime minister in March 2007.\n\nThe SDPK received the votes of 8% of eligible voters in the [[Kyrgyzstani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]], giving it 26 of 120 seats in parliament. This result made the party the second of five parties to surpass the support threshold of 5% of eligible voters necessary to enter parliament.
