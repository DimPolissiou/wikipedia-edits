His use of diagonals in the composition and perspectival abbreviation, the illusive use of foreshortening and the avoidance of a conventional backdrop are prominent in a work such as the ''Card players'' ([[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp]]).<ref name=bar/>  As in the work of his master Janssens, Rombouts' figures have an almost sculptural aspect.<ref name=adam/>\n[[File:Theodoor Rombouts - The quack tooth puller.jpg|thumb|left|335px|''The quack tooth puller.'' [[Museo del Prado|The Prado Museum]], Madrid.|alt=]]\n\nRombouts was the first Flemish painter who, like [[Gerrit van Honthorst]] in the Dutch Republic, painted single male or female musicians.  It is likely that he developed this type of painting under the direct influence of the works of the followers of Caravaggio whose works he had seen in Italy rather than through the intermediary of the Dutch [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Caravaggists]].  Rombouts' ''Lute player'' ([[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp]], 1620s) is a good example of the influence of Manfredi and [[Valentin de Boulogne]] on the Flemish Caravaggisti.  Other Flemish painters such as [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Gonzales Coques]], [[Jan Cossiers]] and Gillis Remeeus would later also adopt the type of the single musician.<ref>J. Richard J. Judson, 'Gerrit van Honthorst: A Discussion of his Position in Dutch Art', Springer, 1 Dec 2013, p. 68</ref>\n[[File:Theodoor Rombouts - Musical company with Bacchus.jpg|thumb|310px|''Musical company with Bacchus'']]\n\nThe themes of the five senses and the [[seven deadly sins]] often appear in his work.  Rombouts' [[:File:Theodoor Rombouts - Joueur de luth.jpg|''The lute player'']] (c. 1620, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]) is not solely a portrait of a musician but also alludes to the five senses through the objects included in the composition: hearing (the lute), taste (the tankard), smell (the pipe), sight (the musical scores), and touch (the knife).<ref>[http://caravaggio.kimbellart.org/exhibit/music-youth/lute-player Theodoor Rombouts, ''The lute player''] at the Kimbell Art Museum</ref> The [[:File:Kort- og br\u00e6tspillere.

Fight over cards''] at the National Gallery of Denmark</ref>\n\nRombouts regularly included portraits of himself and his wife in his genre paintings.  An example is the ''[[:File:Theodoor Rombouts - Musical company with Bacchus.jpg|Musical company with Bacchus]]'' (The Kremer Collection).  Based on the two pendant portraits by [[Antony van Dyck]] of [[:File:Anthony van Dyck - Theodoor Rombouts.JPG|Rombouts]] and [[:File:Anthony van Dyck - Portrait of Anna van Thielen, the wife of the painter Theodoor Rombouts with their daughter.jpg|Rombouts' wife with their daughter]] in the Alte Pinakothek Munich, the couple in the middle of this composition is believed to represent Rombouts and his wife.  That the two should be interpreted as a couple is made clear by the fact that the woman has put her hand on the man's arm. Couples making music or singing together was in 17th-century art and literature a popular reference to love.  In addition, the tuning of the lute by the musician on the left is intended as a symbol of harmony in marriage.  Music was further believed to operate as a cure for sorrow. In the composition described here the pleasures of music and love are enhanced by the wine brought in by [[Dionysus|Bacchus]].<ref name=krem/>\n[[File:L'Echanson - All\u00e9gorie de la Temp\u00e9rance.JPG|thumb|''Allegory of temperance'']]\n\nRombouts also collaborated with specialist painters in Antwerp for whom he typically painted the [[staffage]] in their compositions.  Examples of such collaborations are the ''[[:File:Adriaen van Utrecht, Theodoor Rombouts - Kitchen.jpg|Kitchen]]'' (1630s, [[Hermitage Museum]]), a collaboration with still life painter [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] and ''[[:File:Theodoor Rombouts and Jan Wildens - The Holy Family.jpg|The Holy Family]]'' (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp), a collaboration with landscape painter [[Jan Wildens]].<ref name=adam/>\n===Later work===\n\nThe popularity of the Caravaggio movement lost steam after 1630.  Rombouts abandoned chiaroscuro effects for more tempered lighting, smoother transitions and a lighter palette.  A good example of this is ''The Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherina'' (Saint James's Church, Antwerp). This late style approaches the later work of Rubens, with whom he collaborated in the realization of the decorations for the Joyous Entry of Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand in Antwerp in 1635.<ref name=prado/>  A late work directly influenced by Rubens is the ''[[:File:Theodoor Rombouts - Descent from the Cross.jpg|Descent from the Cross]]'' (1636, [[St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent]]), which directly cites [[:File:Peter Paul Rubens - Descent from the Cross - WGA20212.jpg|Rubens' treatment of the same subject]] of roughly two decades earlier ([[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Antwerp Cathedral]]).<ref name=bran/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons-inline|Category:Theodoor Rombouts|Theodoor Rombouts}}\n{{Caravaggisti}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rombouts, Theodoor}}\n\n[[Category:Flemish Baroque painters]]\n[[Category:Flemish history painters]]\n[[Category:Flemish genre painters]]\n[[Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke]]\n[[Category:Artists from Antwerp]]\n[[Category:1597 births]]\n[[Category:1637 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Anthony van Dyck - Theodoor Rombouts.JPG|thumb|''Portrait of Theodoor Rombouts'' by [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]\n'''Theodoor Rombouts''' (2 July 1597 \u2013 14 September 1637) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] painter who is mainly known for his [[Caravaggism|Caravaggesque]] [[genre painting|genre]] scenes depicting lively dramatic gatherings as well as religiously-themed works.<ref name=\"grove\">Hans Vlieghe. \"Rombouts, Theodoor.\" Grove Art Online.

Based on the two pendant portraits by [[Antony van Dyck]] of [[:File:Anthony van Dyck - Theodoor Rombouts.JPG|Rombouts]] and [[:File:Anthony van Dyck - Portrait of Anna van Thielen, the wife of the painter Theodoor Rombouts with their daughter.jpg|Rombouts' wife with their daughter]] in the Alte Pinakothek Munich, the couple in the middle of this composition is believed to represent Rombouts and his wife.  That the two should be interpreted as a couple is made clear by the fact that the woman has put her hand on the man's arm. Couples making music or singing together was in 17th-century art and literature a popular reference to love.  In addition, the tuning of the lute by the musician on the left is intended as a symbol of harmony in marriage.  Music was further believed to operate as a cure for sorrow. In the composition described here the pleasures of music and love are enhanced by the wine brought in by [[Dionysus|Bacchus]].<ref name=krem/>\n[[File:L'Echanson - All\u00e9gorie de la Temp\u00e9rance.JPG|thumb|''Allegory of temperance'']]\n\nRombouts also collaborated with specialist painters in Antwerp for whom he typically painted the [[staffage]] in their compositions.  Examples of such collaborations are the ''[[:File:Adriaen van Utrecht, Theodoor Rombouts - Kitchen.jpg|Kitchen]]'' (1630s, [[Hermitage Museum]]), a collaboration with still life painter [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] and ''[[:File:Theodoor Rombouts and Jan Wildens - The Holy Family.jpg|The Holy Family]]'' (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp), a collaboration with landscape painter [[Jan Wildens]].<ref name=adam/>\n===Later work===\n\nThe popularity of the Caravaggio movement lost steam after 1630.  Rombouts abandoned chiaroscuro effects for more tempered lighting, smoother transitions and a lighter palette.  A good example of this is ''The Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherina'' (Saint James's Church, Antwerp). This late style approaches the later work of Rubens, with whom he collaborated in the realization of the decorations for the Joyous Entry of Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand in Antwerp in 1635.<ref name=prado/>  A late work directly influenced by Rubens is the ''[[:File:Theodoor Rombouts - Descent from the Cross.jpg|Descent from the Cross]]'' (1636, [[St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent]]), which directly cites [[:File:Peter Paul Rubens - Descent from the Cross - WGA20212.jpg|Rubens' treatment of the same subject]] of roughly two decades earlier ([[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Antwerp Cathedral]]).<ref name=bran/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons-inline|Category:Theodoor Rombouts|Theodoor Rombouts}}\n{{Caravaggisti}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rombouts, Theodoor}}\n\n[[Category:Flemish Baroque painters]]\n[[Category:Flemish history painters]]\n[[Category:Flemish genre painters]]\n[[Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke]]\n[[Category:Artists from Antwerp]]\n[[Category:1597 births]]\n[[Category:1637 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "FydelJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "correcting view of images and adding bibliography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoor_Rombouts"}

[[Yeast in winemaking|Yeast]] consumes the [[sugar]] in the [[Grape|grapes]] and converts it to [[ethanol]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[heat]]. Different varieties of grapes and [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment ([[terroir]]), and the production process. Many [[Country|countries]] enact legal [[appellation]]s intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes involve fermentation of additional crops including,  [[rice wine]] and other [[fruit wine]]s such as [[plum]], [[cherry]], [[pomegranate]], [[Ribes|currant]] and [[Sambucus|elderberry]].\n\nWine has been produced for thousands of years.

Red wine is made from dark-colored [[grape varieties]]. The actual [[Wine color|color of the wine]] can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is actually greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called [[anthocyanin]]s) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon [[teinturier]] varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice.\n\n=== White wine ===\n{{Main|White wine}}\nFermentation of the non-colored [[Juice vesicles|grape pulp]] produces white wine. The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, such as the [[Chardonnay]], [[Sauvignon blanc|Sauvignon]], and [[Riesling]]. Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; [[Tokay (grape)|Tokay]], [[Sherry]], and [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes may be used to produce white wine if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the [[wort]] during the separation of the pulp-juice. [[Pinot noir]], for example, is commonly used to produce [[champagne]].\n\nDry (non-sweet) white wine is the most common, derived from the complete fermentation of the [[wort]]. Sweet wines are produced when the fermentation is interrupted before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white wines, are produced by not allowing [[carbon dioxide]] from the fermentation to escape during fermentation, which takes place in the bottle rather than in the barrel.\n\n===Sparkling wine ===\n{{Main|Sparkling wine}}\n\n=== Ros\u00e9 wine ===\n{{Main|Ros\u00e9 wine}}\nA ros\u00e9 wine incorporates some of the [[wine color|color]] from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a [[red wine]]. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the [[Maceration (wine)|skin contact method]]. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce ros\u00e9 wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the [[wort]]), saign\u00e9e (removing juice from the [[must]] early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and [[Blending (alcohol production)|blending]] (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Ros\u00e9 wines can be made still, [[Semi-sparkling wines|semi-sparkling]], or [[sparkling wine|sparkling]], with a wide range of [[sweetness (wine)|sweetness levels]] from [[dryness (taste)|dry]] [[Proven\u00e7al (wine)|Proven\u00e7al]] ros\u00e9 to sweet [[White Zinfandel]]s and blushes. Ros\u00e9 wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.<ref name=\"Oxford\">J.

Other than the grape [[variety (botany)|varieties]] traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either sufficient fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably one of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent by far than other types, and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined to regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons.\n\n=== Mead (honey wine) ===\n{{Main|Mead}}\nMead, also called honey wine, is created by fermenting [[honey]] with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or [[hops]]. As long as the primary substance fermented is honey, the drink is considered mead.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rites of Odin|first=Edward|last=Fitch|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kg8nObaAZMEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-87542-224-4|page=290|location=St. Paul, Minnesota}}</ref> Mead was produced in ancient history throughout Europe, Africa and Asia,<ref>Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat (Anthea Bell, tr.)

When one of these varieties is used as the predominant grape (usually defined by law as minimums of 75% to 85%), the result is a \"[[varietal]]\" as opposed to a \"blended\" wine. Blended wines are not necessarily inferior to varietal wines, rather they are a different style of wine-making.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/dining/drinks/wine-school-california-grenache.html|title=Don't Judge a Wine by the Grape on Its Label|date=2018-02-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nWine can also be made from other species of grape or from [[Hybrid (grapes)|hybrids]], created by the [[genetic crossing (vine)|genetic crossing]] of two species. ''[[Vitis labrusca|V. labrusca]]'' (of which the [[Concord grape]] is a [[cultivar]]), ''[[Vitis aestivalis|V. aestivalis]]'', ''[[Vitis rupestris|V. rupestris]]'', ''[[Vitis rotundifolia|V. rotundifolia]]'' and ''[[Vitis riparia|V. riparia]]'' are native [[North America]]n grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for grape juice, jam, or jelly, and only occasionally made into wine.\n\nHybridization is different from [[grafting]]. Most of the world's vineyards are planted with European ''V. vinifera'' vines that have been grafted onto North American species' rootstock, a common practice due to their resistance to [[phylloxera]], a root louse that eventually kills the vine. In the late 19th century, most of Europe's vineyards (excluding some of the driest in the south) were devastated by the infestation, leading to widespread vine deaths and eventual replanting. Grafting is done in every wine-producing region in the world except in [[Argentina]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Chile]]\u2014the only places not yet exposed to the insect.<ref name=\"Robinson pg 97\">{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |title=Jancis Robinson's Wine Course: A Guide to the World of Wine |date=28 April 2006 |publisher=Abbeville Press |isbn=978-0-7892-0883-5 |page=97}}</ref>\n\nIn the context of wine production, ''[[terroir]]'' is a concept that encompasses the varieties of grapes used, elevation and shape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fraga|first1=Helder|last2=Malheiro|first2=Aureliano C.|last3=Moutinho-Pereira|first3=Jos\u00e9|last4=Cardoso|first4=Rita M.|last5=Soares|first5=Pedro M.

European wines tend to be classified by region (e.g. [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] and [[Chianti]]), while non-European wines are most often classified by grape (e.g. [[Pinot noir]] and [[Merlot]]). Market recognition of particular regions has recently been leading to their increased prominence on non-European wine labels.

Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and [[spice]]s. The [[sweetness of wine]] is determined by the amount of residual sugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. [[Dry wine]], for example, has only a small amount of residual sugar. Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine \"breathe\" for a couple of hours before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. [[Decanter|Decanting]] (the act of pouring a wine into a special container just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.<ref name=\"Johnson & Robinson pg 46\">{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |author2=Jancis Robinson  |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |page=46}}</ref>\n\nDuring aeration, a younger wine's exposure to air often \"relaxes\" the drink, making it smoother and better integrated in aroma, texture, and flavor. Older wines generally fade (lose their character and flavor intensity) with extended aeration.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fruity character and breathing times | date=18 September 2005 | url =http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:KLSC&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10CBABDF8E627AD8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 | work =[[New Straits Times]] | pages = | accessdate =24 October 2007 | language =}}</ref> Despite these general rules, breathing does not necessarily benefit all wines.

Experienced tasters can distinguish between flavors characteristic of a specific grape and flavors that result from other factors in wine-making. Typical intentional flavor elements in wine\u2014chocolate, vanilla, or coffee\u2014are those imparted by aging in oak casks rather than the grape itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frenchscout.com/types-of-wine |title=Types of wine |accessdate=26 June 2008 |last=Breton |first=F\u00e9licien |publisher=French Scout}}</ref>\n\n[[Horizontal tasting|Vertical and horizontal tasting]] involves a range of vintages within the same grape and vineyard, or the latter in which there is one vintage from multiple vineyards. \"[[Banana]]\" flavors ([[isoamyl acetate]]) are the product of yeast metabolism, as are spoilage aromas such as \"medicinal\" or \"Band-Aid\" ([[4-Ethylphenol|4-ethylphenol]]), \"spicy\" or \"smoky\" ([[4-ethylguaiacol]]),<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219204946/http://www.etslabs.com/scripts/ets/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=193 | archivedate=19 February 2008 |url=http://www.etslabs.com/scripts/ets/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=193 |title=''Brettanomyces'' Monitoring by Analysis of 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol |accessdate=26 June 2008 |author=ETS Laboratories |date=15 March 2001}}</ref> and rotten egg ([[hydrogen sulfide]]).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219205658/http://www.etslabs.com/scripts/ets/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=350 |archivedate=19 February 2008 |url=http://www.etslabs.com/scripts/ets/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=350 |title=Sulfides in Wine |author=ETS Laboratories |date=15 May 2002}}</ref> Some varieties can also exhibit a mineral flavor due to the presence of water-soluble salts as a result of limestone's presence in the vineyard's soil.

A white wine should foster a sense of coolness, achieved by serving at \"cellar temperature\" ({{convert|13|C|F}}). Light red wines drunk young should also be brought to the table at this temperature, where they will quickly rise a few degrees.

However, this does not mean the temperature of the dining room\u2014often around {{convert|21|C|F}}\u2014but rather the coolest room in the house and, therefore, always slightly cooler than the dining room itself.

Wine is often served with dinner. Sweet [[dessert wine]]s may be served with the [[dessert]] course. In fine restaurants in Western countries, wine typically accompanies dinner.

Wine was used in Eucharistic rites by all Protestant groups until an alternative arose in the late 19th century. [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[dentist]] and [[prohibition]]ist [[Thomas Bramwell Welch]] applied new pasteurization techniques to stop the natural fermentation process of [[grape juice]]. Some Christians who were part of the growing [[temperance movement]] pressed for a switch from wine to grape juice, and the substitution spread quickly over much of the United States, as well as to other countries to a lesser degree.<ref>{{cite news |title=Almost Like Wine |date=3 September 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824374,00.html |work=[[Time Magazine]] |accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref> There remains an ongoing debate between some American [[Protestant]] denominations as to whether wine can and should be used for the Eucharist or allowed as an ordinary drink, with Catholics and some mainline Protestants allowing wine drinking in moderation, and some conservative Protestant groups opposing consumption of alcohol altogether.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Islam ===\n[[File:Mei.jpg|thumb|upright|All alcohol is prohibited under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], although there has been a long tradition of drinking wine in some Islamic areas, especially in [[Iran]].]]\n{{Main|Islam and alcohol}}\n\nAlcoholic drinks, including wine, are forbidden under most interpretations of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Frances |last=Harrison |title=Alcohol fatwa sparks controversy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7342425.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref> In many Muslim countries, possession or consumption of alcoholic drinks carry legal penalties.

Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the wine and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or [[street drugs]], among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]], increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting, and death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. As with all alcoholic drinks, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving.\n\nWines can trigger positive emotions in a short period of time, such as feelings of relaxation and comfort. The context and quality of wine can affect the mood and emotions, too.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danner|first1=Lukas|last2=Ristic|first2=Renata|last3=Johnson|first3=Trent E|last4=Meiselman|first4=Herbert L|last5=Hoek|first5=Annet C|title=Context and wine quality effects on consumers' mood, emotions, liking and willingness to pay for Australian Shiraz wines|journal=Food Research International|date=Nov 2016|volume=89|issue=Pt 1|pages=254\u2013265|doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2016.08.006|pmid=28460912}}</ref>\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\n{{See also|Long-term effects of alcohol consumption}}\n[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|left|Most significant of the possible [[Long-term effects of alcohol consumption|long-term effects]] of [[ethanol]], one of the constituents of wine.

Tucked inside the package is a tap affixed to the [[bag in box]], or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh for up to a month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine [[oxidize]]s more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days. Cans are one of the fastest-growing forms of alternative wine packaging on the market.<ref name=\"cans\">{{cite web |title=Canned Wine Comes of Age |language=en |website=Wine Spectator |date=22 May 2019 |author=Augustus Weed |url=https://www.winespectator.com/articles/canned-wine-comes-of-age#}}</ref>\n\nEnvironmental considerations of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass used to make bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] violations. A ''New York Times'' editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced [[carbon footprint]] from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.<ref>Muzaurieta, Annie Bell, thedailygreen.com (1 October 2008).

Fine restaurants and some private homes have wine cellars. In an active wine cellar, temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate-control system. Passive wine cellars are not climate-controlled, and so must be carefully located. Because wine is a natural, perishable food product, all types\u2014including red, white, sparkling, and fortified\u2014can spoil when exposed to heat, light, vibration or fluctuations in temperature and humidity. When properly stored, wines can maintain their quality and in some cases improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity as they age. Some wine experts contend that the optimal temperature for aging wine is {{convert|13|C|F}},<ref>fineliving.com [http://www.fineliving.com/fine/simply_wine/article/0,,fine_15098_2518659,00.html Storing Wine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111025534/http://www.fineliving.com/fine/simply_wine/article/0,,fine_15098_2518659,00.html |date=11 January 2010 }}</ref> others {{convert|15|C|F}}.<ref>maridajesgourmet.com [http://www.maridajesgourmet.com/vinos/vino/vinocuidadovino/temperatura.html Storing Wine Temperature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708100910/http://www.maridajesgourmet.com/vinos/vino/vinocuidadovino/temperatura.html |date=8 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWine refrigerators offer a smaller alternative to wine cellars and are available in capacities ranging from small, 16-bottle units to furniture-quality pieces that can contain 400 bottles. Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but rather serve to chill wine to the proper temperature for drinking. These refrigerators keep the humidity low (usually under 50%), below the optimal humidity of 50% to 70%. Lower humidity levels can dry out corks over time, allowing oxygen to enter the bottle, which reduces the wine's quality through oxidation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intowine.com/wine-fridges-and-wine-cabinets|title=Wine Fridges and Wine Cabinets}}</ref> While some types of alcohol are sometimes stored in freezer, such as [[vodka]], it is not possible to safely freeze wine in the bottle, as there is insufficient room for it to expand as it freezes and the bottle will usually crack. Certain shapes of bottle may allow the cork to be pushed out by the ice, but if the bottle is frozen on its side, the wine in the narrower neck will invariably freeze first, preventing this.\n\n== Professions ==\nThere are a large number of occupations and professions that are part of the wine industry, ranging from the individuals who grow the grapes, prepare the wine, bottle it, sell it, assess it, market it and finally make recommendations to clients and serve the wine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Related professions\n!Name\n!Description\n|-\n|Cellar master\n|A person in charge of a wine cellar\n|-\n|[[Cooper (profession)|Cooper]]\n|A craftsperson of wooden barrels and casks.

[[Yeast in winemaking|Yeast]] consumes the [[sugar]] in the [[Grape|grapes]] and converts it to [[ethanol]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[heat]]. Different varieties of grapes and [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment ([[terroir]]), and the production process. Many [[Country|countries]] enact legal [[appellation]]s intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes involve fermentation of additional crops including,  [[rice wine]] and other [[fruit wine]]s such as [[plum]], [[cherry]], [[pomegranate]], [[Ribes|currant]] and [[Sambucus|elderberry]].\n\nWine has been produced for thousands of years.

Red wine is made from dark-colored [[grape varieties]]. The actual [[Wine color|color of the wine]] can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is actually greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called [[anthocyanin]]s) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon [[teinturier]] varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice.\n\n=== White wine ===\n{{Main|White wine}}\nFermentation of the non-colored [[Juice vesicles|grape pulp]] produces white wine. The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, such as the [[Chardonnay]], [[Sauvignon blanc|Sauvignon]], and [[Riesling]]. Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; [[Tokay (grape)|Tokay]], [[Sherry]], and [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes may be used to produce white wine if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the [[wort]] during the separation of the pulp-juice. [[Pinot noir]], for example, is commonly used to produce [[champagne]].\n\nDry (non-sweet) white wine is the most common, derived from the complete fermentation of the [[wort]]. Sweet wines are produced when the fermentation is interrupted before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white wines, are produced by not allowing [[carbon dioxide]] from the fermentation to escape during fermentation, which takes place in the bottle rather than in the barrel.\n\n===Sparkling wine ===\n{{Main|Sparkling wine}}\n\n=== Ros\u00e9 wine ===\n{{Main|Ros\u00e9 wine}}\nA ros\u00e9 wine incorporates some of the [[wine color|color]] from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a [[red wine]]. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the [[Maceration (wine)|skin contact method]]. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce ros\u00e9 wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the [[wort]]), saign\u00e9e (removing juice from the [[must]] early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and [[Blending (alcohol production)|blending]] (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Ros\u00e9 wines can be made still, [[Semi-sparkling wines|semi-sparkling]], or [[sparkling wine|sparkling]], with a wide range of [[sweetness (wine)|sweetness levels]] from [[dryness (taste)|dry]] [[Proven\u00e7al (wine)|Proven\u00e7al]] ros\u00e9 to sweet [[White Zinfandel]]s and blushes. Ros\u00e9 wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.<ref name=\"Oxford\">J.

Other than the grape [[variety (botany)|varieties]] traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either sufficient fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics.

When one of these varieties is used as the predominant grape (usually defined by law as minimums of 75% to 85%), the result is a \"[[varietal]]\" as opposed to a \"blended\" wine.

Most of the world's vineyards are planted with European ''V. vinifera'' vines that have been grafted onto North American species' rootstock, a common practice due to their resistance to [[phylloxera]], a root louse that eventually kills the vine. In the late 19th century, most of Europe's vineyards (excluding some of the driest in the south) were devastated by the infestation, leading to widespread vine deaths and eventual replanting.

European wines tend to be classified by region (e.g. [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] and [[Chianti]]), while non-European wines are most often classified by grape (e.g. [[Pinot noir]] and [[Merlot]]). Market recognition of particular regions has recently been leading to their increased prominence on non-European wine labels. Examples of recognized non-European locales include [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], Santa Clara Valley, [[Sonoma Valley AVA|Sonoma Valley]], Anderson Valley, and [[Mendocino County]] in California; [[Willamette Valley (wine)|Willamette Valley]] and [[Rogue Valley AVA|Rogue Valley]] in [[Oregon (wine)|Oregon]]; [[Columbia Valley (wine)|Columbia Valley]] in [[Washington (wine)|Washington]]; [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]] in [[South Australia (wine)|South Australia]]; [[Hunter Valley (wine)|Hunter Valley]] in [[New South Wales (wine)|New South Wales]]; Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo in [[Argentina (wine)|Argentina]]; Central Valley in [[Chile (wine)|Chile]]; Vale dos Vinhedos in [[Brazil]]; [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]] in [[New Zealand (wine)|New Zealand]]; and in [[Canadian wine|Canada]], the [[Okanagan Valley (wine)|Okanagan Valley]] of [[British Columbia wine|British Columbia]], and the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]] regions of [[Ontario wine|Ontario]] are the three largest producers.\n\nSome blended wine names are marketing terms whose use is governed by [[trademark]] law rather than by specific wine laws. For example, [[Meritage]] (sounds like \"heritage\") is generally a Bordeaux-style blend of [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and Merlot, but may also include [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit Verdot]], and [[Malbec]].

Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and [[spice]]s. The [[sweetness of wine]] is determined by the amount of residual sugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. [[Dry wine]], for example, has only a small amount of residual sugar. Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine \"breathe\" for a couple of hours before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. [[Decanter|Decanting]] (the act of pouring a wine into a special container just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.<ref name=\"Johnson & Robinson pg 46\">{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |author2=Jancis Robinson  |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |page=46}}</ref>\n\nDuring aeration, a younger wine's exposure to air often \"relaxes\" the drink, making it smoother and better integrated in aroma, texture, and flavor.

Wine is often served with dinner. Sweet [[dessert wine]]s may be served with the [[dessert]] course. In fine restaurants in Western countries, wine typically accompanies dinner.

Wine was used in Eucharistic rites by all Protestant groups until an alternative arose in the late 19th century. [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[dentist]] and [[prohibition]]ist [[Thomas Bramwell Welch]] applied new pasteurization techniques to stop the natural fermentation process of [[grape juice]]. Some Christians who were part of the growing [[temperance movement]] pressed for a switch from wine to grape juice, and the substitution spread quickly over much of the United States, as well as to other countries to a lesser degree.<ref>{{cite news |title=Almost Like Wine |date=3 September 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824374,00.html |work=[[Time Magazine]] |accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref> There remains an ongoing debate between some American [[Protestant]] denominations as to whether wine can and should be used for the Eucharist or allowed as an ordinary drink, with Catholics and some mainline Protestants allowing wine drinking in moderation, and some conservative Protestant groups opposing consumption of alcohol altogether.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Islam ===\n[[File:Mei.jpg|thumb|upright|All alcohol is prohibited under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], although there has been a long tradition of drinking wine in some Islamic areas, especially in [[Iran]].]]\n{{Main|Islam and alcohol}}\n\nAlcoholic drinks, including wine, are forbidden under most interpretations of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Frances |last=Harrison |title=Alcohol fatwa sparks controversy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7342425.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref> In many Muslim countries, possession or consumption of alcoholic drinks carry legal penalties.

Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the wine and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or [[street drugs]], among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]], increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting, and death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. As with all alcoholic drinks, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving.\n\nWines can trigger positive emotions in a short period of time, such as feelings of relaxation and comfort.

Tucked inside the package is a tap affixed to the [[bag in box]], or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh for up to a month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine [[oxidize]]s more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days. Cans are one of the fastest-growing forms of alternative wine packaging on the market.<ref name=\"cans\">{{cite web |title=Canned Wine Comes of Age |language=en |website=Wine Spectator |date=22 May 2019 |author=Augustus Weed |url=https://www.winespectator.com/articles/canned-wine-comes-of-age#}}</ref>\n\nEnvironmental considerations of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass used to make bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] violations. A ''New York Times'' editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced [[carbon footprint]] from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.<ref>Muzaurieta, Annie Bell, thedailygreen.com (1 October 2008).

Fine restaurants and some private homes have wine cellars. In an active wine cellar, temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate-control system. Passive wine cellars are not climate-controlled, and so must be carefully located. Because wine is a natural, perishable food product, all types\u2014including red, white, sparkling, and fortified\u2014can spoil when exposed to heat, light, vibration or fluctuations in temperature and humidity. When properly stored, wines can maintain their quality and in some cases improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity as they age. Some wine experts contend that the optimal temperature for aging wine is {{convert|13|C|F}},<ref>fineliving.com [http://www.fineliving.com/fine/simply_wine/article/0,,fine_15098_2518659,00.html Storing Wine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111025534/http://www.fineliving.com/fine/simply_wine/article/0,,fine_15098_2518659,00.html |date=11 January 2010 }}</ref> others {{convert|15|C|F}}.<ref>maridajesgourmet.com [http://www.maridajesgourmet.com/vinos/vino/vinocuidadovino/temperatura.html Storing Wine Temperature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708100910/http://www.maridajesgourmet.com/vinos/vino/vinocuidadovino/temperatura.html |date=8 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWine refrigerators offer a smaller alternative to wine cellars and are available in capacities ranging from small, 16-bottle units to furniture-quality pieces that can contain 400 bottles. Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but rather serve to chill wine to the proper temperature for drinking. These refrigerators keep the humidity low (usually under 50%), below the optimal humidity of 50% to 70%. Lower humidity levels can dry out corks over time, allowing oxygen to enter the bottle, which reduces the wine's quality through oxidation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intowine.com/wine-fridges-and-wine-cabinets|title=Wine Fridges and Wine Cabinets}}</ref> While some types of alcohol are sometimes stored in freezer, such as [[vodka]], it is not possible to safely freeze wine in the bottle, as there is insufficient room for it to expand as it freezes and the bottle will usually crack. Certain shapes of bottle may allow the cork to be pushed out by the ice, but if the bottle is frozen on its side, the wine in the narrower neck will invariably freeze first, preventing this.\n\n== Professions ==\nThere are a large number of occupations and professions that are part of the wine industry, ranging from the individuals who grow the grapes, prepare the wine, bottle it, sell it, assess it, market it and finally make recommendations to clients and serve the wine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Related professions\n!Name\n!Description\n|-\n|Cellar master\n|A person in charge of a wine cellar\n|-\n|[[Cooper (profession)|Cooper]]\n|A craftsperson of wooden barrels and casks.

By 1930 the application of [[short wave]]s to heat human tissue had developed into the medical therapy of [[diathermy]].  At the [[Century of Progress|1933 Chicago World's Fair]], [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] demonstrated the cooking of foods between two metal plates attached to a 10&nbsp;kW, 60&nbsp;MHz [[shortwave]] [[transmitter]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Cooking with Short Waves | journal = Short Wave Craft | volume = 4| issue = 7 | page = 394 | date = November 1933 | url = http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Short-Wave-Television/30s/SW-TV-1933-11.pdf | issn = | doi =  | id =  | accessdate = 23 March 2015}}</ref>  The Westinghouse team, led by I. F. Mouromtseff, found that foods like steaks and potatoes could be cooked in minutes.\n\nThe 1937 United States patent application by Bell Laboratories states:<ref>{{US patent|2147689}} Chaffee, Joseph G., ''Method and apparatus for heating dielectric materials'', filed 11 August 1937; granted 21 February 1939</ref>\n{{Quotation|This invention relates to heating systems for dielectric materials and the object of the invention is to heat such materials uniformly and substantially simultaneously throughout their mass. ... It has been proposed therefore to heat such materials simultaneously throughout their mass by means of the dielectric loss produced in them when they are subjected to a high voltage, high frequency field.}}\n\nHowever, lower-frequency [[dielectric heating]], as described in the aforementioned patent, is (like [[induction heating]]) an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] heating effect, the result of the so-called [[near and far field|near-field]] effects that exist in an electromagnetic cavity that is small compared with the [[wavelength]] of the electromagnetic field. This patent proposed radio frequency heating, at 10 to 20 [[megahertz]] (wavelength 30 to 15 meters, respectively).<ref name=  \"patent\">{{citation | url = http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=02147689&IDKey=49D95666A76C&HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.htm%2526r%3D1%2526p%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPALL%2526S1%3D2147689.PN.%2526OS%3Dpn%2F2147689%2526RS%3DPN%2F2147689 | publisher = United States Patent and Trademark Office | title = 2,147,689: Method and Apparatus for Heating Dielectric Materials | first = Joseph G. | last = Chaffee | date = 21 February 1939}}</ref> Heating from microwaves that have a wavelength that is small relative to the cavity (as in a modern microwave oven) is due to \"far-field\" effects that are due to classical [[electromagnetic radiation]] that describes freely propagating light and microwaves suitably far from their source. Nevertheless, the primary heating effect of all types of electromagnetic fields at both radio and microwave frequencies occurs via the dielectric heating effect, as polarized molecules are affected by a rapidly alternating electric field.\n\n=== Cavity magnetron ===\n[[File:Original cavity magnetron, 1940 (9663811280).jpg|thumb|The [[cavity magnetron]] developed by [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]] in 1940 at the [[University of Birmingham]], England]]\n\nThe invention of the [[cavity magnetron]] made possible the production of [[electromagnetic wave]]s of a small enough [[wavelength]] ([[microwave]]s).

Employed by [[Raytheon]] at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set he was working on started to melt a [[Mr. Goodbar|chocolate bar]] he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gallawa.com/history.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531120513/http://www.gallawa.com/history.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2013-05-31 |title=The History of the Microwave Oven |first=John Carlton|last= Gallawa |year=1998}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|4h1ESUz2H3E|Radar \u2014 Father of the Microwave Oven}}</ref> To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.<ref>{{US patent reference |number=2495429 |y=1950 |m=January |d=24 |inventor=Spencer, Percy L. |title=Method of treating foodstuffs}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial availability ===\n[[File:NS Savannah microwave oven MD8.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Raytheon RadaRange aboard the [[NS Savannah|NS ''Savannah'']] nuclear-powered cargo ship, installed circa 1961]]\n\nIn 1947, Raytheon built the \"Radarange\", the first commercially available microwave oven.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.raytheon.com/ourcompany/history/leadership/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322044917/http://www.raytheon.com/ourcompany/history/leadership/ |archivedate=2013-03-22 |title=Technology Leadership |publisher=Raytheon}}</ref> It was almost {{convert|1.8|m|ftin}} tall, weighed {{convert|340|kg|lb}} and cost about US$5,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000|1947|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) each.

Between 1964 and 1966, Sharp introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable, a feature that promotes convenient even heating of food.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Sharp |url=http://www.sharpusa.com/aboutsharp/companyprofile/sharpandtechnologyhistory.aspx |website=[[Sharp Corporation]] |accessdate=26 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In 1965, Raytheon acquired [[Amana (appliances)|Amana]]. In 1967, they introduced the first popular home model, the countertop Radarange, at a price of US$495 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|495|1967|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).\n\nIn the 1960s,{{specify|date=November 2013}} [[Litton Industries|Litton]] bought [[Studebaker]]'s Franklin Manufacturing assets, which had been manufacturing magnetrons and building and selling microwave ovens similar to the Radarange. Litton then developed a new configuration of the microwave: the short, wide shape that is now common. The magnetron feed was also unique. This resulted in an oven that could survive a no-load condition: an empty microwave oven where there is nothing to absorb the microwaves. The new oven was shown at a [[trade show]] in Chicago,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and helped begin a rapid growth of the market for home microwave ovens. Sales volume of 40,000 units for the U.S. industry in 1970 grew to one million by 1975. Market penetration was faster in Japan, due to a re-engineered magnetron allowing for less expensive units.\nSeveral other companies joined in the market, and for a time most systems were built by defense contractors, who were most familiar with the magnetron. Litton was particularly well known in the restaurant business.\n\n===Residential use===\nBy 1972, Litton (Litton Atherton Division, Minneapolis) introduced two new microwave ovens, priced at $349 and $399, to tap into the market estimated at $750 million by 1976, according to Robert I Bruder, president of the division.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/14/archives/litton-introduces-microwave-ovens.html Litton Introduces Microwave Ovens].

Often called \"electronic ovens\" in the 1960s, the name \"microwave oven\" later gained currency, and they are now informally called \"microwaves\".]]\n\nFrom the late 1970s, Japanese companies such as [[Sharp Corporation]] manufactured low-cost microwave ovens that were affordable for residential use, leading to the rapid expansion of the microwave oven market in the 1980s. After Japanese dominance for much of the 1980s, with Sharp as market leader, South Korean manufacturers began entering the market in the late 1980s, with [[Samsung]] becoming a major microwave manufacturer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schnaars |first=Steven P. |title=Managing Imitation Strategies |date=2002 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=9781439106372 |page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRmBTp5PKYgC&pg=PT161 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFormerly found only in large industrial applications, microwave ovens increasingly became a standard fixture of residential kitchens in [[Developed country|developed countries]].

Microwaves are a form of [[Non-ionizing radiation|non-ionizing]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] with a [[frequency]] in the so-called  [[Microwave|microwave region]] (300&nbsp;MHz to 300&nbsp;GHz). Microwave ovens use frequencies in one of the [[ISM band|ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands]], which are otherwise used for communication amongst devices that don't need a license to operate, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services.\n\nConsumer ovens work around a nominal 2.45 [[gigahertz]] (GHz) \u2014 a [[wavelength]] of {{convert|12.2|cm|sigfig=3}} in the 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz ISM band\u2014 while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 [[megahertz]] (MHz) \u2014 {{convert|32.8|cm|sigfig=3}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Litton \u2014 For Heat, Tune to 915 or 2450 Megacycles|url=http://www.smecc.org/litton_-_for_heat,_tune_to_915_or_2450_megacycles.htm|work=[[Litton Industries]], 1965|publisher=[[Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation]]|accessdate=12 December 2006|year=2007}}</ref> [[water (molecule)|Water]], fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called [[dielectric heating]]. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, dispersed as molecular rotations, vibrations and/or translations in solids and liquids raises the temperature of the food, in a process similar to heat transfer by contact with a hotter body.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qGTkgFZBJZQC&pg=PA153&dq=microwave+oven+principle#v=onepage&q=microwave%20oven%20principle&f=false|title=The Handy Physics Answer Book|last=Zitzewitz|first=Paul W.|date=1 February 2011|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=9781578593576|language=en}}</ref> It is a common misconception that microwave ovens heat food by operating at a special resonance of water molecules in the food.

For a practical example, milk heats slightly faster than water in a microwave oven, but only because milk solids have less heat capacity than the water they replace.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}</ref> Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves due to the dipole moments of their [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl groups]] or [[ester|ester groups]]. However, due to the lower [[specific heat capacity]] of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens.<ref name=Martin/> This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much in the manner of conventional [[grilling|broiling (UK: grilling)]], braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.\n\nMicrowave heating can cause localized [[thermal runaway]]s in some materials with low thermal conductivity which also have dielectric constants that increase with temperature. An example is glass, which can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave to the point of melting if preheated. Additionally, microwaves can melt certain types of rocks, producing small quantities of molten rock.  Some ceramics can also be melted, and may even become clear upon cooling. Thermal runaway is more typical of electrically conductive liquids such as salty water.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Jerby |first1=Eli |last2=Meir |first2=Yehuda |last3=Faran |first3=Mubarak |title=Basalt Melting by Localized-Microwave Thermal-Runaway Instability |doi=10.13140/2.1.4346.1126 |url=https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~jerby/Jerby_Basalt_Ampere-2013_Proc_PDF.pdf |conference=14th International Conference on Microwave and High Frequency Heating, AMPERE-2013|location=Nottingham, UK|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother misconception is that microwave ovens cook food \"from the inside out\", meaning from the center of the entire mass of food outwards. This idea arises from heating behavior seen if an absorbent layer of water lies beneath a less absorbent drier layer at the surface of a food; in this case, the deposition of heat energy inside a food can exceed that on its surface. This can also occur if the inner layer has a lower heat capacity than the outer layer causing it to reach a higher temperature, or even if the inner layer is more thermally conductive than the outer layer making it feel hotter despite having a lower temperature. In most cases, however, with uniformly structured or reasonably homogenous food item, microwaves are absorbed in the outer layers of the item at a similar level to that of the inner layers. Depending on water content, the depth of initial heat deposition may be several centimetres or more with microwave ovens, in contrast to [[grilling|broiling/grilling]] (infrared) or convection heating\u2014methods which deposit heat thinly at the food surface. Penetration depth of microwaves is dependent on [[food composition]] and the frequency, with lower microwave frequencies (longer wavelengths) penetrating further.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n== Components ==\n[[File:Magnetron2.jpg|thumb|A magnetron with section removed (magnet is not shown)]]\nA microwave oven consists of:\n\n* a high-voltage power source, commonly a simple [[transformer]] or an electronic [[power converter]], which passes energy to the [[magnetron]]\n* a high-voltage [[capacitor]] connected to the magnetron, transformer and via a [[diode]] to the chassis\n* a [[cavity magnetron]], which converts high-voltage electric energy to microwave radiation\n* a magnetron control circuit (usually with a [[microcontroller]])\n* a short [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] (to couple microwave power from the magnetron into the cooking chamber)\n* a metal cooking chamber\n* a turntable and/or metal wave guide stirring fan.\n* a control panel\n\nIn most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. (One variant of the GE Spacemaker had two taps on the transformer primary, for high and low power modes.) Usually choice of power level doesn't affect intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale [[duty cycle]]. Newer models use ''inverter'' power supplies that use [[pulse-width modulation]] to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power settings, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/home-garden/microwave-inverter-7aa31c20fe8a2c52|title=What Is a Microwave Inverter?|publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.panasonic.com/caribbean/consumer/home-appliances/cooking-learn/technology/what_s-an-inverter-.html|title= What's an Inverter? |publisher=Panasonic.com |accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/opinion/columnists/a-notable-advance-in-microwave-technology-135137/|title=A notable advance in microwave technology|work=[[The Telegram]]|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microwave frequencies used in microwave ovens are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The first is that they should be in one of the [[ISM band|industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band]]s set aside for unlicensed purposes. For household purposes, 2.45&nbsp;GHz has the advantage over 915&nbsp;MHz in that 915&nbsp;MHz is only an ISM band in some countries ([[ITU Region]] 2) while 2.45&nbsp;GHz is available worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Three additional ISM bands exist in the microwave frequencies, but are not used for microwave cooking. \nTwo of them are centered on 5.8&nbsp;GHz and 24.125&nbsp;GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies.{{cn|date=May 2019}} \nThe third, centered on 433.92&nbsp;MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe cooking chamber is similar to a [[Faraday cage]] to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no continuous metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, [[Waveguide flange#Choke connection|choke connections]] on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2&nbsp;cm for the usual 2.45&nbsp;GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while [[visible light]] (with its much shorter wavelength) can.\n\n=== Control panel ===\nModern microwave ovens use either an analog dial-type [[timer]] or a digital [[Control panel (engineering)|control panel]] for operation. Control panels feature an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display, in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions, numeric buttons for entering the cook time, a power level selection feature and other possible functions such as a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types, such as meat, [[Fish as food|fish]], poultry, vegetables, [[frozen vegetables]], [[frozen dinners]], and [[popcorn]].\n\nPower settings are commonly implemented, not by actually varying the effect, but by repeatedly turning the power off and on. The highest setting thus represents continuous power. Defrost might represent power for two seconds followed by no power for five seconds. An audible warning such as a bell or a beeper is usually present to indicate that cooking has completed.\n\nMicrowave control panels are often considered awkward to use and are frequently employed as examples for user interface design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/13/microwave-oven-user-interface-digital-complicated |title=User Interfaces: Why are Microwave Ovens All So Difficult to Use?|work=[[The Guardian]]|date= 13 July 2015|accessdate= 4 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Variants and accessories ===\n[[File:TW Panasonic NN-SV30 2012-01.jpg|thumb|A microwave oven with [[Convection microwave|convection]] feature]]\nA variant of the conventional microwave is the convection microwave. A convection microwave oven is a combination of a standard microwave and a [[convection oven]]. It allows food to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned or crisped, as from a convection oven. Convection microwaves are more expensive than conventional microwave ovens. Some convection microwaves\u2014those with exposed heating elements\u2014can produce smoke and burning odors as food spatter from earlier microwave-only use is burned off the heating elements. Some ovens use high speed air; these are known as impingement ovens and are designed to cook food quickly in restaurants, but cost more and consume more power.\n\nIn 2000, some manufacturers began offering high power [[quartz]] [[halogen bulb]]s to their convection microwave models,<ref>{{cite news|last= Fabricant |first= Florence |title= Son of Microwave: Fast and Crisp |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/27/dining/test-kitchen-son-of-microwave-fast-and-crisp.html |date=27 September 2000|accessdate=6 January 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> marketing them under names such as \"Speedcook\", \"[[Advantium]]\", \"Lightwave\" and \"Optimawave\" to emphasize their ability to cook food rapidly and with good browning. The bulbs heat the food's surface with [[infrared]] (IR) radiation, browning surfaces as in a conventional oven. The food browns while also being heated by the microwave radiation and heated through conduction through contact with heated air. The IR energy which is delivered to the outer surface of food by the lamps is sufficient to initiate browning [[caramelization]] in foods primarily made up of carbohydrates and [[Maillard reaction]]s in foods primarily made up of protein. These reactions in food produce a texture and taste similar to that typically expected of conventional oven cooking rather than the bland boiled and steamed taste that microwave-only cooking tends to create.\n\nIn order to aid [[browning (food process)|browning]], sometimes an accessory browning tray is used, usually composed of glass or [[porcelain]]. It makes food crisp by [[Redox|oxidizing]] the top layer until it turns [[Browning (chemical process)|brown]]. Ordinary plastic [[Cookware and bakeware|cookware]] is unsuitable for this purpose because it could melt.\n\n[[Frozen dinner]]s, pies, and [[microwave popcorn]] bags often contain a [[susceptor]] made from thin [[Metallised film|aluminium film]] in the packaging or included on a small paper tray. The metal film absorbs microwave energy efficiently and consequently becomes extremely hot and radiates in the infrared, concentrating the heating of oil for popcorn or even browning surfaces of frozen foods. Heating packages or trays containing susceptors are designed for a single use and are then discarded as waste.\n\n== Heating characteristics ==\n[[File:Microwave tunnel closeup.jpg|thumb|In addition to their use in heating food, microwave ovens are widely used for heating in industrial processes. A microwave tunnel oven for softening plastic rods prior to extrusion.]]\n\nMicrowave ovens produce heat directly within the food, but despite the common misconception that microwaved food cooks from the inside out, 2.45 GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}} into most foods. The inside portions of thicker foods are mainly heated by heat conducted from the outer {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}}.<ref name=P\u00fcschner>{{cite web |title=Microwave Technology Penetration Depths |url=http://www.pueschner.com/en/microwave-technology/penetration-depths |website=pueschner.com |publisher=P\u00fcschner GMBH + CO KG MicrowavePowerSystems |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"FDA\">{{cite web |last1=Health |first1=Center for Devices and Radiological |title=Resources for You (Radiation-Emitting Products) - Microwave Oven Radiation |url=https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ResourcesforYouRadiationEmittingProducts/ucm252762.htm |website=fda.gov |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en |date=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nUneven heating in microwaved food can be partly due to the uneven distribution of microwave energy inside the oven, and partly due to the different rates of energy absorption in different parts of the food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that [[Reflection (physics)|reflects]] microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of [[thermal paper]] in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://maartenrutgers.org/fun/microwave/microwave.html#fax | title = Physics inside a Microwave Oven | at = sec. \"Finding the hot spots in your microwave with fax paper\" | first = Maarten | last = Rutgers | date = 1999 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030720183703/http://maartenrutgers.org/fun/microwave/microwave.html | archivedate = 20 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe second problem is due to food composition and geometry, and must be addressed by the cook, by arranging the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically testing and [[RF shielding|shielding]] any parts of the food that overheat. In some materials with low [[thermal conductivity]], where [[dielectric constant]] increases with temperature, microwave heating can cause localized [[thermal runaway]]. Under certain conditions, glass can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave to the point of melting.<ref>{{YouTube|id=cskB5c0mJ58#t=98s|title=Video of microwave effects}}</ref>\n\nDue to this phenomenon, microwave ovens set at too-high power levels may even start to cook the edges of frozen food while the inside of the food remains frozen. Another case of uneven heating can be observed in baked goods containing berries. In these items, the berries absorb more energy than the drier surrounding bread and cannot dissipate the heat due to the low thermal conductivity of the bread. Often this results in overheating the berries relative to the rest of the food. \"Defrost\" oven settings either use low power levels or turn the power off and on repeatedly - designed to allow time for heat to be conducted within frozen foods from areas that absorb heat more readily to those which heat more slowly. In turntable-equipped ovens, more even heating will take place{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} by placing food off-centre on the turntable tray instead of exactly in the centre, so that no part of the food item will be continuously unheated by the center \"dead zone\".\n\nThere are microwave ovens on the market that allow full-power defrosting.  They do this by exploiting the properties of the electromagnetic radiation [[LSM mode]]s. LSM full-power defrosting may actually achieve more even results than slow defrosting.<ref>P Risman, \"Advanced topics in microwave heating uniformity\", pp. 76-77, in, M W Lorence, P S Pesheck (eds), ''Development of Packaging and Products for Use in Microwave Ovens'', Elsevier, 2009 {{ISBN|1845696573}}.</ref>\n\nMicrowave heating can be deliberately uneven by design. Some microwavable packages (notably pies) may include materials that contain [[ceramic]] or aluminium flakes, which are designed to absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas. Such ceramic patches affixed to cardboard are positioned next to the food, and are typically smokey blue or gray in colour, usually making them easily identifiable; the cardboard sleeves included with [[Hot Pockets]], which have a silver surface on the inside, are a good example of such packaging. Microwavable cardboard packaging may also contain overhead ceramic patches which function in the same way. The technical term for such a microwave-absorbing patch is a [[susceptor]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Labuza | first = T | author2 = Meister | title = An Alternate Method for Measuring the Heating Potential of Microwave Susceptor Films | journal = J.

Taking a pot off a stove, unless it is an [[induction cooktop]], leaves a potentially dangerous heating element or [[trivet]] that will stay hot for some time. Likewise, when taking a [[casserole]] out of a conventional oven, one's arms are exposed to the very hot walls of the oven.  A microwave oven does not pose this problem.\n\nFood and cookware taken out of a microwave oven are rarely much hotter than {{convert|100|C}}. Cookware used in a microwave oven is often much cooler than the food because the cookware is transparent to microwaves; the microwaves heat the food directly and the cookware is indirectly heated by the food. Food and cookware from a conventional oven, on the other hand, are the same temperature as the rest of the oven; a typical cooking temperature is {{convert|180|C}}.  That means that conventional stoves and ovens can cause more serious burns.\n\nThe lower temperature of cooking (the boiling point of water) is a significant safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and [[char]], which are [[carcinogenic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrm.org/health/reports/worst_grill.html |title=The Five Worst Foods to Grill |publisher=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230043041/http://www.pcrm.org/health/reports/worst_grill.html |archivedate=30 December 2010 }}</ref> Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content.

That is, the liquid reaches a temperature slightly above its normal boiling point without bubbles of vapour forming inside the liquid. The boiling process can start [[steam explosion|explosively]] when the liquid is disturbed, such as when the user takes hold of the container to remove it from the oven or while adding solid ingredients such as powdered creamer or sugar. This can result in spontaneous boiling ([[nucleation]]) which may be violent enough to eject the boiling liquid from the container and cause severe [[scalding]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Beaty|first=William J.|title=High Voltage in your Kitchen: Unwise Microwave Oven Experiments|url=http://amasci.com/weird/microwave/voltage3.html#dirt|publisher=Amasci.com|accessdate=21 January 2006}}</ref>\n\nClosed containers, such as [[egg (food)|egg]]s, can explode when heated in a microwave oven due to the increased pressure from [[steam]]. Intact fresh egg yolks outside the shell will also explode, as a result  of superheating. Insulating plastic foams of all types generally contain closed air pockets, and are generally not recommended for use in a microwave, as the air pockets explode and the foam (which can be toxic if consumed) may melt. Not all plastics are microwave-safe, and some plastics absorb microwaves to the point that they may become dangerously hot.\n\nProducts that are heated for too long can catch fire. Though this is inherent to any form of cooking, the rapid cooking and unattended nature of the use of microwave ovens results in additional hazard.\n\n=== Metal objects ===\nAny metal or conductive object placed into the microwave will act as an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] to some degree, resulting in an electric [[alternating current|current]]. This causes the object to act as a [[ohmic heating|heating]] element. This effect varies with the object's shape and composition, and is sometimes utilized for cooking.\n\nAny object containing pointed metal can create an [[electric arc]] (sparks) when microwaved. This includes [[cutlery]], crumpled [[aluminium foil]] (though some foil used in microwaves is safe, see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire, or into a pointed shape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conagrafoods.com/utilities/mwbasics.jsp?cookietest=true|title=Microwave cooking|at=sec. \"Q: What is a microwave-safe plate or container?\"|website=ConagraFoods.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330102812/http://www.conagrafoods.com/utilities/mwbasics.jsp?cookietest=true|archive-date=30 March 2012|access-date=25 October 2009}}</ref> Forks are a good example: the [[Tine (structural)|tine]]s of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This has the effect of exceeding the [[dielectric breakdown]] of air, about 3 [[volt|megavolt]]s per meter (3\u00d710<sup>6</sup> V/m). The air forms a conductive [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.\n\n[[File:Microwave metal shelf.JPG|thumb|A microwave oven with a metal shelf]]\n\nIt is possible for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks can be part of the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.\n\n[[File:RainbowDVD.jpg|thumb|A microwaved [[DVD-R]] disc showing the effects of electrical discharge through its metal film]]\nThe effect of microwaving thin metal films can be seen clearly on a [[Compact disc|Compact Disc]] or [[DVD]] (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, [[porcelain]] with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough to be used in microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microwave Ovens and Food Safety |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Microwave_Ovens_and_Food_Safety.pdf |work=[[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |accessdate=10 August 2011 |date=October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108064919/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Microwave_Ovens_and_Food_Safety.pdf |archivedate=8 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAnother hazard is the resonance of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object to absorb the radiation, a [[standing wave]] will form. The energy is reflected back and forth between the tube and the cooking chamber. This may cause the tube to overload and burn out. High reflected power may also cause magnetron arcing, possibly resulting in primary power fuse failure, though such a causal relationship isn't easily established. Thus, [[dehydrated food]], or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.\n\nCertain foods such as grapes, if properly arranged, can produce an [[electric arc]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Popa|first=Adrian|title=Re: Why do grapes spark in the microwave?|url=http://madsci.org/posts/archives/dec97/882909591.Ph.r.html|publisher=[[MadSci Network]]|accessdate=23 February 2006|date=23 December 1997}}</ref> Prolonged arcing from food carries similar risks to arcing from other sources as noted above.\n\nSome other objects that may conduct sparks are plastic/holographic print thermoses (such as [[Starbucks]] novelty cups) or cups with metal lining. If any bit of the metal is exposed, all the outer shell will burst off the object or melt.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe high electrical fields generated inside a microwave often can be illustrated by placing a [[radiometer]] or neon glow-bulb inside the cooking chamber, creating glowing plasma inside the low-pressure bulb of the device.\n\n=== Direct microwave exposure ===\n{{Further|Microwave burn|Microwave#Effects on health}}\nDirect microwave exposure is not generally possible, as microwaves emitted by the source in a microwave oven are confined in the oven by the material out of which the oven is constructed.

Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer {{nowrap|25\u201338 mm}}  {{nowrap|(1\u20131.5 inches)}} of a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]], high water content food item.\n\nThe development of the [[cavity magnetron]] made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength ([[microwaves]]). American engineer [[Percy Spencer]] is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after [[World War II]] from [[radar]] technology developed during the war. Named the \"Radarange\", it was first sold in 1946. [[Raytheon]] later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by [[Tappan (brand)|Tappan]] in 1955, but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use. [[Sharp Corporation]] introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable between 1964 and 1966. The countertop microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the [[Amana Corporation]]. After Sharp introduced low-cost microwave ovens affordable for residential use in the late 1970s, their use spread into commercial and residential [[kitchens]] around the world. In addition to their use in cooking food, microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes.\n\nMicrowave ovens are a common [[kitchen appliance]] and are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods. They are also useful for rapid heating of otherwise slowly prepared foodstuffs, which can easily burn or turn lumpy when cooked in conventional pans, such as hot butter, fats, chocolate or [[porridge]]. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperatures to produce [[Maillard reaction]]s. Exceptions occur in rare cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other very oily items (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water.\n\nMicrowave ovens have limited roles in professional cooking,<ref name=\"herve\">{{cite book|first=Herv\u00e9 |last=This|title= R\u00e9v\u00e9lations gastronomiques|language=French|publisher= \u00c9ditions Belin|isbn=978-2-7011-1756-0|year=1995}}</ref> because the boiling-range temperatures of a microwave will not produce the flavorful chemical reactions that frying, browning, or baking at a higher temperature will.

This resulted in an oven that could survive a no-load condition: an empty microwave oven where there is nothing to absorb the microwaves. The new oven was shown at a [[trade show]] in Chicago,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and helped begin a rapid growth of the market for home microwave ovens. Sales volume of 40,000 units for the U.S. industry in 1970 grew to one million by 1975. Market penetration was faster in Japan, due to a re-engineered magnetron allowing for less expensive units.\nSeveral other companies joined in the market, and for a time most systems were built by defense contractors, who were most familiar with the magnetron. Litton was particularly well known in the restaurant business.\n\n===Residential use===\nBy 1972, Litton (Litton Atherton Division, Minneapolis) introduced two new microwave ovens, priced at $349 and $399, to tap into the market estimated at $750 million by 1976, according to Robert I Bruder, president of the division.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/14/archives/litton-introduces-microwave-ovens.html Litton Introduces Microwave Ovens].

Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, dispersed as molecular rotations, vibrations and/or translations in solids and liquids raises the temperature of the food, in a process similar to heat transfer by contact with a hotter body.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qGTkgFZBJZQC&pg=PA153&dq=microwave+oven+principle#v=onepage&q=microwave%20oven%20principle&f=false|title=The Handy Physics Answer Book|last=Zitzewitz|first=Paul W.|date=1 February 2011|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=9781578593576|language=en}}</ref> It is a common misconception that microwave ovens heat food by operating at a special resonance of water molecules in the food.

For a practical example, milk heats slightly faster than water in a microwave oven, but only because milk solids have less heat capacity than the water they replace.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}</ref> Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves due to the dipole moments of their [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl groups]] or [[ester|ester groups]]. However, due to the lower [[specific heat capacity]] of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens.<ref name=Martin/> This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much in the manner of conventional [[grilling|broiling (UK: grilling)]], braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.\n\nMicrowave heating can cause localized [[thermal runaway]]s in some materials with low thermal conductivity which also have dielectric constants that increase with temperature. An example is glass, which can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave to the point of melting if preheated. Additionally, microwaves can melt certain types of rocks, producing small quantities of molten rock.  Some ceramics can also be melted, and may even become clear upon cooling. Thermal runaway is more typical of electrically conductive liquids such as salty water.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Jerby |first1=Eli |last2=Meir |first2=Yehuda |last3=Faran |first3=Mubarak |title=Basalt Melting by Localized-Microwave Thermal-Runaway Instability |doi=10.13140/2.1.4346.1126 |url=https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~jerby/Jerby_Basalt_Ampere-2013_Proc_PDF.pdf |conference=14th International Conference on Microwave and High Frequency Heating, AMPERE-2013|location=Nottingham, UK|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother misconception is that microwave ovens cook food \"from the inside out\", meaning from the center of the entire mass of food outwards. This idea arises from heating behavior seen if an absorbent layer of water lies beneath a less absorbent drier layer at the surface of a food; in this case, the deposition of heat energy inside a food can exceed that on its surface. This can also occur if the inner layer has a lower heat capacity than the outer layer causing it to reach a higher temperature, or even if the inner layer is more thermally conductive than the outer layer making it feel hotter despite having a lower temperature. In most cases, however, with uniformly structured or reasonably homogenous food item, microwaves are absorbed in the outer layers of the item at a similar level to that of the inner layers. Depending on water content, the depth of initial heat deposition may be several centimetres or more with microwave ovens, in contrast to [[grilling|broiling/grilling]] (infrared) or convection heating\u2014methods which deposit heat thinly at the food surface. Penetration depth of microwaves is dependent on [[food composition]] and the frequency, with lower microwave frequencies (longer wavelengths) penetrating further.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n== Components ==\n[[File:Magnetron2.jpg|thumb|A magnetron with section removed (magnet is not shown)]]\nA microwave oven consists of:\n\n* a high-voltage power source, commonly a simple [[transformer]] or an electronic [[power converter]], which passes energy to the [[magnetron]]\n* a high-voltage [[capacitor]] connected to the magnetron, transformer and via a [[diode]] to the chassis\n* a [[cavity magnetron]], which converts high-voltage electric energy to microwave radiation\n* a magnetron control circuit (usually with a [[microcontroller]])\n* a short [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] (to couple microwave power from the magnetron into the cooking chamber)\n* a metal cooking chamber\n* a turntable and/or metal wave guide stirring fan.\n* a control panel\n\nIn most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. (One variant of the GE Spacemaker had two taps on the transformer primary, for high and low power modes.) Usually choice of power level doesn't affect intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale [[duty cycle]]. Newer models use ''inverter'' power supplies that use [[pulse-width modulation]] to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power settings, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/home-garden/microwave-inverter-7aa31c20fe8a2c52|title=What Is a Microwave Inverter?|publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.panasonic.com/caribbean/consumer/home-appliances/cooking-learn/technology/what_s-an-inverter-.html|title= What's an Inverter? |publisher=Panasonic.com |accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/opinion/columnists/a-notable-advance-in-microwave-technology-135137/|title=A notable advance in microwave technology|work=[[The Telegram]]|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microwave frequencies used in microwave ovens are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The first is that they should be in one of the [[ISM band|industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band]]s set aside for unlicensed purposes. For household purposes, 2.45&nbsp;GHz has the advantage over 915&nbsp;MHz in that 915&nbsp;MHz is only an ISM band in some countries ([[ITU Region]] 2) while 2.45&nbsp;GHz is available worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Three additional ISM bands exist in the microwave frequencies, but are not used for microwave cooking. \nTwo of them are centered on 5.8&nbsp;GHz and 24.125&nbsp;GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies.{{cn|date=May 2019}} \nThe third, centered on 433.92&nbsp;MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe cooking chamber is similar to a [[Faraday cage]] to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no continuous metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, [[Waveguide flange#Choke connection|choke connections]] on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2&nbsp;cm for the usual 2.45&nbsp;GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while [[visible light]] (with its much shorter wavelength) can.\n\n=== Control panel ===\nModern microwave ovens use either an analog dial-type [[timer]] or a digital [[Control panel (engineering)|control panel]] for operation. Control panels feature an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display, in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions, numeric buttons for entering the cook time, a power level selection feature and other possible functions such as a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types, such as meat, [[Fish as food|fish]], poultry, vegetables, [[frozen vegetables]], [[frozen dinners]], and [[popcorn]].\n\nPower settings are commonly implemented, not by actually varying the effect, but by repeatedly turning the power off and on. The highest setting thus represents continuous power. Defrost might represent power for two seconds followed by no power for five seconds. An audible warning such as a bell or a beeper is usually present to indicate that cooking has completed.\n\nMicrowave control panels are often considered awkward to use and are frequently employed as examples for user interface design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/13/microwave-oven-user-interface-digital-complicated |title=User Interfaces: Why are Microwave Ovens All So Difficult to Use?|work=[[The Guardian]]|date= 13 July 2015|accessdate= 4 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Variants and accessories ===\n[[File:TW Panasonic NN-SV30 2012-01.jpg|thumb|A microwave oven with [[Convection microwave|convection]] feature]]\nA variant of the conventional microwave is the convection microwave. A convection microwave oven is a combination of a standard microwave and a [[convection oven]]. It allows food to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned or crisped, as from a convection oven. Convection microwaves are more expensive than conventional microwave ovens. Some convection microwaves\u2014those with exposed heating elements\u2014can produce smoke and burning odors as food spatter from earlier microwave-only use is burned off the heating elements. Some ovens use high speed air; these are known as impingement ovens and are designed to cook food quickly in restaurants, but cost more and consume more power.\n\nIn 2000, some manufacturers began offering high power [[quartz]] [[halogen bulb]]s to their convection microwave models,<ref>{{cite news|last= Fabricant |first= Florence |title= Son of Microwave: Fast and Crisp |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/27/dining/test-kitchen-son-of-microwave-fast-and-crisp.html |date=27 September 2000|accessdate=6 January 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> marketing them under names such as \"Speedcook\", \"[[Advantium]]\", \"Lightwave\" and \"Optimawave\" to emphasize their ability to cook food rapidly and with good browning. The bulbs heat the food's surface with [[infrared]] (IR) radiation, browning surfaces as in a conventional oven. The food browns while also being heated by the microwave radiation and heated through conduction through contact with heated air. The IR energy which is delivered to the outer surface of food by the lamps is sufficient to initiate browning [[caramelization]] in foods primarily made up of carbohydrates and [[Maillard reaction]]s in foods primarily made up of protein. These reactions in food produce a texture and taste similar to that typically expected of conventional oven cooking rather than the bland boiled and steamed taste that microwave-only cooking tends to create.\n\nIn order to aid [[browning (food process)|browning]], sometimes an accessory browning tray is used, usually composed of glass or [[porcelain]]. It makes food crisp by [[Redox|oxidizing]] the top layer until it turns [[Browning (chemical process)|brown]]. Ordinary plastic [[Cookware and bakeware|cookware]] is unsuitable for this purpose because it could melt.\n\n[[Frozen dinner]]s, pies, and [[microwave popcorn]] bags often contain a [[susceptor]] made from thin [[Metallised film|aluminium film]] in the packaging or included on a small paper tray. The metal film absorbs microwave energy efficiently and consequently becomes extremely hot and radiates in the infrared, concentrating the heating of oil for popcorn or even browning surfaces of frozen foods. Heating packages or trays containing susceptors are designed for a single use and are then discarded as waste.\n\n== Heating characteristics ==\n[[File:Microwave tunnel closeup.jpg|thumb|In addition to their use in heating food, microwave ovens are widely used for heating in industrial processes. A microwave tunnel oven for softening plastic rods prior to extrusion.]]\n\nMicrowave ovens produce heat directly within the food, but despite the common misconception that microwaved food cooks from the inside out, 2.45 GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}} into most foods. The inside portions of thicker foods are mainly heated by heat conducted from the outer {{convert|1|cm|sp=us}}.<ref name=P\u00fcschner>{{cite web |title=Microwave Technology Penetration Depths |url=http://www.pueschner.com/en/microwave-technology/penetration-depths |website=pueschner.com |publisher=P\u00fcschner GMBH + CO KG MicrowavePowerSystems |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"FDA\">{{cite web |last1=Health |first1=Center for Devices and Radiological |title=Resources for You (Radiation-Emitting Products) - Microwave Oven Radiation |url=https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ResourcesforYouRadiationEmittingProducts/ucm252762.htm |website=fda.gov |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en |date=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nUneven heating in microwaved food can be partly due to the uneven distribution of microwave energy inside the oven, and partly due to the different rates of energy absorption in different parts of the food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that [[Reflection (physics)|reflects]] microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of [[thermal paper]] in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://maartenrutgers.org/fun/microwave/microwave.html#fax | title = Physics inside a Microwave Oven | at = sec. \"Finding the hot spots in your microwave with fax paper\" | first = Maarten | last = Rutgers | date = 1999 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030720183703/http://maartenrutgers.org/fun/microwave/microwave.html | archivedate = 20 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe second problem is due to food composition and geometry, and must be addressed by the cook, by arranging the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically testing and [[RF shielding|shielding]] any parts of the food that overheat. In some materials with low [[thermal conductivity]], where [[dielectric constant]] increases with temperature, microwave heating can cause localized [[thermal runaway]]. Under certain conditions, glass can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave to the point of melting.<ref>{{YouTube|id=cskB5c0mJ58#t=98s|title=Video of microwave effects}}</ref>\n\nDue to this phenomenon, microwave ovens set at too-high power levels may even start to cook the edges of frozen food while the inside of the food remains frozen. Another case of uneven heating can be observed in baked goods containing berries. In these items, the berries absorb more energy than the drier surrounding bread and cannot dissipate the heat due to the low thermal conductivity of the bread. Often this results in overheating the berries relative to the rest of the food. \"Defrost\" oven settings either use low power levels or turn the power off and on repeatedly - designed to allow time for heat to be conducted within frozen foods from areas that absorb heat more readily to those which heat more slowly. In turntable-equipped ovens, more even heating will take place{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} by placing food off-centre on the turntable tray instead of exactly in the centre, so that no part of the food item will be continuously unheated by the center \"dead zone\".\n\nThere are microwave ovens on the market that allow full-power defrosting.  They do this by exploiting the properties of the electromagnetic radiation [[LSM mode]]s. LSM full-power defrosting may actually achieve more even results than slow defrosting.<ref>P Risman, \"Advanced topics in microwave heating uniformity\", pp. 76-77, in, M W Lorence, P S Pesheck (eds), ''Development of Packaging and Products for Use in Microwave Ovens'', Elsevier, 2009 {{ISBN|1845696573}}.</ref>\n\nMicrowave heating can be deliberately uneven by design. Some microwavable packages (notably pies) may include materials that contain [[ceramic]] or aluminium flakes, which are designed to absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas. Such ceramic patches affixed to cardboard are positioned next to the food, and are typically smokey blue or gray in colour, usually making them easily identifiable; the cardboard sleeves included with [[Hot Pockets]], which have a silver surface on the inside, are a good example of such packaging. Microwavable cardboard packaging may also contain overhead ceramic patches which function in the same way. The technical term for such a microwave-absorbing patch is a [[susceptor]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Labuza | first = T | author2 = Meister | title = An Alternate Method for Measuring the Heating Potential of Microwave Susceptor Films | journal = J.

Taking a pot off a stove, unless it is an [[induction cooktop]], leaves a potentially dangerous heating element or [[trivet]] that will stay hot for some time. Likewise, when taking a [[casserole]] out of a conventional oven, one's arms are exposed to the very hot walls of the oven.  A microwave oven does not pose this problem.\n\nFood and cookware taken out of a microwave oven are rarely much hotter than {{convert|100|C}}. Cookware used in a microwave oven is often much cooler than the food because the cookware is transparent to microwaves; the microwaves heat the food directly and the cookware is indirectly heated by the food. Food and cookware from a conventional oven, on the other hand, are the same temperature as the rest of the oven; a typical cooking temperature is {{convert|180|C}}.  That means that conventional stoves and ovens can cause more serious burns.\n\nThe lower temperature of cooking (the boiling point of water) is a significant safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and [[char]], which are [[carcinogenic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrm.org/health/reports/worst_grill.html |title=The Five Worst Foods to Grill |publisher=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230043041/http://www.pcrm.org/health/reports/worst_grill.html |archivedate=30 December 2010 }}</ref> Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold.

That is, the liquid reaches a temperature slightly above its normal boiling point without bubbles of vapour forming inside the liquid. The boiling process can start [[steam explosion|explosively]] when the liquid is disturbed, such as when the user takes hold of the container to remove it from the oven or while adding solid ingredients such as powdered creamer or sugar. This can result in spontaneous boiling ([[nucleation]]) which may be violent enough to eject the boiling liquid from the container and cause severe [[scalding]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Beaty|first=William J.|title=High Voltage in your Kitchen: Unwise Microwave Oven Experiments|url=http://amasci.com/weird/microwave/voltage3.html#dirt|publisher=Amasci.com|accessdate=21 January 2006}}</ref>\n\nClosed containers, such as [[egg (food)|egg]]s, can explode when heated in a microwave oven due to the increased pressure from [[steam]]. Intact fresh egg yolks outside the shell will also explode, as a result  of superheating. Insulating plastic foams of all types generally contain closed air pockets, and are generally not recommended for use in a microwave, as the air pockets explode and the foam (which can be toxic if consumed) may melt. Not all plastics are microwave-safe, and some plastics absorb microwaves to the point that they may become dangerously hot.\n\nProducts that are heated for too long can catch fire. Though this is inherent to any form of cooking, the rapid cooking and unattended nature of the use of microwave ovens results in additional hazard.\n\n=== Metal objects ===\nAny metal or conductive object placed into the microwave will act as an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] to some degree, resulting in an electric [[alternating current|current]]. This causes the object to act as a [[ohmic heating|heating]] element. This effect varies with the object's shape and composition, and is sometimes utilized for cooking.\n\nAny object containing pointed metal can create an [[electric arc]] (sparks) when microwaved. This includes [[cutlery]], crumpled [[aluminium foil]] (though some foil used in microwaves is safe, see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire, or into a pointed shape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conagrafoods.com/utilities/mwbasics.jsp?cookietest=true|title=Microwave cooking|at=sec. \"Q: What is a microwave-safe plate or container?\"|website=ConagraFoods.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330102812/http://www.conagrafoods.com/utilities/mwbasics.jsp?cookietest=true|archive-date=30 March 2012|access-date=25 October 2009}}</ref> Forks are a good example: the [[Tine (structural)|tine]]s of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This has the effect of exceeding the [[dielectric breakdown]] of air, about 3 [[volt|megavolt]]s per meter (3\u00d710<sup>6</sup> V/m). The air forms a conductive [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.\n\n[[File:Microwave metal shelf.JPG|thumb|A microwave oven with a metal shelf]]\n\nIt is possible for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks can be part of the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.\n\n[[File:RainbowDVD.jpg|thumb|A microwaved [[DVD-R]] disc showing the effects of electrical discharge through its metal film]]\nThe effect of microwaving thin metal films can be seen clearly on a [[Compact disc|Compact Disc]] or [[DVD]] (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, [[porcelain]] with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough to be used in microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microwave Ovens and Food Safety |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Microwave_Ovens_and_Food_Safety.pdf |work=[[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |accessdate=10 August 2011 |date=October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108064919/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Microwave_Ovens_and_Food_Safety.pdf |archivedate=8 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAnother hazard is the resonance of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object to absorb the radiation, a [[standing wave]] will form. The energy is reflected back and forth between the tube and the cooking chamber. This may cause the tube to overload and burn out. High reflected power may also cause magnetron arcing, possibly resulting in primary power fuse failure, though such a causal relationship isn't easily established. Thus, [[dehydrated food]], or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.\n\nCertain foods such as grapes, if properly arranged, can produce an [[electric arc]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Popa|first=Adrian|title=Re: Why do grapes spark in the microwave?|url=http://madsci.org/posts/archives/dec97/882909591.Ph.r.html|publisher=[[MadSci Network]]|accessdate=23 February 2006|date=23 December 1997}}</ref> Prolonged arcing from food carries similar risks to arcing from other sources as noted above.\n\nSome other objects that may conduct sparks are plastic/holographic print thermoses (such as [[Starbucks]] novelty cups) or cups with metal lining. If any bit of the metal is exposed, all the outer shell will burst off the object or melt.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe high electrical fields generated inside a microwave often can be illustrated by placing a [[radiometer]] or neon glow-bulb inside the cooking chamber, creating glowing plasma inside the low-pressure bulb of the device.\n\n=== Direct microwave exposure ===\n{{Further|Microwave burn|Microwave#Effects on health}}\nDirect microwave exposure is not generally possible, as microwaves emitted by the source in a microwave oven are confined in the oven by the material out of which the oven is constructed.

The [[beryllium]] in such oxides is a serious chemical hazard if crushed then inhaled or ingested. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]];{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be handled.

Other issues include melting and flammability.  An alleged issue of release of dioxins into food has been dismissed<ref name=\"harvhealth\" /> as an intentional [[red herring]] distraction from actual safety issues.\n\nSome current plastic containers and food [[plastic wrap|wraps]] are specifically designed to resist radiation from microwaves.

Ponsse Plc develops and manufactures sustainable and innovative harvesting solutions for environmentally friendly [[cut-to-length logging]]. The strong family company is one of the world\u2019s leading forest machine manufacturers <ref>https://seekingalpha.com/article/4286234-ponsse-quality-comes-price-tag</ref>[1], and its customer-oriented operations are still guided by the wishes and needs of forest machine entrepreneurs. The Ponsse company was established by the forest machine entrepreneur [[Einari Vidgr\u00e9n]] in 1970. The company\u2019s roots are deep in the Finnish countryside and Finnish work, but nowadays the company is quite involved in the international market. Today, Ponsse's machines are used at logging sites in approximately 40 countries, and 80 per cent of the company\u2019s net sales come from exports.<ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin\n</ref> All machines are manufactured in the company\u2019s birthplace in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. Ponsse Group employs more than 1,800 people in 10 countries, and the company\u2019s shares are quoted on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic List. \n\n==History==\n===1970s - Early years===\n\nEntrepreneur [[Einari Vidgren]] receives encouraging feedback on machines he has built. He decides to set up a forest machine factory in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. However, help is required by the municipality of Vierem\u00e4 in order to finance the project. A meeting is held by the municipal council, and they vote on the matter. The council approves the proposal with a majority of a single vote. The work is completed by the end of 1970, and Ponsse Plc is established as a result. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_special_edition_en_issuu2_2.2020/37</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Einari places an ad in the [[Helsingin Sanomat]] news paper in order to recruit an engineer for the factory. An application by Jouko Kelppe, a young engineer from [[Salo]], attracts the most attention. Jouko is hired to be the first ever engineer in the history of Ponsse. The manufacturing of the first machine is started in the spring of 1971. A forest machine contractor Eero Vainikainen is in the process of purchasing a [[Volvo]] or [[Valmet]] machine. However, after strong persuasion and visiting the Ponsse factory, he decides to buy the first ever Ponsse machine. The machine is driven out of the factory by Einari in the autumn of 1971. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\nPonsse premieres in the international markets in 1974. A massive storm hits [[Germany]], and a large number of foreign equipment is needed for harvesting the trees felled by the storm. Einari hears that the job is well compensated, and sets out to Germany, accompanied by Finnish loggers and a Ponsse machine. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\n===1980s - Growth and innovation, Ponsse is sold===\n\nMechanized harvesting is increasing worldwide, and heavy machinery is becoming a talking point. The public demands lighter and more eco-friendly machines. Ponsse releases a new model S 15 [[forwarder]] in 1983. The machine is highly advanced at the time, as it is lighter but is still able to carry heavy loads, as well as function on soil with poor bearing capacity. <ref>https://en.wheelsage.org/ponsse/ergo/hs15/pictures/cjbufj</ref> \n\nEinari is not satisfied with the [[grapples]], or [[harvester heads]], used in Ponsse machines. He wants Ponsse to make their own harvester heads. The first product, H520 is not completely trouble-free, and causes many problems for the company. Learning from these mistakes, a new model called H60 is released at the end of 1985. This marks an important step in the expansion of the product family. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin</ref>\n\nOn 16th of December in 1988, Ponsse's entire share capital is transferred to the industrial company called Interpolator Oy, a part of SKOP Group. This makes Ponsse a part of Norcar Group, along with some earlier acquisitions. Einari becomes a board member of Norcar Group, and Einari's brother, Esa Vidgren, is appointed as the managing director of Ponsse Plc. <ref>https://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/art-2000006124591.html</ref>\n\n===1990s - Globalization, Einari buys Ponsse back===\n\nThe computerized Kajaani 2000 loader control system represents the latest trend in the product development of forest machine control systems. In 1992, Ponsse releases two new machines, the HS10 harvester and the S10 forwarder. Einari receives the Finnish National Inventor Prize awarded by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in recognition of his persistent work in the forest machine development. <ref>https://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/art-2000006124591.html</ref>\n\nA group of investors led by Einari purchase Ponsse back from SKOP Group in February 1993. Kajaanin Automatiikka Ky, a company manufacturing information systems in [[Kajaani]], is merged with Ponsse. As a result, Ponsse Opti is launched. Ponsse becomes the first forest machine manufacturer in the world to introduce a PC-based measuring device system in their machines. As a result, Ponsse is rewarded with a [[ISO 9000]]- certification, the first forest machine manufacturer to do so. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_special_edition_en_issuu2_2.2020/37</ref>\n\nThe expansion continues, as the first [[subsidiary]], Ponsse AB, is established in [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], [[Sweden]] in 1994. As the globalization increases, and Ponsse is getting attention from the international markets, subsidiaries are established also in the [[United States]], [[France]], and [[United Kingdom]]. A corporate development also happens, when the public quotation of Ponsse Plc shares on the [[Helsinki Stock Exhange]] begins in 1995.

Ponsse Plc develops and manufactures sustainable and innovative harvesting solutions for environmentally friendly [[cut-to-length logging]]. The strong family company is one of the world\u2019s leading forest machine manufacturers <ref>https://seekingalpha.com/article/4286234-ponsse-quality-comes-price-tag</ref>[1], and its customer-oriented operations are still guided by the wishes and needs of forest machine entrepreneurs. The Ponsse company was established by the forest machine entrepreneur [[Einari Vidgr\u00e9n]] in 1970. The company\u2019s roots are deep in the Finnish countryside and Finnish work, but nowadays the company is quite involved in the international market. Today, Ponsse's machines are used at logging sites in approximately 40 countries, and 80 per cent of the company\u2019s net sales come from exports.<ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin\n</ref> All machines are manufactured in the company\u2019s birthplace in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. Ponsse Group employs more than 1,800 people in 10 countries, and the company\u2019s shares are quoted on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic List. \n\n==History==\n===1970s - Early years===\n\nEntrepreneur [[Einari Vidgren]] receives encouraging feedback on machines he has built. He decides to set up a forest machine factory in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. However, help is required by the municipality of Vierem\u00e4 in order to finance the project. A meeting is held by the municipal council, and they vote on the matter. The council approves the proposal with a majority of a single vote. The work is completed by the end of 1970, and Ponsse Plc is established as a result. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_special_edition_en_issuu2_2.2020/37</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Einari places an ad in the [[Helsingin Sanomat]] news paper in order to recruit an engineer for the factory. An application by Jouko Kelppe, a young engineer from [[Salo]], attracts the most attention. Jouko is hired to be the first ever engineer in the history of Ponsse. The manufacturing of the first machine is started in the spring of 1971. A forest machine contractor Eero Vainikainen is in the process of purchasing a [[Volvo]] or [[Valmet]] machine. However, after strong persuasion and visiting the Ponsse factory, he decides to buy the first ever Ponsse machine. The machine is driven out of the factory by Einari in the autumn of 1971. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\nPonsse premieres in the international markets in 1974. A massive storm hits [[Germany]], and a large number of foreign equipment is needed for harvesting the trees felled by the storm. Einari hears that the job is well compensated, and sets out to Germany, accompanied by Finnish loggers and a Ponsse machine. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\n===1980s - Innovation and growth, Ponsse is sold===\n\nMechanized harvesting is increasing worldwide, and heavy machinery is becoming a talking point. The public demands lighter and more eco-friendly machines. Ponsse releases a new model S 15 [[forwarder]] in 1983. The machine is highly advanced at the time, as it is lighter but is still able to carry heavy loads, as well as function on soil with poor bearing capacity. <ref>https://en.wheelsage.org/ponsse/ergo/hs15/pictures/cjbufj</ref> \n\nEinari is not satisfied with the [[grapples]], or [[harvester heads]], used in Ponsse machines. He wants Ponsse to make their own harvester heads. The first product, H520 is not completely trouble-free, and causes many problems for the company. Learning from these mistakes, a new model called H60 is released at the end of 1985. This marks an important step in the expansion of the product family. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin</ref>\n\nOn 16th of December in 1988, Ponsse's entire share capital is transferred to the industrial company called Interpolator Oy, a part of SKOP Group. This makes Ponsse a part of Norcar Group, along with some earlier acquisitions. Einari becomes a board member of Norcar Group, and Einari's brother, Esa Vidgren, is appointed as the managing director of Ponsse Plc. <ref>https://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/art-2000006124591.html</ref>\n\n===1990s - Globalization, Einari buys Ponsse back===\n\nThe computerized Kajaani 2000 loader control system represents the latest trend in the product development of forest machine control systems. In 1992, Ponsse releases two new machines, the HS10 harvester and the S10 forwarder. Einari receives the Finnish National Inventor Prize awarded by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in recognition of his persistent work in the forest machine development. <ref>https://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/art-2000006124591.html</ref>\n\nA group of investors led by Einari purchase Ponsse back from SKOP Group in February 1993. Kajaanin Automatiikka Ky, a company manufacturing information systems in [[Kajaani]], is merged with Ponsse. As a result, Ponsse Opti is launched. Ponsse becomes the first forest machine manufacturer in the world to introduce a PC-based measuring device system in their machines. As a result, Ponsse is rewarded with a [[ISO 9000]]- certification, the first forest machine manufacturer to do so. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_special_edition_en_issuu2_2.2020/37</ref>\n\nThe expansion continues, as the first [[subsidiary]], Ponsse AB, is established in [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], [[Sweden]] in 1994. As the globalization increases, and Ponsse is getting attention from the international markets, subsidiaries are established also in the [[United States]], [[France]], and [[United Kingdom]]. A corporate development also happens, when the public quotation of Ponsse Plc shares on the [[Helsinki Stock Exhange]] begins in 1995. Two new harvester models are released in 1996, Ergo HS16 and Cobra HS10. <ref>https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/09/24/770564/0/en/Ponsse-operating-in-France-since-1995.html</ref>\n\n===2000s - Aggressive product development, global financial crisis===\n\nPonsse's 30th anniversary party is organized in 2000, and the occasion is used to announce a brand new product family with [[Mercedes Benz]] engines.

He was born in [[Greece]], but his family was exiled from the country when he was an infant. After being educated in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, he joined the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1939, aged 18. From July 1939, he began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth, whom he had first met in 1934. During the [[Second World War]] he served with distinction in the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean]] and [[British Pacific Fleet|Pacific]] Fleets. After the war, Philip was granted permission by [[George VI]] to marry Elizabeth. Before the official announcement of their engagement in July 1947, he abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, became a naturalised [[British subject]], and adopted his maternal grandparents' surname [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]]. He [[Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten|married Elizabeth]] on 20 November 1947. Just before the wedding, he was created [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Earl of Merioneth]] and [[Baron Greenwich]]. Philip left active military service when Elizabeth became queen in 1952, having reached the rank of [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]], and was formally made a [[British prince]] in 1957.\n\nPhilip and Elizabeth have four children: [[Prince Charles]], [[Princess Anne]], [[Prince Andrew]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]]. Through a British [[Order in Council]] issued in 1960, descendants of the couple not bearing royal styles and titles can use the surname [[Mountbatten-Windsor]], which has also been used by some members of the royal family who do hold titles, such as Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward.\n\nA keen sports enthusiast, Philip helped develop the equestrian event of [[carriage driving]]. He is a patron, president, or member of over 780 organisations, and he serves as chairman of [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] for people aged 14 to 24.<ref>{{cite web |title=Do your DofE \u2013 The Duke of Edinburgh's Award |url=https://www.dofe.org/do-your-dofe/ |website=dofe.org |accessdate=29 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129181534/https://www.dofe.org/do-your-dofe/ |archive-date=29 January 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is the longest-serving consort of a reigning British monarch and the oldest ever male member of the [[British royal family]].

He was baptised in the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] rite at [[Old Fortress, Corfu|St. George's Church in the Old Fortress]] in Corfu.\n\nShortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], then known as Louis Mountbatten, [[Marquess of Milford Haven]], died in London. Louis was a naturalised British citizen, who, after a career in the [[Royal Navy]], had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]]\u2014an Anglicised version of [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]]\u2014during the [[World War I|First World War]], owing to [[Anti-German sentiment#First World War|anti-German sentiment]] in the United Kingdom. After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)]].<ref>Brandreth, pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\nThe war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains. On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]], was forced to abdicate and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others. The commander of the army, General [[Georgios Hatzianestis]], and five senior [[Trial of the Six|politicians were executed]].

During the [[Second World War]] he served with distinction in the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean]] and [[British Pacific Fleet|Pacific]] Fleets. After the war, Philip was granted permission by [[George VI]] to marry Elizabeth.

Philip left active military service when Elizabeth became queen in 1952, having reached the rank of [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]], and was formally made a [[British prince]] in 1957.\n\nPhilip and Elizabeth have four children: [[Prince Charles]], [[Princess Anne]], [[Prince Andrew]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]]. Through a British [[Order in Council]] issued in 1960, descendants of the couple not bearing royal styles and titles can use the surname [[Mountbatten-Windsor]], which has also been used by some members of the royal family who do hold titles, such as Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward.\n\nA keen sports enthusiast, Philip helped develop the equestrian event of [[carriage driving]]. He is a patron, president, or member of over 780 organisations, and he serves as chairman of [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] for people aged 14 to 24.<ref>{{cite web |title=Do your DofE \u2013 The Duke of Edinburgh's Award |url=https://www.dofe.org/do-your-dofe/ |website=dofe.org |accessdate=29 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129181534/https://www.dofe.org/do-your-dofe/ |archive-date=29 January 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is the longest-serving consort of a reigning British monarch and the oldest ever male member of the [[British royal family]].

On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]], was forced to abdicate and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others. The commander of the army, General [[Georgios Hatzianestis]], and five senior [[Trial of the Six|politicians were executed]].
