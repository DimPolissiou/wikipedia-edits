They use [[soporific]] drugs to hold a conference call through time and space between themselves, Strax, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], and Clara, in a dream. Vastra repeats DeMarco's words: \"The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave, and it is discovered.\" During their conference, eyeless humanoids called Whisper Men kidnap Vastra and Strax and kill Jenny. The [[Great Intelligence]] tells Clara to tell the Doctor that his friends are \"lost\" unless he goes to Trenzalore.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travel to Trenzalore, the planet holding his future grave, to save his friends. The planet is covered with tombstones, the result of a great war, while a future version of the [[TARDIS]] (having deteriorated and grown to enormous size) stands above the graveyard. The duo are attacked by Whisper Men. An echo of River, still telepathically linked to Clara, helps direct the two to an escape route that leads to the giant TARDIS. Strax, Vastra, and Jenny (who is revived by Strax) are awakened by Whisper Men and meet the Great Intelligence.\n\nThe Great Intelligence threatens to kill the Doctor's allies unless the Doctor says his name to unlock the TARDIS doors. The Doctor refuses, but as he speaks, River says the Doctor's name and unlocks the TARDIS. Inside, the Doctor reveals a pulsating column of light to be his time stream. The Great Intelligence enters it in order to undo the Doctor's past as revenge for all the defeats it has been dealt. The positive effects of the Doctor's travels begin to be nullified by the Intelligence's interference. Jenny and Strax both disappear.\n\nClara remembers the Doctor telling her that she has helped the Doctor in other places in time and space. She enters the time stream to restore the Doctor's timeline. Echoes of Clara fall through space and time and appear in adventures of the Doctor's previous incarnations. The Doctor enters the column of light to save the original Clara, guiding her from a place where she sees several previous incarnations of the Doctor. Reunited, the two spot another figure in the shadows which Clara does not recognise. The Doctor explains the elderly figure is another past incarnation of himself, but what he did in the past was not in the Doctor's name. The figure turns around, revealing himself to be the [[The War Doctor|War Doctor]], the incarnation who fought during the great [[The Time War|Time War]].\n\n===Continuity===\nImagery of the Doctor's prior incarnations is used during scenes in which Clara and the Great Intelligence interact with the Doctor. Footage of the [[First Doctor|First]] (from ''[[The Aztecs (Doctor Who)|The Aztecs]]'', 1964, with dialogue from ''[[The Web Planet]]'', 1965), [[Second Doctor|Second]], [[Third Doctor|Third]] (both from ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', 1983), [[Fourth Doctor|Fourth]] (''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', 1978), [[Fifth Doctor|Fifth]] (''[[Arc of Infinity]]'', 1983), and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] (''[[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire]]'', 1987) Doctors was shown. [[Stunt double]]s were used for some other brief appearances, including the [[Sixth Doctor]] walking past Clara while she is in a corridor. The [[Ninth Doctor]] can also be seen running past her in the Doctor's time stream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/|title=The Name of the Doctor Past References|work=The Doctor Who Site}}</ref> The opening scene also includes a representation of [[Susan Foreman]] and reference to the Doctor's original departure from [[Gallifrey]] (as a globed city, previously seen in \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", and later seen destroyed in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\").\n\nThe Great Intelligence says that the Doctor has been \"bloodsoaked\" several times, talking about the leader of the Sycorax (whom the [[Tenth Doctor]] kills in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"), Solomon the trader (whom the Eleventh Doctor sends to his death in \"[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]\"), the [[Daleks]], and the [[Cybermen]]. The Great Intelligence also states that the Doctor will be known as the [[Valeyard]] before the end of his life. The Valeyard appeared in the 1986 serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', where he is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/05/18/eleven-thoughts-about-doctor-who/|title=Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who: The Name Of The Doctor|last=Johnston|first=Rich|work=bleedingcool.com|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[John Hurt]] makes his first ever appearance as the [[The War Doctor|War Doctor]] at the climax of the episode, foreshadowing the events of [[The Night of the Doctor|\"The Night of the Doctor\"]] and [[The Day of the Doctor|\"The Day of the Doctor\"]], the 50th Anniversary special.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943593585).jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Whisper Men as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nLead writer [[Steven Moffat]] stated that he wanted to have a new monster in the finale, after the series had seen the reappearance of old monsters such as the [[Ice Warrior]]s, Cybermen, and Daleks.

He informed Sontar that the operation was called \"The Name of the Doctor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0192lz9 |title=Strax Field Report: The Name of the Doctor |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=16 May 2013 |work=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> In the second, subtitled \"A Glorious Day Is Almost Upon Us...\", [[Madame Vastra, Jenny Flint and Strax|Strax]] discussed a 'glorious day' in which death was likely.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0195m8j |title=Strax Field Report: A Glorious Day Is Almost Upon Us... |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=18 May 2013 |work=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> The final field report \u2014 \"The Doctor's Greatest Secret\" \u2014 discussed the cliffhanger, commenting that this new [[War Doctor|Doctor]] had the appearance of a warrior.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p019hr50 |title=Strax Field Report: The Doctor's Greatest Secret |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=24 May 2013 |work=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> This was the only field report released after the episode.\n\n===Synopsis===\nIn 1893, [[Madame Vastra]] and [[Jenny Flint]] are given information concerning the Doctor by Clarence DeMarco, in return for a stay on his execution. They use [[soporific]] drugs to hold a conference call through time and space between themselves, Strax, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], and Clara, in a dream. Vastra repeats DeMarco's words: \"The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave, and it is discovered.\" During their conference, eyeless humanoids called Whisper Men kidnap Vastra and Strax and kill Jenny. The [[Great Intelligence]] tells Clara to tell the Doctor that his friends are \"lost\" unless he goes to Trenzalore.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travel to Trenzalore, the planet holding his future grave, to save his friends. The planet is covered with tombstones, the result of a great war, while a future version of the [[TARDIS]] (having deteriorated and grown to enormous size) stands above the graveyard. The duo are attacked by Whisper Men. An echo of River, still telepathically linked to Clara, helps direct the two to an escape route that leads to the giant TARDIS. Strax, Vastra, and Jenny (who is revived by Strax) are awakened by Whisper Men and meet the Great Intelligence.\n\nThe Great Intelligence threatens to kill the Doctor's allies unless the Doctor says his name to unlock the TARDIS doors. The Doctor refuses, but as he speaks, River says the Doctor's name and unlocks the TARDIS. Inside, the Doctor reveals a pulsating column of light to be his time stream. The Great Intelligence enters it in order to undo the Doctor's past as revenge for all the defeats it has been dealt. The positive effects of the Doctor's travels begin to be nullified by the Intelligence's interference. Jenny and Strax both disappear.\n\nClara remembers the Doctor telling her that she has helped the Doctor in other places in time and space. She enters the time stream to restore the Doctor's timeline. Echoes of Clara fall through space and time and appear in adventures of the Doctor's previous incarnations. The Doctor enters the column of light to save the original Clara, guiding her from a place where she sees several previous incarnations of the Doctor. Reunited, the two spot another figure in the shadows which Clara does not recognise. The Doctor explains the elderly figure is another past incarnation of himself, but what he did in the past was not in the Doctor's name. The figure turns around, revealing himself to be the [[The War Doctor|War Doctor]], the incarnation who fought during the great [[The Time War|Time War]].\n\n===Continuity===\nImagery of the Doctor's prior incarnations is used during scenes in which Clara and the Great Intelligence interact with the Doctor. Footage of the [[First Doctor|First]] (from ''[[The Aztecs (Doctor Who)|The Aztecs]]'', 1964, with dialogue from ''[[The Web Planet]]'', 1965), [[Second Doctor|Second]], [[Third Doctor|Third]] (both from ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', 1983), [[Fourth Doctor|Fourth]] (''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', 1978), [[Fifth Doctor|Fifth]] (''[[Arc of Infinity]]'', 1983), and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] (''[[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire]]'', 1987) Doctors was shown. [[Stunt double]]s were used for some other brief appearances, including the [[Sixth Doctor]] walking past Clara while she is in a corridor. The [[Ninth Doctor]] can also be seen running past her in the Doctor's time stream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/|title=The Name of the Doctor Past References|work=The Doctor Who Site}}</ref> The opening scene also includes a representation of [[Susan Foreman]] and reference to the Doctor's original departure from [[Gallifrey]] (as a globed city, previously seen in \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", and later seen destroyed in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\").\n\nThe Great Intelligence says that the Doctor has been \"bloodsoaked\" several times, talking about the leader of the Sycorax (whom the [[Tenth Doctor]] kills in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"), Solomon the trader (whom the Eleventh Doctor sends to his death in \"[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]\"), the [[Daleks]], and the [[Cybermen]]. The Great Intelligence also states that the Doctor will be known as the [[Valeyard]] before the end of his life. The Valeyard appeared in the 1986 serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', where he is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/05/18/eleven-thoughts-about-doctor-who/|title=Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who: The Name Of The Doctor|last=Johnston|first=Rich|work=bleedingcool.com|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943593585).jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Whisper Men as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nLead writer [[Steven Moffat]] stated that he wanted to have a new monster in the finale, after the series had seen the reappearance of old monsters such as the [[Ice Warrior]]s, Cybermen, and Daleks.

[[hunter-gatherers]] were probably very small. Such groups probably made contact with other such bands only rarely. Such isolation would have caused [[epidemic]] diseases to be restricted to any given local population, because propagation and expansion of epidemics depend on frequent contact with other individuals who have not yet developed an adequate [[immune response]]. To persist in such a population, a pathogen either had to be a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] infection, staying present and potentially infectious in the infected host for long periods, or it had to have other additional species as [[natural reservoir|reservoir]] where it can maintain itself until further susceptible hosts are contacted and infected. In fact, for many 'human' diseases, the human is actually better viewed as an accidental or incidental victim and a [[dead-end host]]. Examples include [[rabies]], [[anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[tularemia]] and [[West Nile virus]]. Thus, much of human exposure to infectious disease has been zoonotic.\n[[File:Figure 3- Examples of Zoonotic Diseases and Their Affected Populations (6323431516).jpg|thumb|Possibilities for zoonotic disease transmissions]]\nMany modern diseases, even epidemic diseases, started out as zoonotic diseases. It is hard to establish with certainty which diseases jumped from other animals to humans, but there is increasing evidence from [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] [[sequencing]], that [[measles]], [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[HIV]], and [[diphtheria]] came to humans this way. Various forms of the [[common cold]] and [[tuberculosis]] also are adaptations of strains originating in other species.\n\nZoonoses are of interest because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity. The West Nile virus appeared in the [[United States]] in 1999 in the [[New York City]] area, and moved through the country in the summer of 2002, causing much distress. [[Bubonic plague]] is a zoonotic disease,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A | title = Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health | journal = Crit Rev Microbiol | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 221\u201370 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19548807 | doi = 10.1080/10408410902989837 }}</ref> as are [[salmonellosis]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], and [[Lyme disease]].\n\nA major factor contributing to the appearance of new zoonotic pathogens in human populations is increased contact between humans and wildlife.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Daszak P, Cunningham AA, Hyatt AD | title = Anthropogenic environmental change and the emergence of infectious diseases in wildlife | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 103\u2013116 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11230820 | doi = 10.1016/S0001-706X(00)00179-0 }}</ref> This can be caused either by encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas or by movement of wild animals into areas of human activity. An example of this is the outbreak of [[Henipavirus#Nipah virus|Nipah virus]] in peninsular Malaysia in 1999, when [[intensive pig farming]] began on the habitat of infected fruit bats. Unidentified infection of the pigs amplified the force of infection, eventually transmitting the virus to farmers and causing 105 human deaths.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Field H, Young P, Yob JM, Mills J, Hall L, Mackenzie J | title = The natural history of Hendra and Nipah viruses | journal = Microbes and Infection / Institut Pasteur | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 307\u2013314 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11334748 | doi = 10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01384-3 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, in recent times [[avian influenza]] and West Nile virus have [[Spillover infection|spilled over]] into human populations probably due to interactions between the carrier host and domestic animals. Highly mobile animals such as bats and birds may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission than other animals due to the ease with which they can move into areas of human habitation.\n\nBecause they depend on the human host for part of their life-cycle, diseases such as African [[schistosomiasis]], [[river blindness]], and [[Lymphatic filariasis|elephantiasis]] are ''not'' defined as zoonotic, even though they may depend on transmission by insects or other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]].\n\n== Use in vaccines ==\nThe first vaccine against smallpox by [[Edward Jenner]] in 1800 was by infection of a zoonotic bovine virus which caused a disease called [[cowpox]].  Jenner had noticed that milkmaids were resistant to smallpox.  Milkmaids contracted a milder version of the disease from infected cows that conferred cross immunity to the human disease.  Jenner abstracted an infectious preparation of 'cowpox' and subsequently used it to inoculate persons against smallpox.  As a result, smallpox has been eradicated globally, and mass vaccination against this disease \nceased in 1981.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Conservation medicine}}\n* {{annotated link|Cross-species transmission}}\n* {{annotated link|Emerging infectious disease}}\n* {{annotated link|Foodborne illness}}\n* {{annotated link|Spillover infection}}\n* {{annotated link|Wildlife disease}}\n* {{annotated link|Veterinary medicine}}\n* {{annotated link|List of zoonotic primate viruses}}\n* {{annotated link|Wildlife smuggling and zoonoses}}\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Bardosh, K.

[[hunter-gatherers]] were probably very small. Such groups probably made contact with other such bands only rarely. Such isolation would have caused [[epidemic]] diseases to be restricted to any given local population, because propagation and expansion of epidemics depend on frequent contact with other individuals who have not yet developed an adequate [[immune response]]. To persist in such a population, a pathogen either had to be a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] infection, staying present and potentially infectious in the infected host for long periods, or it had to have other additional species as [[natural reservoir|reservoir]] where it can maintain itself until further susceptible hosts are contacted and infected. In fact, for many 'human' diseases, the human is actually better viewed as an accidental or incidental victim and a [[dead-end host]]. Examples include [[rabies]], [[anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[tularemia]] and [[West Nile virus]]. Thus, much of human exposure to infectious disease has been zoonotic.\n[[File:Figure 3- Examples of Zoonotic Diseases and Their Affected Populations (6323431516).jpg|thumb|Possibilities for zoonotic disease transmissions]]\nMany modern diseases, even epidemic diseases, started out as zoonotic diseases. It is hard to establish with certainty which diseases jumped from other animals to humans, but there is increasing evidence from [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] [[sequencing]], that [[measles]], [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[HIV]], and [[diphtheria]] came to humans this way. Various forms of the [[common cold]] and [[tuberculosis]] also are adaptations of strains originating in other species.\n\nZoonoses are of interest because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity. The West Nile virus appeared in the [[United States]] in 1999 in the [[New York City]] area, and moved through the country in the summer of 2002, causing much distress. [[Bubonic plague]] is a zoonotic disease,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A | title = Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health | journal = Crit Rev Microbiol | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 221\u201370 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19548807 | doi = 10.1080/10408410902989837 }}</ref> as are [[salmonellosis]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], and [[Lyme disease]].\n\nA major factor contributing to the appearance of new zoonotic pathogens in human populations is increased contact between humans and wildlife.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Daszak P, Cunningham AA, Hyatt AD | title = Anthropogenic environmental change and the emergence of infectious diseases in wildlife | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 103\u2013116 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11230820 | doi = 10.1016/S0001-706X(00)00179-0 }}</ref> This can be caused either by encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas or by movement of wild animals into areas of human activity. An example of this is the outbreak of [[Henipavirus#Nipah virus|Nipah virus]] in peninsular Malaysia in 1999, when [[intensive pig farming]] began on the habitat of infected fruit bats. Unidentified infection of the pigs amplified the force of infection, eventually transmitting the virus to farmers and causing 105 human deaths.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Field H, Young P, Yob JM, Mills J, Hall L, Mackenzie J | title = The natural history of Hendra and Nipah viruses | journal = Microbes and Infection / Institut Pasteur | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 307\u2013314 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11334748 | doi = 10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01384-3 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, in recent times [[avian influenza]] and West Nile virus have [[Spillover infection|spilled over]] into human populations probably due to interactions between the carrier host and domestic animals. Highly mobile animals such as bats and birds may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission than other animals due to the ease with which they can move into areas of human habitation.\n\nBecause they depend on the human host for part of their life-cycle, diseases such as African [[schistosomiasis]], [[river blindness]], and [[Lymphatic filariasis|elephantiasis]] are ''not'' defined as zoonotic, even though they may depend on transmission by insects or other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]].\n\n== Use in vaccines ==\nThe first vaccine against smallpox by [[Edward Jenner]] in 1800 was by infection of a zoonotic bovine virus which caused a disease called [[cowpox]].  Jenner had noticed that milkmaids were resistant to smallpox.  Milkmaids contracted a milder version of the disease from infected cows that conferred cross immunity to the human disease.  Jenner abstracted an infectious preparation of 'cowpox' and subsequently used it to inoculate persons against smallpox.  As a result, smallpox has been eradicated globally, and mass vaccination against this disease \nceased in 1981.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Conservation medicine}}\n* {{annotated link|Cross-species transmission}}\n* {{annotated link|Emerging infectious disease}}\n* {{annotated link|Foodborne illness}}\n* {{annotated link|Spillover infection}}\n* {{annotated link|Wildlife disease}}\n* {{annotated link|Veterinary medicine}}\n* {{annotated link|List of zoonotic primate viruses}}\n* {{annotated link|Wildlife smuggling and zoonoses}}\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Bardosh, K.

Some research programs draw from, and build on, the perspectives developed in trans-disciplinary fields such as [[human ecology]], [[ecological anthropology]], [[environmental geography]], [[ecological economics|economics]], as well as others. In contrast, other research programs aim to develop a more quantitative theoretic framework focusing on the development of analytical and numerical models, by building on theoretical advances in [[complex adaptive systems]], [[complexity economics]], [[dynamical system]]s theory, and the [[earth science]]s. To some extent, all CHANS programs recognize the need to move beyond traditional research methods developed in the social and natural sciences, as these are not sufficient to quantify the highly nonlinear dynamics often present in CHANS. Some research into CHANS emulates the more traditional research programs that tended to separate the social from the ecological sciences.<ref name=\"Liu07\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[639:chans]2.0.co;2 |jstor=25547831 |pmid=18240679 |title=Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=639\u201349 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Jianguo |last2=Dietz |first2=Thomas |last3=Carpenter |first3=Stephen R |last4=Folke |first4=Carl |last5=Alberti |first5=Marina |last6=Redman |first6=Charles L |last7=Schneider |first7=Stephen H |last8=Ostrom |first8=Elinor |last9=Pell |first9=Alice N |last10=Lubchenco |first10=Jane |last11=Taylor |first11=William W |last12=Ouyang |first12=Zhiyun |last13=Deadman |first13=Peter |last14=Kratz |first14=Timothy |last15=Provencher |first15=William }}</ref><ref name=\"Liu07b\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1144004 |pmid=17872436 |title=Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5844 |pages=1513\u20136 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=J |last2=Dietz |first2=T |last3=Carpenter |first3=S.

''Liberal'' could refer to \"free in bestowing\" as early as 1387, \"made without stint\" in 1433, \"freely permitted\" in 1530 and \"free from restraint\"\u2014often as a pejorative remark\u2014in the 16th and the 17th centuries.<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> In 16th century [[Kingdom of England|England]], ''liberal'' could have positive or negative attributes in referring to someone's generosity or indiscretion.<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> In ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] wrote of \"a liberal villaine\" who \"hath [...] confest his vile encounters\".<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> With the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the word acquired decisively more positive undertones, being defined as \"free from narrow prejudice\" in 1781 and \"free from bigotry\" in 1823.<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> In 1815, the first use of the word \"liberalism\" appeared in English.<ref>Kirchner, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> In Spain, the ''[[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|liberales]]'', the first group to use the liberal label in a political context,<ref>Colton and Palmer, p. 479.</ref> fought for decades for the implementation of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. From 1820 to 1823 during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'', [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] was compelled by the ''liberales'' to swear to uphold the Constitution. By the middle of the 19th century, ''liberal'' was used as a politicised term for parties and movements worldwide.<ref>Emil J. Kirchner, ''Liberal Parties in Western Europe'', \"Liberal parties were among the first political parties to form, and their long-serving and influential records, as participants in parliaments and governments, raise important questions [...]\", Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32394-9}}.</ref>\n\nOver time, the meaning of the word ''liberalism'' began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'': \"In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies\".<ref>\"Liberalism\", ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref> Consequently, in the United States the ideas of [[individualism]] and ''laissez-faire'' economics previously associated with [[classical liberalism]] became the basis for the emerging school of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] thought<ref>Rothbard, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard121.html ''The Libertarian Heritage: The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism]''.</ref> and are key components of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]].\n\nUnlike Europe and Latin America, the word ''liberalism'' in North America almost exclusively refers to [[social liberalism]]. The dominant Canadian party is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the United States' [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is usually considered liberal.<ref>Puddington, p. 142. \"After a dozen years of centre-left Liberal Party rule, the Conservative Party emerged from the 2006 parliamentary elections with a plurality and established a fragile minority government.\"</ref><ref>Grigsby, pp. 106\u201307.

Its immense scholarly and academic output has been characterised as containing \"richness and diversity\", but that diversity often has meant that liberalism comes in different formulations and presents a challenge to anyone looking for a clear definition.<ref name=\"Young, p. 24\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=24}}.</ref>\n\n=== Major themes ===\n{{Individualism sidebar|expanded=Philosophies}}\nThough all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage, scholars frequently assume that those doctrines contain \"separate and often contradictory streams of thought\".<ref name=\"Young, p. 24\"/> The objectives of [[List of liberal theorists|liberal theorists and philosophers]] have differed across various times, cultures and continents. The diversity of liberalism can be gleaned from the numerous qualifiers that liberal thinkers and movements have attached to the very term \"liberalism\", including [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], [[Economic liberalism|economic]], [[Social liberalism|social]], [[welfare state]], [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Deontological ethics|deontological]], [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist]], [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[institution]]al,  to name a few.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=25}}.</ref> Despite these variations, liberal thought does exhibit a few definite and fundamental conceptions. At its very root, liberalism is a philosophy about the meaning of humanity and society.\n\nPolitical philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] identified the common strands in liberal thought as being individualist, egalitarian, [[meliorism|meliorist]] and [[Universalism|universalist]]. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social [[collectivism]], the egalitarian element assigns the same [[Morality|moral]] worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local [[Culture|cultural]] differences.<ref name=\"Gray, p. xii\">Gray, p. xii.</ref> The meliorist element has been the subject of much controversy, defended by thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] who believed in human progress while suffering criticism by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who instead believed that human attempts to improve themselves through social [[cooperation]] would fail.<ref>Wolfe, pp. 33\u201336.</ref> Describing the liberal temperament, Gray claimed that it \"has been inspired by scepticism and by a fideistic certainty of divine revelation&nbsp;[...] it has exalted the power of reason even as, in other contexts, it has sought to humble reason's claims\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe liberal philosophical tradition has searched for validation and justification through several intellectual projects. The moral and political suppositions of liberalism have been based on traditions such as natural rights and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian theory]], although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles.<ref name=\"Gray, p. xii\"/> Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and [[individual liberty]], supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[toleration]], autonomy, [[bodily integrity]] and [[Consent of the governed|consent]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=45}}.</ref>\n\n=== Classical and modern ===\n====John Locke and Thomas Hobbes====\n[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers are given credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct [[ideology]] by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.<ref name=\"Delaney, p. 18\">Delaney, p. 18.</ref><ref name=\"Godwin et al., p. 12\">Godwin et al., p. 12.</ref> [[Thomas Hobbes]] attempted to determine the purpose and the justification of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a state of nature \u2014 a hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the state \u2014 he constructed the idea of a social contract that individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such a peace. Hobbes had developed the concept of the social contract, according to which individuals in the anarchic and brutal state of nature came together and voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Whereas Hobbes advocated a strong monarchical commonwealth (the [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]), Locke developed the then radical notion that government acquires [[Consent of the governed|consent from the governed]] which has to be constantly present for the government to remain legitimate.<ref>Copleston, pp. 39\u201341.</ref> While adopting Hobbes's idea of a state of nature and social contract, Locke nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, it constituted a violation of the social contract, which bestows life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the people have a right to overthrow a tyrant. By placing life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life\u2014[[liberty]] and [[private property]] among them\u2014required the formation of a \"sovereign\" authority with universal jurisdiction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\nHis influential ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Two Treatises]]'' (1690), the foundational text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas. Once humans moved out of their [[State of nature|natural state]] and formed societies, Locke argued as follows: \"Thus that which begins and actually constitutes any [[State (polity)|political society]] is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society. And this is that, and that only, which did or could give beginning to any lawful government in the world\".<ref>Locke, p. 170.</ref> The stringent insistence that lawful government did not have a [[supernatural]] basis was a sharp break with the dominant theories of governance which advocated the divine right of kings<ref>Forster, p. 219.</ref> and echoed the earlier thought of [[Aristotle]]. One political scientist described this new thinking as follows: \"In the liberal understanding, there are no citizens within the regime who can claim to rule by natural or supernatural right, without the consent of the governed\".<ref>Zvesper, p. 93.</ref>\n\nLocke had other intellectual opponents besides Hobbes. In the ''First Treatise'', Locke aimed his guns first and foremost at one of the doyens of 17th century English conservative philosophy: [[Robert Filmer]]. Filmer's ''Patriarcha'' (1680) argued for the [[divine right of kings]] by appealing to [[Bible|biblical]] teaching, claiming that the authority granted to [[Adam]] by [[God]] gave successors of Adam in the male line of descent a right of dominion over all other humans and creatures in the world.<ref>Copleston, p. 33.</ref> However, Locke disagreed so thoroughly and obsessively with Filmer that the ''First Treatise'' is almost a sentence-by-sentence refutation of ''Patriarcha''. Reinforcing his respect for consensus, Locke argued that \"conjugal society is made up by a voluntary compact between men and women\".<ref name=\"Kerber, p. 189\">Kerber, p. 189.</ref> Locke maintained that the grant of dominion in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was not to [[Male privilege|men over women]], as Filmer believed, but to humans over animals.<ref name=\"Kerber, p. 189\"/> Locke was certainly no [[feminism|feminist]] by modern standards, but the first major liberal thinker in history accomplished an equally major task on the road to making the world more pluralistic: the integration of women into [[social theory]].<ref name=\"Kerber, p. 189\"/>\n\n[[File:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644) argued for the importance of [[freedom of speech]]]]\nLocke also originated the concept of the [[separation of church and state]].<ref name=AFP>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 (\"It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.\")</ref> Based on the social contract principle, Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority.<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29</ref> He also formulated a general defence for [[religious toleration]] in his ''Letters Concerning Toleration''. Three arguments are central: (1) earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) even if they could, enforcing a single \"[[Supremacism#Religious|true religion]]\" would not have the desired effect because belief cannot be compelled by [[Religious violence|violence]]; (3) coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.<ref>[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214\u201315.</ref>\n\nLocke was also influenced by the liberal ideas of [[Presbyterian]] politician and poet [[John Milton]], who was a staunch advocate of freedom in all its forms.<ref>{{Citation | first = Heinrich | last = Bornkamm | language = German | contribution = Toleranz.

''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8'' (East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980). pp. 71, 72. {{ISBN|0-8387-1841-8}}.</ref> As assistant to [[Oliver Cromwell]], Milton also took part in drafting a constitution of the [[Independent politician|independents]] (''Agreement of the People''; 1647) that strongly stressed the equality of all humans as a consequence of democratic tendencies.<ref>{{Citation | first = W | last = Wertenbruch | contribution = Menschenrechte | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | language = German | place = T\u00fcbingen, DE | year = 1960}}, 3. Auflage, Band IV, col. 869</ref> In his ''[[Areopagitica]]'', Milton provided one of the first arguments for the importance of freedom of speech\u2014\"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\". His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to distinguish right from wrong. To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in \"[[Marketplace of ideas|a free and open encounter]]\" and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.\n\nIn a natural state of affairs, liberals argued, humans were driven by the instincts of survival and [[self-preservation]] and the only way to escape from such a dangerous existence was to form a common and supreme power capable of arbitrating between competing human desires.<ref name=\"Young 30\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=30}}.</ref> This power could be formed in the framework of a [[civil society]] that allows individuals to make a voluntary social contract with the sovereign authority, transferring their natural rights to that authority in return for the protection of life, liberty and property.<ref name=\"Young 30\" /> These early liberals often disagreed about the most appropriate form of government, but they all shared the belief that liberty was natural and that its restriction needed strong justification.<ref name=\"Young 30\" /> Liberals generally believed in limited government, although several liberal philosophers decried government outright, with [[Thomas Paine]] writing \"government even in its best state is a necessary evil\".<ref name=\"Young, p. 31\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=31}}.</ref>\n\n====Madison and Montesquieu====\nAs part of the project to limit the powers of government, liberal theorists such as [[James Madison]] and [[Montesquieu]] conceived the notion of [[separation of powers]], a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches.<ref name=\"Young, p. 31\" /> Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and [[revolution]], if needed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=32}}.</ref> Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited [[Constitution#Governmental constitutions|constitutional government]] while also advocating for [[Social services|state services]] and [[Provisioning|provisions]] to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights are irrelevant when individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a [[Economic interventionism|greater role for government]] in the administration of economic affairs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=32\u201333}}.</ref> Early liberals also laid the groundwork for the separation of church and state. As heirs of the Enlightenment, liberals believed that any given social and political order emanated [[Consent of the governed|from human interactions]], not from [[Divine law|divine will]].<ref name=\"Gould, p. 4\">Gould, p. 4.</ref> Many liberals were openly hostile to [[religious belief]] itself, but most concentrated their opposition to the union of religious and political authority, arguing that faith could prosper on its own, without official sponsorship or administration by the state.<ref name=\"Gould, p. 4\"/>\n\nBeyond identifying a clear role for government in modern society, liberals also have argued over the meaning and nature of the most important principle in liberal philosophy, namely liberty. From the 17th century until the 19th century, liberals (from [[Adam Smith]] to [[John Stuart Mill]]) conceptualised liberty as the absence of interference from government and from other individuals, claiming that all people should have the freedom to develop their own unique abilities and capacities without being sabotaged by others.<ref name=\"Young, p. 33\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=33}}.</ref> Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), one of the classic texts in liberal philosophy, proclaimed, \"the only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way\".<ref name=\"Young, p. 33\"/> Support for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]] is often associated with this principle, with [[Friedrich Hayek]] arguing in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) that reliance on free markets would preclude totalitarian control by the state.<ref>Wolfe, p. 74.</ref>\n\n====The Coppet Group and Benjamin Constant====\n[[File:Madame de Sta\u00ebl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl|Madame de Sta\u00ebl]]]] \n[[File:Benjamin Constant.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Constant]] (1767-1830), Franco-Swiss political activist and theorist]]\nThe development into maturity of modern classical in contrast to ancient liberalism took place before and soon after the French Revolution.

Generally, this required a sub-group of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous male societies, in which they could congregate in one place to transact public affairs.<ref name=\"AncientModern\"/> \n\nThe Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of [[civil liberties]], the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a mercantile society in which there were no slaves but almost everybody had to earn a living through work.

Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights.

This new kind of liberty became known as [[positive liberty]] to distinguish it from the prior [[negative liberty|negative version]] and it was first developed by [[British philosophy|British philosopher]] [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green rejected the idea that humans were driven solely by [[self-interest]], emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of our [[moral character]].<ref name=\"Adams, pp. 54\u20135\">Adams, pp. 54\u201355.</ref> In a very profound step for the future of modern liberalism, he also tasked society and political institutions with the enhancement of individual freedom and identity and the development of moral character, will and reason and the state to create the conditions that allow for the above, giving the opportunity for genuine [[choice]].<ref name=\"Adams, pp. 54\u20135\"/> Foreshadowing the new liberty as the freedom to act rather than to avoid suffering from the acts of others, Green wrote the following: {{quote|If it were ever reasonable to wish that the usage of words had been other than it has been [...] one might be inclined to wish that the term 'freedom' had been confined to the [...] power to do what one wills.<ref>Wempe, p. 123.</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nRather than previous liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole in which all individuals have a [[duty]] to promote the [[common good]].<ref>Adams, p. 55.</ref> His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]] and [[John A.

In a few years, this ''New Liberalism'' had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain<ref>Adams, p. 58.</ref> and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand [[Universal suffrage|suffrage rights]], liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the [[Voting|democratic decision-making process]] were liable to the \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\", a concept explained in Mill's ''On Liberty'' and in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835) by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].<ref name=\"Young, p. 36\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=36}}.</ref> As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the [[Minority rights|rights of minorities]].<ref name=\"Young, p. 36\"/>\n\nBesides liberty, liberals have developed several other principles important to the construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, [[Voltaire]] commented that \"equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things\".<ref>Wolfe, p. 63.</ref> All forms of liberalism assume in some basic sense that individuals are equal.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=39}}.</ref> In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref> In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else and all people are [[Equality before the law|equal subjects before the law]].<ref name=\"Young, p. 40\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=40}}.</ref> Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher [[John Rawls]] emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their [[Motivation|aspirations]] in life.<ref name=\"Young, p. 40\"/> Libertarian thinker [[Robert Nozick]] disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of [[Equal opportunity|Lockean equality]] instead.<ref name=\"Young, p. 40\"/>\n\nTo contribute to the development of liberty, liberals also have promoted concepts like pluralism and toleration. By pluralism, liberals refer to the proliferation of opinions and beliefs that characterise a stable [[social order]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=42\u201343}}.</ref> Unlike many of their competitors and predecessors, liberals do not seek conformity and homogeneity in the way that people think. In fact, their efforts have been geared towards establishing a governing framework that [[Conflict resolution|harmonises and minimises conflicting views]], but still allows those views to exist and flourish.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=43}}.</ref> For liberal philosophy, pluralism leads easily to toleration. Since individuals will hold diverging viewpoints, liberals argue, they ought to uphold and respect the right of one another to disagree.<ref name=\"Young, p. 44\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=44}}.</ref> From the liberal perspective, toleration was initially connected to [[religious toleration]], with [[Baruch Spinoza]] condemning \"the stupidity of religious persecution and ideological wars\".<ref name=\"Young, p. 44\"/> Toleration also played a central role in the [[Kantianism|ideas of Kant]] and John Stuart Mill. Both thinkers believed that society will contain different conceptions of a good ethical life and that people should be allowed to make their own choices without interference from the state or other individuals.<ref name=\"Young, p. 44\"/>\n\n=== Liberal economic theory ===\n{{main|Economic liberalism}}\n[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, followed by the French liberal economist, [[Jean-Baptiste Say]]'s treatise on ''[[Say's Political Economy|Political Economy]]'' published in 1803 and expanded in 1830 with practical applications, were to provide most of the ideas of economics until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.<ref name=\"Mills, pp. 63, 68\">Mills, pp. 63, 68</ref> Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of [[Pricing|prices]] and the [[distribution of wealth]] and the [[Economic policy|policies]] the state should follow in order to maximise [[wealth]].<ref name=\"Mills, p. 64\">Mills, p. 64</ref>\n\nSmith wrote that as long as [[Supply and demand|supply, demand]], [[price]]s and [[Competition (economics)|competition]] were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22public+good%22&sa=X#v=onepage&q=%22public%20good%22 The Wealth of Nations]'', Strahan and Cadell, 1778</ref> through profit-driven production of goods and services. An \"[[invisible hand]]\" directed individuals and firms to work toward the nation's good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 64\"/>\n\nSmith assumed that workers could be [[Salary|paid]] as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the \"[[iron law of wages]]\".<ref>Mills, p. 65</ref> His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and [[international trade]], which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.<ref>Mills, p. 66</ref> He also opposed restrictive [[trade preference]]s, state grants of [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and [[employers' organisation]]s and [[trade union]]s.<ref>Mills, p. 67</ref> Government should be limited to defence, [[public work]]s and the [[administration of justice]], financed by [[Income tax|taxes based on income]].<ref>Mills, p. 68</ref> Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the [[globalisation]] literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace.<ref>See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 1.</ref> Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 69\">Mills, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn his ''Treatise'' (Trait\u00e9 d'\u00e9conomie politique), Say states that any production process requires effort, knowledge and the \"application\" of the entrepreneur. He sees entrepreneurs as intermediaries in the production process who combine productive factors such as land, capital and labour to meet the demand of consumers. As a result, they play a central role in the economy through their coordinating function. He also highlights qualities essential for successful entrepreneurship and focuses on judgement, in that they have continuously to assess market needs and the means to meet them. This requires an \"unerring market sense\". Say views entrepreneurial income primarily as the high revenue paid in compensation for their skills and expert knowledge. He does so by contrasting the enterprise function and the supply-of-capital-function which distinguishes the earnings of the entrepreneur on one hand and the remuneration of capital on the other. This clearly differentiates his theory from that of [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who describes entrepreneurial rent as short-term profits which compensate for high risk (Schumpeterian rent). Say himself does also refer to risk and uncertainty along with innovation, without analysing them in detail.\n\nSay is also credited with [[Say's law]], or the law of markets which may be summarised as: \"[[Aggregate supply]] creates its own [[aggregate demand]]\",\nand \"[[Supply creates its own demand]]\" or \"Supply constitutes its own demand\" and \"Inherent in supply is the need for its own consumption\". The related phrase \"supply creates its own demand\" was actually coined by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who criticized Say's separate formulations as amounting to the same thing. Some advocates of Say's law who disagree with Keynes, have claimed that Say's law can actually be summarized more accurately as \"production precedes consumption\" and that what Say is actually stating, is that for consumption to happen one must produce something of value so that it can be traded for money or barter for consumption later.<ref name=\"clower92\">{{Harv|Clower|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tzzClShefiYC&pg=PA92 p. 92]}}</ref><ref>Bylund, Per.

Mill senior restates Say's law in 1808, writing: \"production of commodities creates, and is the one and universal cause which creates a market for the commodities produced\".<ref>Mill, James (1808).

However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. Malthus wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798,<ref>Mills, pp. 71\u201372</ref> becoming a major influence on classical liberalism. Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.<ref>Mills, p. 72.</ref>\n\nSeveral liberals, including Adam Smith and [[Richard Cobden]], argued that the free exchange of goods between nations would lead to world peace.<ref>Erik Gartzke, \"[http://www.columbia.akadns.net/itc/journalism/stille/Politics%20Fall%202007/readings%20weeks%206-7/Economic%20Freedom%20and%20Peace%20--%20Garzke.pdf Economic Freedom and Peace],\" in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).</ref> Smith argued that as societies progressed the spoils of war would rise, but the costs of war would rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations.<ref>Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).</ref> Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets.\n\n[[Utilitarianism]] was seen as a [[Legitimacy (political)|political justification]] for the implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, an idea dominating economic policy from the 1840s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and John Stuart Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a premise for a ''laissez-faire'' approach.<ref>Richardson, p. 32</ref> The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that [[public policy]] should seek to provide \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to [[Poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 76\"/> His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government [[social control]], including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.\n\n==== Keynesian economics ====\n{{main|Keynesian economics}}\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times and whose ideas, which are still [[2008\u201309 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]\n[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Great Depression]] with its periods of worldwide economic hardship formed the backdrop against which [[Keynesian Revolution]] took place (the image is [[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''[[Migrant Mother]]'' depiction of destitute [[pea-pickers]] in California, taken in March 1936)]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the definitive liberal response to the economic crisis was given by the English economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883\u20131946).

The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the [[Market (economics)|market]] would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. [[Classical economics|Classical economists]] had believed in [[Say's law]], which simply put states that \"[[supply creates its own demand]]\" and that in a [[free market]] workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]], i.e. the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [[rationality|rational]] for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of \"[[aggregate demand]]\" and \"[[aggregate supply]]\" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria and in those cases it is the state and not the market that economies must depend on for their salvation. The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. In 1928, he wrote: \"Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth. [...] With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them\".<ref name=\"Cassidy2011\"/> Where the market failed to properly allocate resources, the government was required to stimulate the economy until private funds could start flowing again\u2014a \"prime the pump\" kind of strategy designed to boost [[industrial production]].<ref>Colton and Palmer, p. 808.</ref>\n\n=== Liberal feminist theory ===\n{{main|Liberal feminism}}\n[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], widely regarded as the pioneer of [[liberal feminism]]]]\n[[Liberal feminism]], the dominant tradition in [[History of feminism|feminist history]], is an [[Individualism|individualistic]] form of [[feminist theory]] which focuses on women's ability to maintain their equality through their own actions and choices.

Wollstonecraft \"denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood\".<ref name=\"Tong, Rosemarie 1989\"/>\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]] was also an early proponent of feminism. In his article ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1861, published 1869), Mill attempted to prove that the legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to perfect equality.<ref>John Stuart Mill: critical assessments, Volume 4, By [[John Cunningham Wood]]</ref><ref>Mill, J.S. (1869) [http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm ''The Subjection of Women''], Chapter 1</ref> He believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that \"until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely\".<ref>Mill, John Stuart (1869). The Subjection of Women (1869 first ed.). London: Longmans, Green, Reader & Dyer. Retrieved 10 December 2012.</ref> Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same \"genuine unselfishness\" that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one \"that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit\".<ref name=\"Tong, Rosemarie 1989\"/> Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book ''The Subjection of Women'', Mill argues that three major parts of women's lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education and marriage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/|title=Mill's Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Brink|first=David|date=9 October 2007|website=|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=1 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Equity feminism]] is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s,<ref>{{cite book |title=Social Feminism |first=Naomi |last=Black |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kDYqAAAAYAAJ |year=1989 |publisher=Cornell University Press}}</ref><ref name=Halfmann>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Q83kxhOsgxYC&pg=PA79 |title=Industry and Politics in West Germany: Toward the Third Republic |editor-first=Peter J. |editor-last=Katzenstein |chapter=3.

[[Anarcho-capitalism]] goes one step further, with law enforcement and the courts being provided by private companies.  Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of [[privatizing]] protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. Later in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same. In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: \"No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity\". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers \"had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism\".<ref>Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035217/http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm |date=10 June 2009 }}, Unit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e au CNRS</ref> Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state.

The [[Levellers]], a radical political movement, during the war called for [[Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom|freedom of religion]], frequent convening of parliament and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the [[Early modern Britain|17th century in England]], culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]] and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1688firstmodernr00stev|url-access=registration|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15605-8 |access-date=7 February 2013}}</ref> The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era.

After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The [[Articles of Confederation]], written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government.

France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. However, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in [[Liberalism and radicalism in Italy|Italy]] and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy and ended the secular power of the Popes. However, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'' in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelling the Jesuit order]]. By the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged and the ideal of the self-made individual seemed increasingly implausible.

Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of \"cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]\".\n\nIn the Middle East, liberalism led to constitutional periods, like the Ottoman [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First]] and [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] and the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Persian constitutional period]], but it declined in the late 1930s due the growth and opposition of [[Islamism]] and [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kurzman|first1=Charles|title=Liberal Islam: A Source Book|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195116229|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8HSe9SfXMC&pg=PA10|access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Moaddel1\">{{cite book|last1=Moaddel|first1=Mansoor|title=Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226533339|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk6BLopmn3gC&pg=PA4}}</ref><ref name=\"lapidus\">{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies |last=Lapidus |first=Ira Marvin |author-link= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0521779333 |page=496 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&pg=PA496}}</ref><ref name=\"LorentzIran\">{{cite book|last1=Lorentz|first1=John H.|title=The A to Z of Iran|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1461731917|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9WwxXbCB8C&pg=PA224|access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"LindgrenRoss\"/> However, there were various examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas.

However, liberalism still has challenges to overcome in Africa and Asia. The fundamental elements of [[Modernity|contemporary society]] have liberal roots. The early waves of liberalism popularised economic individualism while expanding [[constitution]]al [[government]] and [[parliament]]ary authority.<ref name=\"Gould, p. 3\">Gould, p. 3.</ref> Liberals sought and established a constitutional order that prized important [[Civil liberties|individual freedoms]], such as  [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of association]]; an [[Independence of the judiciary|independent judiciary]] and public [[Jury trial|trial by jury]]; and the abolition of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privileges.<ref name=\"Gould, p. 3\"/> Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights.<ref name=\"Worell470\">Worell, p. 470.</ref>\n\nLiberals have [[Advocacy|advocated]] gender and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a [[Civil rights movements|global civil rights movement]] in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Continental European liberalism is divided between [[moderate]]s and [[Progressivism|progressives]], with the moderates tending to [[elitism]] and the progressives supporting the universalisation of fundamental institutions, such as [[universal suffrage]], [[Universal access to education|universal education]] and the expansion of [[Property|property rights]]. Over time, the moderates displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism.<ref name=\"Kirchner, p. 3\"/>\n\n== Etymology and definition ==\nWords such as ''[[wikt:Liberal|liberal]]'', ''[[wikt:Liberty|liberty]]'', ''[[wikt:Libertarianism|libertarian]]'' and ''[[libertine]]'' all trace their history to the Latin ''[[wikt:Liber|liber]]'', which means \"[[wikt:Free|free]]\".<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\">Gross, p. 5.</ref> One of the first recorded instances of the word ''liberal'' occurs in 1375, when it was used to describe the [[liberal arts]] in the context of an education desirable for a free-born man.<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> The word's early connection with the classical education of a medieval university soon gave way to a proliferation of different denotations and connotations. ''Liberal'' could refer to \"free in bestowing\" as early as 1387, \"made without stint\" in 1433, \"freely permitted\" in 1530 and \"free from restraint\"\u2014often as a pejorative remark\u2014in the 16th and the 17th centuries.<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> In 16th century [[Kingdom of England|England]], ''liberal'' could have positive or negative attributes in referring to someone's generosity or indiscretion.<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> In ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] wrote of \"a liberal villaine\" who \"hath [...] confest his vile encounters\".<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> With the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the word acquired decisively more positive undertones, being defined as \"free from narrow prejudice\" in 1781 and \"free from bigotry\" in 1823.<ref name=\"Gross, p. 5\"/> In 1815, the first use of the word \"liberalism\" appeared in English.<ref>Kirchner, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> In Spain, the ''[[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|liberales]]'', the first group to use the liberal label in a political context,<ref>Colton and Palmer, p. 479.</ref> fought for decades for the implementation of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. From 1820 to 1823 during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'', [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] was compelled by the ''liberales'' to swear to uphold the Constitution. By the middle of the 19th century, ''liberal'' was used as a politicised term for parties and movements worldwide.<ref>Emil J. Kirchner, ''Liberal Parties in Western Europe'', \"Liberal parties were among the first political parties to form, and their long-serving and influential records, as participants in parliaments and governments, raise important questions [...]\", Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32394-9}}.</ref>\n\nOver time, the meaning of the word ''liberalism'' began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'': \"In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies\".<ref>\"Liberalism\", ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref> Consequently, in the United States the ideas of [[individualism]] and ''laissez-faire'' economics previously associated with [[classical liberalism]] became the basis for the emerging school of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] thought<ref>Rothbard, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard121.html ''The Libertarian Heritage: The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism]''.</ref> and are key components of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]].\n\nUnlike Europe and Latin America, the word ''liberalism'' in North America almost exclusively refers to [[social liberalism]]. The dominant Canadian party is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the United States' [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is usually considered liberal.<ref>Puddington, p. 142. \"After a dozen years of centre-left Liberal Party rule, the Conservative Party emerged from the 2006 parliamentary elections with a plurality and established a fragile minority government.\"</ref><ref>Grigsby, pp. 106\u201307.

Its immense scholarly and academic output has been characterised as containing \"richness and diversity\", but that diversity often has meant that liberalism comes in different formulations and presents a challenge to anyone looking for a clear definition.<ref name=\"Young, p. 24\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=24}}.</ref>\n\n=== Major themes ===\n{{Individualism sidebar|expanded=Philosophies}}\nThough all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage, scholars frequently assume that those doctrines contain \"separate and often contradictory streams of thought\".<ref name=\"Young, p. 24\"/> The objectives of [[List of liberal theorists|liberal theorists and philosophers]] have differed across various times, cultures and continents. The diversity of liberalism can be gleaned from the numerous adjectives that liberal thinkers and movements have attached to the very term \"liberalism\", including [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], [[Economic liberalism|economic]], [[Social liberalism|social]], [[welfare state]], [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Deontological ethics|deontological]], [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist]], [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[institution]]al,  to name a few.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=25}}.</ref> Despite these variations, liberal thought does exhibit a few definite and fundamental conceptions. At its very root, liberalism is a philosophy about the meaning of humanity and society.\n\nPolitical philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] identified the common strands in liberal thought as being individualist, egalitarian, [[meliorism|meliorist]] and [[Universalism|universalist]]. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social [[collectivism]], the egalitarian element assigns the same [[Morality|moral]] worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local [[Culture|cultural]] differences.<ref name=\"Gray, p. xii\">Gray, p. xii.</ref> The meliorist element has been the subject of much controversy, defended by thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] who believed in human progress while suffering criticism by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who instead believed that human attempts to improve themselves through social [[cooperation]] would fail.<ref>Wolfe, pp. 33\u201336.</ref> Describing the liberal temperament, Gray claimed that it \"has been inspired by scepticism and by a fideistic certainty of divine revelation&nbsp;[...] it has exalted the power of reason even as, in other contexts, it has sought to humble reason's claims\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe liberal philosophical tradition has searched for validation and justification through several intellectual projects. The moral and political suppositions of liberalism have been based on traditions such as natural rights and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian theory]], although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles.<ref name=\"Gray, p. xii\"/> Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and [[individual liberty]], supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[toleration]], autonomy, [[bodily integrity]] and [[Consent of the governed|consent]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=45}}.</ref>\n\n=== Classical and modern ===\n====John Locke and Thomas Hobbes====\n[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers are given credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct [[ideology]] by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.<ref name=\"Delaney, p. 18\">Delaney, p. 18.</ref><ref name=\"Godwin et al., p. 12\">Godwin et al., p. 12.</ref> [[Thomas Hobbes]] attempted to determine the purpose and the justification of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a state of nature \u2014 a hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the state \u2014 he constructed the idea of a social contract that individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such a peace. Hobbes had developed the concept of the social contract, according to which individuals in the anarchic and brutal state of nature came together and voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Whereas Hobbes advocated a strong monarchical commonwealth (the [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]), Locke developed the then radical notion that government acquires [[Consent of the governed|consent from the governed]] which has to be constantly present for the government to remain legitimate.<ref>Copleston, pp. 39\u201341.</ref> While adopting Hobbes's idea of a state of nature and social contract, Locke nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, it constituted a violation of the social contract, which bestows life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the people have a right to overthrow a tyrant. By placing life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life\u2014[[liberty]] and [[private property]] among them\u2014required the formation of a \"sovereign\" authority with universal jurisdiction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\nHis influential ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Two Treatises]]'' (1690), the foundational text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas. Once humans moved out of their [[State of nature|natural state]] and formed societies, Locke argued as follows: \"Thus that which begins and actually constitutes any [[State (polity)|political society]] is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society. And this is that, and that only, which did or could give beginning to any lawful government in the world\".<ref>Locke, p. 170.</ref> The stringent insistence that lawful government did not have a [[supernatural]] basis was a sharp break with the dominant theories of governance which advocated the divine right of kings<ref>Forster, p. 219.</ref> and echoed the earlier thought of [[Aristotle]]. One political scientist described this new thinking as follows: \"In the liberal understanding, there are no citizens within the regime who can claim to rule by natural or supernatural right, without the consent of the governed\".<ref>Zvesper, p. 93.</ref>\n\nLocke had other intellectual opponents besides Hobbes. In the ''First Treatise'', Locke aimed his guns first and foremost at one of the doyens of 17th century English conservative philosophy: [[Robert Filmer]]. Filmer's ''Patriarcha'' (1680) argued for the [[divine right of kings]] by appealing to [[Bible|biblical]] teaching, claiming that the authority granted to [[Adam]] by [[God]] gave successors of Adam in the male line of descent a right of dominion over all other humans and creatures in the world.<ref>Copleston, p. 33.</ref> However, Locke disagreed so thoroughly and obsessively with Filmer that the ''First Treatise'' is almost a sentence-by-sentence refutation of ''Patriarcha''. Reinforcing his respect for consensus, Locke argued that \"conjugal society is made up by a voluntary compact between men and women\".<ref name=\"Kerber, p. 189\">Kerber, p. 189.</ref> Locke maintained that the grant of dominion in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was not to [[Male privilege|men over women]], as Filmer believed, but to humans over animals.<ref name=\"Kerber, p. 189\"/> Locke was certainly no [[feminism|feminist]] by modern standards, but the first major liberal thinker in history accomplished an equally major task on the road to making the world more pluralistic: the integration of women into [[social theory]].<ref name=\"Kerber, p. 189\"/>\n\n[[File:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644) argued for the importance of [[freedom of speech]]]]\nLocke also originated the concept of the [[separation of church and state]].<ref name=AFP>Feldman, Noah (2005).

Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 (\"It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.\")</ref> Based on the social contract principle, Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority.<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29</ref> He also formulated a general defence for [[religious toleration]] in his ''Letters Concerning Toleration''. Three arguments are central: (1) earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) even if they could, enforcing a single \"[[Supremacism#Religious|true religion]]\" would not have the desired effect because belief cannot be compelled by [[Religious violence|violence]]; (3) coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.<ref>[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998.

His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to distinguish right from wrong. To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in \"[[Marketplace of ideas|a free and open encounter]]\" and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.\n\nIn a natural state of affairs, liberals argued, humans were driven by the instincts of survival and [[self-preservation]] and the only way to escape from such a dangerous existence was to form a common and supreme power capable of arbitrating between competing human desires.<ref name=\"Young 30\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=30}}.</ref> This power could be formed in the framework of a [[civil society]] that allows individuals to make a voluntary social contract with the sovereign authority, transferring their natural rights to that authority in return for the protection of life, liberty and property.<ref name=\"Young 30\" /> These early liberals often disagreed about the most appropriate form of government, but they all shared the belief that liberty was natural and that its restriction needed strong justification.<ref name=\"Young 30\" /> Liberals generally believed in limited government, although several liberal philosophers decried government outright, with [[Thomas Paine]] writing \"government even in its best state is a necessary evil\".<ref name=\"Young, p. 31\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=31}}.</ref>\n\n====Madison and Montesquieu====\nAs part of the project to limit the powers of government, liberal theorists such as [[James Madison]] and [[Montesquieu]] conceived the notion of [[separation of powers]], a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches.<ref name=\"Young, p. 31\" /> Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and [[revolution]], if needed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=32}}.</ref> Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited [[Constitution#Governmental constitutions|constitutional government]] while also advocating for [[Social services|state services]] and [[Provisioning|provisions]] to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights are irrelevant when individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a [[Economic interventionism|greater role for government]] in the administration of economic affairs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=32\u201333}}.</ref> Early liberals also laid the groundwork for the separation of church and state. As heirs of the Enlightenment, liberals believed that any given social and political order emanated [[Consent of the governed|from human interactions]], not from [[Divine law|divine will]].<ref name=\"Gould, p. 4\">Gould, p. 4.</ref> Many liberals were openly hostile to [[religious belief]] itself, but most concentrated their opposition to the union of religious and political authority, arguing that faith could prosper on its own, without official sponsorship or administration by the state.<ref name=\"Gould, p. 4\"/>\n\nBeyond identifying a clear role for government in modern society, liberals also have argued over the meaning and nature of the most important principle in liberal philosophy, namely liberty. From the 17th century until the 19th century, liberals (from [[Adam Smith]] to [[John Stuart Mill]]) conceptualised liberty as the absence of interference from government and from other individuals, claiming that all people should have the freedom to develop their own unique abilities and capacities without being sabotaged by others.<ref name=\"Young, p. 33\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=33}}.</ref> Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), one of the classic texts in liberal philosophy, proclaimed, \"the only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way\".<ref name=\"Young, p. 33\"/> Support for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]] is often associated with this principle, with [[Friedrich Hayek]] arguing in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) that reliance on free markets would preclude totalitarian control by the state.<ref>Wolfe, p. 74.</ref>\n\n====The Coppet Group and Benjamin Constant====\n[[File:Madame de Sta\u00ebl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl|Madame de Sta\u00ebl]]]] \n[[File:Benjamin Constant.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Constant]] (1767-1830), Franco-Swiss political activist and theorist]]\nThe development into maturity of modern classical in contrast to ancient liberalism took place before and soon after the French Revolution.

Generally, this required a sub-group of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous male societies, in which they could congregate in one place to transact public affairs.<ref name=\"AncientModern\"/> \n\nThe Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of [[civil liberties]], the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a mercantile society in which there were no slaves but almost everybody had to earn a living through work.

Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights.

This new kind of liberty became known as [[positive liberty]] to distinguish it from the prior [[negative liberty|negative version]] and it was first developed by [[British philosophy|British philosopher]] [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green rejected the idea that humans were driven solely by [[self-interest]], emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of our [[moral character]].<ref name=\"Adams, pp. 54\u20135\">Adams, pp. 54\u201355.</ref> In a very profound step for the future of modern liberalism, he also tasked society and political institutions with the enhancement of individual freedom and identity and the development of moral character, will and reason and the state to create the conditions that allow for the above, giving the opportunity for genuine [[choice]].<ref name=\"Adams, pp. 54\u20135\"/> Foreshadowing the new liberty as the freedom to act rather than to avoid suffering from the acts of others, Green wrote the following: {{quote|If it were ever reasonable to wish that the usage of words had been other than it has been [...] one might be inclined to wish that the term 'freedom' had been confined to the [...] power to do what one wills.<ref>Wempe, p. 123.</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nRather than previous liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole in which all individuals have a [[duty]] to promote the [[common good]].<ref>Adams, p. 55.</ref> His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]] and [[John A. Hobson]]. In a few years, this ''New Liberalism'' had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain<ref>Adams, p. 58.</ref> and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand [[Universal suffrage|suffrage rights]], liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the [[Voting|democratic decision-making process]] were liable to the \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\", a concept explained in Mill's ''On Liberty'' and in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835) by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].<ref name=\"Young, p. 36\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=36}}.</ref> As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the [[Minority rights|rights of minorities]].<ref name=\"Young, p. 36\"/>\n\nBesides liberty, liberals have developed several other principles important to the construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, [[Voltaire]] commented that \"equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things\".<ref>Wolfe, p. 63.</ref> All forms of liberalism assume in some basic sense that individuals are equal.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=39}}.</ref> In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref> In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else and all people are [[Equality before the law|equal subjects before the law]].<ref name=\"Young, p. 40\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=40}}.</ref> Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher [[John Rawls]] emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their [[Motivation|aspirations]] in life.<ref name=\"Young, p. 40\"/> Libertarian thinker [[Robert Nozick]] disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of [[Equal opportunity|Lockean equality]] instead.<ref name=\"Young, p. 40\"/>\n\nTo contribute to the development of liberty, liberals also have promoted concepts like pluralism and toleration. By pluralism, liberals refer to the proliferation of opinions and beliefs that characterise a stable [[social order]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=42\u201343}}.</ref> Unlike many of their competitors and predecessors, liberals do not seek conformity and homogeneity in the way that people think. In fact, their efforts have been geared towards establishing a governing framework that [[Conflict resolution|harmonises and minimises conflicting views]], but still allows those views to exist and flourish.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=43}}.</ref> For liberal philosophy, pluralism leads easily to toleration. Since individuals will hold diverging viewpoints, liberals argue, they ought to uphold and respect the right of one another to disagree.<ref name=\"Young, p. 44\">{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=44}}.</ref> From the liberal perspective, toleration was initially connected to [[religious toleration]], with [[Baruch Spinoza]] condemning \"the stupidity of religious persecution and ideological wars\".<ref name=\"Young, p. 44\"/> Toleration also played a central role in the [[Kantianism|ideas of Kant]] and John Stuart Mill. Both thinkers believed that society will contain different conceptions of a good ethical life and that people should be allowed to make their own choices without interference from the state or other individuals.<ref name=\"Young, p. 44\"/>\n\n=== Liberal economic theory ===\n{{main|Economic liberalism}}\n[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, followed by the French liberal economist, [[Jean-Baptiste Say]]'s treatise on ''[[Say's Political Economy|Political Economy]]'' published in 1803 and expanded in 1830 with practical applications, were to provide most of the ideas of economics until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.<ref name=\"Mills, pp. 63, 68\">Mills, pp. 63, 68</ref> Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of [[Pricing|prices]] and the [[distribution of wealth]] and the [[Economic policy|policies]] the state should follow in order to maximise [[wealth]].<ref name=\"Mills, p. 64\">Mills, p. 64</ref>\n\nSmith wrote that as long as [[Supply and demand|supply, demand]], [[price]]s and [[Competition (economics)|competition]] were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22public+good%22&sa=X#v=onepage&q=%22public%20good%22 The Wealth of Nations]'', Strahan and Cadell, 1778</ref> through profit-driven production of goods and services. An \"[[invisible hand]]\" directed individuals and firms to work toward the nation's good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 64\"/>\n\nSmith assumed that workers could be [[Salary|paid]] as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the \"[[iron law of wages]]\".<ref>Mills, p. 65</ref> His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and [[international trade]], which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.<ref>Mills, p. 66</ref> He also opposed restrictive [[trade preference]]s, state grants of [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and [[employers' organisation]]s and [[trade union]]s.<ref>Mills, p. 67</ref> Government should be limited to defence, [[public work]]s and the [[administration of justice]], financed by [[Income tax|taxes based on income]].<ref>Mills, p. 68</ref> Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the [[globalisation]] literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace.<ref>See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 1.</ref> Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 69\">Mills, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn his ''Treatise'' (Trait\u00e9 d'\u00e9conomie politique), Say states that any production process requires effort, knowledge and the \"application\" of the entrepreneur. He sees entrepreneurs as intermediaries in the production process who combine productive factors such as land, capital and labour to meet the demand of consumers. As a result, they play a central role in the economy through their coordinating function. He also highlights qualities essential for successful entrepreneurship and focuses on judgement, in that they have continuously to assess market needs and the means to meet them. This requires an \"unerring market sense\". Say views entrepreneurial income primarily as the high revenue paid in compensation for their skills and expert knowledge. He does so by contrasting the enterprise function and the supply-of-capital-function which distinguishes the earnings of the entrepreneur on one hand and the remuneration of capital on the other. This clearly differentiates his theory from that of [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who describes entrepreneurial rent as short-term profits which compensate for high risk (Schumpeterian rent). Say himself does also refer to risk and uncertainty along with innovation, without analysing them in detail.\n\nSay is also credited with [[Say's law]], or the law of markets which may be summarised as: \"[[Aggregate supply]] creates its own [[aggregate demand]]\",\nand \"[[Supply creates its own demand]]\" or \"Supply constitutes its own demand\" and \"Inherent in supply is the need for its own consumption\". The related phrase \"supply creates its own demand\" was actually coined by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who criticized Say's separate formulations as amounting to the same thing. Some advocates of Say's law who disagree with Keynes, have claimed that Say's law can actually be summarized more accurately as \"production precedes consumption\" and that what Say is actually stating, is that for consumption to happen one must produce something of value so that it can be traded for money or barter for consumption later.<ref name=\"clower92\">{{Harv|Clower|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tzzClShefiYC&pg=PA92 p. 92]}}</ref><ref>Bylund, Per.

Mill senior restates Say's law in 1808, writing: \"production of commodities creates, and is the one and universal cause which creates a market for the commodities produced\".<ref>Mill, James (1808).

However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. Malthus wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798,<ref>Mills, pp. 71\u201372</ref> becoming a major influence on classical liberalism. Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating.

Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and John Stuart Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a premise for a ''laissez-faire'' approach.<ref>Richardson, p. 32</ref> The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that [[public policy]] should seek to provide \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to [[Poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 76\"/> His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government [[social control]], including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.\n\n==== Keynesian economics ====\n{{main|Keynesian economics}}\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times and whose ideas, which are still [[2008\u201309 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]\n[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Great Depression]] with its periods of worldwide economic hardship formed the backdrop against which [[Keynesian Revolution]] took place (the image is [[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''[[Migrant Mother]]'' depiction of destitute [[pea-pickers]] in California, taken in March 1936)]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the definitive liberal response to the economic crisis was given by the English economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883\u20131946).

The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the [[Market (economics)|market]] would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. [[Classical economics|Classical economists]] had believed in [[Say's law]], which simply put states that \"[[supply creates its own demand]]\" and that in a [[free market]] workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]], i.e. the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [[rationality|rational]] for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of \"[[aggregate demand]]\" and \"[[aggregate supply]]\" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria and in those cases it is the state and not the market that economies must depend on for their salvation. The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. In 1928, he wrote: \"Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth. [...] With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them\".<ref name=\"Cassidy2011\"/> Where the market failed to properly allocate resources, the government was required to stimulate the economy until private funds could start flowing again\u2014a \"prime the pump\" kind of strategy designed to boost [[industrial production]].<ref>Colton and Palmer, p. 808.</ref>\n\n=== Liberal feminist theory ===\n{{main|Liberal feminism}}\n[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], widely regarded as the pioneer of [[liberal feminism]]]]\n[[Liberal feminism]], the dominant tradition in [[History of feminism|feminist history]], is an [[Individualism|individualistic]] form of [[feminist theory]] which focuses on women's ability to maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Liberal feminists hope to eradicate all barriers to [[gender equality]], claiming that the continued existence of such barriers eviscerates the individual rights and freedoms ostensibly guaranteed by a liberal social order.<ref>Jensen, p. 2.</ref> They argue that society holds the false belief that women are by nature [[Gender inequality|less intellectually and physically capable]] than men; thus it tends to [[Sexism|discriminate against women]] in the [[Sexism in academia|academy]], the forum and the [[Occupational sexism|marketplace]]. Liberal feminists believe that \"female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-called public world\". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal reform.<ref name=\"Tong, Rosemarie 1989\">Tong, Rosemarie. 1989. Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction. Oxon, United Kingdom: Unwin Human Ltd. Chapter 1</ref>\n\nBritish [[List of women philosophers|philosopher]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759\u20131797) is widely regarded as the pioneer of liberal feminism, with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) expanding the boundaries of liberalism to include women in the political structure of liberal society.<ref>Falco, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> In her writings such as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft commented on society's view of the woman and encouraged women to use their voices in making decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft \"denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood\".<ref name=\"Tong, Rosemarie 1989\"/>\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]] was also an early proponent of feminism. In his article ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1861, published 1869), Mill attempted to prove that the legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to perfect equality.<ref>John Stuart Mill: critical assessments, Volume 4, By [[John Cunningham Wood]]</ref><ref>Mill, J.S. (1869) [http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm ''The Subjection of Women''], Chapter 1</ref> He believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that \"until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely\".<ref>Mill, John Stuart (1869). The Subjection of Women (1869 first ed.). London: Longmans, Green, Reader & Dyer. Retrieved 10 December 2012.</ref> Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same \"genuine unselfishness\" that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one \"that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit\".<ref name=\"Tong, Rosemarie 1989\"/> Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book ''The Subjection of Women'', Mill argues that three major parts of women's lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education and marriage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/|title=Mill's Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Brink|first=David|date=9 October 2007|website=|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=1 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Equity feminism]] is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s,<ref>{{cite book |title=Social Feminism |first=Naomi |last=Black |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kDYqAAAAYAAJ |year=1989 |publisher=Cornell University Press}}</ref><ref name=Halfmann>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Q83kxhOsgxYC&pg=PA79 |title=Industry and Politics in West Germany: Toward the Third Republic |editor-first=Peter J. |editor-last=Katzenstein |chapter=3.

[[Anarcho-capitalism]] goes one step further, with law enforcement and the courts being provided by private companies.  Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism.

Later in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same. In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: \"No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity\". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics.

These ideas began to coalesce at the time of the [[English Civil War]]s. The [[Levellers]], a radical political movement, during the war called for [[Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom|freedom of religion]], frequent convening of parliament and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the [[Early modern Britain|17th century in England]], culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]] and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1688firstmodernr00stev|url-access=registration|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15605-8 |access-date=7 February 2013}}</ref> The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] throughout the 18th century. Political tension between England and its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] grew after 1765 and the [[Seven Years' War]] over the issue of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]], culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of a new republic, and the resulting [[American Revolutionary War]] to defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The [[Articles of Confederation]], written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The [[United States in Congress Assembled|Confederation Congress]] called a [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new [[Constitution of the United States]] establishing a [[Federation|federal]] government.

France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. However, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in [[Liberalism and radicalism in Italy|Italy]] and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy and ended the secular power of the Popes. However, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'' in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelling the Jesuit order]]. By the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged and the ideal of the self-made individual seemed increasingly implausible. Victorian writers like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]] were early influential critics of social injustice.<ref name=\"Richardson, pp. 36\u201337\"/>\n\nLiberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The bastion of [[autocracy]], the [[Nicholas II|Russian Tsar]], was overthrown in the [[February Revolution|first phase]] of the [[Russian Revolution]]. The Allied victory in the [[First World War]] and the collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across the European continent, not just among the [[Allies of World War I|victorious allies]], but also in Germany and the newly created states of [[Eastern Europe]]. Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of \"cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]\".\n\nIn the Middle East, liberalism led to constitutional periods, like the Ottoman [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First]] and [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] and the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Persian constitutional period]], but it declined in the late 1930s due the growth and opposition of [[Islamism]] and [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kurzman|first1=Charles|title=Liberal Islam: A Source Book|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195116229|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8HSe9SfXMC&pg=PA10|access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Moaddel1\">{{cite book|last1=Moaddel|first1=Mansoor|title=Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226533339|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk6BLopmn3gC&pg=PA4}}</ref><ref name=\"lapidus\">{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies |last=Lapidus |first=Ira Marvin |author-link= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0521779333 |page=496 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&pg=PA496}}</ref><ref name=\"LorentzIran\">{{cite book|last1=Lorentz|first1=John H.|title=The A to Z of Iran|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1461731917|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9WwxXbCB8C&pg=PA224|access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"LindgrenRoss\"/> However, there were various examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas.

The first and best-known Black Widow is a [[Russians|Russian]] agent trained as a spy, martial artist, and sniper, and outfitted with an arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including a pair of wrist-mounted energy weapons dubbed her \"Widow's Bite\". She wears no costume during her first few appearances but simply [[formal wear|evening wear]] and a veil. Romanova eventually defects to the U.S. for reasons that include her love for the reluctant-criminal turned superhero [[Archery|archer]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].\n\nThe first hints to Natasha Romanova's childhood come from Ivan Petrovich, who is introduced as her middle-aged chauffeur and confidant in the Black Widow's 1970s ''[[Amazing Adventures]]''. Petrovich tells [[Matt Murdock]] that he had been given custody of little Natasha by a woman who died immediately afterwards, during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in autumn 1942.

She pilots a ship holding a handpicked few to restart humanity after the universe ends, copiloted by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]]. Her ship is shot down during the battle though, and she is killed in the ensuing explosion.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>\n\nAs the evacuation of Earth-616 begins in light of the fact that Earth-1610 is about to come crashing down as part of the \"Last Days\" storyline, Black Widow is seen standing atop a building with Captain America who gives her a list of people to save and bring aboard the lifeboat. As she tells Sam she can't save them all, Sam explains it's Natasha's job to assist in the effort to save as many people as possible before Earth as they know it is destroyed. As she leaves, her mind transitions to [[Cold War]] Russia, where a young Natasha (here called Natalia) speaks with two Russian functionaries in the infamous \"Red Room\". She is given her first mission: travel to Cuba and locate a family called the Comienzas, who are at risk from [[Ra\u00fal Castro]]'s regime and who may have information of vital importance to Russia. She is told to rendezvous with another agent, her classmate Marina, and befriend the family under the guise of a Russian businesswoman. Natasha assures them of her competency and leaves. When one of the officers questions her youth, the other assures him, \"she's a killer. She will not disappoint.\" Natasha meets Marina in Cuba and the two friends catch up before meeting with the Comienzas that night at a local bar. Using her talent for deception, she casually and politely convinces the husband and wife that she's seeking inside information to help her import various goods into the country. The Comienzas explain they can't reveal said information, prompting Natasha to later explain to Marina that the family might need \"a little push\". Not too soon she effectively began terrorizing the family into desperation. First, she plants an American flag on their doorstep to mimic someone accusing them of defecting to the United States. Later after meeting with one of the Russian officers from the Red Room to report her progress, she detonated a car bomb outside their home when the first attempt didn't make them \"nearly desperate enough\". Following the car bomb explosion, Natasha declares the family is indeed desperate enough to reproach for information. Before letting Natasha go, the officer announces she has one additional task before her mission is over: Marina has become too much enamored with her civilian guise, and is now a security risk. Natasha will have to eliminate her.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #19</ref> Flipping to the present, Black Widow is saving as many people as she can, but she quickly flashbacks to Havana. Natasha and her then Red Room partner Marina are trying to help a family defect. Natasha's orders are simple: Kill the parents and make it public. When Natasha asks if she should kill the child too, her boss looks horrified that she would be so OK with that and tells her no. Having no problem following orders she sets up a meet and using a sniper rifle she takes out the pair without blinking. Next she shoots Marina's boyfriend then Marina herself. Next she shoots Marina's cat. Flipping back to the present, Black Widow is back saving people from the incursion as the reason that triggered Natasha's flashback is revealed ... a man she saved is holding his cat.

Created by editor and plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Don Rico]], and artist [[Don Heck]], the character debuted in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964). The character was introduced as a [[Russia]]n [[espionage|spy]], an antagonist of the superhero [[Iron Man]]. She later [[Defection|defected]] to the United States, becoming an agent of the fictional spy agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and a member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\n[[Scarlett Johansson]] portrays the [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (both 2019).

Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Paul Reinman]]]]\n\nThe Black Widow's first appearances were as a recurring, non-costumed, [[Russia]]n-[[espionage|spy]] antagonist in the feature \"[[Iron Man]]\", beginning in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964). Five issues later, she recruits the besotted costumed archer and later superhero [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] to her cause. Her government later supplies her with her first Black Widow costume and high-tech weaponry, but she eventually defects to the United States after appearing, temporarily brainwashed against the U.S., in the superhero-team series ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #29 (July 1966). The Widow later becomes a recurring ally of the team before officially becoming its sixteenth member many years later.\n\nThe Black Widow was visually updated in 1970: ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #86 (July 1970) reintroduced her with shoulder-length red hair (instead of her former short black hair), a skintight black costume, and wristbands which fired spider threads. This would become the appearance most commonly associated with the character.<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal|last= Carson|first= Lex|date= December 2010|title= Daredevil and the Black Widow: A Swinging Couple of Crimefighters|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45| pages= 31\u201338|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nIn short order, The Black Widow starred in her own series in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #1\u20138 (Aug. 1970\u2013Sept. 1971), sharing that split book with the feature [[Inhumans]]. The Black Widow feature was dropped after only eight issues (the Inhumans feature followed soon, ending with issue 10).<ref name=\"back45\"/>\n\nImmediately after her initial solo feature ended, the Black Widow co-starred in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] '' #81\u2013124 (Nov. 1971\u2013Aug. 1975), of which #92-107 were cover titled ''Daredevil and the Black Widow''. ''Daredevil'' writer [[Gerry Conway]] recounted, \"It was my idea to team up Daredevil and the Black Widow, mainly because I was a fan of Natasha, and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry.\"<ref name=\"back45\"/> Succeeding writers, however, felt that Daredevil worked better as a solo hero, and gradually wrote the Black Widow out of the series.<ref name=\"back45\"/> She was immediately recast into the super-team series ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' as the leader of the titular superhero group, which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975\u2013Jan. 1978).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17\u201323|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Black Widow appeared frequently as both an Avengers member and a freelance agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She starred in a serialized feature within the omnibus comic-book series ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #10\u201313 (Aug. 1983\u2013March 1984), written by [[George P\u00e9rez]] and [[Ralph Macchio (editor)|Ralph Macchio]], with art by [[penciller]] Perez. These stories were later collected in the oversized [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Black Widow: Web of Intrigue'' #1 (June 1999).\n\nThe Widow guest-starred in issues of ''Solo Avengers'', ''[[Force Works]]'', ''Iron Man'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', and other comics.

From ''The Avengers'' #36 (Jan. 1967), art by [[Don Heck]].]]\nNatasha was born in [[Stalingrad]] (now Volgograd), [[RSFSR|Russia]], [[USSR]]. The first and best-known Black Widow is a [[Russians|Russian]] agent trained as a spy, martial artist, and sniper, and outfitted with an arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including a pair of wrist-mounted energy weapons dubbed her \"Widow's Bite\". She wears no costume during her first few appearances but simply [[formal wear|evening wear]] and a veil. Romanova eventually defects to the U.S. for reasons that include her love for the reluctant-criminal turned superhero [[Archery|archer]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].\n\nThe first hints to Natasha Romanova's childhood come from Ivan Petrovich, who is introduced as her middle-aged chauffeur and confidant in the Black Widow's 1970s ''[[Amazing Adventures]]''. Petrovich tells [[Matt Murdock]] that he had been given custody of little Natasha by a woman who died immediately afterwards, during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in autumn 1942. He consequently felt committed to raise the orphan as a surrogate father and she eventually trained as a [[Soviet]] spy, being eager to help her homeland.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' issue #88 (June 1972)</ref> In another [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], set in the fictional island of [[Madripoor]] in 1941, Petrovich helps [[Captain America]] and the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Logan, who would later become the [[Canadians|Canadian]] super-agent and costumed hero [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], to rescue Natasha from [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' issue #268 (Sept. 1990)</ref>\n\nA revised, [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] origin establishes her as being raised from very early childhood by the U.S.S.R.'s \"Black Widow Ops\" program, rather than solely by Ivan Petrovitch.<ref>''Black Widow'' #1\u20136 (Nov. 2004\u2013April 2005)</ref> Petrovitch had taken her to Department X, with other young female orphans, where she was [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and trained in combat and espionage at the covert \"[[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]]\" facility. There, she is biotechnologically and psycho-technologically enhanced\u2014which provides a rationale for her unusually long and youthful lifespan. During that time she had some training under the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], and the pair even had a short romance.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5, #27 (Aug. 2007)</ref> Each Black Widow is deployed with false memories to help ensure her loyalty. Romanova eventually discovers this, including the fact that she had never, as she had believed, been a [[ballerina]]. She further discovers that the Red Room is still active as \"2R\".\n\nThe KGB arranged a marriage between Natasha and the renowned Soviet test pilot [[Red Guardian#Alexei Shostakov|Alexei Shostakov]]. However, when the Soviet government decided to make Shostakov into their new operative, the Red Guardian, he is told that he can have no further contact with his wife. Natasha is told that he died and is trained as a secret agent separately.\n\n===The Avengers===\nRomanova grew up to serve as a femme fatale. She was assigned to assist [[Crimson Dynamo#The second Crimson Dynamo|Boris Turgenov]] in the assassination of [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Professor Anton Vanko]] for defecting from the Soviet Union, which served as her first mission in the United States. Natasha and Turgenov infiltrated [[Stark Industries]] as part of the plan.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol 1 #52</ref> She attempted to manipulate information from American [[defense contractor]] Tony Stark, and inevitably confronted his superhero alter ego, [[Iron Man]]. The pair then battled Iron Man, and Turgenov stole and wore the Crimson Dynamo suit. Vanko sacrificed himself to save Iron Man, killing Turgenov in the process, using an unstable experimental laser light pistol.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #52\u201353 (Apr. 1964\u2013May 1964)</ref> Romanova later meets the criminal archer [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and sets him against Iron Man,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and later helped Hawkeye battle Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #60 (Dec. 1964)</ref>\n\nLater, Natasha again attempted to get Hawkeye to help her destroy Iron Man. The pair almost succeeded, but when Black Widow was injured, Hawkeye retreated to get her to safety.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #64</ref> During this period, Romanova was attempting to defect from the Soviet Union and began falling in love with Hawkeye, weakening her loyalty to her country.

She pilots a ship holding a handpicked few to restart humanity after the universe ends, copiloted by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]]. Her ship is shot down during the battle though, and she is killed in the ensuing explosion.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>\n\nAs the evacuation of Earth-616 begins in light of the fact that Earth-1610 is about to come crashing down as part of the \"Last Days\" storyline, Black Widow is seen standing atop a building with Captain America who gives her a list of people to save and bring aboard the lifeboat. As she tells Sam she can't save them all, Sam explains it's Natasha's job to assist in the effort to save as many people as possible before Earth as they know it is destroyed. As she leaves, her mind transitions to [[Cold War]] Russia, where a young Natasha (here called Natalia) speaks with two Russian functionaries in the infamous \"Red Room\". She is given her first mission: travel to Cuba and locate a family called the Comienzas, who are at risk from [[Ra\u00fal Castro]]'s regime and who may have information of vital importance to Russia. She is told to rendezvous with another agent, her classmate Marina, and befriend the family under the guise of a Russian businesswoman. Natasha assures them of her competency and leaves. When one of the officers questions her youth, the other assures him, \"she's a killer. She will not disappoint.\" Natasha meets Marina in Cuba and the two friends catch up before meeting with the Comienzas that night at a local bar. Using her talent for deception, she casually and politely convinces the husband and wife that she's seeking inside information to help her import various goods into the country. The Comienzas explain they can't reveal said information, prompting Natasha to later explain to Marina that the family might need \"a little push\". Not too soon she effectively began terrorizing the family into desperation. First, she plants an American flag on their doorstep to mimic someone accusing them of defecting to the United States. Later after meeting with one of the Russian officers from the Red Room to report her progress, she detonated a car bomb outside their home when the first attempt didn't make them \"nearly desperate enough\". Following the car bomb explosion, Natasha declares the family is indeed desperate enough to reproach for information. Before letting Natasha go, the officer announces she has one additional task before her mission is over: Marina has become too much enamored with her civilian guise, and is now a security risk. Natasha will have to eliminate her.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #19</ref> Flipping to the present, Black Widow is saving as many people as she can, but she quickly flashbacks to Havana. Natasha and her then Red Room partner Marina are trying to help a family defect. Natasha's orders are simple: Kill the parents and make it public. When Natasha asks if she should kill the child too, her boss looks horrified that she would be so OK with that and tells her no. Having no problem following orders she sets up a meet and using a sniper rifle she takes out the pair without blinking. Next she shoots Marina's boyfriend then Marina herself. Next she shoots Marina's cat. Flipping back to the present, Black Widow is back saving people from the incursion as the reason that triggered Natasha's flashback is revealed ... a man she saved is holding his cat. This dark, heartless side of the Black Widow shows why she is trying so hard to do good today.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #20</ref>\n\n===Secret Empire===\n{{long plot|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" storyline, Black Widow appears as a member of the underground resistance at the time when most of the United States has been taken over by Hydra and Captain America who was brainwashed by Red Skull's clone using the powers of the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]] into believing that he was a Hydra sleeper agent.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> While Hawkeye assembles a strike force of Hercules and Quicksilver to find the Cosmic Cube fragments, Black Widow sets off to kill Rogers herself reasoning that even if Rick's theory is true, the man Rogers was would prefer to die than be used in this manner.
