He received the [[Medal of Honor]] for gallantry during the [[Siege of Vicksburg]] on May 22, 1863.\n\n==Union assault==\nOn May 22, 1863, General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack.\n\nThe volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \"forlorn hope\". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.\nThe Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed.  Seventy-nine of the survivors were awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\n==Medal of Honor citation==\n<blockquote>For gallantry in the charge of the volunteer storming party on 22 May 1863.</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|American Civil War}}\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients]]\n*[[List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: A\u2013F]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web\n |accessdate=July 13, 2010\n |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html\n |title= Civil War (A-L), Armstrong, Clinton L. entry\n |work= Medal of Honor recipients\n |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n |date= August 6, 2009\n}}\n*{{Hall of Valor|518|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}\n*{{Find a Grave|7881749|work=Claim to Fame: Medal of Honor recipients|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}\n*{{Cite web|accessdate=September 29, 2010 |url=http://oregonmag.com/CivilWarFletcher1108.html |title=A Forlorn Hope |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011003120/http://oregonmag.com/CivilWarFletcher1108.html |archivedate=October 11, 2010 }}\n*{{Cite web |accessdate=September 29, 2010 |url=http://www.nps.gov/vick/historyculture/vicksburg-medal-of-honor-recipients.htm |title=Vicksburg Medal of Honor recipients}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Armstrong, Clinton L.}}\n[[Category:1844 births]]\n[[Category:1899 deaths]]\n[[Category:Union Army soldiers]]\n[[Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients]]\n[[Category:People of Indiana in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:American Civil War recipients of the Medal of Honor]]\n[[Category:People from Franklin, Indiana]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n|name          = Clinton L.
