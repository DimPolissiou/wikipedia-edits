Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html |title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit |date=March 8, 1932 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf |title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys |date=October 16, 1940 |work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

This resulted in a \"tiered\" balcony system where several shallow balconies were built at the back of the theater, cantilevered off the back wall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Second, Roxy specified that the stage contain a central section with three parts, so that the [[Set construction|sets]] could be changed easily.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Roxy also wanted red seats because he believed it would make the theater successful.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} He wished for an auditorium with an oval shape because contemporary wisdom held that oval-shaped auditoriums had better acoustic qualities.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=94}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} Finally, he wanted to build at least 6,201 seats in the Music Hall so it would be larger than the Roxy Theatre. There were only 5,960 audience seats, but Roxy counted exactly 6,201 seats by including elevator stools, [[orchestra pit]] seats, and dressing-room chairs.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|pp=217\u2013218}}\n\nDespite Roxy's specific requests for design features, the Music Hall's general design was determined by the Associated Architects, the architectural consortium that was designing the rest of Rockefeller Center.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} The Radio City Music Hall was designed by architect [[Edward Durell Stone]]{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=7}} and interior designer [[Donald Deskey]]{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=10}} in the [[Art Deco]] style.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=1}} Stone used [[Indiana Limestone]] for the facade, as with all the other buildings in Rockefeller Center, but he also included some distinguishing features. Three {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented [[fire escape]]s were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets. Inside, Stone designed {{convert|165|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Grand Foyer with a large staircase, balconies, and mirrors, and commissioned [[Ezra Winter]] for the grand foyer's {{convert|2400|ft2|m2|adj=on}} mural, \"Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth\".{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} Deskey, meanwhile, was selected as part of a competition for interior designers for the Music Hall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=220}} He had reportedly called Winter's painting \"God-awful\" and regarded the interior and exterior as not much better.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}} To make the Music Hall presentable in his opinion, Deskey designed upholstery and furniture that was custom to the Hall.

The entrance's location, which was enhanced by the amount of open space in front of that corner, ensured that the hall could easily be seen from the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Broadway theater district]] a block to the west.

Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each embedded into the northern and southern walls, and two in the middle, facing the booths in the walls. Large black pillars support a low, slightly [[coffer]]ed ceiling.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=16}}  The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\nTo the ticket lobby's east, and the advance sales lobby's northeast, is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Two long, tubular chandeliers created by [[Edward F.

The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is located to the west of the northern exit vestibule.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by [[Edward Trumbull]], and represent wine, women, and song.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=51}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\n====Auditorium====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of stage and orchestra seating from mezzanine seating]]\nThe auditorium itself is very large and striking. Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: \"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=Secrets of the Magic Theater |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=27 |date=January 1941 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news | title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale |first=Walter Rendell |last=Storey | work=The New York Times | date=December 25, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site.

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html |title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit |date=March 8, 1932 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf |title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys |date=October 16, 1940 |work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

There were only 5,960 audience seats, but Roxy counted exactly 6,201 seats by including elevator stools, [[orchestra pit]] seats, and dressing-room chairs.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|pp=217\u2013218}}\n\nDespite Roxy's specific requests for design features, the Music Hall's general design was determined by the Associated Architects, the architectural consortium that was designing the rest of Rockefeller Center.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} The Radio City Music Hall was designed by architect [[Edward Durell Stone]]{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=7}} and interior designer [[Donald Deskey]]{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=10}} in the [[Art Deco]] style.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=1}} Stone used [[Indiana Limestone]] for the facade, as with all the other buildings in Rockefeller Center, but he also included some distinguishing features. Three {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented [[fire escape]]s were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets. Inside, Stone designed {{convert|165|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Grand Foyer with a large staircase, balconies, and mirrors, and commissioned [[Ezra Winter]] for the grand foyer's {{convert|2400|ft2|m2|adj=on}} mural, \"Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth\".{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} Deskey, meanwhile, was selected as part of a competition for interior designers for the Music Hall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=220}} He had reportedly called Winter's painting \"God-awful\" and regarded the interior and exterior as not much better.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}} To make the Music Hall presentable in his opinion, Deskey designed upholstery and furniture that was custom to the Hall.

Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each embedded into the northern and southern walls, and two in the middle, facing the booths in the walls. Large black pillars support a low, slightly [[coffer]]ed ceiling.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=16}}  The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\nTo the ticket lobby's east, and the advance sales lobby's northeast, is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Two long, tubular chandeliers created by [[Edward F.

The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is located to the west of the northern exit vestibule.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by [[Edward Trumbull]], and represent wine, women, and song.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=51}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\n====Auditorium====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of stage and orchestra seating from mezzanine seating]]\nThe auditorium itself is very large and striking. Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: \"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=Secrets of the Magic Theater |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=27 |date=January 1941 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news | title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale |first=Walter Rendell |last=Storey | work=The New York Times | date=December 25, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site. The offstage rooms include a [[carpenter (theatre)|carpenter]]'s studio, a [[scene shop]], sewing rooms, dressing rooms for 600 people, a [[green room]] for performers' guests, and a dormitory.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Radio City Music Hall To Be Opened Dec. 27; Brilliant Program Is Planned for Premiere \u2013 Theatre to Have Dormitory for the Chorus. |work=The New York Times |date=November 18, 1932 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/11/18/105886921.pdf | access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe elevator system was designed by Peter Clark and built by Otis Elevators.

In short, the Beastie Boys cleared the sample but obtained only the rights to use the sound recording and not the composition rights to the song \"Choir\". In the decision, the judge found that:\n\n{{quote|when viewed in relation to Newton's composition as a whole, the portion is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant... Because Beastie Boys' use of the sound recording was authorized, the sole basis of Newton's infringement action is his remaining copyright interest in the 'Choir' composition. We hold today that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for copyright infringement.<ref name=legal>{{cite web|title=Newton v.

In short, the Beastie Boys cleared the sample but obtained only the rights to use the sound recording and not the composition rights to the song \"Choir\". In the decision, the judge found that:\n\n{{quote|when viewed in relation to Newton's composition as a whole, the portion is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant... Because Beastie Boys' use of the sound recording was authorized, the sole basis of Newton's infringement action is his remaining copyright interest in the 'Choir' composition. We hold today that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for copyright infringement.<ref name=legal>{{cite web|title=Newton v.

With her husband and former partner, [[Chris Knierim]], she is a [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Team event|2018 Olympic]] bronze medalist in the figure skating team event, the [[2016 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2016 Four Continents]] silver medalist, the [[2014 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2014 Four Continents]] bronze medalist, a three-time [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] medalist, and a three-time U.S. national champion ([[2015 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2015]], [[2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2018]], [[2020 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2020]]). At the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the Knierims became the first American pair, and the second pair ever in history, to perform a quad twist at the Olympics.\n\n==Personal life==\nAlexa Scimeca was born June 10, 1991, in [[Addison, Illinois]].<ref name=ISU-1516/> She has two siblings, a brother and a sister. She and [[Chris Knierim]] became skating partners in April 2012, and began dating about a month later. They became engaged on April 8, 2014,<ref name=IN140602/> and married on June 26, 2016, in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].<ref name=IN160628/> The couple currently lives and trains in [[Irvine, California]].\n\n==Skating career==\n===Early career===\n\nScimeca began skating in 1998.<ref name=ISU-1718/> She was coached by Trish Cazeau Brown and Sergei Telenkov from 1998 to 2008, by [[Maria Je\u017cak-Athey]] in 2008\u20132009, and by [[Vadim Naumov]] and [[Evgenia Shishkova]] from 2010 to 2011.<ref name=USFS-ASCK/>\nIn the 2011\u20132012 season, Scimeca began pair skating with [[Ivan Dimitrov (figure skater)|Ivan Dimitrov]], with whom she trained in [[Connecticut]].<ref name=IN120729/> In 2012, she moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], and began being coached by [[Dalilah Sappenfield]].\n\n===Teaming up with Chris Knierim and 2012-2013 season===\nSappenfield suggested that Scimeca skate with [[Chris Knierim]]. They teamed up in April 2012.<ref name=IN121029/> They began training with Sappenfield, [[Larry Ibarra]], and various other coaches at the [[Broadmoor World Arena (1998)|Broadmoor World Arena]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].<ref name=IN120729/>\n\nScimeca/Knierim won the gold medal in their first international event, the [[2012 Coupe Internationale de Nice]] in October.<ref name=IN121029/> After a number of withdrawals by other teams, they received a [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] assignment, the [[2012 NHK Trophy]] in November, where they placed fourth.\n\nThe pair won the silver medal at the [[2013 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2013 U.S. Championships]] in January. They were assigned to the [[2013 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2013 Four Continents Championships]] but withdrew just before the event when Scimeca injured her right foot in practice.<ref name=USFS130207/> Scimeca/Knierim were named to the U.S. team for the [[2013 World Figure Skating Championships|2013 World Championships]] after [[Caydee Denney]] / [[John Coughlin (figure skater)|John Coughlin]] withdrew.<ref name=USFS130218/> They placed ninth in their World Championships debut in March.\n\n===2013\u20132014 season===\nScimeca/Knierim experienced a setback that hampered their season when Knierim broke his left fibula in July. He underwent surgery that placed a metal plate and nine screws in his ankle.<ref name=IN141025/> While Knierim was able to heal relatively quickly, the team believed they rushed back to competition a bit too soon. In January, they won the pewter medal at the [[2014 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2014 U.S. Championships]] and were named second alternates to the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympic]] team. They then won the bronze medal at the 2014 [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]]. Their second place short program score of 66.04 set a new record for the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team. Knierim had additional surgery in March to remove the metal hardware in his leg, which had been causing discomfort.<ref name=GS150127/>\n\n===2014\u20132015 season: First national title===\nScimeca/Knierim won the gold medal in their first ISU Challenger series event, the [[2014 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic| 2014 U.S. International Classic]], and won the bronze medal at [[2014 CS Nebelhorn Trophy| 2014 Nebelhorn Trophy]]. They were assigned two Grand Prix events, placing fourth at both [[2014 Skate America]] and [[2014 Troph\u00e9e \u00c9ric Bompard]].\n\nAt the [[2015 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2015 U.S. Championships]], Scimeca/Knierim captured their first national title, setting new U.S. record scores in both the short program and the free skate. They also became the first American pair team in history to perform a quadruple twist in competition.<ref name=GS150127/>\n\nAt the [[2015 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2015 Four Continents Championships]], Scimeca/Knierim placed fifth and earned new ISU personal best scores of 124.44 in the free skate and 187.98 total, setting new records for the highest scores ever achieved by a U.S. pair team in an international event. At the [[2015 World Figure Skating Championships|2015 World Championships]], the pair placed 7th, the highest finish by a U.S. pair since 2011. They then competed at the [[2015 ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|2015 World Team Trophy]], finishing 4th in the short program and 3rd in the free skate, which ultimately was a key factor in Team USA winning the gold medal. Scimeca/Knierim earned new personal best scores of 127.87 in the free skate and 192.09 total, setting new records once again for the highest scores ever recorded by a U.S. pair team in international competition.<ref name=ISUStat>{{cite news |url= http://www.isu.org/en/single-and-pair-skating-and-ice-dance/statistics-and-world-standings/statistics-including-personal-bestseason-best-information |title= Statistics including Personal Best/Season Best information |publisher= [[International Skating Union]] |access-date= 2015-05-27 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141221231951/http://www.isu.org/en/single-and-pair-skating-and-ice-dance/statistics-and-world-standings/statistics-including-personal-bestseason-best-information |archive-date= 2014-12-21 |url-status= dead }}</ref> \n\nScimeca/Knierim won SKATING magazine\u2019s 2015 Readers\u2019 Choice Skaters of the Year Award, also known as the Michelle Kwan Trophy.<ref>https://www.usfsa.org/story?id=84178&menu=skatingmagazine</ref>\n\n=== 2015\u20132016 season: First Grand Prix medals and silver at Four Continents ===\nScimeca/Knierim began their season at [[2015 Nebelhorn Trophy]] where they won the silver medal behind reigning Olympic champions [[Tatiana Volosozhar]] / [[Maxim Trankov]].<ref name=GS151016/> The team then competed at [[2015 Skate America]] where they won the silver medal. They earned a new personal best short program score of 69.69, setting a new record for the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team in international competition. The following week, they won the gold medal at [[2015 CS Ice Challenge|2015 Ice Challenge]] in Graz, Austria.\n\nScimeca/Knierim went on to win the bronze medal at [[2015 NHK Trophy]] which helped qualify them for the [[2015\u201316 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2015\u201316 Grand Prix Final]] in [[Barcelona]], where they placed seventh. They were the first U.S. pair since 2007 to qualify for the Grand Prix Final.<ref name=IN151203/> The pair entered the [[2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2016 U.S. Championships]] as the heavy favorite for the title, but won the silver medal after costly errors.\n\nAt the [[2016 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2016 Four Continents Championships]], Scimeca/Knierim won the silver medal in their best competitive outing to date.<ref name=GS160220/> They earned new personal best scores of 140.35 in the free skate and 207.96 total, which are the highest scores ever recorded by a U.S. pair team in international competition.<ref name=ISUStat/> A subsequent injury to Knierim limited the team's training before the [[2016 World Figure Skating Championships|2016 World Championships]], where they placed 9th. They were 7th in the short program with a personal best score of 71.37, which set a new record for the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team in international competition.<ref name=ISUStat/> The pair then competed for Team North America at the inaugural [[2016 Team Challenge Cup]], where the team won the gold medal.\n\n===2016\u20132017 season: Major illness, surgery, and successful return===\nAlexa Scimeca Knierim became sick in April 2016, and her illness interrupted the Knierims' training throughout the summer months. She was properly diagnosed with a rare, life-threatening gastrointestinal condition in August and underwent two abdominal surgeries that month.<ref name=NBC170321/><ref name=IN170214/> The pair resumed light training in late September.<ref name=USFS160928/> Scimeca Knierim underwent additional surgery on November 1 and returned to training by the middle of that month.<ref name=NBC170321/>\n\nScimeca Knierim's illness involved regular episodes of vomiting, debilitating pain, difficulties with sleeping, eating or drinking, as well as significant weight loss.<ref name=NBC170321/> Already small, she lost 20 pounds and shrunk to just over 80 pounds.<ref name=USA171121/><ref name=PEO180208/> Knierim stated that when his wife initially returned to the ice following surgery, she had to hold his hands just to skate a lap around the rink and could only skate for 10 minutes before having to go home for a nap because it was so physically draining on her body.<ref name=FSO170323/> The pair withdrew from both of their [[2016\u201317 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] events, the [[2016 Rostelecom Cup]] and [[2016 Cup of China]], and the [[2017 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2017 U.S. Championships]]. They resumed full training in January<ref name=USFS170111/> and were named to the U.S. team for both the [[2017 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2017 Four Continents Championships]] and the [[2017 World Figure Skating Championships|2017 World Championships]].\n\nIn February, the Knierims made a strong return to competition at the [[2017 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2017 Four Continents Championships]], where they placed sixth in a deep field of Chinese and Canadian pairs. Their total score was the second highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team, behind only their score from Four Continents the prior year. The pair then competed at the [[2017 World Figure Skating Championships|2017 World Championships]], where they skated two strong programs and placed 10th in an exceptionally deep field. 5th through 10th place were separated by just 4.35 points. They placed 8th in the short program with a personal best score of 72.17, the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team. They were the only U.S. pair to qualify for the free skate. \n\nTheir total score of 202.37 is the second highest in U.S. pairs history, and they are the only U.S. pair to have ever surpassed the 200 point barrier.<ref name=\"RS170403\" /> This was the Knierims' fourth top 10 finish in their four Worlds appearances. They are the only U.S. pair in the past five years to have earned top 10 finishes at the World Championships.\n\n===2017\u20132018 season: Second national title and Pyeongchang Olympics===\nThe Knierims began their season at the [[2017 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic| 2017 U.S. International Classic]], where they won the silver medal and were narrowly edged by Canadians Kirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Marinaro. They placed 1st in the free skate after having changed their long program in the week prior to the event.<ref name=IN170915/> The team then competed at two Grand Prix events, [[2017 NHK Trophy]] and [[2017 Skate America]], where they placed a solid fifth in deep fields at both events. It was revealed after Skate America that Chris Knierim was recovering from a patella injury.<ref name=IN171125/> The Knierims have been the top U.S. finisher at every international event they have entered for the past three years. Their scores throughout the Grand Prix season were the clear highest by a U.S. pair team.\n\nAt the [[2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2018 U.S. Championships]], the Knierims won their second National title with a score of 206.60. They placed 1st in the short program, 1st in the free skate, and performed a quadruple twist in competition for the first time since 2016. They are one of the only pairs in the world capable of doing a quad twist. Following the event, the Knierims were named to the [[United States at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 U.S. Olympic Team]] that competed at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang, South Korea]]. They were the sole U.S. pair team at this Olympic Games.<ref name=US1817/>\n\nAt the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the Knierims won an Olympic bronze medal in the [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Team event|figure skating team event]] as a key part of the U.S. team. They placed a strong 4th in the short program with a season's best score, and placed 4th in the free skate. Their total score was the highest of their season. In the pair event, they were 14th in the short program and finished 15th overall in what was the strongest Olympic pair competition to date. In the free skate, the Knierims became the first U.S. pair, and the second pair ever in history, to successfully perform a quad twist at the Olympics.<ref name=NEWS180214/>\n\nWeeks later, the Knierims competed at the [[2018 World Figure Skating Championships|2018 World Championships]]. They placed 11th in the short program with a strong performance and were less than three points from the top 5. They finished 15th overall after an uncharacteristically shaky skate by Alexa that included a fall on a death spiral. They were the only U.S. pair to qualify for the free skate.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, [[U.S. Figure Skating]] announced that the Knierims had left their coach, [[Dalilah Sappenfield]], to train with [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Olympic champion]] [[Aljona Savchenko]] and her coaching staff. They began training part-time in [[Oberstdorf|Oberstdorf, Germany]].<ref name=USFS180514/>\n\n===2018\u20132019 season: Third Grand Prix medal and coaching changes===\nThe Knierims started their season at [[2018 CS Nebelhorn Trophy| 2018 Nebelhorn Trophy]] where they won the silver medal. They placed 1st in the short program and finished 2nd overall, just one point from 1st. They then competed at their first [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] event of the season, [[2018 Skate America]], where they placed 4th. They were without a coach at the event, and it was announced on October 20, 2018, in the middle of the free skate, that they had very recently split from their coach Aljona Savchenko, which the Knierims confirmed after the event.<ref name=NBC181020/>\n\nIn early November, the Knierims won the bronze medal at their second Grand Prix event, [[2018 NHK Trophy]], ahead of Canadians [[Kirsten Moore-Towers]] and [[Michael Marinaro]]. They were coached at the event by [[Todd Sand]] and had relocated to California during the two weeks between their Grand Prix events. They officially began training with [[Jenni Meno]] and [[Todd Sand]] in late November. In early December, they won the silver medal at [[2018 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb| 2018 Golden Spin of Zagreb]], placing 1st in the free skate and finishing one point from 1st overall.\n\nIn January at the [[2019 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2019 U.S. Championships]], the Knierims placed a very unexpected seventh after a series of unusual mishaps. In the short program, they had an uncharacteristic big error on their signature triple twist, typically their best element.<ref name=GS190124/> In the free skate, they surprisingly aborted their second lift and missed their third lift entirely. It was revealed after the competition that Chris Knierim had been suffering from a torn wrist ligament that required surgery to repair. He remarked afterward that \"the program went how our year went, a lot of unplanned mishaps.\"<ref name=GS190126/> He underwent surgery to repair his wrist during the off-season.<ref name=NBC191029/>\n\n===2019\u20132020 season: Third national title and split===\nThe Knierims added [[Rafael Arutyunyan]] to their coaching team during the off-season.<ref name=USFS191120/> They had a strong start to their season at [[2019 CS Nebelhorn Trophy]] where they won the silver medal with a total score of 202.41. Their free skate score of 131.58 was the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team under the current version of the judging system.<ref name=NBC191029/> \n\nThe Knierims then competed at their first [[2019-20 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] event of the season, [[2019 Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]], where they skated strongly and placed fourth, less than three points behind reigning World silver medalists [[Evgenia Tarasova]] and [[Vladimir Morozov (figure skater)|Vladimir Morozov]].<ref name=GS191026/><ref name=GS191027/>  At their second Grand Prix event, [[2019 NHK Trophy]], they placed fifth in the short program with a fall and a completely invalidated death spiral. After a free skate with many errors, including a costly missed lift, they placed seventh overall.<ref name=GS191122/>\n\nIn January at the [[2020 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2020 U.S. Championships]], the Knierims won their third national title with a score of 216.15, the highest score ever achieved in U.S. competition. They skated a completely clean short program and scored 77.06, a new record at the U.S. Championships, and won that segment by nearly seven points.<ref name=GS200123/> After leaving some points on the table in an otherwise strong free skate performance, they placed second in that segment and first overall after having a nearly ten point lead over silver medalists [[Jessica Calalang|Calalang]]/[[Brian Johnson (figure skater)|Johnson]] from the short program. The Knierims were the first U.S. pair team to win three national titles since 2002.<ref name=GS200125/>\n\nLess than two weeks after the U.S. Championships, the Knierims competed at the [[2020 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2020 Four Continents Championships]] in [[Seoul]]. In the short program, they both erred on their side-by-side jump attempt and then Chris slipped on the entry to their side-by-side spin, completely invalidating the element. They placed fifth in the segment.<ref name=GS200206/> The Knierims withdrew the morning of the free skate, citing family illness.<ref name=GS200208/>\n\nThe day the official entry list for Worlds was posted, it was announced that Chris was stepping away from the sport, citing ongoing \"bouts of depression\" that had come to a head at the Four Continents Championships.  It was also announced that Knierim would be seeking a new partner to continue skating, saying as well that \"I'm his wife over being his partner. We know skating ends and life continues. For us, our marriage, our relationship is what's important.\"<ref name=retirement/>\n\n===2020-21 season: New Partnership===\n\nOn March 30, Knierim announced that she was teaming up with [[Brandon Frazier]].<ref name=knierim-frazier>{{cite web | url=https://usfigureskatingfanzone.com/news/2020/3/30/figure-skating-alexa-knierim-and-brandon-frazier-announce-partnership.aspx?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-usfigureskating&utm_content=later-6215670&utm_medium=social&utm_source=instagram | title = Alexa Scimeca Knierim and Brandon Frazier Announce Partnership | date = March 30, 2020 | publisher = USFSA}}</ref>\n\n==Programs==\n(with Knierim)\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!

American [[pair skater]]. With her husband and former partner, [[Chris Knierim]], she is a [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Team event|2018 Olympic]] bronze medalist in the figure skating team event, the [[2016 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2016 Four Continents]] silver medalist, the [[2014 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2014 Four Continents]] bronze medalist, a three-time [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] medalist, and a three-time U.S. national champion ([[2015 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2015]], [[2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2018]], [[2020 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2020]]). At the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the Knierims became the first American pair, and the second pair ever in history, to perform a quad twist at the Olympics.\n\n==Personal life==\nAlexa Scimeca was born June 10, 1991, in [[Addison, Illinois]].<ref name=ISU-1516/> She has two siblings, a brother and a sister. She and [[Chris Knierim]] became skating partners in April 2012, and began dating about a month later. They became engaged on April 8, 2014,<ref name=IN140602/> and married on June 26, 2016, in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].<ref name=IN160628/> The couple currently lives and trains in [[Irvine, California]].\n\n==Skating career==\n===Early career===\n\nScimeca began skating in 1998.<ref name=ISU-1718/> She was coached by Trish Cazeau Brown and Sergei Telenkov from 1998 to 2008, by [[Maria Je\u017cak-Athey]] in 2008\u20132009, and by [[Vadim Naumov]] and [[Evgenia Shishkova]] from 2010 to 2011.<ref name=USFS-ASCK/>\nIn the 2011\u20132012 season, Scimeca began pair skating with [[Ivan Dimitrov (figure skater)|Ivan Dimitrov]], with whom she trained in [[Connecticut]].<ref name=IN120729/> In 2012, she moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], and began being coached by [[Dalilah Sappenfield]].\n\n===Teaming up with Chris Knierim and 2012-2013 season===\nSappenfield suggested that Scimeca skate with [[Chris Knierim]]. They teamed up in April 2012.<ref name=IN121029/> They began training with Sappenfield, [[Larry Ibarra]], and various other coaches at the [[Broadmoor World Arena (1998)|Broadmoor World Arena]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].<ref name=IN120729/>\n\nScimeca/Knierim won the gold medal in their first international event, the [[2012 Coupe Internationale de Nice]] in October.<ref name=IN121029/> After a number of withdrawals by other teams, they received a [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] assignment, the [[2012 NHK Trophy]] in November, where they placed fourth.\n\nThe pair won the silver medal at the [[2013 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2013 U.S. Championships]] in January. They were assigned to the [[2013 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2013 Four Continents Championships]] but withdrew just before the event when Scimeca injured her right foot in practice.<ref name=USFS130207/> Scimeca/Knierim were named to the U.S. team for the [[2013 World Figure Skating Championships|2013 World Championships]] after [[Caydee Denney]] / [[John Coughlin (figure skater)|John Coughlin]] withdrew.<ref name=USFS130218/> They placed ninth in their World Championships debut in March.\n\n===2013\u20132014 season===\nScimeca/Knierim experienced a setback that hampered their season when Knierim broke his left fibula in July. He underwent surgery that placed a metal plate and nine screws in his ankle.<ref name=IN141025/> While Knierim was able to heal relatively quickly, the team believed they rushed back to competition a bit too soon. In January, they won the pewter medal at the [[2014 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2014 U.S. Championships]] and were named second alternates to the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympic]] team. They then won the bronze medal at the 2014 [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]]. Their second place short program score of 66.04 set a new record for the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team. Knierim had additional surgery in March to remove the metal hardware in his leg, which had been causing discomfort.<ref name=GS150127/>\n\n===2014\u20132015 season: First national title===\nScimeca/Knierim won the gold medal in their first ISU Challenger series event, the [[2014 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic| 2014 U.S. International Classic]], and won the bronze medal at [[2014 CS Nebelhorn Trophy| 2014 Nebelhorn Trophy]]. They were assigned two Grand Prix events, placing fourth at both [[2014 Skate America]] and [[2014 Troph\u00e9e \u00c9ric Bompard]].\n\nAt the [[2015 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2015 U.S. Championships]], Scimeca/Knierim captured their first national title, setting new U.S. record scores in both the short program and the free skate. They also became the first American pair team in history to perform a quadruple twist in competition.<ref name=GS150127/>\n\nAt the [[2015 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2015 Four Continents Championships]], Scimeca/Knierim placed fifth and earned new ISU personal best scores of 124.44 in the free skate and 187.98 total, setting new records for the highest scores ever achieved by a U.S. pair team in an international event. At the [[2015 World Figure Skating Championships|2015 World Championships]], the pair placed 7th, the highest finish by a U.S. pair since 2011. They then competed at the [[2015 ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|2015 World Team Trophy]], finishing 4th in the short program and 3rd in the free skate, which ultimately was a key factor in Team USA winning the gold medal. Scimeca/Knierim earned new personal best scores of 127.87 in the free skate and 192.09 total, setting new records once again for the highest scores ever recorded by a U.S. pair team in international competition.<ref name=ISUStat>{{cite news |url= http://www.isu.org/en/single-and-pair-skating-and-ice-dance/statistics-and-world-standings/statistics-including-personal-bestseason-best-information |title= Statistics including Personal Best/Season Best information |publisher= [[International Skating Union]] |access-date= 2015-05-27 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141221231951/http://www.isu.org/en/single-and-pair-skating-and-ice-dance/statistics-and-world-standings/statistics-including-personal-bestseason-best-information |archive-date= 2014-12-21 |url-status= dead }}</ref> \n\nScimeca/Knierim won SKATING magazine\u2019s 2015 Readers\u2019 Choice Skaters of the Year Award, also known as the Michelle Kwan Trophy.<ref>https://www.usfsa.org/story?id=84178&menu=skatingmagazine</ref>\n\n=== 2015\u20132016 season: First Grand Prix medals and silver at Four Continents ===\nScimeca/Knierim began their season at [[2015 Nebelhorn Trophy]] where they won the silver medal behind reigning Olympic champions [[Tatiana Volosozhar]] / [[Maxim Trankov]].<ref name=GS151016/> The team then competed at [[2015 Skate America]] where they won the silver medal. They earned a new personal best short program score of 69.69, setting a new record for the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team in international competition. The following week, they won the gold medal at [[2015 CS Ice Challenge|2015 Ice Challenge]] in Graz, Austria.\n\nScimeca/Knierim went on to win the bronze medal at [[2015 NHK Trophy]] which helped qualify them for the [[2015\u201316 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2015\u201316 Grand Prix Final]] in [[Barcelona]], where they placed seventh. They were the first U.S. pair since 2007 to qualify for the Grand Prix Final.<ref name=IN151203/> The pair entered the [[2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2016 U.S. Championships]] as the heavy favorite for the title, but won the silver medal after costly errors.\n\nAt the [[2016 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2016 Four Continents Championships]], Scimeca/Knierim won the silver medal in their best competitive outing to date.<ref name=GS160220/> They earned new personal best scores of 140.35 in the free skate and 207.96 total, which are the highest scores ever recorded by a U.S. pair team in international competition.<ref name=ISUStat/> A subsequent injury to Knierim limited the team's training before the [[2016 World Figure Skating Championships|2016 World Championships]], where they placed 9th. They were 7th in the short program with a personal best score of 71.37, which set a new record for the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team in international competition.<ref name=ISUStat/> The pair then competed for Team North America at the inaugural [[2016 Team Challenge Cup]], where the team won the gold medal.\n\n===2016\u20132017 season: Major illness, surgery, and successful return===\nAlexa Scimeca Knierim became sick in April 2016, and her illness interrupted the Knierims' training throughout the summer months. She was properly diagnosed with a rare, life-threatening gastrointestinal condition in August and underwent two abdominal surgeries that month.<ref name=NBC170321/><ref name=IN170214/> The pair resumed light training in late September.<ref name=USFS160928/> Scimeca Knierim underwent additional surgery on November 1 and returned to training by the middle of that month.<ref name=NBC170321/>\n\nScimeca Knierim's illness involved regular episodes of vomiting, debilitating pain, difficulties with sleeping, eating or drinking, as well as significant weight loss.<ref name=NBC170321/> Already small, she lost 20 pounds and shrunk to just over 80 pounds.<ref name=USA171121/><ref name=PEO180208/> Knierim stated that when his wife initially returned to the ice following surgery, she had to hold his hands just to skate a lap around the rink and could only skate for 10 minutes before having to go home for a nap because it was so physically draining on her body.<ref name=FSO170323/> The pair withdrew from both of their [[2016\u201317 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] events, the [[2016 Rostelecom Cup]] and [[2016 Cup of China]], and the [[2017 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2017 U.S. Championships]]. They resumed full training in January<ref name=USFS170111/> and were named to the U.S. team for both the [[2017 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2017 Four Continents Championships]] and the [[2017 World Figure Skating Championships|2017 World Championships]].\n\nIn February, the Knierims made a strong return to competition at the [[2017 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2017 Four Continents Championships]], where they placed sixth in a deep field of Chinese and Canadian pairs. Their total score was the second highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team, behind only their score from Four Continents the prior year. The pair then competed at the [[2017 World Figure Skating Championships|2017 World Championships]], where they skated two strong programs and placed 10th in an exceptionally deep field. 5th through 10th place were separated by just 4.35 points. They placed 8th in the short program with a personal best score of 72.17, the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team. They were the only U.S. pair to qualify for the free skate. \n\nTheir total score of 202.37 is the second highest in U.S. pairs history, and they are the only U.S. pair to have ever surpassed the 200 point barrier.<ref name=\"RS170403\" /> This was the Knierims' fourth top 10 finish in their four Worlds appearances. They are the only U.S. pair in the past five years to have earned top 10 finishes at the World Championships.\n\n===2017\u20132018 season: Second national title and Pyeongchang Olympics===\nThe Knierims began their season at the [[2017 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic| 2017 U.S. International Classic]], where they won the silver medal and were narrowly edged by Canadians Kirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Marinaro. They placed 1st in the free skate after having changed their long program in the week prior to the event.<ref name=IN170915/> The team then competed at two Grand Prix events, [[2017 NHK Trophy]] and [[2017 Skate America]], where they placed a solid fifth in deep fields at both events. It was revealed after Skate America that Chris Knierim was recovering from a patella injury.<ref name=IN171125/> The Knierims have been the top U.S. finisher at every international event they have entered for the past three years. Their scores throughout the Grand Prix season were the clear highest by a U.S. pair team.\n\nAt the [[2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2018 U.S. Championships]], the Knierims won their second National title with a score of 206.60. They placed 1st in the short program, 1st in the free skate, and performed a quadruple twist in competition for the first time since 2016. They are one of the only pairs in the world capable of doing a quad twist. Following the event, the Knierims were named to the [[United States at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 U.S. Olympic Team]] that competed at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang, South Korea]]. They were the sole U.S. pair team at this Olympic Games.<ref name=US1817/>\n\nAt the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the Knierims won an Olympic bronze medal in the [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Team event|figure skating team event]] as a key part of the U.S. team. They placed a strong 4th in the short program with a season's best score, and placed 4th in the free skate. Their total score was the highest of their season. In the pair event, they were 14th in the short program and finished 15th overall in what was the strongest Olympic pair competition to date. In the free skate, the Knierims became the first U.S. pair, and the second pair ever in history, to successfully perform a quad twist at the Olympics.<ref name=NEWS180214/>\n\nWeeks later, the Knierims competed at the [[2018 World Figure Skating Championships|2018 World Championships]]. They placed 11th in the short program with a strong performance and were less than three points from the top 5. They finished 15th overall after an uncharacteristically shaky skate by Alexa that included a fall on a death spiral. They were the only U.S. pair to qualify for the free skate.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, [[U.S. Figure Skating]] announced that the Knierims had left their coach, [[Dalilah Sappenfield]], to train with [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Olympic champion]] [[Aljona Savchenko]] and her coaching staff. They began training part-time in [[Oberstdorf|Oberstdorf, Germany]].<ref name=USFS180514/>\n\n===2018\u20132019 season: Third Grand Prix medal and coaching changes===\nThe Knierims started their season at [[2018 CS Nebelhorn Trophy| 2018 Nebelhorn Trophy]] where they won the silver medal. They placed 1st in the short program and finished 2nd overall, just one point from 1st. They then competed at their first [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] event of the season, [[2018 Skate America]], where they placed 4th. They were without a coach at the event, and it was announced on October 20, 2018, in the middle of the free skate, that they had very recently split from their coach Aljona Savchenko, which the Knierims confirmed after the event.<ref name=NBC181020/>\n\nIn early November, the Knierims won the bronze medal at their second Grand Prix event, [[2018 NHK Trophy]], ahead of Canadians [[Kirsten Moore-Towers]] and [[Michael Marinaro]]. They were coached at the event by [[Todd Sand]] and had relocated to California during the two weeks between their Grand Prix events. They officially began training with [[Jenni Meno]] and [[Todd Sand]] in late November. In early December, they won the silver medal at [[2018 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb| 2018 Golden Spin of Zagreb]], placing 1st in the free skate and finishing one point from 1st overall.\n\nIn January at the [[2019 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2019 U.S. Championships]], the Knierims placed a very unexpected seventh after a series of unusual mishaps. In the short program, they had an uncharacteristic big error on their signature triple twist, typically their best element.<ref name=GS190124/> In the free skate, they surprisingly aborted their second lift and missed their third lift entirely. It was revealed after the competition that Chris Knierim had been suffering from a torn wrist ligament that required surgery to repair. He remarked afterward that \"the program went how our year went, a lot of unplanned mishaps.\"<ref name=GS190126/> He underwent surgery to repair his wrist during the off-season.<ref name=NBC191029/>\n\n===2019\u20132020 season: Third national title and split===\nThe Knierims added [[Rafael Arutyunyan]] to their coaching team during the off-season.<ref name=USFS191120/> They had a strong start to their season at [[2019 CS Nebelhorn Trophy]] where they won the silver medal with a total score of 202.41. Their free skate score of 131.58 was the highest score ever achieved by a U.S. pair team under the current version of the judging system.<ref name=NBC191029/> \n\nThe Knierims then competed at their first [[2019-20 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] event of the season, [[2019 Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]], where they skated strongly and placed fourth, less than three points behind reigning World silver medalists [[Evgenia Tarasova]] and [[Vladimir Morozov (figure skater)|Vladimir Morozov]].<ref name=GS191026/><ref name=GS191027/>  At their second Grand Prix event, [[2019 NHK Trophy]], they placed fifth in the short program with a fall and a completely invalidated death spiral. After a free skate with many errors, including a costly missed lift, they placed seventh overall.<ref name=GS191122/>\n\nIn January at the [[2020 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2020 U.S. Championships]], the Knierims won their third national title with a score of 216.15, the highest score ever achieved in U.S. competition. They skated a completely clean short program and scored 77.06, a new record at the U.S. Championships, and won that segment by nearly seven points.<ref name=GS200123/> After leaving some points on the table in an otherwise strong free skate performance, they placed second in that segment and first overall after having a nearly ten point lead over silver medalists [[Jessica Calalang|Calalang]]/[[Brian Johnson (figure skater)|Johnson]] from the short program. The Knierims were the first U.S. pair team to win three national titles since 2002.<ref name=GS200125/>\n\nLess than two weeks after the U.S. Championships, the Knierims competed at the [[2020 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2020 Four Continents Championships]] in [[Seoul]]. In the short program, they both erred on their side-by-side jump attempt and then Chris slipped on the entry to their side-by-side spin, completely invalidating the element. They placed fifth in the segment.<ref name=GS200206/> The Knierims withdrew the morning of the free skate, citing family illness.<ref name=GS200208/>\n\nThe day the official entry list for Worlds was posted, it was announced that Chris was stepping away from the sport, citing ongoing \"bouts of depression\" that had come to a head at the Four Continents Championships.  It was also announced that Knierim would be seeking a new partner to continue skating, saying as well that \"I'm his wife over being his partner. We know skating ends and life continues.

He began to play the guitar at 12 years of age, first learning [[British blues]] music, being influenced by the work of [[Eric Clapton]], and also that of [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armouryshow.com/media/interviews/1985-11-00_The_Guitarist-John_mcgeoch_03.jpg |title=Interview|website=Armourshow.com |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> In 1970 he played with a local band called the 'Slugband'. In 1971 his parents moved to London. In 1975 he went to [[Manchester Polytechnic]] where he received a degree in Fine Art. He maintained an interest in photography, painting and drawing throughout his life.\n\n==Early career==\nIn April 1977 McGeoch's Manchester student flatmate [[Malcolm Garrett]] introduced him to [[Howard Devoto]], who had recently left the [[Buzzcocks]] and was looking for a guitarist to form a band with. The pair formed a new act entitled [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], along with [[Barry Adamson]], Bob Dickinson and [[Martin Jackson]]. The new band released its debut single, \"[[Shot by Both Sides]]\" in January 1978. The song's music was written by [[Pete Shelley]] with new Devoto lyrics (the Buzzcocks version was titled \"Lipstick\"); on release it reached #41 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. (The same year McGeoch graduated from Manchester Polytechnic) .\n\nMcGeoch went on to play on Magazine's first three albums, ''[[Real Life (Magazine album)|Real Life]]'' (1978), ''[[Secondhand Daylight]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Correct Use of Soap]]'' (1980). He left the band in 1980 shortly after the release of the latter album, frustrated with its lack of commercial success despite its recognition with music press critics.\n\nIn 1979, while still a member of Magazine, McGeoch joined [[Steve Strange]]'s electronic band [[Visage (band)|Visage]] along with erstwhile Magazine bandmates Adamson and [[Dave Formula]], recording songs for their first single \"[[Tar (song)|Tar]]\" and later, in 1980, for their eponymous album ''[[Visage (Visage album)|Visage]]'', McGeoch playing guitar and saxophone on the record.\n\nAlthough he saw Visage as something of a joke,<ref name=\"Simpson\">{{Cite news |title= Obituary \u2013 John McGeoch: Innovative and influential guitarist of the post-punk era|newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries | first=Dave | last=Simpson | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> the band provided McGeoch with early professional credibility and success. The band's single \"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\" went to #1 in a number of European countries. McGeoch did not record on the group's second album, ''[[The Anvil (album)|The Anvil]]'', as it was recorded in London and he was unable to participate.\n\nWhile still a member of Magazine and Visage, McGeoch also worked occasionally with other bands. In mid-1980 he recorded most of the guitar work on [[Generation X (band)|Gen X]]'s album ''[[Kiss Me Deadly (album)|Kiss Me Deadly]]'' at [[AIR Studios]] in London.<ref>'Dancing with Myself', by Billy Idol. (Pub. Simon & Schuster, 2014).</ref> In September 1980 he guested with the [[Skids (band)|Skids]] for a [[Peel Session]], standing in for [[Stuart Adamson]] who was unwell.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1980s/1980/Sep01skids|title=BBC \u2013 Radio 1 \u2013 Keeping It Peel \u2013 01/09/1980 Skids|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref> He also collaborated with ex-Magazine drummer [[John Doyle (drummer)|John Doyle]] on [[Ken Lockie]]'s album ''[[The Impossible (album)|The Impossible]]'' (1981). Around this time, he left Magazine.\n\n==Siouxsie and the Banshees==\nAfter joining [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] in late 1980,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1456851/John-McGeoch.html \"Obituary , John McGeoch\"]. Telegraph.co.uk. 15 March 2004.</ref> McGeoch entered a period of both creative and commercial success. During his first session with the Banshees he began a new style of playing. He later commented: \"I was going through a picky phase, as opposed to strumming. \"Happy House\" was lighter and had more musicality in it. They invited me to join. I was sad leaving Magazine but the Banshees were so interesting and it felt like a good move\".<ref name=Independent />\n\nHe recorded guitar on the Banshees' long-players ''[[Kaleidoscope (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' (1980), ''[[Juju (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Juju]]'' (1981) and ''[[A Kiss in the Dreamhouse]]'' (1982). The Banshees' hit singles of this era featured some of McGeoch's most acclaimed work, particularly 1980's \"[[Happy House]]\", \"[[Christine (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Christine]]\" and \"[[Israel (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Israel]]\", and 1981's \"[[Spellbound (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Spellbound]]\" and \"[[Arabian Knights (song)|Arabian Knights]]\". McGeoch's contribution to the band was important in terms of sounds and style. Singer [[Siouxsie Sioux]] later said: {{Cquote|John McGeoch was my favourite guitarist of all time. He was into sound in an almost abstract way. I loved the fact that I could say, \"I want this to sound like a horse falling off a cliff\", and he would know exactly what I meant. He was easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the most creative guitarist the Banshees ever had\".<ref name=Independent />}} However, McGeoch suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] due to the stresses of touring and an increasing personal problem with alcohol, and after collapsing on stage during a performance at a gig in [[Madrid]], left the band in 1982.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1983, during a break from playing music, he produced Swedish punk-funk band ''Zzzang Tumb's'' debut long-player.<ref name=\"Black Mat Smith\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Black Mat|title=Happy Talk|url=http://www.fodderstompf.com/ARCHIVES/INTERVIEWS/mm87.html|work=Fodderstompf|publisher=[[Melody Maker]]|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986 McGeoch contributed to former [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] singer [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]]'s debut solo long-player ''[[Should the World Fail to Fall Apart]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Pierre Perrone |title=John McGeoch |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-mcgeoch-38149.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 July 2018 |format=Obituary |date=11 March 2004}}</ref>\n\nFollowing three years playing guitar with an act entitled [[The Armoury Show]] (which included Doyle as well as ex-Skids members [[Richard Jobson (television presenter)|Richard Jobson]] and [[Russell Webb (musician)|Russell Webb]]), the album Waiting For the floods features some of his best guitar work. McGeoch joined [[John Lydon]]'s [[Public Image Ltd]] in 1986, a decision which may have been partly motivated by financial difficulties he was in at this time. He had been an admirer of PiL, particularly of Lydon's song-lyrics, yet reportedly had previously turned down an offer from him to join the band in 1984. Despite being struck in the face with a bottle thrown from the crowd during one of his first gigs with the band, McGeoch remained with PiL until it disbanded in 1992, making him the longest-serving member apart from Lydon. He recorded on its long-players: ''[[Happy? (Public Image Limited)|Happy?]]'', ''[[9 (Public Image Limited album)|9]]'' and ''[[That What Is Not]]''. McGeoch left PiL's line-up in 1992.\n\nIn 1992 he was invited by the Icelandic band [[The Sugarcubes]] to play the guitar track on the song \"Gold\" for their ''[[Stick Around for Joy]]'' long-player. In early 1990s, without a band, he ended his career seeking to form one via a variety of short-lived ventures, including working with [[Glenn Gregory]] and the songwriter/producer Keith Lowndes. With [[John Keeble]] of [[Spandau Ballet]] and vocalist Clive Farrington of [[When in Rome (band)|When in Rome]], he formed a line-up provisionally titled 'Pacific', but no commercial material came of it.\n\nIn the mid-1990s McGeoch retired from professional music and trained mid-life as a nurse/carer. In the early 2000s he was reported as attempting to re-enter professional music by working on musical scores for television productions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504100128/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |archive-date=4 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMcGeoch died at the age of 48 in his sleep on 4 March 2004 at his home in [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n==Tributes==\nBanshees' drummer [[Budgie (musician)|Budgie]] wrote a text to honour him on the Siouxsie website, saying: \"Without any disrespect to all the other guitarists we have worked with, none had the relaxed mastery and such a depth of expression as John McGeoch.

Colin Greenwood remembers: \"The running joke when we were making this record was that if we recorded a track that stretched over 3mn 50 sec., we'd say \"Oh fuck, we've buggered it then. It's gone on too long.\" Of course, the irony is that the first single we're releasing is actually the longest song on the record. (\"There There\"). It was all recorded live in Oxford.

He began to play the guitar at 12 years of age, first learning [[British blues]] music, being influenced by the work of [[Eric Clapton]], and also that of [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armouryshow.com/media/interviews/1985-11-00_The_Guitarist-John_mcgeoch_03.jpg |title=Interview|website=Armourshow.com |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> In 1970 he played with a local band called the 'Slugband'. In 1971 his parents moved to London. In 1975 he went to [[Manchester Polytechnic]] where he received a degree in Fine Art. He maintained an interest in photography, painting and drawing throughout his life.\n\n==Early career==\nIn April 1977 McGeoch's Manchester student flatmate [[Malcolm Garrett]] introduced him to [[Howard Devoto]], who had recently left the [[Buzzcocks]] and was looking for a guitarist to form a band with. The pair formed a new act entitled [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], along with [[Barry Adamson]], Bob Dickinson and [[Martin Jackson]]. The new band released its debut single, \"[[Shot by Both Sides]]\" in January 1978. The song's music was written by [[Pete Shelley]] with new Devoto lyrics (the Buzzcocks version was titled \"Lipstick\"); on release it reached #41 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. (The same year McGeoch graduated from Manchester Polytechnic) .\n\nMcGeoch went on to play on Magazine's first three albums, ''[[Real Life (Magazine album)|Real Life]]'' (1978), ''[[Secondhand Daylight]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Correct Use of Soap]]'' (1980). He left the band in 1980 shortly after the release of the latter album, frustrated with its lack of commercial success despite its recognition with music press critics.\n\nIn 1979, while still a member of Magazine, McGeoch joined [[Steve Strange]]'s electronic band [[Visage (band)|Visage]] along with erstwhile Magazine bandmates Adamson and [[Dave Formula]], recording songs for their first single \"[[Tar (song)|Tar]]\" and later, in 1980, for their eponymous album ''[[Visage (Visage album)|Visage]]'', McGeoch playing guitar and saxophone on the record.\n\nAlthough he saw Visage as something of a joke,<ref name=\"Simpson\">{{Cite news |title= Obituary \u2013 John McGeoch: Innovative and influential guitarist of the post-punk era|newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries | first=Dave | last=Simpson | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> the band provided McGeoch with early professional credibility and success. The band's single \"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\" went to #1 in a number of European countries. McGeoch did not record on the group's second album, ''[[The Anvil (album)|The Anvil]]'', as it was recorded in London and he was unable to participate.\n\nWhile still a member of Magazine and Visage, McGeoch also worked occasionally with other bands. In mid-1980 he recorded most of the guitar work on [[Generation X (band)|Gen X]]'s album ''[[Kiss Me Deadly (album)|Kiss Me Deadly]]'' at [[AIR Studios]] in London.<ref>'Dancing with Myself', by Billy Idol. (Pub.

Around this time, he left Magazine.\n\n==Siouxsie and the Banshees==\nAfter joining [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] in late 1980,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1456851/John-McGeoch.html \"Obituary , John McGeoch\"]. Telegraph.co.uk. 15 March 2004.</ref> McGeoch entered a period of both creative and commercial success. During his first session with the Banshees he began a new style of playing. He later commented: \"I was going through a picky phase, as opposed to strumming. \"Happy House\" was lighter and had more musicality in it. They invited me to join. I was sad leaving Magazine but the Banshees were so interesting and it felt like a good move\".<ref name=Independent />\n\nHe recorded guitar on the Banshees' long-players ''[[Kaleidoscope (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' (1980), ''[[Juju (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Juju]]'' (1981) and ''[[A Kiss in the Dreamhouse]]'' (1982). The Banshees' hit singles of this era featured some of McGeoch's most acclaimed work, particularly 1980's \"[[Happy House]]\", \"[[Christine (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Christine]]\" and \"[[Israel (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Israel]]\", and 1981's \"[[Spellbound (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Spellbound]]\" and \"[[Arabian Knights (song)|Arabian Knights]]\". McGeoch's contribution to the band was important in terms of sounds and style. Singer [[Siouxsie Sioux]] later said: {{Cquote|John McGeoch was my favourite guitarist of all time. He was into sound in an almost abstract way. I loved the fact that I could say, \"I want this to sound like a horse falling off a cliff\", and he would know exactly what I meant. He was easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the most creative guitarist the Banshees ever had\".<ref name=Independent />}} However, McGeoch suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] due to the stresses of touring and an increasing personal problem with alcohol, and after collapsing on stage during a performance at a gig in [[Madrid]], left the band in 1982.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1983, during a break from playing music, he produced Swedish punk-funk band ''Zzzang Tumb's'' debut long-player.<ref name=\"Black Mat Smith\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Black Mat|title=Happy Talk|url=http://www.fodderstompf.com/ARCHIVES/INTERVIEWS/mm87.html|work=Fodderstompf|publisher=[[Melody Maker]]|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986 McGeoch contributed to former [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] singer [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]]'s debut solo long-player ''[[Should the World Fail to Fall Apart]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Pierre Perrone |title=John McGeoch |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-mcgeoch-38149.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 July 2018 |format=Obituary |date=11 March 2004}}</ref>\n\nFollowing three years playing guitar with an act entitled [[The Armoury Show]] (which included Doyle as well as ex-Skids members [[Richard Jobson (television presenter)|Richard Jobson]] and [[Russell Webb (musician)|Russell Webb]]), the album Waiting For the floods features some of his best guitar work. McGeoch joined [[John Lydon]]'s [[Public Image Ltd]] in 1986, a decision which may have been partly motivated by financial difficulties he was in at this time. He had been an admirer of PiL, particularly of Lydon's song-lyrics, yet reportedly had previously turned down an offer from him to join the band in 1984. Despite being struck in the face with a bottle thrown from the crowd during one of his first gigs with the band, McGeoch remained with PiL until it disbanded in 1992, making him the longest-serving member apart from Lydon. He recorded on its long-players: ''[[Happy? (Public Image Limited)|Happy?]]'', ''[[9 (Public Image Limited album)|9]]'' and ''[[That What Is Not]]''. McGeoch left PiL's line-up in 1992.\n\nIn 1992 he was invited by the Icelandic band [[The Sugarcubes]] to play the guitar track on the song \"Gold\" for their ''[[Stick Around for Joy]]'' long-player. In early 1990s, without a band, he ended his career seeking to form one via a variety of short-lived ventures, including working with [[Glenn Gregory]] and the songwriter/producer Keith Lowndes. With [[John Keeble]] of [[Spandau Ballet]] and vocalist Clive Farrington of [[When in Rome (band)|When in Rome]], he formed a line-up provisionally titled 'Pacific', but no commercial material came of it.\n\nIn the mid-1990s McGeoch retired from professional music and trained mid-life as a nurse/carer. In the early 2000s he was reported as attempting to re-enter professional music by working on musical scores for television productions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504100128/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |archive-date=4 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMcGeoch died at the age of 48 in his sleep on 4 March 2004 at his home in [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n==Tributes==\nBanshees' drummer [[Budgie (musician)|Budgie]] wrote a text to honour him on the Siouxsie website, saying: \"Without any disrespect to all the other guitarists we have worked with, none had the relaxed mastery and such a depth of expression as John McGeoch.
