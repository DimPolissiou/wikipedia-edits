It was designed by [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon]] and completed in 1931. Its name is derived from \"[[Empire State]]\", the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The building has a roof height of {{convert|1250|ft|m}} and stands a total of {{convert|1454|ft|m|1}} tall, including its [[antenna tower|antenna]]. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building until the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in 1970; following the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], the Empire State Building was again the city's tallest until 2012. {{As of|2019}}, the building is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|seventh-tallest building in New York City]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|sixth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]], the [[List of tallest buildings|45th-tallest in the world]], and the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]].\n\nThe site of the Empire State Building, located in [[Midtown South]] on the west side of [[Fifth Avenue]] between West [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Streets]], was originally part of an early 18th-century farm. It was developed in 1893 as the site of the [[Waldorf\u2013Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf\u2013Astoria Hotel]]. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931.\u00a0Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], its owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s.\n\nThe building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around 4 million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an [[United States|American]] [[cultural icon]]: it has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. It was ranked first on the [[American Institute of Architects]]' List of [[America's Favorite Architecture]] in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated as city landmarks by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1980, and were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Location==\n[[File:View from Building (January 2019).jpg|thumb|left|Eastward view from 102nd floor observatory in January 2019]]\nThe Empire State Building is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], between 33rd Street to the south and 34th Street to the north.{{sfn|Jackson|2010|p=414}} Tenants enter the building through the Art Deco lobby located at 350 Fifth Avenue.

It was designed by [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon]] and completed in 1931. Its name is derived from \"[[Empire State]]\", the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The building has a roof height of {{convert|1250|ft|m}} and stands a total of {{convert|1454|ft|m|1}} tall, including its [[antenna tower|antenna]]. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building until the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in 1970; following the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], the Empire State Building was again the city's tallest until 2012. {{As of|2019}}, the building is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|seventh-tallest building in New York City]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|sixth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]], the [[List of tallest buildings|45th-tallest in the world]], and the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]].\n\nThe site of the Empire State Building, located in [[Midtown South]] on the west side of [[Fifth Avenue]] between West [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Streets]], was originally part of an early 18th-century farm. It was developed in 1893 as the site of the [[Waldorf\u2013Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf\u2013Astoria Hotel]]. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931.\u00a0Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], its owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s.\n\nThe building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around 4 million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an [[United States|American]] [[cultural icon]]: it has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. It was ranked first on the [[American Institute of Architects]]' List of [[America's Favorite Architecture]] in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated as city landmarks by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1980, and were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Location==\n[[File:View from Building (January 2019).jpg|thumb|left|Eastward view from 102nd floor observatory in January 2019]]\nThe Empire State Building is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue in [[Manhattan]], between 33rd Street to the south and 34th Street to the north.{{sfn|Jackson|2010|p=414}} Tenants enter the building through the Art Deco lobby located at 350 Fifth Avenue.

In 1821, a [[Massachusetts]] court outlawed ''Fanny Hill''. The publisher, Peter Holmes, was convicted for printing a \"lewd and obscene\" novel. Holmes appealed to the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Massachusetts Supreme Court]]. He claimed that the judge, relying only on the prosecution's description, had not even seen the book. The state Supreme Court wasn't swayed. The Chief Justice wrote that Holmes was \"a scandalous and evil disposed person\" who had contrived to \"debauch and corrupt\" the citizens of Massachusetts and \"to raise and create in their minds inordinate and lustful desires.\"\n\n===Mayflower (UK) edition===\n{{Summarize section|date=February 2014}}\nAfter the failure in 1960 of [[R v Penguin Books Ltd|the British obscenity trial]] of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', Mayflower Books, run by [[Gareth Powell]], published in 1963 an uncensored paperback version of ''Fanny Hill''. The police became aware of the 1963 edition a few days before publication,  spotting a sign in the window of the Magic Shop in [[Tottenham Court Road]] in London, run by Ralph Gold. An officer went to the shop, bought a copy, and delivered it to [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court|Bow Street magistrate]] Sir Robert Blundell, who issued a search warrant. At the same time, two officers from the [[vice squad]] visited Mayflower Books in [[Vauxhall Bridge Road]] to determine whether copies of the book were kept on the premises. They interviewed the publisher, Gareth Powell, and took away the five copies there. The police returned to the Magic Shop and seized 171 copies of the book, and in December Ralph Gold was summonsed under section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|Obscenity Act]]. By then, Mayflower had distributed 82,000 copies of the book, but it was Gold who was being tried, although Mayflower covered the legal costs. The trial took place in February 1964. The defence argued that ''Fanny Hill'' was a historical source book and that it was a joyful celebration of normal non-perverted sex\u2014bawdy rather than pornographic. The prosecution countered by stressing one atypical scene involving flagellation, and won. Mayflower decided not to appeal.\n\nLuxor Press published a 9/6 edition in January 1964, using text \"exactly the same as that employed for the de-luxe edition\" in 1963. The back cover features praise from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and from the author and critic [[Marghanita Laski]]. It went through many reprints in the first couple of years.\n\nThe Mayflower case highlighted the growing disconnect between the obscenity laws and the [[permissive society]] that was developing in late 1960s Britain, and was instrumental in shifting views to the point where in 1970 an uncensored version of ''Fanny Hill'' was again published in Britain.\n\n===1960s US Edition / Prosecutions and Court Rulings===\nIn 1963, [[G.

Fanny has been prevailed upon by 'Madam' to recount the 'scandalous stages' of her earlier life, which she proceeds to do with 'stark naked truth' as her governing principle.\n\nThe first letter begins with a short account of Fanny's impoverished childhood in a village in [[Lancashire]]. At age 14 she loses her parents to smallpox, arrives in London to look for domestic work, and gets lured into a brothel. She sees a sexual encounter between an ugly older couple and another between a young attractive couple, and participates in a lesbian encounter with Phoebe, a bisexual prostitute. A customer, Charles, induces Fanny to escape.  She loses her virginity to Charles and becomes his lover. Charles is sent away by deception to the South Seas, and Fanny is driven by desperation and poverty to become the kept woman of a rich merchant named Mr H\u2014. After enjoying a brief period of stability, she sees Mr H\u2014 have a sexual encounter with her own maid, and goes on to seduce Will (the young footman of Mr H\u2014) as an act of revenge. She is discovered by Mr H\u2014 as she is having a sexual encounter with Will. After being abandoned by Mr H\u2014, Fanny becomes a prostitute for wealthy clients in a pleasure-house run by Mrs Cole. This marks the end of the first letter.\n\nThe second letter begins with a rumination on the tedium of writing about sex and the difficulty of driving a middle course between vulgar language and \"mincing metaphors and affected circumlocutions\". Fanny then describes her adventures in the house of Mrs Cole, which include a public orgy, an elaborately orchestrated bogus sale of her \"virginity\" to a rich dupe called Mr Norbert, and a sado-masochistic session with a man involving mutual flagellation with birch-rods. These are interspersed with narratives which do not involve Fanny directly; for instance, three other girls in the house (Emily, Louisa and Harriett) describe their own losses of virginity, and the nyphomaniac Louisa seduces the immensely endowed but imbecilic \"good-natured Dick\". Fanny also describes anal intercourse between two older boys. (This was removed from several later editions) Eventually Fanny retires from prostitution and becomes the lover of a rich and worldly-wise man of 60 (described by Fanny as a \"rational pleasurist\"). This phase of Fanny's life brings about her intellectual development, and leaves her wealthy when her lover dies of a sudden cold. Soon after, she has a chance encounter with Charles, who has returned as a poor man to England after being shipwrecked. Fanny offers her fortune to Charles unconditionally, but he insists on marrying her.\n\nThe novel's developed characters include Charles, Mrs Jones (Fanny's landlady), Mrs Cole, Will, Mr H\u2014 and Mr Norbert. The prose includes long sentences with many subordinate clauses. Its morality is conventional for the time, in that it denounces sodomy, frowns upon vice and approves of only heterosexual unions based upon mutual love.<ref>Cleland John, Memoirs of a woman of pleasure, ed.

However, this interpretation lacks corroborating evidence: the term \"[[Vulva#Alternative terms|fanny]]\" is first known to have been used to mean female genitalia in the 1830s, and no 18th-century dictionary defines \"fanny\" in this way.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spedding|first=Patrick|last2=Lambert|first2=James|date=2011|title=Fanny Hill, Lord Fanny, and the Myth of Metonymy|journal=Studies in Philology|language=en|volume=108|issue=1|pages=108\u2013132|doi=10.1353/sip.2011.0001|issn=1543-0383|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0222117904f5021c8e20a694eb455c7c2218b21}}</ref>\n\n=== Disability ===\n\nLater in the text when Fanny is with Louisa, they come across a boy nicknamed \"Good-natured Dick\" who is described as having some mental disability/handicap. Louisa brings the boy in anyway, as Dick's functioning physical state supersedes his poor mental one. This scene also leads into an issue within the text of rape (for both Dick and Louisa) and how the possible label of rape is removed by resistance transitioning into pleasure.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |title = What Happens When Pornography Ends in Marriage: The Uniformity of Pleasure in \"Fanny Hill\"\n  |last = Haslanger\n  |first = Andrea\n  |journal = [[ELH]]\n  |issn = 0013-8304\n  |eissn = 1080-6547\n  |volume = 78\n  |issue = 1\n  |year = 2011\n  |pages = 163\u2013188\n  |jstor = 41236538\n  |ref = harv\n|doi = 10.1353/elh.2011.0002\n |pmid = 21688452\n |url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a5f44d97b74bcd96e89577d1ea43ae17c2241f1\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Bildungsroman ===\n\nOne scholar, David McCracken, writes about ''Fanny Hill'' as a [[bildungsroman]]. Her sexual development contains three life stages: innocence, experimentation, and experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCracken|first=David|date=October 2016|title=A Burkean Analysis of the Sublimity and the Beauty of the Phallus in John Cleland's Fanny Hill|url=|journal=ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews|volume=29|issue=3|pages=138\u2013141|via=MLA Bibliography|doi=10.1080/0895769X.2016.1216388}}</ref> McCracken specifically addresses how Fanny's word selections on describing the phallus change throughout the stages. Fanny sees the phallus as both an object of terror and of delight. McCracken relates her changing view of the phallus to Burke's theory of the sublime and beautiful.\n\n=== Shame ===\n\n[[Patricia Spacks]] discusses how Fanny has been previously deprived by her rural environment of what she can understand as real experience, and how she welcomes the whores' efforts to educate her.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |title = Female Changelessness; Or, What Do Women Want?\n  |last = Spacks\n  |first = Patricia Meyer\n  |journal = [[Studies in the Novel]]\n  |issn = 0039-3827\n  |volume = 19\n  |issue = 3, Women and Early Fiction\n  |year = 1987\n  |pages = 273\u2013283\n  |jstor = 29532507\n  |ref = harv\n}}</ref> Since Fanny is so quickly catapulted into her new life, she has had little time to reflect on the shame and regret that she feels for leading a life of adultery, and replaces this shame with the pleasure of sexual encounters with men and women.

Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=78}}</ref> Having little time to think about how she feels about her transition, she masks her thoughts with sexual pleasure, yet this is not a total fix to forget her emotions.\n\n== Narrative voice ==\n[[File:\u00c9douard-Henri Avril (3) crop.JPG|thumb|Illustration by [[\u00c9douard-Henri Avril]].]]<!-- this image is forced to infobox width - if the infobox width changes, please change this width -->\n\nAndrea Haslanger argues in her dissertation how the use of first-person narrative in the 18th-century \"undermines, rather than secures, the individual\" in classic epistolary novels like ''Roxanna, Evelina, Frankenstein,'' and specifically ''Fanny Hill.'' Haslanger claims that \"the paradox of pornographic narration is that it mobilizes certain aspects of the first person (the description of intimate details) while eradicating others (the expression of disagreement or resistance)\" (19).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Story of I: First Persons and Others In Eighteenth-Century Narrative|last=Haslanger|first=Andrea|publisher=UMI|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> With this in mind, she raises the question of \"whether \"I\" denotes consciousness or body or both\" (34).\n\n== ''Fanny Hill'' versus the traditional conduct novel ==\nWith sexual acts being viewed heavily as taboo within 18th-century England, ''Fanny Hill'' strayed far away from the norm in comparison to other works of its time. A large portion of books that focused on the idea of sex were written in the form of conduct novels: books that would focus on teaching women the proper ways to behave and live their lives in as virtuous of a manner as possible.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sachidananda|first=Mohanty|date=2004|title=Female Identity and Conduct Book Tradition in Orissa: The Virtuous Woman in the Ideal Home.|url=|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=39|pages=333\u2013336}}</ref> These novels encouraged women to stay away from sexual deviance, for if they were to remain virtuous then they would ultimately be rewarded. One example of this is [[Samuel Richardson]]'s conduct novel ''[[Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded]]'', in which the character of Pamela is able to resist sexual temptation, thus maintaining her virtue and being rewarded in the end with a prosperous life.\n\nHowever, ''Fanny Hill'' was widely considered to be the first work of its time to focus on the idea of sexual deviance being an act of pleasure, rather than something that was simply shameful. This can be seen through Fanny's character partaking in acts that would normally be viewed as deplorable by society's standards, but then is never punished for them. In fact, Fanny is ultimately able to achieve her own happy ending when she is able to find Charles again, marrying him and living in a life of wealth. This can be viewed in sharp contrast to a work like ''Pamela,'' where sexual acts are heavily avoided for the sake of maintaining virtue. Meanwhile, within ''Fanny Hill'', normally deplorable acts can be conducted with little to no consequence. {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Literary and film adaptations== <!-- This section is linked from [[B movie]] -->\n{{Further|Fanny Hill (disambiguation)}}\nBecause of the book's notoriety (and [[public domain]] status), numerous adaptations have been produced.

The text has no \"dirty words\" or explicit scientific terms for body parts, but uses many literary devices to describe genitalia.  For example, the vagina is sometimes referred to as \"the nethermouth,\" which is also an example of [[Displacement (psychology)|psychological displacement]].\n\nA critical edition by Peter Sabor includes a bibliography and explanatory notes.<ref>Oxford World's Classics, 1985.</ref> The collection \"Launching \"Fanny Hill\" contains several essays on the historical, social and economic themes underlying the novel.<ref>Patsy S.

Fenton\".<ref>Roger Lonsdale, \"New attributions to John Cleland\", ''[[The Review of English Studies]]'' 1979 XXX(119):268\u2013290 {{doi|10.1093/res/XXX.119.268}}</ref> There has been speculation that the novel was at least partly written by 1740, when Cleland was stationed in [[Bombay]] as a servant of the [[British East India Company]].<ref>Gladfelder, Hall, Fanny Hill in Bombay, The Making and Unmaking of John Cleland, Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2012.</ref>\n\nInitially, there was no governmental reaction to the novel. However, in November 1749, a year after the first instalment was published, Cleland and Ralph Griffiths were arrested and charged with \"corrupting the King's subjects.\" In court, Cleland renounced the novel and it was officially withdrawn.\n\nAs the book became popular, [[copyright infringement|pirate editions]] appeared. It was once believed that the scene near the end, in which Fanny reacts with disgust at the sight of two young men engaging in anal intercourse,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kopelson|first=K.|date=1992|title=Seeing sodomy: Fanny Hill's blinding vision|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=23|issue=1\u20132|pages=173\u2013183|doi=10.1300/J082v23n01_09|issn=0091-8369|pmid=1431071}}</ref> was an interpolation made for these pirated editions, but the scene is present in the first edition (p. xxiii). In the 19th century, copies of the book sold [[Underground press|underground]] in the UK, the US and elsewhere.<ref name=globe/> In 1887, a French edition appeared with illustration by  [[\u00c9douard-Henri Avril]].\n\nThe book eventually made its way to the United States. In 1821, a [[Massachusetts]] court outlawed ''Fanny Hill''. The publisher, Peter Holmes, was convicted for printing a \"lewd and obscene\" novel. Holmes appealed to the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Massachusetts Supreme Court]]. He claimed that the judge, relying only on the prosecution's description, had not even seen the book. The state Supreme Court wasn't swayed. The Chief Justice wrote that Holmes was \"a scandalous and evil disposed person\" who had contrived to \"debauch and corrupt\" the citizens of Massachusetts and \"to raise and create in their minds inordinate and lustful desires.\"\n\n===Mayflower (UK) edition===\n{{Summarize section|date=February 2014}}\nAfter the failure in 1960 of [[R v Penguin Books Ltd|the British obscenity trial]] of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', Mayflower Books, run by [[Gareth Powell]], published in 1963 an uncensored paperback version of ''Fanny Hill''. The police became aware of the 1963 edition a few days before publication,  spotting a sign in the window of the Magic Shop in [[Tottenham Court Road]] in London, run by Ralph Gold. An officer went to the shop, bought a copy, and delivered it to [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court|Bow Street magistrate]] Sir Robert Blundell, who issued a search warrant. At the same time, two officers from the [[vice squad]] visited Mayflower Books in [[Vauxhall Bridge Road]] to determine whether copies of the book were kept on the premises. They interviewed the publisher, Gareth Powell, and took away the five copies there. The police returned to the Magic Shop and seized 171 copies of the book, and in December Ralph Gold was summonsed under section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|Obscenity Act]]. By then, Mayflower had distributed 82,000 copies of the book, but it was Gold who was being tried, although Mayflower covered the legal costs. The trial took place in February 1964. The defence argued that ''Fanny Hill'' was a historical source book and that it was a joyful celebration of normal non-perverted sex\u2014bawdy rather than pornographic. The prosecution countered by stressing one atypical scene involving flagellation, and won. Mayflower decided not to appeal.\n\nLuxor Press published a 9/6 edition in January 1964, using text \"exactly the same as that employed for the de-luxe edition\" in 1963. The back cover features praise from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and from the author and critic [[Marghanita Laski]]. It went through many reprints in the first couple of years.\n\nThe Mayflower case highlighted the growing disconnect between the obscenity laws and the [[permissive society]] that was developing in late 1960s Britain, and was instrumental in shifting views to the point where in 1970 an uncensored version of ''Fanny Hill'' was again published in Britain.\n\n===1960s US Edition / Prosecutions and Court Rulings===\nIn 1963, [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam]] published the book in the United States under the title ''John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure''.

Fanny has been prevailed upon by 'Madam' to recount the 'scandalous stages' of her earlier life, which she proceeds to do with 'stark naked truth' as her governing principle.\n\nThe first letter begins with a short account of Fanny's impoverished childhood in a village in [[Lancashire]]. At age 14 she loses her parents to smallpox, arrives in London to look for domestic work, and gets lured into a brothel. She sees a sexual encounter between an ugly older couple and another between a young attractive couple, and participates in a lesbian encounter with Phoebe, a bisexual prostitute. A customer, Charles, induces Fanny to escape.  She loses her virginity to Charles and becomes his lover. Charles is sent away by deception to the South Seas, and Fanny is driven by desperation and poverty to become the kept woman of a rich merchant named Mr H\u2014. After enjoying a brief period of stability, she sees Mr H\u2014 have a sexual encounter with her own maid, and goes on to seduce Will (the young footman of Mr H\u2014) as an act of revenge. She is discovered by Mr H\u2014 as she is having a sexual encounter with Will. After being abandoned by Mr H\u2014, Fanny becomes a prostitute for wealthy clients in a pleasure-house run by Mrs Cole. This marks the end of the first letter.\n\nThe second letter begins with a rumination on the tedium of writing about sex and the difficulty of driving a middle course between vulgar language and \"mincing metaphors and affected circumlocutions\". Fanny then describes her adventures in the house of Mrs Cole, which include a public orgy, an elaborately orchestrated bogus sale of her \"virginity\" to a rich dupe called Mr Norbert, and a sado-masochistic session with a man involving mutual flagellation with birch-rods. These are interspersed with narratives which do not involve Fanny directly; for instance, three other girls in the house (Emily, Louisa and Harriett) describe their own losses of virginity, and the nyphomaniac Louisa seduces the immensely endowed but imbecilic \"good-natured Dick\". Fanny also describes anal intercourse between two older boys. (This was removed from several later editions) Eventually Fanny retires from prostitution and becomes the lover of a rich and worldly-wise man of 60 (described by Fanny as a \"rational pleasurist\"). This phase of Fanny's life brings about her intellectual development, and leaves her wealthy when her lover dies of a sudden cold. Soon after, she has a chance encounter with Charles, who has returned as a poor man to England after being shipwrecked. Fanny offers her fortune to Charles unconditionally, but he insists on marrying her.\n\nThe novel's developed characters include Charles, Mrs Jones (Fanny's landlady), Mrs Cole, Will, Mr H\u2014 and Mr Norbert. The prose includes long sentences with many subordinate clauses. Its morality is conventional for the time, in that it denounces sodomy, frowns upon vice and approves of only heterosexual unions based upon mutual love.<ref>Cleland John, Memoirs of a woman of pleasure, ed.

However, this interpretation lacks corroborating evidence: the term \"[[Vulva#Alternative terms|fanny]]\" is first known to have been used to mean female genitalia in the 1830s, and no 18th-century dictionary defines \"fanny\" in this way.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spedding|first=Patrick|last2=Lambert|first2=James|date=2011|title=Fanny Hill, Lord Fanny, and the Myth of Metonymy|journal=Studies in Philology|language=en|volume=108|issue=1|pages=108\u2013132|doi=10.1353/sip.2011.0001|issn=1543-0383|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0222117904f5021c8e20a694eb455c7c2218b21}}</ref>\n\n=== Disability ===\n\nLater in the text when Fanny is with Louisa, they come across a boy nicknamed \"Good-natured Dick\" who is described as having some mental disability/handicap. Louisa brings the boy in anyway, as Dick's functioning physical state supersedes his poor mental one. This scene also leads into an issue within the text of rape (for both Dick and Louisa) and how the possible label of rape is removed by resistance transitioning into pleasure.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |title = What Happens When Pornography Ends in Marriage: The Uniformity of Pleasure in \"Fanny Hill\"\n  |last = Haslanger\n  |first = Andrea\n  |journal = [[ELH]]\n  |issn = 0013-8304\n  |eissn = 1080-6547\n  |volume = 78\n  |issue = 1\n  |year = 2011\n  |pages = 163\u2013188\n  |jstor = 41236538\n  |ref = harv\n|doi = 10.1353/elh.2011.0002\n |pmid = 21688452\n |url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a5f44d97b74bcd96e89577d1ea43ae17c2241f1\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Bildungsroman ===\n\nOne scholar, David McCracken, writes about ''Fanny Hill'' as a [[bildungsroman]]. Her sexual development contains three life stages: innocence, experimentation, and experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCracken|first=David|date=October 2016|title=A Burkean Analysis of the Sublimity and the Beauty of the Phallus in John Cleland's Fanny Hill|url=|journal=ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews|volume=29|issue=3|pages=138\u2013141|via=MLA Bibliography|doi=10.1080/0895769X.2016.1216388}}</ref> McCracken specifically addresses how Fanny's word selections on describing the phallus change throughout the stages. Fanny sees the phallus as both an object of terror and of delight. McCracken relates her changing view of the phallus to Burke's theory of the sublime and beautiful.\n\n=== Shame ===\n\n[[Patricia Spacks]] discusses how Fanny has been previously deprived by her rural environment of what she can understand as real experience, and how she welcomes the whores' efforts to educate her.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |title = Female Changelessness; Or, What Do Women Want?\n  |last = Spacks\n  |first = Patricia Meyer\n  |journal = [[Studies in the Novel]]\n  |issn = 0039-3827\n  |volume = 19\n  |issue = 3, Women and Early Fiction\n  |year = 1987\n  |pages = 273\u2013283\n  |jstor = 29532507\n  |ref = harv\n}}</ref> Since Fanny is so quickly catapulted into her new life, she has had little time to reflect on the shame and regret that she feels for leading a life of adultery, and replaces this shame with the pleasure of sexual encounters with men and women. Even though these feelings may have been replaced or forgotten, she still reflects on her past: \"...and since I was now bent over the bar, I thought by plunging over head and ears into the stream I was hurried away by, to drown all sense of shame or reflection\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memoirs of a woman of pleasure|last=Cleland|first=John|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=78}}</ref> Having little time to think about how she feels about her transition, she masks her thoughts with sexual pleasure, yet this is not a total fix to forget her emotions.\n\n== Narrative voice ==\n[[File:\u00c9douard-Henri Avril (3) crop.JPG|thumb|Illustration by [[\u00c9douard-Henri Avril]].]]<!-- this image is forced to infobox width - if the infobox width changes, please change this width -->\n\nAndrea Haslanger argues in her dissertation how the use of first-person narrative in the 18th-century \"undermines, rather than secures, the individual\" in classic epistolary novels like ''Roxanna, Evelina, Frankenstein,'' and specifically ''Fanny Hill.'' Haslanger claims that \"the paradox of pornographic narration is that it mobilizes certain aspects of the first person (the description of intimate details) while eradicating others (the expression of disagreement or resistance)\" (19).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Story of I: First Persons and Others In Eighteenth-Century Narrative|last=Haslanger|first=Andrea|publisher=UMI|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> With this in mind, she raises the question of \"whether \"I\" denotes consciousness or body or both\" (34).\n\n== ''Fanny Hill'' versus the traditional conduct novel ==\nWith sexual acts being viewed heavily as taboo within 18th-century England, ''Fanny Hill'' strayed far away from the norm in comparison to other works of its time. A large portion of books that focused on the idea of sex were written in the form of conduct novels: books that would focus on teaching women the proper ways to behave and live their lives in as virtuous of a manner as possible.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sachidananda|first=Mohanty|date=2004|title=Female Identity and Conduct Book Tradition in Orissa: The Virtuous Woman in the Ideal Home.|url=|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=39|pages=333\u2013336}}</ref> These novels encouraged women to stay away from sexual deviance, for if they were to remain virtuous then they would ultimately be rewarded. One example of this is [[Samuel Richardson]]'s conduct novel ''[[Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded]]'', in which the character of Pamela is able to resist sexual temptation, thus maintaining her virtue and being rewarded in the end with a prosperous life.\n\nHowever, ''Fanny Hill'' was widely considered to be the first work of its time to focus on the idea of sexual deviance being an act of pleasure, rather than something that was simply shameful. This can be seen through Fanny's character partaking in acts that would normally be viewed as deplorable by society's standards, but then is never punished for them. In fact, Fanny is ultimately able to achieve her own happy ending when she is able to find Charles again, marrying him and living in a life of wealth. This can be viewed in sharp contrast to a work like ''Pamela,'' where sexual acts are heavily avoided for the sake of maintaining virtue. Meanwhile, within ''Fanny Hill'', normally deplorable acts can be conducted with little to no consequence. {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Literary and film adaptations== <!-- This section is linked from [[B movie]] -->\n{{Further|Fanny Hill (disambiguation)}}\nBecause of the book's notoriety (and [[public domain]] status), numerous adaptations have been produced.

A three-time winner of the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actress|BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress]], she won for ''[[A Cream Cracker under the Settee|Talking Heads: A Cream Cracker Under the Settee]]'' (1988), ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads: Waiting for the Telegram]]'' (1998) and ''[[Lost for Words (1999 film)|Lost for Words]]'' (1999).

Her father James Henry Hird married her mother Jane Mary Mayor in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=112602108:7759&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Marriages Sep 1904|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=112578514:5081&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Marriages Sep 1904|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=126293033:4164&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Births Sep 1911|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer family background was largely theatrical: her mother had been an actress, while her father managed a number of entertainment venues in Morecambe, including the Royalty Theatre where she made her first appearance, and the Central Pier. Thora first appeared on stage at the age of two months in a play her father was managing. She worked at the local [[The Co-operative Group|Co-operative store]] before joining the Morecambe Repertory Theatre.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hird|first=Thora|title=Obituary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/946854.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHird often described her father, who initially did not want her to be an actress, as her sternest critic and attributed much of her talent as an actress and comedian to his guidance. In 1944 she made her [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in the [[Esther McCracken]] play ''[[No Medals]]''.\n\nAlthough Hird left Morecambe in the late 1940s, she retained her affection for the town, referring to herself as a \"sand grown 'un\", the colloquial term for anyone born in Morecambe.\n\nInitially, she made regular appearances in films, including the wartime propaganda film ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942, known as ''48 Hours'' in the USA), in which she is shown wielding a rifle to defend a house from [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|German paratroopers]]. She worked with the British film comedian [[Will Hay]] and featured in ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' (1960), which starred [[Laurence Olivier]], as well as ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' (1962) with [[Alan Bates]] and [[June Ritchie]].\n\nHird gained her highest profile in [[television comedy]], notably the [[situation comedy|sitcoms]] ''[[Meet the Wife (TV series)|Meet the Wife]]'' (1963\u201366), ''[[In Loving Memory (TV series)|In Loving Memory]]'' (1979\u201386), ''[[Hallelujah! (TV series)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1983\u201384), and for nearly two decades as Edie Pegden in ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' (1986\u20132003). However, she played a variety of roles, including the nurse in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best Actress awards for her roles in two of [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads]]'' monologues.\n\nShe starred as Captain Emily Ridley in the sitcom ''[[Hallelujah! (TV series)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1983\u201384) about the [[Salvation Army]], a movement for which she had a soft spot throughout her life. Hird also portrayed Mrs Speck, the housekeeper of the Mayor of [[Gloucester]] in ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester (Television Film)|The Tailor of Gloucester]]'' (1989).\n\nIn 1993 she played Annie Longden, mother of [[Deric Longden]] in ''[[Wide-Eyed and Legless]]'' (known as ''The Wedding Gift'' outside the UK) and reprised her role in the 1999 TV film ''[[Lost for Words (1999 film)|Lost for Words]]'', which won her a [[BAFTA]] for Best Actress.\n\n==Religious broadcasts==\nHird was a committed Christian, hosting the religious programme ''Praise Be!'', a spin off from ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' on the [[BBC]]. Her work for charity and on television in spite of old age and ill health made her an institution. Her advertisements for Churchill [[stairlift]]s also kept her in the public eye.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Honours==\nShe was created an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1983 Birthday Honours]] and raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in the [[1993 Birthday Honours]]. She received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] from [[Lancaster University]] in 1989.\n\n==Later life==\nIn December 1998, using a wheelchair, Hird played a brief but energetic cameo role as the mother of Dolly on ''[[Dinnerladies (TV series)|Dinnerladies]]'', a sarcastic character who was particularly bitter towards her daughter.\n\nHer final work was for [[BBC Radio 7]], recorded and broadcast in 2002: a monologue written for her by Alan Bennett entitled ''The Last of the Sun'', in which she played a forthright, broad-minded woman, immobile in an old people's home but still able to take a stand against the censorious and politically correct attitudes of her own daughter.\n\n==''This Is Your Life''==\nShe was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in January 1964 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]], and in December 1996, when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised her while filming on location for ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/thora_hird_1.html |title=Thora Hird |publisher=Bigredbook.info |date= |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life, death and memorial==\nHird had a heart bypass operation in 1992. She suffered severe arthritis and used a wheelchair in her later life. She died on 15 March 2003 aged 91.\n\nA memorial service was held on 15 September 2003 at [[Westminster Abbey]] attended by more than 2000 people, including [[Alan Bennett]], [[Sir David Frost]], [[Melvyn Bragg]] and [[Victoria Wood]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3110150.stm | title=Stars celebrate Dame Thora's life | date=15 September 2003 | accessdate=29 March 2015 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 July 2019 a commemorative blue plaque was installed to Thora Hird by The Theatre and Film Guild of Great Britain and America, at the [[Bayswater]] home where she lived for over 60 years.<ref>[http://www.themusichallguild.com/news.php \"Dame Thora Hird is Commemorated\"], the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America, accessed 7 July 2019</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\nHird married musician James Scott in 1937.

A three-time winner of the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actress|BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress]], she won for ''[[A Cream Cracker under the Settee|Talking Heads: A Cream Cracker Under the Settee]]'' (1988), ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads: Waiting for the Telegram]]'' (1998) and ''[[Lost for Words (1999 film)|Lost for Words]]'' (1999).

Her father James Henry Hird married her mother Jane Mary Mayor in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=112602108:7759&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Marriages Sep 1904|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=112578514:5081&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Marriages Sep 1904|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=126293033:4164&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Births Sep 1911|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer family background was largely theatrical: her mother had been an actress, while her father managed a number of entertainment venues in Morecambe, including the Royalty Theatre where she made her first appearance, and the Central Pier. Thora first appeared on stage at the age of two months in a play her father was managing. She worked at the local [[The Co-operative Group|Co-operative store]] before joining the Morecambe Repertory Theatre.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hird|first=Thora|title=Obituary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/946854.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHird often described her father, who initially did not want her to be an actress, as her sternest critic and attributed much of her talent as an actress and comedian to his guidance. In 1944 she made her [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in the [[Esther McCracken]] play ''[[No Medals]]''.\n\nAlthough Hird left Morecambe in the late 1940s, she retained her affection for the town, referring to herself as a \"sand grown 'un\", the colloquial term for anyone born in Morecambe.\n\nInitially, she made regular appearances in films, including the wartime propaganda film ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942, known as ''48 Hours'' in the USA), in which she is shown wielding a rifle to defend a house from [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|German paratroopers]]. She worked with the British film comedian [[Will Hay]] and featured in ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' (1960), which starred [[Laurence Olivier]], as well as ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' (1962) with [[Alan Bates]] and [[June Ritchie]].\n\nHird gained her highest profile in [[television comedy]], notably the [[situation comedy|sitcoms]] ''[[Meet the Wife]]'' (1963\u201366), ''[[In Loving Memory (TV series)|In Loving Memory]]'' (1979\u201386), ''[[Hallelujah! (TV series)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1983\u201384), and for nearly two decades as Edie Pegden in ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' (1986\u20132003). However, she played a variety of roles, including the nurse in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best Actress awards for her roles in two of [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads]]'' monologues.\n\nShe starred as Captain Emily Ridley in the sitcom ''[[Hallelujah! (TV series)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1983\u201384) about the [[Salvation Army]], a movement for which she had a soft spot throughout her life. Hird also portrayed Mrs Speck, the housekeeper of the Mayor of [[Gloucester]] in ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester (Television Film)|The Tailor of Gloucester]]'' (1989).\n\nIn 1993 she played Annie Longden, mother of [[Deric Longden]] in ''[[Wide-Eyed and Legless]]'' (known as ''The Wedding Gift'' outside the UK) and reprised her role in the 1999 TV film ''[[Lost for Words (1999 film)|Lost for Words]]'', which won her a [[BAFTA]] for Best Actress.\n\n==Religious broadcasts==\nHird was a committed Christian, hosting the religious programme ''Praise Be!'', a spin off from ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' on the [[BBC]]. Her work for charity and on television in spite of old age and ill health made her an institution. Her advertisements for Churchill [[stairlift]]s also kept her in the public eye.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Honours==\nShe was created an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1983 Birthday Honours]] and raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in the [[1993 Birthday Honours]]. She received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] from [[Lancaster University]] in 1989.\n\n==Later life==\nIn December 1998, using a wheelchair, Hird played a brief but energetic cameo role as the mother of Dolly on ''[[Dinnerladies (TV series)|Dinnerladies]]'', a sarcastic character who was particularly bitter towards her daughter.\n\nHer final work was for [[BBC Radio 7]], recorded and broadcast in 2002: a monologue written for her by Alan Bennett entitled ''The Last of the Sun'', in which she played a forthright, broad-minded woman, immobile in an old people's home but still able to take a stand against the censorious and politically correct attitudes of her own daughter.\n\n==''This Is Your Life''==\nShe was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in January 1964 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]], and in December 1996, when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised her while filming on location for ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/thora_hird_1.html |title=Thora Hird |publisher=Bigredbook.info |date= |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life, death and memorial==\nHird had a heart bypass operation in 1992. She suffered severe arthritis and used a wheelchair in her later life. She died on 15 March 2003 aged 91.\n\nA memorial service was held on 15 September 2003 at [[Westminster Abbey]] attended by more than 2000 people, including [[Alan Bennett]], [[Sir David Frost]], [[Melvyn Bragg]] and [[Victoria Wood]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3110150.stm | title=Stars celebrate Dame Thora's life | date=15 September 2003 | accessdate=29 March 2015 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 July 2019 a commemorative blue plaque was installed to Thora Hird by The Theatre and Film Guild of Great Britain and America, at the [[Bayswater]] home where she lived for over 60 years.<ref>[http://www.themusichallguild.com/news.php \"Dame Thora Hird is Commemorated\"], the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America, accessed 7 July 2019</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\nHird married musician James Scott in 1937.

Notes to Classico CD  CLASSCD634 ''The British Symphonic Collection'', Vol. 14</ref> In Foreman's view, the symphonies are, for their time, ambitious in their use of the orchestra, showing the influence of early Beethoven, and reminiscent of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s symphonies although the latter were completely unknown in Britain at the time.<ref name=lf/>\n\n==Recordings==\n===Commercial recordings of works by Potter===\n*Symphony No. 7 in F major.

It started in 1922 as a simple shelter on land presented by the [[Sultan of Johor]].\n\nIn 1991, Sri Sinnathamby Sivasamy, current temple chairman and chief priest, also known as Guru Bhagawan Sittar inherited the administration of the temple from his father. He is the inspiration and driving force behind the temple. The Guru made a commitment to rebuild the temple upon inheriting it from the humble hut it once was. In spite of difficulties and challenges, the temple was rebuilt and officially reopened in 1996.\n\n===Rebuilding in glass===\nThe Guru had the inspiration to rebuild the temple in glass during one of his trips to [[Bangkok]]. He was in a [[tuk-tuk]] ([[auto-rickshaw]]) in [[Bangkok]] when he saw a light shining like a diamond, some {{convert|2|km}} away. The driver told him that it was a wat (temple). When he went there, he found that it was the glass artwork at the temple entrance that had caught his eyes.\n\nHe was amazed that a small glass artwork could capture his attention from a vast distance. This inspired him to use this technique in the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Temple. He believed a temple fully embellished with impressive glass artwork will attract local devotees and visitors from the world over.\n\nTransformation of the temple with glass fittings started in 2008 and was completed in October 2009.<ref name=\"glitters\" /> Since then, it has become one of the state's major tourist attractions.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman exterior.jpg|thumb|right|The exterior of the temple, image taken by the [[Georgia National Guard]].]]\nLight from crystal chandeliers is reflected on doors, pillars, walls and ceilings in a bright blaze that's quite blinding initially. At least 90 per cent of the temple is embellished by a mosaic of 300,000 pieces of red, blue, yellow, green, purple and white glass.\n\nThe centrepiece in the Athma Lingam sanctuary is a [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] for [[Shiva]], on which devotees can pour rose water and perform their prayers. Guru says this special sanctuary is the first in [[Malaysia]] to be designed with walls that are fully covered with 300,000 mukni [[Rudraksha]] beads from [[Nepal]].\n\nAt a glance, the walls appear to have an unusual embossed texture. Each [[Rudraksha]] bead is embedded in the walls with a chanted prayer.\n\nThe fully air-conditioned temple has a caf\u00e9 that serves vegetarian meals for special events, and a function hall in an adjoining building.\n\n==Sculptures==\nThere are 10 gold-finished sculptures close to the ceiling. Of the two figures on the left, one appears to be lying down and the other crawling, while the one on the far right seems to be reclining too. These sculptures portray the cycle of life, from birth, youth, adulthood, to old age and death.\n\nThere are 10 white marble statues standing {{convert|120|cm}} tall each. According to the name plaques, these are Gautama Buddha, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Sai Baba and Mother Teresa. The Guru believes that these are messengers of God, and visitors of other faiths will be happy to see them here.\n\n==Murals==\nOn the left wing, there are two large panels on the ceiling painted by specially commissioned artists to convey a universal message of social and racial harmony.\n\nIn one picture, a cow is next to an [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] girl, a dog is near a [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] girl while a [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] girl holds a cat in her arms.\n\nThe other picture has a [[Hindu]] motorcyclist being helped up by a [[Muslim]] after he fell off his bike, while a [[Buddhist]] is picking up his helmet and a [[Christians|Christian]] is lifting up the motorcycle.\n\n==Location and Opening Hours==\nThe temple, located in 22 Lorong 1, Jalan Tebrau, Johor Baru, is accessible through Jalan Tun Abdul Razak and the lane that borders Gim Shew Building.

Disagreements over design authority and operational requirements led France to leave the consortium to develop the [[Dassault Rafale]] independently. A technology demonstration aircraft, the [[British Aerospace EAP]], first took flight on 6{{nbsp}}August 1986; the first prototype of the finalised Eurofighter made its first flight on 27 March 1994. The aircraft's name, Typhoon, was adopted in September 1998; the first production contracts were also signed that year.\n\nPolitical issues in the partner nations significantly protracted the Typhoon's development: the sudden end of the [[Cold War]], reduced European demand for fighter aircraft, and the debate over the aircraft's cost and work share. The Typhoon entered operational service in 2003; it has entered service with the air forces of [[Austrian Air Force|Austria]], [[Italian Air Force|Italy]], [[German Air Force|Germany]], the [[Royal Air Force|United Kingdom]], [[Spanish Air Force|Spain]] and [[Royal Saudi Air Force|Saudi Arabia]]. The air forces of [[Royal Air Force of Oman|Oman]], [[Kuwait Air Force|Kuwait]] and [[Qatar Air Force|Qatar]] are export customers, bringing the procurement total to 623 aircraft {{as of|2019|lc=yes}}.\n\nThe Eurofighter Typhoon is a highly agile aircraft, designed to be a supremely effective [[dogfight]]er in combat.<ref>''[[Janes Defence Weekly]]'', Vol 52 ''Fighting Fit'', page XL</ref> Later production aircraft have been increasingly better equipped to undertake air-to-surface strike missions and to be compatible with an increasing number of different armaments and equipment, including [[Storm Shadow]] and the [[RAF]]'s [[Brimstone (missile)|Brimstone]]. The Typhoon had its combat debut during the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] with the UK's Royal Air Force and the Italian Air Force, performing [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Air interdiction|ground-strike]] missions.

The AST 403 specification, issued by the [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air staff]] in 1972, led to the P.96 conventional \"tailed\" design presented in the late 1970s. While the design would have met the Air Staff's requirements, the UK air industry had reservations, as it appeared to be very similar to the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]], which was then well advanced in its development. The P.96 design had little potential for growth, and when it entered production, it would secure few exports in a market in which the Hornet would be well established.<ref name=\"Boot\">Boot 1990, pp. 229\u2013233.</ref> However, the simultaneous West German requirement for a new fighter had led by 1979 to the development of the TKF-90 concept.<ref name=\"butler\">Buttler 2000, pp. 131\u2013134.</ref><ref name=\"efcuk\" /> This was a [[Delta wing#Design variations|cranked delta wing]] design with forward close-coupled-[[canard (aeronautics)|canard controls]] and artificial stability.

Depending on the attitude, the FCS employs an ALSR \"push\", \"pull\" or \"knife-over\" manoeuvre.<ref>[http://www.targetlock.org.uk/typhoon/systems.html \"Flight Control System.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316175354/http://www.targetlock.org.uk/typhoon/systems.html |date=16 March 2012 }} ''targetlock.org.uk.''

It was the first production DVI system used in a military cockpit. DVI provides the pilot with an additional natural mode of command and control over approximately 26 non-critical cockpit functions, to reduce pilot workload, improve aircraft safety, and expand mission capabilities. An important step in the development of the DVI occurred in 1987 when [[Texas Instruments]] completed the TMS-320-C30, a digital signal-processor, enabling reductions in the size and system complexity required. The project was given the go-ahead in July 1997, with development and pilot assessment carried out on the Eurofighter Active Cockpit Simulator at BAE Systems Warton.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512020020/http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jav/jav_a062.html \"Janes: Aircraft Control and Monitoring Systems.\"] (archive version) Jane's Information Group, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe DVI system is speaker-dependent, requiring each pilot to create a template.

To overcome this, the Typhoon employs what are now known as [[sensor fusion]] techniques. In the Typhoon fusion of all data sources is achieved through the Attack and Identification System, or AIS. The AIS combines data from the major on-board sensors along with any information obtained from off-board platforms such as [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]], [[Raytheon Sentinel|ASTOR]], and Eurofighter own Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS). Additionally the AIS integrates all the other major offensive and defensive systems such as the DASS, Navigation, ACS and Communications. The AIS physically comprises two essentially separate units: the Attack Computer (AC) and the Navigation Computer (NC), linked via the [[STANAG 3910]] databus to the other major systems such as the ACS, ECR-90/CAPTOR, [[EuroFIRST PIRATE|PIRATE]], etc. Both the AC and the NC are identical in design, being a modular unit based on [[Motorola 68020]] [[CPU]]s with math [[co-processor]]s, and several custom [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]-based processors to accelerate [[floating point]] and matrix operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sensor-fusion-52559 |title=Sensor fusion |date=16 June 1999 |website= Flight Global |accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy having a single source of information, pilot [[Cognitive load|workload]] should be reduced by removing the possibility of conflicting data and the need for cross-checking, improving [[situational awareness]] and increasing systems automation. In practice the AIS should allow the Eurofighter to identify targets at distances in excess of 150&nbsp;nmi and acquire and auto-prioritise them at over 100&nbsp;nmi. In addition the AIS offers the ability to automatically control emissions from the aircraft, so called EMCON (from EMissions CONtrol). This should aid in limiting the detectability of the Typhoon by opposing aircraft further reducing pilot workload.<ref name=\"Paul S.

The output can be directed to any of the Multi-function Head Down Displays, and can also be overlaid on both the Helmet Mounted Sight and the Head Up Display.\n\nThe IIR sensor has a stabilised mount so it can maintain a target within its field of view. Up to 200 targets can be simultaneously tracked using one of several different modes; Multiple Target Track (MTT), Single Target Track (STT), Single Target Track Ident (STTI), Sector Acquisition and Slaved Acquisition. In MTT mode the system will scan a designated volume space looking for potential targets. In STT mode PIRATE will provide high precision tracking of a single designated target. An addition to this mode, STT Ident allows for visual identification of the target, the resolution being superior to CAPTOR's. Both Sector and Slave Acquisition demonstrate the level of sensor fusion present in the Typhoon. When in Sector Acquisition mode PIRATE will scan a volume of space under direction of another onboard sensor such as CAPTOR. In Slave Acquisition, off-board sensors are used with PIRATE being commanded by data obtained from an AWACS or other source. When a target is found in either of these modes, PIRATE will automatically designate it and switch to STT.\n\nOnce a target has been tracked and identified, PIRATE can be used to cue an appropriately equipped short range missile, i.e. a missile with a high off-boresight tracking capability such as ASRAAM. Additionally the data can be used to augment that of CAPTOR or off-board sensor information via the AIS.

Disagreements over design authority and operational requirements led France to leave the consortium to develop the [[Dassault Rafale]] independently. A technology demonstration aircraft, the [[British Aerospace EAP]], first took flight on 6{{nbsp}}August 1986; the first prototype of the finalised Eurofighter made its first flight on 27 March 1994. The aircraft's name, Typhoon, was adopted in September 1998; the first production contracts were also signed that year.\n\nPolitical issues in the partner nations significantly protracted the Typhoon's development: the sudden end of the [[Cold War]], reduced European demand for fighter aircraft, and the debate over the aircraft's cost and work share. The Typhoon entered operational service in 2003; it has entered service with the air forces of [[Austrian Air Force|Austria]], [[Italian Air Force|Italy]], [[German Air Force|Germany]], the [[Royal Air Force|United Kingdom]], [[Spanish Air Force|Spain]] and [[Royal Saudi Air Force|Saudi Arabia]]. The air forces of [[Royal Air Force of Oman|Oman]], [[Kuwait Air Force|Kuwait]] and [[Qatar Air Force|Qatar]] are export customers, bringing the procurement total to 623 aircraft {{as of|2019|lc=yes}}.\n\nThe Eurofighter Typhoon is a highly agile aircraft, designed to be a supremely effective [[dogfight]]er in combat.<ref>''[[Janes Defence Weekly]]'', Vol 52 ''Fighting Fit'', page XL</ref> Later production aircraft have been increasingly better equipped to undertake air-to-surface strike missions and to be compatible with an increasing number of different armaments and equipment, including [[Storm Shadow]] and the [[RAF]]'s [[Brimstone (missile)|Brimstone]]. The Typhoon had its combat debut during the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] with the UK's Royal Air Force and the Italian Air Force, performing [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Air interdiction|ground-strike]] missions. The type has also taken primary responsibility for air-defence duties for the majority of customer nations.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\n\n{{Further|British Aerospace EAP}}\n[[File:Eurofighter logo.svg|thumb|left|Official Eurofighter logo]]\n\nThe UK had identified a requirement for a new fighter as early as 1971. The AST 403 specification, issued by the [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air staff]] in 1972, led to the P.96 conventional \"tailed\" design presented in the late 1970s. While the design would have met the Air Staff's requirements, the UK air industry had reservations, as it appeared to be very similar to the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]], which was then well advanced in its development. The P.96 design had little potential for growth, and when it entered production, it would secure few exports in a market in which the Hornet would be well established.<ref name=\"Boot\">Boot 1990, pp. 229\u2013233.</ref> However, the simultaneous West German requirement for a new fighter had led by 1979 to the development of the TKF-90 concept.<ref name=\"butler\">Buttler 2000, pp. 131\u2013134.</ref><ref name=\"efcuk\" /> This was a [[Delta wing#Design variations|cranked delta wing]] design with forward close-coupled-[[canard (aeronautics)|canard controls]] and artificial stability.

To overcome this, the Typhoon employs what are now known as [[sensor fusion]] techniques. In the Typhoon fusion of all data sources is achieved through the Attack and Identification System, or AIS. The AIS combines data from the major on-board sensors along with any information obtained from off-board platforms such as [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]], [[Raytheon Sentinel|ASTOR]], and Eurofighter own Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS). Additionally the AIS integrates all the other major offensive and defensive systems such as the DASS, Navigation, ACS and Communications. The AIS physically comprises two essentially separate units: the Attack Computer (AC) and the Navigation Computer (NC), linked via the [[STANAG 3910]] databus to the other major systems such as the ACS, ECR-90/CAPTOR, [[EuroFIRST PIRATE|PIRATE]], etc. Both the AC and the NC are identical in design, being a modular unit based on [[Motorola 68020]] [[CPU]]s with math [[co-processor]]s, and several custom [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]-based processors to accelerate [[floating point]] and matrix operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sensor-fusion-52559 |title=Sensor fusion |date=16 June 1999 |website= Flight Global |accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy having a single source of information, pilot [[Cognitive load|workload]] should be reduced by removing the possibility of conflicting data and the need for cross-checking, improving [[situational awareness]] and increasing systems automation. In practice the AIS should allow the Eurofighter to identify targets at distances in excess of 150&nbsp;nmi and acquire and auto-prioritise them at over 100&nbsp;nmi. In addition the AIS offers the ability to automatically control emissions from the aircraft, so called EMCON (from EMissions CONtrol). This should aid in limiting the detectability of the Typhoon by opposing aircraft further reducing pilot workload.<ref name=\"Paul S.

The output can be directed to any of the Multi-function Head Down Displays, and can also be overlaid on both the Helmet Mounted Sight and the Head Up Display.\n\nThe IIR sensor has a stabilised mount so it can maintain a target within its field of view. Up to 200 targets can be simultaneously tracked using one of several different modes; Multiple Target Track (MTT), Single Target Track (STT), Single Target Track Ident (STTI), Sector Acquisition and Slaved Acquisition. In MTT mode the system will scan a designated volume space looking for potential targets. In STT mode PIRATE will provide high precision tracking of a single designated target. An addition to this mode, STT Ident allows for visual identification of the target, the resolution being superior to CAPTOR's. Both Sector and Slave Acquisition demonstrate the level of sensor fusion present in the Typhoon. When in Sector Acquisition mode PIRATE will scan a volume of space under direction of another onboard sensor such as CAPTOR. In Slave Acquisition, off-board sensors are used with PIRATE being commanded by data obtained from an AWACS or other source. When a target is found in either of these modes, PIRATE will automatically designate it and switch to STT.\n\nOnce a target has been tracked and identified, PIRATE can be used to cue an appropriately equipped short range missile, i.e. a missile with a high off-boresight tracking capability such as ASRAAM. Additionally the data can be used to augment that of CAPTOR or off-board sensor information via the AIS. This should enable the Typhoon to overcome severe ECM environments and still engage its targets.<ref name=\"Paul S.

P52</ref> is a [[Hindu]] temple dedicated to [[Shiva]] located in the village of Alangudi in the [[Valangaiman taluk]]<ref>http://tnmaps.tn.nic.in/vill.php?dcode=20&centcode=0001&tlkname=Valangaiman#MAP</ref> of [[Tiruvarur district]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. Shiva is worshipped as Apathsahyesvarar, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]''. His consort [[Parvati]] is depicted as Elavarkuzhali. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil saint poets known as the [[Nayanmars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''.\n\nThe temple complex covers two acres and it houses a five tier gateway tower known as ''[[gopurams]]'', one facing the Apathsaheswarar shrine and other towards North. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Apathsaheswarar and his consort Elavarkuzhali being the most prominent.\n\nThe temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&nbsp;p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated during Chittirai (April\u2013May) is the most prominent festival.\n\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by [[Cholas]], while the present masonry structure was built during the [[Madurai Nayak|Nayak]] during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the [[Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department]] of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe temple has a 5-tier ''raja[[gopuram]]'' surrounded by two ''[[prakarams]]'' (closed precincts of a temple).\n\n==Legend==\nLegend is that [[Shiva|Siva]] consumed deadly poison, giving rise to the name Alangudi and deity being termed Apatsahayesvarar, indicating saviour during hard times. The other names of the presiding deity are Aranyeswarar. There are sixteen waterbodies associated with the temple.<ref name=Meena>{{cite book|title=Temples in South India|last=V.|first=Meena|publisher=Harikumar Arts|location=Kanniyakumari|year=1974|edition=1st|page=32}}</ref>\n\nPancha Aranya Sthalams: Aranyam means forest and the following five temples at different forests Thanjavur / Kumbakonam / Thiruvarur region are revered as \u201cPancha Aranya Sthalams\u201d.\n* 1.

Shiva is worshipped as Apathsahyesvarar, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]''. His consort [[Parvati]] is depicted as Elavarkuzhali. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil saint poets known as the [[Nayanmars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''.\n\nThe temple complex covers two acres and it houses a five tier gateway tower known as ''[[gopurams]]'', one facing the Apathsaheswarar shrine and other towards North. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Apathsaheswarar and his consort Elavarkuzhali being the most prominent.\n\nThe temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&nbsp;p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated during Chittirai (April\u2013May) is the most prominent festival.\n\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by [[Cholas]], while the present masonry structure was built during the [[Madurai Nayak|Nayak]] during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the [[Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department]] of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe temple has a 5-tier ''raja[[gopuram]]'' surrounded by two ''[[prakarams]]'' (closed precincts of a temple).\n\n==Legend==\nLegend is that [[Shiva|Siva]] consumed deadly poison, giving rise to the name Alangudi and deity being termed Apatsahayesvarar, indicating saviour during hard times. The other names of the presiding deity are Aranyeswarar. There are sixteen waterbodies associated with the temple.<ref name=Meena>{{cite book|title=Temples in South India|last=V.|first=Meena|publisher=Harikumar Arts|location=Kanniyakumari|year=1974|edition=1st|page=32}}</ref>\n\nPancha Aranya Sthalams: Aranyam means forest and the following five temples at different forests Thanjavur / Kumbakonam / Thiruvarur region are revered as \u201cPancha Aranya Sthalams\u201d.\n* 1.
