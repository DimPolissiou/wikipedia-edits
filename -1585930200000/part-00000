''Blast-Off Buzzard'' imitated [[Looney Tunes]]' [[Wile E.

The show was also rebroadcast on [[Cartoon Network]] from 1995\u20131997.

They travel the country solving mysteries in a tacky garbage truck called the Perfume Wagon (the CB term for a garbage truck). A sultry-voiced female named Charlie (voiced by [[Susan Davis (actor)|Susan Davis]]) contacts the bears on the truck's [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] to give them their assignments. This show was \"inspired\" by the hit TV series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (Bump wore a blonde hairstyle similar to [[Farrah Fawcett]]). Each of the bears' names are based on a 1970s [[disco]] dance, and the show's overall premise made reference to the CB radio craze of the mid-1970s (by this point waning in popularity). Physically and personality-wise, Hustle, Boogie, and Bump resemble Hair Bear, Bubi Bear, and Square Bear, respectively, from ''[[Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!]]''; [[Daws Butler]] provided the same Phil Silvers-esque voice for both Hustle and Hair.\n\n====Episodes====\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:80%; background:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:30px\"| {{Abbr|N\u00ba|Number}}\n! style=\"background:#FFD700\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:135px\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = C.1\n| Title = The Missing Mansion Mystery\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1977|9|10}}\n| ShortSummary = The CB Bears uncover a missing mansion in the midst of an alligator-infested lagoon.\n| LineColor = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = C.2\n| Title = The Doomsday Mine\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1977|9|17}}\n| ShortSummary = The CB Bears drive out to End of the Trail, Arizona, where people are turning green and strange lights and sounds are emanating from the deserted Doomsday Mine.\n| LineColor = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = C.3\n| Title = Follow that Mountain\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1977|9|24}}\n| ShortSummary = While investigating the strange case of the disappearing mountains, the CB Bears fall into a cavern and are chased by giant [[gopher]]s created by Dr. Terra.\n| LineColor = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = C.4\n| Title = Valley of No Return\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1977|10|1}}\n| ShortSummary = The CB Bears go deep into the jungle to discover why the animals are fleeing in terror from the Valley of No Return.

This show was \"inspired\" by the hit TV series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (Bump wore a blonde hairstyle similar to [[Farrah Fawcett]]). Each of the bears' names are based on a 1970s [[disco]] dance, and the show's overall premise made reference to the CB radio craze of the mid-1970s (by this point waning in popularity).

It was registered as [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]] #669, with the endorsement of then-owner Michael LaFetra, the [[Los Angeles Conservancy]], and [[Pierre Koenig|Pierre]] and Gloria Koenig.\n\n== The Case Study House Program ==\nIn January 1945 [[John Entenza]], the editor and publisher of [[Arts & Architecture]] magazine, announced the [[Case Study Houses|Case Study House Program]] (CSHP). The program was envisioned as a creative response to the impending building boom expected to follow the [[House|housing]] shortages of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]. Entenza encouraged participating [[architect]]s to use donated materials from [[industry]] and [[manufacturer]]s to create low-cost, modern housing [[prototype]]s that might foster a dialogue between architectural professionals and laymen.\n\nThe highly publicized program ran from 1945 to 1964, spanning thirty-six individual designs, many of which were never constructed. The initial program announcement stated that \u201ceach house must be capable of [[wikt:duplication|duplication]] and in no sense be an individual performance\u201d and that \u201cthe overall program will be general enough to be of practical assistance to the average American in search of a home in which he can afford to live.\u201d\n\nAfter returning from four years of fighting in WWII, Pierre Koenig was introduced to the CSHP through the ongoing publication of the [[avant-garde]] designs in Arts & Architecture magazine. By 1948 Koenig's interest in modern [[architecture]] led him to transfer from [[Pasadena City College]] to the School of Architecture at the [[University of Southern California]] where he studied under [[Richard Neutra]] and [[Gregory Ain]]. In 1950, while enrolled at USC, Koenig designed and built his first [[Steel-framed building|steel-framed house]] for himself and his family.\n\nKoenig's first involvement with the Case Study House Program occurred while working in the office of [[Raphael Soriano]] on the Case Study House 1950 project. In 1956 he worked briefly with [[Archibald Quincy Jones]] on a steel house in [[San Mateo, California]] for the prominent [[property developer]] [[Joseph Eichler]]. Eichler and John Entenza were well acquainted and both were developing a keen interest in the potential of lightweight [[steel construction]] for residential architecture.\n\nKoenig's hands-on experience with steel construction and his mastery of the new [[arc welding]] process on the San Mateo house would prove influential for the rest of his architectural career. Entenza saw great potential in Koenig's design work of the time and offered him a tentative invitation to participate in the CSHP when he \u201cfound the right house and the right client.\u201d This period marked the beginning of what [[historian]] [[Esther McCoy]] would later identify as the second phase of the Case Study House Program, represented by \u201ca concerted effort\u2026 to bring architecture into relationship with the machine.\u201d\n\n== The Bailey Commission ==\nIn early 1957 [[psychologist]] Walter Bailey and his wife Mary commissioned Pierre Koenig to design a 1,200-1,300 square foot house upon a level site nestled within a [[Hollywood Hills]] [[canyon]]. The Baileys were later described in Arts & Architecture magazine as a \u201ccontemporary-minded\u201d couple with no children and an informal lifestyle. This represented the ideal program for Koenig to realize steel framings potential to achieve a truly [[open plan]] design that capitalized upon the vast spans that steel facilitated.\n\nBy May 1958 Koenig had completed his [[construction drawing]]s and begun collaboration with [[Factory|factories]] that were capable of producing the prefabricated steel [[Bent (structural)|bents]]. The bulk of [[construction]] took place from August to November of the same year, and by January 1959 the house was officially completed.\n\n== Publication ==\nIn February 1959 Case Study House #21 was published in Arts & Architecture and was lauded as \u201csome of the cleanest and most immaculate thinking in the development of the small contemporary house.\u201d As was standard for all CSHP participants, the house was opened to the public for several weeks of viewing.\n\nA year later in 1960, a [[photographer]] named [[Julius Shulman]] (himself a Case Study client) was invited to photograph the Bailey House. The photographs he took would later become iconic symbols of California Modernism. As one article for [[L\u2019Uomo Vogue]] described, Shulman's architectural photographs of Case Study House #21 and [[Stahl House|#22]] have \u201can enduring resonance and iconic power. Taken on the eve of America\u2019s involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] they record the last glorious moments of American post-war [[hegemony]] and self-confidence and its unquestioned belief in the benefits of progress and technology.\u201d\n\nNearly thirty years later in 1989 Shulman's photographs of the Case Study Houses were exhibited at the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]] in an exhibit titled \u201cBlueprints for Modern Living\u201d which would ignite a \u201cgroundswell of interest in [[Modernism]]\u201d and renewed appreciation for Koenig's contribution to the California Modern movement, which had been largely forgotten during the 1970s and \u201880s.\n\n==Significant alterations==\nAbout 1969 Dr. and Mrs. Bailey relocated to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] for professional reasons and put Case Study House #21 up for sale. Sadly, over the next thirty years a succession of owners exhibited \u201cweaker commitments to maintenance and preservation\u201d than the Baileys had demonstrated. Numerous ad-hoc [[renovation]]s wreaked havoc upon the original design. Among these were the installation of several [[skylight (window)|skylight]]s and a [[fireplace]].\n\nIn the 1980s Koenig's original [[kitchen]] was demolished and was replaced with a center-island [[cooking]] station. The slab-like white-[[Vinyl composition tile|vinyl]]-tiled floors that Koenig originally specified were replaced with wide-grout [[ceramic tile]]s. Years later Koenig would describe his impressions of the altered house by stating: \u201ceven though I knew what had been going on in this house it was a great shock to see it. My houses are like children to me.\u201d\n\nIn 1997 an admirer of Julius Shulman's photography, [[film producer]] Dan Cracchiolo expressed interest in the Bailey House after seeing some of Shulman's photographs. He made an offer on the property of $1.5 million. The offer was accepted and Cracchiolo immediately commissioned Pierre Koenig to assist with \u2018resuscitating\u2019 the original design.\n\nThe meticulous [[Building restoration|restoration]] that followed would last for over a year, nearly twice the duration of the original construction. In recalling the process Koenig later described the difficulty of \u201cfinding the parts.\u201d The mosaic tile that covered the walls of the interior [[courtyard]] proved particularly challenging. Restoring the essence of the original kitchen with state-of-the-art appliances also proved difficult. The wall-hung [[refrigerator]] of the original design was no longer in production by [[General Electric]] so Koenig modified three under-counter [[Sub-Zero Refrigerator]]s by inverting the motor locations to conform to the plan. Koenig also retrofitted the house with state-of-the-art mechanical and lighting elements including an updated [[water heating|water heater]] and [[furnace]] housed in the utility core. When the process was nearly complete Koenig reflected on the restoration acknowledging \u201ca weird sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in working on the same building forty years after I built it the first time\u201d but confessing \u201ca wonderful feeling about getting it right, again.\u201d\n\nCracchiolo was not content with a purely architectural restoration and pursued reinstatement of the original [[furnishing]]s as well. To replace the long-discontinued [[Formica]] entry cabinet shown in the famous Julius Schulman photograph, Cracchiolo commissioned Jerry McCabe, the original manufacturer, to repeat the design. Likewise, a black [[Naugahyde]] sofa was commissioned to the exact specifications of the original.\n\nIn a July 1999 [[Architectural Digest]] article describing the restoration process Cracchiolo acknowledged feeling \u201can edgy ambivalence between wanting, on the one hand, to restore Case Study #21 to its original condition of fifties \u2018purity\u2019 and, on the other to allow more expression of his own nineties needs and tastes.\u201d One example he describes is his desire to display books rather than leaving the walls as pure and bare as the original Shulman photographs depict. In 2001 Pierre Koenig received the City of Los Angeles historic Preservation 2000 Award of excellence for his beautiful restoration of the Bailey House.\n\nShortly after publication of the Architectural Digest article a film producer named Michael LaFetra who had been looking for modern architecture properties came across the article and resolved to purchase the property. It came on the market shortly after and LaFetra\u2019s offer was accepted. Within a week of the purchase LaFetra received a phone message from Pierre Koenig stating: \u201cHello, this is Pierre, your architect, and I want to talk.\u201d Soon after LaFetra was told by Koenig that \u201che ought not to have to change anything in the house but, if he needed to, he should get in touch with him.\u201d\n\nSoon after a friendship began and by 2000 LaFetra had commissioned Koenig to design a new home for him on a [[beachfront]] lot in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. After ensuring protection for Case Study House #21 by registering it as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, the house was put on the market in 2002 to pay for the new construction. With Koenig's permission LaFetra began work on a [[documentary]] to cover the design and construction process, but sadly in 2004 Koenig succumbed to [[leukemia]] and died April 4 of that year.\n\n== Current condition ==\nIn July 2006 Julius Shulman (at age 95) was invited to revisit Case Study House #21 to photograph it in its modern condition for the catalog of an upcoming [[auction]] at Wright 20. On December 3, 2006 the property sold for $3,185,600 to a female art collector from [[South Korea]]. This sale represented the second highest price of a Modern house at auction, just behind [[Mies van der Rohe]]\u2019s [[Farnsworth House (Plano, Illinois)|Farnsworth House]], which sold for $8 million. Reports of the sale describe it as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in the public acceptance of Modernism as art, rather than [[real estate]].\n\nShulman's latest photographs offer a unique glimpse into the precision of Koenig's restoration. Although Koenig's completed house is nearly exact to the original design, subtle changes are present. Among these are a slightly altered [[tile|tiling]] layout for the inner courtyard wall and a more elaborate [[fountain]] mechanism below. The can-like lights that are present throughout the space appear to have a darkened [[patina]] applied as compared to the original [[lacquer]]ed fixtures. Additionally, Cracchiolo apparently requested the introduction of semi-translucent glass on the [[bathroom]] walls for increased privacy.\n\n== Description ==\nIn describing his concept for Case Study House #21, Koenig stated \"I was trying to develop\" {{convert|1,300|sqft|m2}} \"in an efficient, social, and exciting plan that people could afford\u2026 I had thrown out all conventional thought because I had no patience with anything that had been done before.\" The Case Study program called for the design of mass-producible prototypes and Koenig appears to have accomplished this while adequately addressing site-specific factors.\n\nCSH #21 is arranged along a north\u2013south axis with a carport on the North side and a fully glazed South side to take advantage of the best view and maximum sunlight for winter months. Koenig opted for a compressed \u2018L\u2019 shaped plan to establish a linear progression from the [[carport]] and entry through the living space and out to the garden. This compression is achieved by opaque, steel decking walls blocking the unattractive views towards the \u201cscrubby hillside\u201d on the West and Wonderland Park Avenue on the East.\n\nThe main house is a 30\u2019 x 44\u2019 rectangular plan with a solid rectangular core housing the utilities \u2013 two full bathrooms and a mechanical room. Beyond this core lay two efficiently arranged bedrooms. The threshold through this interior courtyard/core provides increased privacy (visually and acoustically) for the bedrooms. By designing a central service core Koenig simplified the language of the perimeter condition to either standard sized [[Sliding door|sliding glass doors]] or opaque steel walls. The simplicity of the material vocabulary is what John Entenza found most appealing. When first visiting the house he described it as \u201ca very pristine, clean design. Two details, one north\u2013south, one east\u2013west. One material for the roof, same one for the walls. Minimal house, maximum space.\u201d\n\nThe steel framing system of the house is composed of four prefabricated steel bents 44\u2019 wide x 9\u2019 high, forming the interior of the house. In addition, three half-span bents are used to frame the covered carport. Koenig specified identical structure to the houses he worked on with Soriano and Jones \u2013 8\u201d I-section beams and 4\u201d H-section columns. Rather than use a standardized 8\u2019 dimension, Koenig opted for a 10\u2019 spacing between bents for economy and to streamline the overall structure. Koenig frequently stated, \u201cSteel is only as good as its detailing. In order to make exposed steel acceptable in the living room it must be so well detailed that the joining connections are imperceptible.\u201d\n\nIndicative of the changing context, the property is now surrounded by tall [[tree]]s and [[shrubbery]], replacing what was once a grand view to the south. This is clearly an adaptation to achieve greater privacy within the now densely populated Hollywood Hills canyon. As an article in [[House Beautiful]] magazine described, today \u201cthe building\u2019s defiant simplicity stands in stark contrast to the fussy over-scaled residences that sit high on the hills behind it.\u201d\n\n== Evaluation ==\n\n=== Technical ===\nThe rigidity of the steel framing provided sufficient lateral stability in the east\u2013west direction, and the welding of channels to the top and base of each columns provided additional strength in the north\u2013south direction for resistance to seismic forces and wind loads. These expressed elements unify the building aesthetically and structurally.\n\nKoenig made use of the sandwiched steel decking walls to conceal [[Building insulation|insulation]], [[wiring]] and pipes. By piercing the roof over the bathroom and utility areas, even the core of the house has access to exterior elements such as daylight, rain, and plantings. This feature also provides an acoustical buffer between living and sleeping areas and underscores the airy, natural feel of the house.\n\nThe furnace in utility core supplies heat to the main space through [[heating duct]]s, which are arranged along the base of the glass walls for maximum efficiency. During the winter the lack of overhangs provides maximum passive heat gain, and use of the original Koolshade panels was meant to minimize excessive heat gain in the summer.\n\nThe circulation of pond water up to the gutters and back down through the roof scuppers represents an early experiment with environmental control systems. As [[James Steele (journalist)|James Steele]] described in his [[monograph]] of Pierre Koenig, \u201cthe strategy is both pragmatic and lyrical; the water has some cooling properties and the hard building edge at the ground level is softened by the reflective surface.\u201d Additionally, this circulation eliminates the need for chemical treatment of the water.\n\n=== Social ===\nAlthough architects of the second phase of the Case Study House Program never gave up their belief in the potential of steel framing for residential construction, the public never embraced the material. As [[Elizabeth A. T. Smith]] explained: \u201cUnfortunately, the economic pressures of the era were pushing residential construction another way, to accommodate the merchant builders working to deskill building tradesman and architects, and to glorify the add-ons and fix-ups of Mr. Homeowner and Mrs. Consumer, the stock characters of American advertising lobbying of the 1920s and 30s.\u201d Although they imagined factory-based industrial materials could be more economical then traditional wood framing, this was never realized. As such steel-framing faced social and economical obstacles. In the end, the [[Levittown]] paradigm would dominate America's [[mass housing]] strategy in the post-war era.\n\n=== Cultural and aesthetic ===\nBy painting the walls and ceiling white and maintaining the factory-applied charcoal Perma-Bar sealer coating on the steel, Koenig created visual emphasis on the structural skeleton. By expressing the volume as a simple box without overhangs Koenig underscored the simplicity of the rectangular forms and achieved an understated elegance.\n\nThe fully glazed North and South walls blur the interior and exterior \u2013 a common goal of the Case Study Houses. Describing the aesthetic goals of the movement Koenig would later explain: \u201cWe moved garages to the front and living rooms to the back to put them closer to the yard\u2026 We used steel, which in addition to being economical gave us a different living environment. It opened up the plan, letting us use more glass to create more light, which helped heighten the relationship of the interior to the exterior.\u201d\n\nKoenig's inclusion of the ponds around the perimeter of the house allows the structure to read as if it is floating. As [[Elizabeth A.T. Smith]] described in ''Blueprints for Modern Living'', \u201creflections of trees and sky intermingled on the water\u2019s surface with the pure lines of the house\u2019s contour\u2026humanized through the merging of the technological with the natural.\u201d\n\n=== Historical ===\nAlthough CSH #22 is more recognizable, CSH#21 is arguably the finest example of Pierre Koenig's steel-framed houses. It is widely considered to represent the highest point of the Case Study House Program's success. As [[Neil Jackson]] stated in his monograph of Koenig, \u201cThe Bailey House represents the ultimate refinement of an ideal developed by Koenig in his early houses and built upon through his experience with Soriano and Quincy Jones. It was the simplest of solutions achieved in, apparently, the most effortless way and was a remarkable achievement for such a young man.\u201d\n\nDavid Hay summarized the original and continuing importance of the house, stating \u201cBack then, Case Study House 21 was a brilliant response to the design spirit prevalent in Los Angeles \u2014 \u201cbe modern, be decisive.\u201d Now in its restored state, it is a powerful reminder of a time in southern California when architecture insisted on invention.\u201d\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments on the Westside]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Banham, Reyner, and Thomas Hine.

It was registered as [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]] #669, with the endorsement of then-owner Michael LaFetra, the [[Los Angeles Conservancy]], and [[Pierre Koenig|Pierre]] and Gloria Koenig.\n\n== The Case Study House Program ==\nIn January 1945 [[John Entenza]], the editor and publisher of [[Arts & Architecture]] magazine, announced the [[Case Study Houses|Case Study House Program]] (CSHP). The program was envisioned as a creative response to the impending building boom expected to follow the [[House|housing]] shortages of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]. Entenza encouraged participating [[architect]]s to use donated materials from [[industry]] and [[manufacturer]]s to create low-cost, modern housing [[prototype]]s that might foster a dialogue between architectural professionals and laymen.\n\nThe highly publicized program ran from 1945 to 1964, spanning thirty-six individual designs, many of which were never constructed. The initial program announcement stated that \u201ceach house must be capable of [[wikt:duplication|duplication]] and in no sense be an individual performance\u201d and that \u201cthe overall program will be general enough to be of practical assistance to the average American in search of a home in which he can afford to live.\u201d\n\nAfter returning from four years of fighting in WWII, Pierre Koenig was introduced to the CSHP through the ongoing publication of the [[avant-garde]] designs in Arts & Architecture magazine. By 1948 Koenig's interest in modern [[architecture]] led him to transfer from [[Pasadena City College]] to the School of Architecture at the [[University of Southern California]] where he studied under [[Richard Neutra]] and [[Gregory Ain]]. In 1950, while enrolled at USC, Koenig designed and built his first [[Steel-framed building|steel-framed house]] for himself and his family.\n\nKoenig's first involvement with the Case Study House Program occurred while working in the office of [[Raphael Soriano]] on the Case Study House 1950 project. In 1956 he worked briefly with [[Archibald Quincy Jones]] on a steel house in [[San Mateo, California]] for the prominent [[property developer]] [[Joseph Eichler]]. Eichler and John Entenza were well acquainted and both were developing a keen interest in the potential of lightweight [[steel construction]] for residential architecture.\n\nKoenig's hands-on experience with steel construction and his mastery of the new [[arc welding]] process on the San Mateo house would prove influential for the rest of his architectural career. Entenza saw great potential in Koenig's design work of the time and offered him a tentative invitation to participate in the CSHP when he \u201cfound the right house and the right client.\u201d This period marked the beginning of what [[historian]] [[Esther McCoy]] would later identify as the second phase of the Case Study House Program, represented by \u201ca concerted effort\u2026 to bring architecture into relationship with the machine.\u201d\n\n== The Bailey Commission ==\nIn early 1957 [[psychologist]] Walter Bailey and his wife Mary commissioned Pierre Koenig to design a 1,200-1,300 square foot house upon a level site nestled within a [[Hollywood Hills]] [[canyon]]. The Baileys were later described in Arts & Architecture magazine as a \u201ccontemporary-minded\u201d couple with no children and an informal lifestyle. This represented the ideal program for Koenig to realize steel framings potential to achieve a truly [[open plan]] design that capitalized upon the vast spans that steel facilitated.\n\nBy May 1958 Koenig had completed his [[construction drawing]]s and begun collaboration with [[Factory|factories]] that were capable of producing the prefabricated steel [[Bent (structural)|bents]]. The bulk of [[construction]] took place from August to November of the same year, and by January 1959 the house was officially completed.\n\n== Publication ==\nIn February 1959 Case Study House #21 was published in Arts & Architecture and was lauded as \u201csome of the cleanest and most immaculate thinking in the development of the small contemporary house.\u201d As was standard for all CSHP participants, the house was opened to the public for several weeks of viewing.\n\nA year later in 1960, a [[photographer]] named [[Julius Shulman]] (himself a Case Study client) was invited to photograph the Bailey House. The photographs he took would later become iconic symbols of California Modernism. As one article for [[L\u2019Uomo Vogue]] described, Shulman's architectural photographs of Case Study House #21 and [[Stahl House|#22]] have \u201can enduring resonance and iconic power. Taken on the eve of America\u2019s involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] they record the last glorious moments of American post-war [[hegemony]] and self-confidence and its unquestioned belief in the benefits of progress and technology.\u201d\n\nNearly thirty years later in 1989 Shulman's photographs of the Case Study Houses were exhibited at the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]] in an exhibit titled \u201cBlueprints for Modern Living\u201d which would ignite a \u201cgroundswell of interest in [[Modernism]]\u201d and renewed appreciation for Koenig's contribution to the California Modern movement, which had been largely forgotten during the 1970s and \u201880s.\n\n==Significant alterations==\nAbout 1969 Dr. and Mrs. Bailey relocated to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] for professional reasons and put Case Study House #21 up for sale. Sadly, over the next thirty years a succession of owners exhibited \u201cweaker commitments to maintenance and preservation\u201d than the Baileys had demonstrated. Numerous ad-hoc [[renovation]]s wreaked havoc upon the original design. Among these were the installation of several [[skylight (window)|skylight]]s and a [[fireplace]].\n\nIn the 1980s Koenig's original [[kitchen]] was demolished and was replaced with a center-island [[cooking]] station. The slab-like white-[[Vinyl composition tile|vinyl]]-tiled floors that Koenig originally specified were replaced with wide-grout [[ceramic tile]]s. Years later Koenig would describe his impressions of the altered house by stating: \u201ceven though I knew what had been going on in this house it was a great shock to see it. My houses are like children to me.\u201d\n\nIn 1997 an admirer of Julius Shulman's photography, [[film producer]] Dan Cracchiolo expressed interest in the Bailey House after seeing some of Shulman's photographs. He made an offer on the property of $1.5 million. The offer was accepted and Cracchiolo immediately commissioned Pierre Koenig to assist with \u2018resuscitating\u2019 the original design.\n\nThe meticulous [[Building restoration|restoration]] that followed would last for over a year, nearly twice the duration of the original construction. In recalling the process Koenig later described the difficulty of \u201cfinding the parts.\u201d The mosaic tile that covered the walls of the interior [[courtyard]] proved particularly challenging. Restoring the essence of the original kitchen with state-of-the-art appliances also proved difficult. The wall-hung [[refrigerator]] of the original design was no longer in production by [[General Electric]] so Koenig modified three under-counter [[Sub-Zero Refrigerator]]s by inverting the motor locations to conform to the plan. Koenig also retrofitted the house with state-of-the-art mechanical and lighting elements including an updated [[water heater]] and [[furnace]] housed in the utility core. When the process was nearly complete Koenig reflected on the restoration acknowledging \u201ca weird sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in working on the same building forty years after I built it the first time\u201d but confessing \u201ca wonderful feeling about getting it right, again.\u201d\n\nCracchiolo was not content with a purely architectural restoration and pursued reinstatement of the original [[furnishing]]s as well. To replace the long-discontinued [[Formica]] entry cabinet shown in the famous Julius Schulman photograph, Cracchiolo commissioned Jerry McCabe, the original manufacturer, to repeat the design. Likewise, a black [[Naugahyde]] sofa was commissioned to the exact specifications of the original.\n\nIn a July 1999 [[Architectural Digest]] article describing the restoration process Cracchiolo acknowledged feeling \u201can edgy ambivalence between wanting, on the one hand, to restore Case Study #21 to its original condition of fifties \u2018purity\u2019 and, on the other to allow more expression of his own nineties needs and tastes.\u201d One example he describes is his desire to display books rather than leaving the walls as pure and bare as the original Shulman photographs depict. In 2001 Pierre Koenig received the City of Los Angeles historic Preservation 2000 Award of excellence for his beautiful restoration of the Bailey House.\n\nShortly after publication of the Architectural Digest article a film producer named Michael LaFetra who had been looking for modern architecture properties came across the article and resolved to purchase the property. It came on the market shortly after and LaFetra\u2019s offer was accepted. Within a week of the purchase LaFetra received a phone message from Pierre Koenig stating: \u201cHello, this is Pierre, your architect, and I want to talk.\u201d Soon after LaFetra was told by Koenig that \u201che ought not to have to change anything in the house but, if he needed to, he should get in touch with him.\u201d\n\nSoon after a friendship began and by 2000 LaFetra had commissioned Koenig to design a new home for him on a [[beachfront]] lot in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. After ensuring protection for Case Study House #21 by registering it as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, the house was put on the market in 2002 to pay for the new construction. With Koenig's permission LaFetra began work on a [[documentary]] to cover the design and construction process, but sadly in 2004 Koenig succumbed to [[leukemia]] and died April 4 of that year.\n\n== Current condition ==\nIn July 2006 Julius Shulman (at age 95) was invited to revisit Case Study House #21 to photograph it in its modern condition for the catalog of an upcoming [[auction]] at Wright 20. On December 3, 2006 the property sold for $3,185,600 to a female art collector from [[South Korea]]. This sale represented the second highest price of a Modern house at auction, just behind [[Mies van der Rohe]]\u2019s [[Farnsworth House (Plano, Illinois)|Farnsworth House]], which sold for $8 million. Reports of the sale describe it as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in the public acceptance of Modernism as art, rather than [[real estate]].\n\nShulman's latest photographs offer a unique glimpse into the precision of Koenig's restoration. Although Koenig's completed house is nearly exact to the original design, subtle changes are present. Among these are a slightly altered [[tile|tiling]] layout for the inner courtyard wall and a more elaborate [[fountain]] mechanism below. The can-like lights that are present throughout the space appear to have a darkened [[patina]] applied as compared to the original [[lacquer]]ed fixtures. Additionally, Cracchiolo apparently requested the introduction of semi-translucent glass on the [[bathroom]] walls for increased privacy.\n\n== Description ==\nIn describing his concept for Case Study House #21, Koenig stated \"I was trying to develop\" {{convert|1,300|sqft|m2}} \"in an efficient, social, and exciting plan that people could afford\u2026 I had thrown out all conventional thought because I had no patience with anything that had been done before.\" The Case Study program called for the design of mass-producible prototypes and Koenig appears to have accomplished this while adequately addressing site-specific factors.\n\nCSH #21 is arranged along a north\u2013south axis with a carport on the North side and a fully glazed South side to take advantage of the best view and maximum sunlight for winter months. Koenig opted for a compressed \u2018L\u2019 shaped plan to establish a linear progression from the [[carport]] and entry through the living space and out to the garden. This compression is achieved by opaque, steel decking walls blocking the unattractive views towards the \u201cscrubby hillside\u201d on the West and Wonderland Park Avenue on the East.\n\nThe main house is a 30\u2019 x 44\u2019 rectangular plan with a solid rectangular core housing the utilities \u2013 two full bathrooms and a mechanical room. Beyond this core lay two efficiently arranged bedrooms. The threshold through this interior courtyard/core provides increased privacy (visually and acoustically) for the bedrooms. By designing a central service core Koenig simplified the language of the perimeter condition to either standard sized [[Sliding door|sliding glass doors]] or opaque steel walls. The simplicity of the material vocabulary is what John Entenza found most appealing. When first visiting the house he described it as \u201ca very pristine, clean design. Two details, one north\u2013south, one east\u2013west. One material for the roof, same one for the walls. Minimal house, maximum space.\u201d\n\nThe steel framing system of the house is composed of four prefabricated steel bents 44\u2019 wide x 9\u2019 high, forming the interior of the house. In addition, three half-span bents are used to frame the covered carport. Koenig specified identical structure to the houses he worked on with Soriano and Jones \u2013 8\u201d I-section beams and 4\u201d H-section columns. Rather than use a standardized 8\u2019 dimension, Koenig opted for a 10\u2019 spacing between bents for economy and to streamline the overall structure. Koenig frequently stated, \u201cSteel is only as good as its detailing. In order to make exposed steel acceptable in the living room it must be so well detailed that the joining connections are imperceptible.\u201d\n\nIndicative of the changing context, the property is now surrounded by tall [[tree]]s and [[shrubbery]], replacing what was once a grand view to the south. This is clearly an adaptation to achieve greater privacy within the now densely populated Hollywood Hills canyon. As an article in [[House Beautiful]] magazine described, today \u201cthe building\u2019s defiant simplicity stands in stark contrast to the fussy over-scaled residences that sit high on the hills behind it.\u201d\n\n== Evaluation ==\n\n=== Technical ===\nThe rigidity of the steel framing provided sufficient lateral stability in the east\u2013west direction, and the welding of channels to the top and base of each columns provided additional strength in the north\u2013south direction for resistance to seismic forces and wind loads. These expressed elements unify the building aesthetically and structurally.\n\nKoenig made use of the sandwiched steel decking walls to conceal [[Building insulation|insulation]], [[wiring]] and pipes. By piercing the roof over the bathroom and utility areas, even the core of the house has access to exterior elements such as daylight, rain, and plantings. This feature also provides an acoustical buffer between living and sleeping areas and underscores the airy, natural feel of the house.\n\nThe furnace in utility core supplies heat to the main space through [[heating duct]]s, which are arranged along the base of the glass walls for maximum efficiency. During the winter the lack of overhangs provides maximum passive heat gain, and use of the original Koolshade panels was meant to minimize excessive heat gain in the summer.\n\nThe circulation of pond water up to the gutters and back down through the roof scuppers represents an early experiment with environmental control systems. As [[James Steele (journalist)|James Steele]] described in his [[monograph]] of Pierre Koenig, \u201cthe strategy is both pragmatic and lyrical; the water has some cooling properties and the hard building edge at the ground level is softened by the reflective surface.\u201d Additionally, this circulation eliminates the need for chemical treatment of the water.\n\n=== Social ===\nAlthough architects of the second phase of the Case Study House Program never gave up their belief in the potential of steel framing for residential construction, the public never embraced the material. As [[Elizabeth A. T. Smith]] explained: \u201cUnfortunately, the economic pressures of the era were pushing residential construction another way, to accommodate the merchant builders working to deskill building tradesman and architects, and to glorify the add-ons and fix-ups of Mr. Homeowner and Mrs. Consumer, the stock characters of American advertising lobbying of the 1920s and 30s.\u201d Although they imagined factory-based industrial materials could be more economical then traditional wood framing, this was never realized. As such steel-framing faced social and economical obstacles. In the end, the [[Levittown]] paradigm would dominate America's [[mass housing]] strategy in the post-war era.\n\n=== Cultural and aesthetic ===\nBy painting the walls and ceiling white and maintaining the factory-applied charcoal Perma-Bar sealer coating on the steel, Koenig created visual emphasis on the structural skeleton. By expressing the volume as a simple box without overhangs Koenig underscored the simplicity of the rectangular forms and achieved an understated elegance.\n\nThe fully glazed North and South walls blur the interior and exterior \u2013 a common goal of the Case Study Houses. Describing the aesthetic goals of the movement Koenig would later explain: \u201cWe moved garages to the front and living rooms to the back to put them closer to the yard\u2026 We used steel, which in addition to being economical gave us a different living environment. It opened up the plan, letting us use more glass to create more light, which helped heighten the relationship of the interior to the exterior.\u201d\n\nKoenig's inclusion of the ponds around the perimeter of the house allows the structure to read as if it is floating. As [[Elizabeth A.T. Smith]] described in ''Blueprints for Modern Living'', \u201creflections of trees and sky intermingled on the water\u2019s surface with the pure lines of the house\u2019s contour\u2026humanized through the merging of the technological with the natural.\u201d\n\n=== Historical ===\nAlthough CSH #22 is more recognizable, CSH#21 is arguably the finest example of Pierre Koenig's steel-framed houses. It is widely considered to represent the highest point of the Case Study House Program's success. As [[Neil Jackson]] stated in his monograph of Koenig, \u201cThe Bailey House represents the ultimate refinement of an ideal developed by Koenig in his early houses and built upon through his experience with Soriano and Quincy Jones. It was the simplest of solutions achieved in, apparently, the most effortless way and was a remarkable achievement for such a young man.\u201d\n\nDavid Hay summarized the original and continuing importance of the house, stating \u201cBack then, Case Study House 21 was a brilliant response to the design spirit prevalent in Los Angeles \u2014 \u201cbe modern, be decisive.\u201d Now in its restored state, it is a powerful reminder of a time in southern California when architecture insisted on invention.\u201d\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments on the Westside]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Banham, Reyner, and Thomas Hine.

Even milk was considered an indulgence. At Bangor only one meal was allowed, and that not until evening. Confession was in public before the community. Severe acts of penance were frequent. Silence was observed at meals and at other times also, conversation being restricted to the minimum. Fasting was frequent and prolonged.<ref name=parish/>\n\nAccording to Adamnan's ''Life of Columba'', there was a close connection between Comgall and [[Columba]], though there does not appear to be sufficient authority for stating that Comgall was the disciple of Columba in any strict sense.

These flourished in the Irish Church during the sixth century. They were for the most part educated in Britain, or received their training from those who had grown up under the influence of the British Schools. They were the founders of the great Irish monastic schools, and contributed much to the spread of monasticism in the [[Celtic Christianity|Irish Church]]. The [[Antiphonary of Bangor]] of the seventh century claimed that Comgall was 'strict, holy and constant';<ref name=dictionary /> and there has come down to us a Rule of Saint Comgall in Irish, but the evidence would not warrant us in saying that as it stands at present it could be attributed to him. The fact, however, that Columbanus, a disciple of Comgall and himself a monk of Bangor, drew up for his Continental monasteries a ''Regula Monachorum'' would lead us to believe that there had been a similar organisation in Bangor in his time. This, however, is not conclusive, since Columbanus might have derived inspiration from the Benedictine Rule then widely spread over the [[Iberian Peninsula]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSt. Comgall is mentioned in the \"Life of Columbanus\" by Jonas, as the superior of Bangor, under whom St. Columbanus had studied.

According to the Irish annals, Bangor was founded no later than 552, though [[James Ussher]] and most of the later writers on the subject assign the foundation to the year 555.<ref name=\"maccaffrey\"/> Webb places it at 559.<ref name=Webb>[http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/SaintComgall.php Webb, Alfred. \"Saint Comgall\", ''A compendium of Irish Biography'', 1878]</ref> He is said to have governed in Bangor and other houses over four thousand monks; all which religious men were employed in tillage or other manual labour.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/210/5/104.html Butler, Rev. Alban, \"St. Comgall, Abbot in Ireland\", ''Lives of the Saints'', Vol.V, 1866]</ref> Life in the monasteries was very severe. Food was scant and plain. Herbs, water, and bread was customary. Even milk was considered an indulgence. At Bangor only one meal was allowed, and that not until evening. Confession was in public before the community. Severe acts of penance were frequent. Silence was observed at meals and at other times also, conversation being restricted to the minimum. Fasting was frequent and prolonged.<ref name=parish/>\n\nAccording to Adamnan's ''Life of Columba'', there was a close connection between Comgall and [[Columba]], though there does not appear to be sufficient authority for stating that Comgall was the disciple of Columba in any strict sense. Comgall was a friend to [[Brendan]], Saint Cormac, [[Cainnech of Aghaboe]], and Finnian of Movilla.<ref name=\"maccaffrey\"/> It is believed that among the monks trained by Comgall at Bangor, were [[Columbanus]] of [[Luxeuil-les-Bains]] ( 21 or 23 November) and [[Saint Moluag]] (25 June).<ref name=oca>[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/05/10/103921-venerable-comgall-of-bangor \"Venerable Comgall of Bangor\", Orthodox Church in America]</ref>\n\nAfter a period of intense suffering, Comgall received the Eucharist from [[Saint Fiacre]] and died in the monastery at Bangor. The year of his death was either 602, according to ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' and ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'', or 597, according to ''[[Annals of Inisfallen]]''.<ref name=\"maccaffrey\"/> His relics, which were kept at Bangor, were scattered during [[Vikings|Viking]] raids in 822.<ref name=dictionary>{{cite book|last=Farmer |first=David Hugh |title=The Oxford dictionary of saints |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-280058-2 |pages=112\u2013113 |edition=4}}</ref>\n\n==Role==\nComgall belonged to what is known as the Second Order of Irish Saints. These flourished in the Irish Church during the sixth century. They were for the most part educated in Britain, or received their training from those who had grown up under the influence of the British Schools. They were the founders of the great Irish monastic schools, and contributed much to the spread of monasticism in the [[Celtic Christianity|Irish Church]]. The [[Antiphonary of Bangor]] of the seventh century claimed that Comgall was 'strict, holy and constant';<ref name=dictionary /> and there has come down to us a Rule of Saint Comgall in Irish, but the evidence would not warrant us in saying that as it stands at present it could be attributed to him. The fact, however, that Columbanus, a disciple of Comgall and himself a monk of Bangor, drew up for his Continental monasteries a ''Regula Monachorum'' would lead us to believe that there had been a similar organisation in Bangor in his time. This, however, is not conclusive, since Columbanus might have derived inspiration from the Benedictine Rule then widely spread over the [[Iberian Peninsula]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSt. Comgall is mentioned in the \"Life of Columbanus\" by Jonas, as the superior of Bangor, under whom St. Columbanus had studied. He is also mentioned under 10 May, his feast-day in the \"Felire\" of [[\u00d3engus of Tallaght]] published by [[Whitley Stokes]] for the [[Henry Bradshaw Society]] (2nd ed.), and his name is commemorated in the [[Stowe Missal]] (MacCarthy), and in the ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portalbar|Saints}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Comgall}}\n[[Category:602 deaths]]\n[[Category:Medieval Irish poets]]\n[[Category:Medieval Irish saints]]\n[[Category:6th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:People from County Antrim]]\n[[Category:People from County Down]]\n[[Category:7th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:Irish male poets]]\n", "name_user": "Trappist the monk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:cite repair;", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comgall"}

Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He is a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]], one of the ''Istari'' order, and the leader of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', he is initially known as '''Gandalf the Grey''', but returns from death as '''Gandalf the White'''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nTolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the \"[[Norse dwarves#Dvergatal: the list of the Dvergar|Catalogue of Dwarves]]\" in the [[Old Norse]] ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''. \n\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an [[angel]] incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] who assisted [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[The Aeneid]]'', or to Virgil himself in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; and as a [[Christ]]-figure, a [[prophet]].\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Emblema Gandalf.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Cirth|Certh]] [[rune]] no. 19 \"G\", used by Gandalf as a personal [[sign]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]]]]\n\n===Etymology===\n\nTolkien derived the name ''Gandalf'' from ''[[Gandalf (mythology)|Gand\u00e1lfr]]'', a [[Norse dwarf|dwarf]] in the [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'s ''Dvergatal'', a list of dwarf-names.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D.

For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf ''the Grey'', and Grey[[wikt:hame|hame]]. ''Mithrandir'' is a name in [[Sindarin]] meaning \"the Grey Pilgrim\" or \"the Grey Wanderer\". Midway through ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed [[#Gandalf the White|Gandalf the White]]. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as ''Mithrandir''. At times in ''The Lord of the Rings'', other characters address Gandalf by disparaging nicknames:Stormcrow, ''L\u00e1thspell'' (\"Ill-news\" in [[Old English]]), and \"Grey Fool\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in [[Middle-earth]], one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a [[Magic (Middle-earth)#Magic items|staff]]\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> Yet the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[C\u00edrdan]] who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven [[Three Rings|Ring of Power]] called [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] later in the same essay:<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n{{blockquote|Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of [[Sauron]], opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of the North Gandalf 'the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>}}\n\n==Internal biography==\n\n===Valinor===\n\nIn [[Valinor]], Gandalf was called ''Ol\u00f3rin''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala [[Manw\u00eb]]; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and [[Nienna]], the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards (Istari)]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed [[Sauron]], Ol\u00f3rin was proposed by Manw\u00eb. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 4, ch. 2, \"The Istari\"</ref>\n\nAs one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol\u00f3rin was in service to the Creator ([[Eru Il\u00favatar]]) and the Creator's '[[Secret Fire]]'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===Middle-earth===\n\nThe Istari arrived in [[Middle-earth]] separately, early in the [[Third Age]]; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but [[C\u00edrdan]] the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Saruman]], the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other [[ring-bearers]] at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C\u00edrdan, was the holder of the third of the [[Three Rings|Elven-rings]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate them\u2014an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The White Council====\n\nGandalf suspected early on that the [[Sauron#The Necromancer of Dol Guldur|Necromancer of Dol Guldur]] was not a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] but Sauron himself. He went to [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix B.</ref> to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force,<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> and the White Council was formed in response.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> [[Galadriel]] had hoped Gandalf would lead the Council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the [[One Ring]] would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river [[Anduin]] to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the [[Gladden Fields]] where [[Isildur]] had been killed.<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T/><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\n\"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' elaborates upon the story behind ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and [[Thorin Oakenshield]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-king in exile, in the inn of the ''Prancing Pony'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with [[Sauron]], and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If [[Rivendell]] were to be attacked, the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of [[Erebor]] from Smaug, and so the quest was born.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, 3, \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\"</ref>\n\n===''The Hobbit''===\n\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of ''The Hobbit''. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative. To the quest, Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 1, \"An Unexpected Party\"</ref> On this quest Gandalf finds his sword, ''[[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]]'', in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll's]] treasure hoard.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 2, \"Roast Mutton\"</ref> Elrond informs them this sword was made in [[Gondolin]], a city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 3, \"A Short Rest\"</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from the [[Misty Mountains]] pursued by goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|warg]]s, the party is carried to safety by the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 6, \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\"</ref> Gandalf then persuades [[Beorn]] to house and provision the company for the trip through [[Mirkwood]]. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 7, \"Queer Lodgings\"</ref>\n\nHe turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of [[Esgaroth]] and the [[Mirkwood Elves]] will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 17, \"The Clouds Burst\"</ref> After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the [[One Ring]] to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 19, \"The Last Stage\"</ref> Then the Council \"put forth its power\" and drives Sauron from [[Dol Guldur]]. Sauron, however, has anticipated this and withdraws as a feint, only to reappear in [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''The Fellowship of the Ring'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\n====Gandalf the Grey====\n\nAs explained in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gandalf spends the years between ''The Hobbit'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' traveling [[Middle-earth]] in search of information on [[Sauron]]'s resurgence and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s mysterious [[One Ring|ring]], spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from [[Gollum]]. During this period, he befriends [[Aragorn]] and first becomes suspicious of [[Saruman]]. He spends as much time as he can in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many [[fireworks]] for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears, Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for [[Rivendell]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He find some answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also wants to question Gollum, who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nReturning to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing [[One Ring|the Ring]] into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and urges him to take it to [[Rivendell]], for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of [[Sauron]] will be searching for him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters [[Radagast the Brown]], another wizard, who brings the news that the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] have ridden forth out of Mordor\u2014and a request from [[Saruman]] that Gandalf come to [[Isengard]]. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGwaihir sets Gandalf down in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], where Gandalf appeals to King [[Th\u00e9oden]] for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the evil influence of [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]], Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the ''mearas'', who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf then rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it until Frodo has already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with [[Aragorn]]. He faces the Nazg\u00fbl at [[Weathertop]] but escapes after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northward.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/> Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights later.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 11, \"A Knife in the Dark\"</ref> Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nIn Rivendell, Gandalf helps [[Elrond]] drive off the Nazg\u00fbl pursuing Frodo<!--eh?--> and plays a great part in the following [[Council of Elrond|council]] as the only person who knows the full history of the Ring.

When it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo\u2014now the Ring-bearer\u2014in his quest.

He is a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]], one of the ''Istari'' order, and the leader of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', he is initially known as '''Gandalf the Grey''', but returns from death as '''Gandalf the White'''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nTolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the \"[[Norse dwarves#Dvergatal: the list of the Dvergar|Catalogue of Dwarves]]\" in the [[Old Norse]] ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''. \n\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an [[angel]] incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] who assisted [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[The Aeneid]]'', or to Virgil himself in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; and as a [[Christ]]-figure, a [[prophet]].\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Emblema Gandalf.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Cirth|Certh]] [[rune]] no. 19 \"G\", used by Gandalf as a personal [[sign]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]]]]\n\n===Etymology===\n\nTolkien derived the name ''Gandalf'' from ''[[Gandalf (mythology)|Gand\u00e1lfr]]'', a [[Norse dwarf|dwarf]] in the [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'s ''Dvergatal'', a list of dwarf-names.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D.

For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf ''the Grey'', and Grey[[wikt:hame|hame]]. ''Mithrandir'' is a name in [[Sindarin]] meaning \"the Grey Pilgrim\" or \"the Grey Wanderer\". Midway through ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed [[#Gandalf the White|Gandalf the White]]. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as ''Mithrandir''. At times in ''The Lord of the Rings'', other characters address Gandalf by disparaging nicknames:Stormcrow, ''L\u00e1thspell'' (\"Ill-news\" in [[Old English]]), and \"Grey Fool\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in [[Middle-earth]], one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a [[Magic (Middle-earth)#Magic items|staff]]\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> Yet the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[C\u00edrdan]] who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven [[Three Rings|Ring of Power]] called [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] later in the same essay:<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n{{blockquote|Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of [[Sauron]], opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of the North Gandalf 'the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>}}\n\n==Internal biography==\n\n===Valinor===\n\nIn [[Valinor]], Gandalf was called ''Ol\u00f3rin''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala [[Manw\u00eb]]; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and [[Nienna]], the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards (Istari)]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed [[Sauron]], Ol\u00f3rin was proposed by Manw\u00eb. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 4, ch. 2, \"The Istari\"</ref>\n\nAs one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol\u00f3rin was in service to the Creator ([[Eru Il\u00favatar]]) and the Creator's '[[Secret Fire]]'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===Middle-earth===\n\nThe Istari arrived in [[Middle-earth]] separately, early in the [[Third Age]]; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but [[C\u00edrdan]] the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Saruman]], the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other [[ring-bearers]] at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C\u00edrdan, was the holder of the third of the [[Three Rings|Elven-rings]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate them\u2014an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The White Council====\n\nGandalf suspected early on that the [[Sauron#The Necromancer of Dol Guldur|Necromancer of Dol Guldur]] was not a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] but Sauron himself. He went to [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix B.</ref> to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force,<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> and the White Council was formed in response.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> [[Galadriel]] had hoped Gandalf would lead the Council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the [[One Ring]] would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river [[Anduin]] to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the [[Gladden Fields]] where [[Isildur]] had been killed.<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T/><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\n\"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' elaborates upon the story behind ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and [[Thorin Oakenshield]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-king in exile, in the inn of the ''Prancing Pony'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with [[Sauron]], and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If [[Rivendell]] were to be attacked, the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of [[Erebor]] from Smaug, and so the quest was born.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, 3, \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\"</ref>\n\n===''The Hobbit''===\n\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of ''The Hobbit''. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative. To the quest, Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 1, \"An Unexpected Party\"</ref> On this quest Gandalf finds his sword, ''[[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]]'', in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll's]] treasure hoard.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 2, \"Roast Mutton\"</ref> Elrond informs them this sword was made in [[Gondolin]], a city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 3, \"A Short Rest\"</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from the [[Misty Mountains]] pursued by goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|warg]]s, the party is carried to safety by the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 6, \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\"</ref> Gandalf then persuades [[Beorn]] to house and provision the company for the trip through [[Mirkwood]]. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 7, \"Queer Lodgings\"</ref>\n\nHe turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of [[Esgaroth]] and the [[Mirkwood Elves]] will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 17, \"The Clouds Burst\"</ref> After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the [[One Ring]] to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 19, \"The Last Stage\"</ref> Then the Council \"put forth its power\" and drives Sauron from [[Dol Guldur]]. Sauron, however, has anticipated this and withdraws as a feint, only to reappear in [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''The Fellowship of the Ring'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\n====Gandalf the Grey====\n\nAs explained in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gandalf spends the years between ''The Hobbit'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' traveling [[Middle-earth]] in search of information on [[Sauron]]'s resurgence and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s mysterious [[One Ring|ring]], spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from [[Gollum]]. During this period, he befriends [[Aragorn]] and first becomes suspicious of [[Saruman]]. He spends as much time as he can in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many [[fireworks]] for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears, Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for [[Rivendell]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He find some answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also wants to question Gollum, who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nReturning to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing [[One Ring|the Ring]] into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and urges him to take it to [[Rivendell]], for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of [[Sauron]] will be searching for him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters [[Radagast the Brown]], another wizard, who brings the news that the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] have ridden forth out of Mordor\u2014and a request from [[Saruman]] that Gandalf come to [[Isengard]]. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGwaihir sets Gandalf down in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], where Gandalf appeals to King [[Th\u00e9oden]] for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the evil influence of [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]], Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the ''mearas'', who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf then rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it until Frodo has already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with [[Aragorn]]. He faces the Nazg\u00fbl at [[Weathertop]] but escapes after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northward.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/> Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights later.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 11, \"A Knife in the Dark\"</ref> Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nIn Rivendell, Gandalf helps [[Elrond]] drive off the Nazg\u00fbl pursuing Frodo<!--eh?--> and plays a great part in the following [[Council of Elrond|council]] as the only person who knows the full history of the Ring. He also reveals that Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo\u2014now the Ring-bearer\u2014in his quest. He also persuades Elrond to let Frodo's cousins [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] join the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\n{{Quote box|\n |quote  = The Balrog reached the bridge.
