The difficulty of procuring [[palm branch (symbol)|palms]] in unfavorable climates led to their substitution with branches of native trees, including [[Buxus sempervirens|box]], [[olive]], [[willow]], and [[taxus|yew]]. The Sunday was often named after these substitute trees, as in '''Yew Sunday''', or by the general term '''Branch Sunday'''.\n\nMany churches of mainstream [[Christian denominations]], including the Lutheran, Catholic, Orthodox, Methodist, Anglican, Moravian and Reformed traditions, distribute palm branches to their congregations during their Palm Sunday liturgies.

It suggests that Jesus was declaring he was the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]], to the anger of the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin]].\n\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus Christ rode on a donkey into Jerusalem, and the celebrating people there laid down their cloaks and small branches of trees in front of him, singing part of [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Psalm#118:25|Psalm 118: 25\u201326]] \u2013  Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.

Jesus' entry to Jerusalem would have thus symbolized his entry as the [[Jesus|Prince of Peace]], not as a war-waging king.<ref name=Allison120 /><ref name=MacArthur17 /> Thus there have been two different meanings (or more levels of [[biblical hermeneutics]]): an historical meaning, truly happening according to the Gospels, and a secondary meaning in the symbolism.\n\n[[File:Enrique Simonet - Flevit super illam 1892.jpg|thumb|right|350px|\"Flevit super illam\" (He wept over it); by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1892]]\nIn [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#19:41|Luke 19:41]] as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it (an event known as ''[[Jesus wept|Flevit super illam]]'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]), foretelling his coming Passion and the suffering that awaits the city in the events of the destruction of the [[Second Temple]].\n\nIn many lands in the ancient [[Near East]], it was customary to cover in some way the path of someone thought worthy of the highest honour. The [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{bibleverse||2 Kings|9:13|KJV}}) reports that [[Jehu]], son of [[Jehoshaphat]], was treated this way. Both the [[Synoptic Gospels]] and the [[Gospel of John]] report that people gave Jesus this form of honour. In the synoptics the people are described as laying their garments and cut [[Juncus|rushes]] on the street, whereas John specifies fronds of palm (Greek ''phoinix)''. In Jewish tradition, the palm is one of the [[Four Species]] carried for [[Sukkot]], as prescribed for rejoicing at {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:40}}.\n\nIn the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman culture]] of the [[Roman Empire]], which strongly influenced Christian tradition, the [[palm branch (symbol)|palm branch was a symbol]] of triumph and victory.

The day before Palm Sunday, [[Lazarus Saturday]], believers often prepare palm fronds by knotting them into crosses in preparation for the procession on Sunday. The [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] in the church are changed to a festive color \u2013 most commonly green.\n\nThe [[Troparion]] of the Feast (a short hymn) indicates that the resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] is a prefiguration of Jesus's own Resurrection:\n\n{{quote|<poem>O Christ our God\nWhen Thou didst raise Lazarus from the dead before Thy Passion,\nThou didst confirm the resurrection of the universe.\nWherefore, we like children,\ncarry the banner of triumph and victory,\nand we cry to Thee, O Conqueror of love,\nHosanna in the highest!\nBlessed is He that cometh\nin the Name of the Lord.</poem>}}\n\nIn the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]], [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[Bavaria]]n and [[Austria]]n [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and various other [[Eastern Europe]]an peoples, the custom developed of using [[pussy willow]] instead of palm fronds because the latter are not readily available that far north.  There is no canonical requirement as to what kind of branches must be used, so some Orthodox believers use [[olive]] branches. Whatever the kind, these branches are [[blessing|blessed]] and distributed together with candles either during the [[All-Night Vigil]] on the Eve of the Feast (Saturday night), or before the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sunday morning. The [[Great Entrance]] of the Divine Liturgy commemorates the \"Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem\", so the meaningfulness of this moment is punctuated on Palm Sunday as everyone stands, holding their branches and lit candles. The faithful take these branches and candles home with them after the liturgy, and keep them in their [[icon corner]] as an ''evloghia'' (blessing).\n\nIn Russia, [[donkey walk]] processions took place in different cities, but most importantly in [[Novgorod]] and, from 1558 until 1693, in Moscow. These were prominently featured in testimonies by foreign witnesses and mentioned in contemporary Western maps of the city. The [[Patriarch of Moscow]], representing Christ, rode on a \"donkey\" (actually a horse draped in white cloth); the [[Tsar of Russia]] humbly led the procession on foot. Originally, Moscow processions began inside the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and terminated at Trinity Church, now known as [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], but in 1658 [[Patriarch Nikon]] reversed the order of procession. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] in the 1720s, as a part of his [[Church reform of Peter I|nationalisation of the church]], terminated the custom; it has been occasionally recreated in the 21st century.\n\nIn [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, palm fronds are distributed at the front of the church at the sanctuary steps. In India the sanctuary itself is strewn with marigolds, and the congregation proceeds through and outside the church.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Palm Sunday in Eastern and Oriental Christianity\">\nFile:Wjatscheslaw Grigorjewitsch Schwarz 002.jpg|Palm Sunday procession, Moscow, with Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexei Michaelovich]] (painting by [[Vyacheslav Schwarz]], 1865)\nFile:Engraving of Red Square & Kremlin (Moscow, 1654).jpg|Palm Sunday in Moscow, 1654.<br />Caption on the illustration: ''Abrie\u00df der Muscowitischen Prozession am Palmsontag''\nFile:Palm sunday.JPG|[[Oriental Orthodox|Orthodox]] congregation in India collects palm fronds for [[procession]]: men on left of sanctuary in the photo; women collecting fronds on right of sanctuary, outside photo.\nFile:\u0426\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438, \u0443\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u0408\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c (Church fresco - Triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Bitola).jpg|[[Eastern Orthodox]] fresco in Nativity of the Theotokos Church, [[Bitola]], [[Republic of North Macedonia]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Western Christianity===\n[[File:Palmsonntag in Osttimor 2019.jpg|thumb|Palm Sunday in [[East Timor]]]]\n\nIn ancient times, palm branches symbolized goodness and victory. They were often depicted on coins and important buildings. Solomon had palm branches carved into the walls and doors of the temple ({{bibleverse||1 Kings|6:29|KJV}}). Again at the end of the Bible, people from every nation raise palm branches to honor Jesus ({{bibleverse||Revelation|7:9|KJV}}).\n\nPalm Sunday commemorates the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Matthew|21:1-9|KJV}}), when palm branches were placed in his path, before his arrest on Holy Thursday and his crucifixion on Good Friday. It thus marks the beginning of [[Holy Week]], the final week of Lent.\n\nIn churches of many [[Christian denomination]]s, members of the congregation, oftentimes children, are given palms that they carry as they walk in a procession around the inside of the church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/palm-sunday-marks-start-of-holy-week.html|title=Palm Sunday Marks Start of Holy Week|website=www.christianpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womansday.com/life/a26557005/when-is-palm-sunday/|title=When Is Palm Sunday?

A solemn procession also takes place, and often includes the entire congregation.\n\nIn the Catholic Church and the Episcopal Church, this feast now coincides with that of [[Passion Sunday]], which is the focus of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] which follows the palms ceremony. The palms are saved in many churches to be burned on [[Shrove Tuesday]] the following year to make ashes used in [[Ash Wednesday]] liturgies. The Catholic Church considers the blessed palms to be [[sacramentals]].

The Church teaches that this is a sign of welcoming Christ into the home, but folk belief holds that the blessed ''palasp\u00e1s'' are [[apotropaic]], deterring evil spirits, lightning, and fires. Another folk custom is to feed pieces of blessed ''palasp\u00e1s'' to [[rooster]]s used in [[Cockfight#Philippines|''sabong'']] (cockfighting); this was strongly discouraged by the [[Archbishop of Manila]], Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In other provinces, the flowers strewn by the angels during the procession are added to the rice seeds being planted, in the belief that these will ensure a bountiful harvest.\n\n===Poland===\n[[File:87365 Palm Sunday.jpg|thumb|A palm in [[\u0141yse, Masovian Voivodeship|\u0141yse]], [[Poland]]]]\nMany [[Poland|Polish]] towns and villages (the best known are [[Lipnica Murowana]] in [[Lesser Poland]] and [[\u0141yse, Masovian Voivodeship|\u0141yse]]) organize artificial palm competitions.

It suggests that Jesus was declaring he was the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]], to the anger of the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin]].\n\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus Christ rode on a donkey into Jerusalem, and the celebrating people there laid down their cloaks and small branches of trees in front of him, singing part of [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Psalm#118:25|Psalm 118: 25\u201326]] \u2013  Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.

The [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{bibleverse||2 Kings|9:13|KJV}}) reports that [[Jehu]], son of [[Jehoshaphat]], was treated this way. Both the [[Synoptic Gospels]] and the [[Gospel of John]] report that people gave Jesus this form of honour. In the synoptics the people are described as laying their garments and cut [[Juncus|rushes]] on the street, whereas John specifies fronds of palm (Greek ''phoinix)''.

The day before Palm Sunday, [[Lazarus Saturday]], believers often prepare palm fronds by knotting them into crosses in preparation for the procession on Sunday. The [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] in the church are changed to a festive color \u2013 most commonly green.\n\nThe [[Troparion]] of the Feast (a short hymn) indicates that the resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] is a prefiguration of Jesus's own Resurrection:\n\n{{quote|<poem>O Christ our God\nWhen Thou didst raise Lazarus from the dead before Thy Passion,\nThou didst confirm the resurrection of the universe.\nWherefore, we like children,\ncarry the banner of triumph and victory,\nand we cry to Thee, O Conqueror of love,\nHosanna in the highest!\nBlessed is He that cometh\nin the Name of the Lord.</poem>}}\n\nIn the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]], [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[Bavaria]]n and [[Austria]]n [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and various other [[Eastern Europe]]an peoples, the custom developed of using [[pussy willow]] instead of palm fronds because the latter are not readily available that far north.  There is no canonical requirement as to what kind of branches must be used, so some Orthodox believers use [[olive]] branches. Whatever the kind, these branches are [[blessing|blessed]] and distributed together with candles either during the [[All-Night Vigil]] on the Eve of the Feast (Saturday night), or before the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sunday morning. The [[Great Entrance]] of the Divine Liturgy commemorates the \"Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem\", so the meaningfulness of this moment is punctuated on Palm Sunday as everyone stands, holding their branches and lit candles. The faithful take these branches and candles home with them after the liturgy, and keep them in their [[icon corner]] as an ''evloghia'' (blessing).\n\nIn Russia, [[donkey walk]] processions took place in different cities, but most importantly in [[Novgorod]] and, from 1558 until 1693, in Moscow. These were prominently featured in testimonies by foreign witnesses and mentioned in contemporary Western maps of the city. The [[Patriarch of Moscow]], representing Christ, rode on a \"donkey\" (actually a horse draped in white cloth); the [[Tsar of Russia]] humbly led the procession on foot. Originally, Moscow processions began inside the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and terminated at Trinity Church, now known as [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], but in 1658 [[Patriarch Nikon]] reversed the order of procession. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] in the 1720s, as a part of his [[Church reform of Peter I|nationalisation of the church]], terminated the custom; it has been occasionally recreated in the 21st century.\n\nIn [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, palm fronds are distributed at the front of the church at the sanctuary steps. In India the sanctuary itself is strewn with marigolds, and the congregation proceeds through and outside the church.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Palm Sunday in Eastern and Oriental Christianity\">\nFile:Wjatscheslaw Grigorjewitsch Schwarz 002.jpg|Palm Sunday procession, Moscow, with Tsar [[Alexis of Russia|Alexei Michaelovich]] (painting by [[Vyacheslav Schwarz]], 1865)\nFile:Engraving of Red Square & Kremlin (Moscow, 1654).jpg|Palm Sunday in Moscow, 1654.<br />Caption on the illustration: ''Abrie\u00df der Muscowitischen Prozession am Palmsontag''\nFile:Palm sunday.JPG|[[Oriental Orthodox|Orthodox]] congregation in India collects palm fronds for [[procession]]: men on left of sanctuary in the photo; women collecting fronds on right of sanctuary, outside photo.\nFile:\u0426\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438, \u0443\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u0408\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c (Church fresco - Triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Bitola).jpg|[[Eastern Orthodox]] fresco in Nativity of the Theotokos Church, [[Bitola]], [[Republic of North Macedonia]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Western Christianity===\n[[File:Palmsonntag in Osttimor 2019.jpg|thumb|Palm Sunday in [[East Timor]]]]\n\nIn ancient times, palm branches symbolized goodness and victory. They were often depicted on coins and important buildings. Solomon had palm branches carved into the walls and doors of the temple ({{bibleverse||1 Kings|6:29|KJV}}). Again at the end of the Bible, people from every nation raise palm branches to honor Jesus ({{bibleverse||Revelation|7:9|KJV}}).\n\nPalm Sunday commemorates the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Matthew|21:1-9|KJV}}), when palm branches were placed in his path, before his arrest on Holy Thursday and his crucifixion on Good Friday. It thus marks the beginning of [[Holy Week]], the final week of Lent.\n\nIn churches of many [[Christian denomination]]s, members of the congregation, oftentimes children, are given palms that they carry as they walk in a procession around the inside of the church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/palm-sunday-marks-start-of-holy-week.html|title=Palm Sunday Marks Start of Holy Week|website=www.christianpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womansday.com/life/a26557005/when-is-palm-sunday/|title=When Is Palm Sunday?

A solemn procession also takes place, and often includes the entire congregation.\n\nIn the Catholic Church and the Episcopal Church, this feast now coincides with that of [[Passion Sunday]], which is the focus of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] which follows the palms ceremony. The palms are saved in many churches to be burned on [[Shrove Tuesday]] the following year to make ashes used in [[Ash Wednesday]] liturgies. The Catholic Church considers the blessed palms to be [[sacramentals]]. The vestments for the day are deep scarlet red, the colour of blood, indicating the supreme redemptive sacrifice Christ was entering the city to fulfill: his Passion and Resurrection in Jerusalem.\n\n[[File:PalmSunday.jpg|thumb|right|Blessing of palms outside an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States]]]]\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\nIn the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] and many other Anglican churches and in Lutheran churches, as well, the day is nowadays officially called \"The Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday\"; in practice, though, it is usually termed \"Palm Sunday\" as in the 1928 American [[Book of Common Prayer]] and in earlier Lutheran liturgies and calendars, to avoid undue confusion with the penultimate Sunday of Lent in the traditional calendar, which was \"Passion Sunday\".\n\nIn traditional usage of the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist Church]], ''[[Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965)|The Book of Worship for Church and Home]]'' (1965) provides the following [[Collect]] for Palm Sunday:<ref name=\"BOW1964\">{{cite book|title=The Book of Worship for Church and Home: With Orders of Worship, Services for the Administration of the Sacraments and Other Aids to Worship According to the Usages of the Methodist Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ckw6vgAACAAJ|accessdate=25 March 2017|year=1964|publisher=Methodist Publishing House|language=English |page=101}}</ref>\n{{quotation|Almighty and everlasting God, who, of thy tender love toward mankind hast sent thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ to take upon him our flesh, and to suffer death upon the cross, that all mankind should follow the example of his great humility: Mercifully grant that we may both follow the example of his patience and also be made partakers of his resurrection; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.

Congregants line the route, waving ''palasp\u00e1s'' (ornately woven palm branches) and spreading ''tapis'' (heirloom \"aprons\" made for this ritual) in imitation of the excited Jerusalemites. At the church parvise, a house, or the town plaza, children dressed as angels scatter flowers as they sing the day's [[antiphon]] ''Hosanna Filio David'' in the vernacular and to traditional tunes. The first Mass of the day then follows.\n\nOnce blessed, the ''palasp\u00e1s'' are brought home and placed on altars, doorways, and windows. The Church teaches that this is a sign of welcoming Christ into the home, but folk belief holds that the blessed ''palasp\u00e1s'' are [[apotropaic]], deterring evil spirits, lightning, and fires. Another folk custom is to feed pieces of blessed ''palasp\u00e1s'' to [[rooster]]s used in [[Cockfight#Philippines|''sabong'']] (cockfighting); this was strongly discouraged by the [[Archbishop of Manila]], Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In other provinces, the flowers strewn by the angels during the procession are added to the rice seeds being planted, in the belief that these will ensure a bountiful harvest.\n\n===Poland===\n[[File:87365 Palm Sunday.jpg|thumb|A palm in [[\u0141yse, Masovian Voivodeship|\u0141yse]], [[Poland]]]]\nMany [[Poland|Polish]] towns and villages (the best known are [[Lipnica Murowana]] in [[Lesser Poland]] and [[\u0141yse, Masovian Voivodeship|\u0141yse]]) organize artificial palm competitions.

Today, the names Palm Sunday and Flowering Sunday are used interchangeably in those regions. In 1829 Thomas Wallace, of Llanbadoc, Monmouthshire, published a poem which contains the first known reference to the custom being practiced only on Palm Sunday.\n\nWelsh cemetery cleaning and decoration traditions may have begun as an Easter celebration before becoming more commonly associated with Palm Sunday. As early as 1786, cleaning and flower decorations were attested by William Matthews during a tour of South Wales.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Matthews |first1=William |title=The miscellaneous companions, Vol. I Being a short tour of observation and sentiment, through a part of South Wales |date=1786 |pages=50\u201351}}</ref> Richard Warner attested in 1797 \"the ornamenting of the graves of the deceased with various plants and flowers, at certain seasons, by the surviving relatives\" and noted that Easter was the most popular time for this tradition.
