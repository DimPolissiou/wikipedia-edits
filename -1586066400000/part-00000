In the operation, Japanese aircraft \u2013 primarily from [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] units under the command of Admirals [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] and [[Jinichi Kusaka]] \u2013 attacked Allied ships, aircraft, and land installations in the southeast Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The goal of the operation was to halt the Allied offensives in New Guinea and the Solomons and to give Japan time to prepare a new set of defenses in response to recent defeats to the Allies in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle of Guadalcanal]] and in New Guinea at [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona|Buna\u2013Gona]], [[Battle of Wau|Wau]], and the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea|Bismarck Sea]].\n\nThe operation consisted of several massed aerial attacks by Japanese bomber and fighter aircraft \u2013 based at [[Rabaul]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], and the [[Shortland Islands]] \u2013 against Allied targets on and around [[Guadalcanal]] and the [[Russell Islands]] in the Solomons and [[Port Moresby]], [[Oro Bay]], and [[Milne Bay]] in New Guinea. Although the Japanese sank several Allied transports and warships, the attack failed to inflict serious damage on Allied forces. Based on inaccurate and unintentionally exaggerated reports from the involved aircrews, Yamamoto halted the attacks on 16 April, believing the operation to be a success. The operation, however, did not significantly delay Allied preparations for further offensives in the South Pacific area. Yamamoto [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|was killed]] shortly thereafter while traveling to congratulate units that had participated in the operation.\n\n==Air attacks==\nOn 1 April 1943 a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] [[Combat air patrol|sweep]] of 58 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M3 Zero]]s of the 204th, 251st and 582st ''[[K\u014dk\u016btai]]'' was met by Allied fighters over the Russell Islands intercepting the Japanese ''en route'' to Tulagi and Guadalcanal, that claimed 18 Zeros at the cost of six Allied aircraft.\n\nThe next attack was launched on 7 April, a raid by 67 [[Aichi D3A]]2 \"Val\" [[dive bomber]]s escorted by 110 Zeros against Guadalcanal and was met by 76 Allied fighters. Twenty-one Japanese aircraft were lost; the Allies lost seven. The raid resulted in the sinking of the destroyer {{USS|Aaron Ward|DD-483|6}}, the corvette [[HMNZS Moa (T233)|HMNZS ''Moa'']], and the [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] {{USS|Kanawha|AO-1|6}}.\n\nOn 11 April, a force of 22 \"Vals\" and 72 Zeros attacked shipping at [[Oro Bay]], near Buna. 50 Allied fighters scrambled from [[Girua Airport|Dobodura]] and intercepted the force, shooting down six Japanese aircraft without loss.\n\nAn attack on Port Moresby by a force of 131 Zeros \u2013 of the 253rd ''K\u014dk\u016btai'' and air groups of the carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuih\u014d||2}} \u2013 and 43 [[Mitsubishi G4M]]2 \"Betty\" [[medium bomber]]s of the 751st and 705th ''K\u014dk\u016btai'' struck on 12 April. Opposed by 44 Allied fighters, the attack resulted in two Allied and five Japanese aircraft lost. The raid damaged a few small craft and damaged or destroyed additional Allied aircraft on Port Moresby airfields.\n\nOn 14 April 1943, the Japanese launched an attack against Milne Bay with 188 aircraft. Twenty-four [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk 1A]]s intercepted the attacking force, resulting in seven Japanese and three Allied aircraft shot down. The Dutch cargo ship ''Van Heemskerk'' was beached after being hit by several bombs, which set it ablaze. The British cargo ship ''Gorgon'' was also bombed and set on fire, before the blaze was extinguished. Near misses damaged the Dutch cargo ship ''Van Outhoorn'' and the Australian [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s [[HMAS Wagga|HMAS ''Wagga'']] and {{HMAS|Kapunda||2}}. Four Allied servicemen and 12 merchant seamen were killed in the air raid, with 68 injured.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n===Print===\n*{{cite book | last = Bergerud | first = Eric M. | authorlink = | year = 2000 | chapter = | title = Fire in the Sky: The Air War in the South Pacific | publisher = Westview Press | location = Boulder, CO, USA | isbn = 0-8133-3869-7}}\n*{{cite book | last = Brown | first = David | authorlink = | year = 1990 | title = Warship Losses of World War Two | publisher = Naval Institute Press | location = | isbn = 1-55750-914-X}}\n*{{cite book | last = Gamble | first = Bruce | authorlink = | year = 2010 | chapter = | title = Fortress Rabaul: The Battle for the Southwest Pacific, January 1942 \u2013 April 1943 | publisher = Zenith Press | location = Minneapolis, MN, USA | isbn = 978-0-7603-2350-2}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Hoyt\n | first = Edwin P.\n | authorlink = \n | year = 1990\n | title = Yamamoto:  The Man who Planned Pearl Harbor\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-07-030626-5\n}}\n*{{cite book | last = Morison | first = Samuel Eliot | authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison | year = 1958 | chapter = | title = Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', vol. 6 of ''[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]] | publisher = Castle Books | location = | isbn = 0-7858-1307-1}}\n*{{cite book | last = Odgers | first = George | year = 1968 | url = https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1070210/| title = Volume II \u2013 Air War Against Japan, 1943\u20131945 | series = [[Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945]] | location = Canberra | publisher = [[Australian War Memorial]]}}\n*{{cite book | last = Tagaya | first = Osamu | authorlink = | year = 2001 | chapter = | title = Mitsubishi Type 1 \"Rikko\" 'Betty' Units of World War 2 | publisher = Osprey | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-84176-082-7}}\n\n===Web===\n*{{cite web | last = Craven | first = Wesley Frank | authorlink = |author2=James Lea Cate | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/IV/index.html | title = Vol. IV, The Pacific: Guadalcanal to Saipan, August 1942 to July 1944 | work = The Army Air Forces in World War II | pages = | publisher = U.S. Office of Air Force History | accessdate = October 20, 2006 }}\n*{{cite web | last = Gillespie | first = Oliver A. | authorlink = | year = 1952 | url = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Paci-_N84545.html | title = ''The Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War, 1939\u20131945'';

In the operation, Japanese aircraft \u2013 primarily from [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] units under the command of Admirals [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] and [[Jinichi Kusaka]] \u2013 attacked Allied ships, aircraft, and land installations in the southeast Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The goal of the operation was to halt the Allied offensives in New Guinea and the Solomons and to give Japan time to prepare a new set of defenses in response to recent defeats to the Allies in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle of Guadalcanal]] and in New Guinea at [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona|Buna\u2013Gona]], [[Battle of Wau|Wau]], and the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea|Bismarck Sea]].\n\nThe operation consisted of several massed aerial attacks by Japanese bomber and fighter aircraft \u2013 based at [[Rabaul]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], and the [[Shortland Islands]] \u2013 against Allied targets on and around [[Guadalcanal]] and the [[Russell Islands]] in the Solomons and [[Port Moresby]], [[Oro Bay]], and [[Milne Bay]] in New Guinea. Although the Japanese sank several Allied transports and warships, the attack failed to inflict serious damage on Allied forces. Based on inaccurate and unintentionally exaggerated reports from the involved aircrews, Yamamoto halted the attacks on 16 April, believing the operation to be a success. The operation, however, did not significantly delay Allied preparations for further offensives in the South Pacific area. Yamamoto [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|was killed]] shortly thereafter while traveling to congratulate units that had participated in the operation.\n\n==Air attacks==\nOn 1 April 1943 a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] [[Combat air patrol|sweep]] of 58 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M3 Zero]]s of the 204th, 251st and 582st ''[[K\u014dk\u016btai]]'' was met by Allied fighters over the Russell Islands intercepting the Japanese ''en route'' to Tulagi and Guadalcanal, that claimed 18 Zeros at the cost of six Allied aircraft.\n\nThe next attack was launched on 7 April, a raid by 67 [[Aichi D3A]]2 \"Val\" [[dive bomber]]s escorted by 110 Zeros against Guadalcanal and was met by 76 Allied fighters. Twenty-one Japanese aircraft were lost; the Allies lost seven. The raid resulted in the sinking of the destroyer {{USS|Aaron Ward|DD-483|6}}, the corvette [[HMNZS Moa (T233)|HMNZS ''Moa'']], and the [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] {{USS|Kanawha|AO-1|6}}.\n\nOn 11 April, a force of 22 \"Vals\" and 72 Zeros attacked shipping at [[Oro Bay]], near Buna. 50 Allied fighters scrambled from [[Girua Airport|Dobodura]] and intercepted the force, shooting down six Japanese aircraft without loss.\n\nAn attack on Port Moresby by a force of 131 Zeros \u2013 of the 253rd ''K\u014dk\u016btai'' and air groups of the carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuih\u014d||2}} \u2013 and 43 [[Mitsubishi G4M]]2 \"Betty\" [[medium bomber]]s of the 751st and 705th ''K\u014dk\u016btai'' struck on 12 April.
