{"title_page": "Titles of Mary", "text_new": "[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], 19th century.]]\n[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), [[epithet]]s ([[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], [[Queen of Heaven]], Cause of Our Joy), invocations (''[[Theotokos]]'', ''[[Panagia]]'', Mother of Mercy) and other names ([[Our Lady of Loreto]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]).\n{{Mary}}\nAll of these titles refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]] (in the [[New Testament]]) and are used variably by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].  (Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as, [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=150| English !! width=100| Latin !! width=100| Greek !!

In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God.

(Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians.

Furthermore, she is interested by four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]], are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

A close friend and associate of [[Sheriff|lawman]] [[Wyatt Earp]], Holliday is best known for his role in the events leading up to and following the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]. He developed a reputation as having killed more than a dozen men in various altercations, but modern researchers have concluded that, contrary to popular myth-making, Holliday killed only one to three men. Holliday's colorful life and character have been depicted in many books and portrayed by well-known actors in numerous movies and television series.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|415}}\n\nAt age 21, Holliday earned a [[Dental degree|degree in dentistry]] from the [[Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery]]. He set up practice in Griffin, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15, having acquired it while tending to her needs while she was still in the contagious phase of the illness. Hoping the climate in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] would ease his symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona in that day.<ref>{{cite web| title=Gambling in the Old West| url=http://www.historynet.com/gambling-in-the-old-west.htm| website=History Net| publisher=Wild West Magazine| accessdate=April 13, 2015| date=June 12, 2006| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424035923/http://www.historynet.com/gambling-in-the-old-west.htm| archivedate=April 24, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations.

In Tombstone, local members of the outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys]] repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a [[Stagecoach|stage]]. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal [[Virgil Earp]]. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys near the O.K. Corral on the west side of town, which resulted in the 30-second shootout.\n\nFollowing the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants while [[Morgan Earp]] was murdered. Unable to obtain justice in the courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the recently appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they [[Earp Vendetta Ride|pursued]] the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found [[Frank Stilwell]] [[lying in wait]] as Virgil boarded a train for California and killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of five members of the federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April 1882, before they rode to the [[New Mexico Territory]]. Wyatt Earp learned of an extradition request for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor [[Frederick Walker Pitkin]] to deny Holliday's extradition.

He had a contemporary reputation as a skilled gunfighter which modern historians generally regard as accurate.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|410}} Tombstone resident [[George W. Parsons]] wrote that Holliday confronted [[Johnny Ringo]] in January 1882, telling him, \"All I want of you is ten paces out in the street.\" Ringo and he were prevented from a gunfight by the Tombstone police, who arrested both. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Holliday initially carried a shotgun and shot at and may have killed Tom McLaury. Holliday was grazed by a bullet fired by Frank McLaury, and shot back. After [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] was maimed in a January ambush, Holliday was part of a federal posse led by Deputy U.S. Marshal Earp who guarded him on his way to the railroad in Tucson. There they found Frank Stilwell apparently waiting for the Earps in the rail yard. A warrant for Holliday's arrest was issued after Stilwell was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds. Holliday was part of Earp's federal posse when they killed three other outlaw Cowboys during the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]]. Holliday reported that he had been arrested 17 times, four attempts had been made to hang him, and that he survived ambush five times.<ref name=Natural>{{cite web |url=http://thenaturalamerican.com/holliday.htm |title=The Natural American: Doc Holliday |quote=based on information found in ''The Chronicles of Tombstone'' by Ben Traywick |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021201753/http://thenaturalamerican.com/holliday.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2014  |access-date=October 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Character ===\nThroughout his lifetime, Holliday was known by many of his peers as a tempered, calm, Southern gentleman.

Only one arrest was for murder, which occurred in an 1879 shootout with Mike Gordon in New Mexico, for which he was acquitted. In the preliminary hearing following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated Holliday's actions as those of a duly appointed lawman. In Denver, the Arizona warrant against Holliday for Frank Stilwell's murder went unserved when the governor was persuaded by Trinidad Chief of Police Bat Masterson to release Holliday to his custody for bunco charges.<ref name=\"holliday2001\">{{cite book | last=Holliday| first=Karen Tanner| title=Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait| year=2001| publisher=University of Oklahoma Press| location=Norman| isbn=978-0-8061-3320-1}}</ref>\n\nAmong his other arrests, Holliday pleaded guilty to two gambling charges, one charge of carrying a deadly weapon in the city (in connection with the argument with Ringo), and one misdemeanor assault and battery charge (for his shooting of Joyce and Parker). The others were all dismissed or returned as \"not guilty.\"<ref name=\"holliday2001\"/>\n\n=== Alleged murder of Ed Bailey ===\n\nWyatt Earp recounted one event during which Holliday killed a fellow gambler named Ed Bailey. Earp and his common-law wife [[Mattie Blaylock]] were in [[Fort Griffin, Texas]], during the winter of 1878, looking for gambling opportunities.

Holliday caught Bailey \"monkeying with the dead wood\" or the discard pile, which was against the rules. According to Earp, Holliday reminded Bailey to \"play poker\", which was a polite way to caution him to stop cheating. When Bailey made the same move again, Holliday took the pot without showing his hand, which was his right under the rules. Bailey immediately went for his pistol, but Holliday whipped out a knife from his breast pocket and \"caught Bailey just below the brisket\" or upper chest. Bailey died and Holliday, new to town, was detained in his room at the Planter's Hotel.<ref name=holliday2001/>{{rp|115}}\n\nIn [[Stuart N. Lake|Stuart Lake]]'s best-selling biography, ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'' (1931), Earp added to the story. He is quoted as saying that Holliday's girlfriend, \"Big Nose Kate\" Horony, devised a diversion. She procured a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol.<ref name=lee/> However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey's death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed \"a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room.\" She laughed at the idea of \"a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw up his hands, disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies.\"<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|87}}\n\nAuthor and Earp expert Ben Traywick doubts that Holliday killed Bailey. He could find no newspaper articles or court records to support the story. He found evidence to support that Holliday was being held in his hotel room under guard, but for \"illegal gambling\", and that the story of Horony starting a fire as a diversion to free him was true. The story about Bailey as told in  ''San Francisco Enquirer'' interview of Earp was likely fabricated by the writer. Years later, Earp wrote:\n\n{{quote|Of all the nonsensical guff which has been written around my life, there has been none more inaccurate or farfetched than that which has dealt with Doc Holliday.  After Holliday died, I gave a San Francisco newspaper reporter a short sketch of his life.  Apparently the reporter was not satisfied.

Fly]] in Tombstone, but sometimes reported to have been taken in Dallas. Holliday lived in a rooming house in front of Fly's photography studio. Many persons share similar facial features, and the faces of people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers, and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist.

A close friend and associate of [[Sheriff|lawman]] [[Wyatt Earp]], Holliday is best known for his role in the events leading up to and following the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]. He developed a reputation as having killed more than a dozen men in various altercations, but modern researchers have concluded that, contrary to popular myth-making, Holliday killed only one to three men. Holliday's colorful life and character have been depicted in many books and portrayed by well-known actors in numerous movies and television series.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|415}}\n\nAt age 21, Holliday earned a [[Dental degree|degree in dentistry]] from the [[Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery]]. He set up practice in Griffin, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15, having acquired it while tending to her needs while she was still in the contagious phase of the illness. Hoping the climate in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] would ease his symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona in that day.<ref>{{cite web| title=Gambling in the Old West| url=http://www.historynet.com/gambling-in-the-old-west.htm| website=History Net| publisher=Wild West Magazine| accessdate=April 13, 2015| date=June 12, 2006| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424035923/http://www.historynet.com/gambling-in-the-old-west.htm| archivedate=April 24, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations.

In Tombstone, local members of the outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys]] repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a [[Stagecoach|stage]]. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal [[Virgil Earp]]. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys near the O.K. Corral on the west side of town, which resulted in the 30-second shootout.\n\nFollowing the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants while [[Morgan Earp]] was murdered. Unable to obtain justice in the courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the recently appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they [[Earp Vendetta Ride|pursued]] the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found [[Frank Stilwell]] [[lying in wait]] as Virgil boarded a train for California and killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of five members of the federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April 1882, before they rode to the [[New Mexico Territory]]. Wyatt Earp learned of an extradition request for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor [[Frederick Walker Pitkin]] to deny Holliday's extradition. Holliday spent the few remaining years of his life in Colorado, and died of tuberculosis in his bed at the Hotel Glenwood at age 36.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web |last1=[[The Associated Press]] |title=A New Tombstone Sets the Record Straight for Doc Holliday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/us/a-new-tombstone-sets-the-record-straight-for-doc-holliday.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=NYT |accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\n[[File:DocHollidayCloseUp.jpg|left|thumb|Holliday's graduation photo in March 1872 from the Pennsylvania School of Dentistry.]]\n\nHolliday was born in [[Griffin, Georgia]], to Henry Burroughs Holliday and Alice Jane (McKey) Holliday.<ref name=\"genealogy2\">{{cite web| url=http://www.kansasheritage.org/families/holliday.html| title=John Henry Holliday Family History| publisher=Kansas Heritage Group| accessdate=March 30, 2015| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514215437/http://www.kansasheritage.org/families/holliday.html| archivedate=May 14, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref> He was of [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry.<ref name=tanner/>{{rp| 236}} His father served in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (as a Confederate).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/soldiers.cfm|title=Civil War Soldiers and Sailors| publisher= The National Park Service|accessdate=January 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814171239/http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/soldiers.cfm|archivedate=August 14, 2008 }}</ref> When the Mexican\u2013American War ended, Henry brought home an adopted son named Francisco.

McKey, said her father told her: \"They rode in on the Negroes in swimming in a part of the Withlacoochee River that \"Doc\" and his friends had cleared to be used as their swimming hole. The presence of the Negroes in their swimming hole enraged \"Doc,\" and he drew his pistol, shooting over their heads to scare them off.\" Papa said, \"He shot over their heads!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Folsom |first1=Allen |title=Doc Holliday and the Swimming Hole Incident - Valdosta State University |url=https://www.valdosta.edu/academics/library/depts/archives-and-special-collections/regional-history/folsom01.php |website=www.valdosta.edu |accessdate=September 13, 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Masterson's story, Holliday leveled a double-barreled shotgun at them, and when they exited the swimming hole, killed two of the youths.

The cowboys had repeatedly threatened the Earps and Holliday.  Fearing trouble, Virgil temporarily deputized Holliday and sought backup from his brothers Wyatt and Morgan.

This was based on correspondence written between Holliday and his cousin, Sister Mary Melanie, a Catholic nun. No baptismal record has been found in either St. Stephen's Catholic Church in Glenwood Springs or at the Annunciation Catholic Church in nearby Leadville.<ref name=holliday2001/>{{rp|300}} Holliday's mother had been raised a Methodist and later joined a Presbyterian church (her husband's faith), but objected to the Presbyterian doctrine of [[predestination]] and reconverted to [[Methodism]] publicly before she died, saying that she wanted her son John to know what she believed.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|14, 41}} Holliday himself was later to say that he had joined a Methodist church in Dallas.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|70}} At the end of his life, Holliday had struck up friendships with both a Catholic priest, Father E.T. Downey, and a Presbyterian minister, Rev. W.S. Randolph, in Glenwood Springs. When he died, Father Downey was out of town, and so Rev. Randolph presided over the burial at 4pm on the same day that Holliday died. The services were reportedly attended by \"many friends\".<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|370, 372}}\n\n=== Burial ===\n\nHolliday is buried in Linwood Cemetery overlooking Glenwood Springs. Since Holliday died in November, the ground may have been frozen. Some modern authors such as Bob Boze Bell<ref>{{cite book | last1=Bell| first1=Bob Boze| title=The Illustrated Life and Times of Doc Holliday| date=1995| publisher=Tri Star-Boze Publications| location=Phoenix, Arizona| isbn=1-887576-00-2| edition=Second}}</ref> speculate that it would have been impossible to transport him to the cemetery, which was only accessible by a difficult mountain road, or to dig a grave because the ground was frozen. Author Gary Roberts located evidence that other bodies were transported to the Linwood Cemetery at the same time of the month that year. Contemporary newspaper reports explicitly state that Holliday was buried in the Linwood Cemetery, but the exact location of his grave is uncertain.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n== Public reputation ==\n\nHolliday maintained a fierce persona as was sometimes needed for a gambler to earn respect. He had a contemporary reputation as a skilled gunfighter which modern historians generally regard as accurate.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|410}} Tombstone resident [[George W. Parsons]] wrote that Holliday confronted [[Johnny Ringo]] in January 1882, telling him, \"All I want of you is ten paces out in the street.\" Ringo and he were prevented from a gunfight by the Tombstone police, who arrested both. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Holliday initially carried a shotgun and shot at and may have killed Tom McLaury. Holliday was grazed by a bullet fired by Frank McLaury, and shot back. After [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] was maimed in a January ambush, Holliday was part of a federal posse led by Deputy U.S. Marshal Earp who guarded him on his way to the railroad in Tucson. There they found Frank Stilwell apparently waiting for the Earps in the rail yard. A warrant for Holliday's arrest was issued after Stilwell was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds. Holliday was part of Earp's federal posse when they killed three other outlaw Cowboys during the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]]. Holliday reported that he had been arrested 17 times, four attempts had been made to hang him, and that he survived ambush five times.<ref name=Natural>{{cite web |url=http://thenaturalamerican.com/holliday.htm |title=The Natural American: Doc Holliday |quote=based on information found in ''The Chronicles of Tombstone'' by Ben Traywick |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021201753/http://thenaturalamerican.com/holliday.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2014  |access-date=October 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Character ===\nThroughout his lifetime, Holliday was known by many of his peers as a tempered, calm, Southern gentleman. In an 1896 article, Wyatt Earp said:\n\n{{quote|I found him a loyal friend and good company. He was a dentist whom necessity had made a gambler; a gentleman whom disease had made a vagabond; a philosopher whom life had made a caustic wit; a long, lean blonde fellow nearly dead with consumption and at the same time the most skillful gambler and nerviest, speediest, deadliest man with a six-gun I ever knew.<ref>{{cite web | title=Doc Holliday- Deadly Doctor of the West | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/CP-DocHolliday.html | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211105333/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/CP-DocHolliday.html | archivedate=December 11, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a newspaper interview, Holliday was once asked if his conscience ever troubled him.

Holliday had a mean disposition and an ungovernable temper, and under the influence of liquor was a most dangerous man\u2026. Physically, Doc Holliday was a weakling who could not have whipped a healthy fifteen-year-old boy in a go-as-you-please fist fight.<ref name=\"westdoc\"/>}}\n\n=== Stabbings and shootings ===\n\nMuch of Holliday's violent reputation was nothing but rumors and [[self promotion]]. However, he showed great skill in gambling and gunfights. His tuberculosis did not hamper his ability as a gambler and as a marksman. Holliday was [[ambidextrous]].<ref name=lubet/>{{rp|96}}\n\nNo contemporaneous newspaper accounts or legal records offer proof of the many unnamed men whom Holliday is credited with killing in popular folklore. The only men he is known to have killed are Mike Gordon in 1879; probably Frank Mclaury and Tom McLaury in Tombstone; and possibly Frank Stilwell in Tucson. Some scholars argue that Holliday may have encouraged the stories about his reputation, although his record never supported those claims.<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|410}}\n\nIn a March 1882 interview with the ''Arizona Daily Star'', Virgil Earp told the reporter:\n\n{{quote|There was something very peculiar about Doc. He was gentlemanly, a good dentist, a friendly man, and yet outside of us boys I don't think he had a friend in the Territory. Tales were told that he had murdered men in different parts of the country; that he had robbed and committed all manner of crimes, and yet when persons were asked how they knew it, they could only admit that it was hearsay, and that nothing of the kind could really be traced up to Doc's account.<ref name=interviewone>{{cite web | title=Interview with Virgil Earp Arizona Daily Star| accessdate=May 24, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428084917/http://www.angelfire.com/co4/earpgang/interviewone.html| archivedate=April 28, 2009| date=May 30, 1882 | work=Arizona Affairs |url=http://www.angelfire.com/co4/earpgang/interviewone.html}} Originally published in the ''Arizona Daily Star'' on May 30, 1882</ref>}}\n\n=== Arrests and convictions ===\n\nBiographer Karen Holliday Tanner found that Holliday had been arrested 17 times before his 1881 shootout in Tombstone. Only one arrest was for murder, which occurred in an 1879 shootout with Mike Gordon in New Mexico, for which he was acquitted. In the preliminary hearing following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated Holliday's actions as those of a duly appointed lawman. In Denver, the Arizona warrant against Holliday for Frank Stilwell's murder went unserved when the governor was persuaded by Trinidad Chief of Police Bat Masterson to release Holliday to his custody for bunco charges.<ref name=\"holliday2001\">{{cite book | last=Holliday| first=Karen Tanner| title=Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait| year=2001| publisher=University of Oklahoma Press| location=Norman| isbn=978-0-8061-3320-1}}</ref>\n\nAmong his other arrests, Holliday pleaded guilty to two gambling charges, one charge of carrying a deadly weapon in the city (in connection with the argument with Ringo), and one misdemeanor assault and battery charge (for his shooting of Joyce and Parker). The others were all dismissed or returned as \"not guilty.\"<ref name=\"holliday2001\"/>\n\n=== Alleged murder of Ed Bailey ===\n\nWyatt Earp recounted one event during which Holliday killed a fellow gambler named Ed Bailey. Earp and his common-law wife [[Mattie Blaylock]] were in [[Fort Griffin, Texas]], during the winter of 1878, looking for gambling opportunities. Earp visited the saloon of his old friend from Cheyenne, John Shannsey, and met Holliday at the Cattle Exchange.<ref name=lee>{{cite web | last=Paul| first=Lee| title=John Henry Holliday| url=http://www.theoutlaws.com/outlaws1.htm| accessdate=October 29, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216201643/http://www.theoutlaws.com/outlaws1.htm|archivedate=February 16, 2008}}</ref> The story of Holliday killing Bailey first appeared nine years after Holliday's death in an 1896 interview with Wyatt Earp that was published in the ''San Francisco Enquirer''.<ref name=wilcox>{{cite web| last1=Wilcox| first1=Victoria| title=Doc Holliday and the Ghost of Ed Bailey {{!}}| url=http://victoriawilcoxbooks.com/doc-holliday-history/doc-holliday-and-the-ghost-of-ed-bailey/| website=victoriawilcoxbooks.com| accessdate=November 1, 2016| date=August 11, 2015| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103234127/http://victoriawilcoxbooks.com/doc-holliday-history/doc-holliday-and-the-ghost-of-ed-bailey/| archivedate=November 3, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to Earp, Holliday was playing poker with a well-liked local man named Ed Bailey. Holliday caught Bailey \"monkeying with the dead wood\" or the discard pile, which was against the rules. According to Earp, Holliday reminded Bailey to \"play poker\", which was a polite way to caution him to stop cheating. When Bailey made the same move again, Holliday took the pot without showing his hand, which was his right under the rules. Bailey immediately went for his pistol, but Holliday whipped out a knife from his breast pocket and \"caught Bailey just below the brisket\" or upper chest. Bailey died and Holliday, new to town, was detained in his room at the Planter's Hotel.<ref name=holliday2001/>{{rp|115}}\n\nIn [[Stuart N. Lake|Stuart Lake]]'s best-selling biography, ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'' (1931), Earp added to the story. He is quoted as saying that Holliday's girlfriend, \"Big Nose Kate\" Horony, devised a diversion. She procured a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol.<ref name=lee/> However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey's death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed \"a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room.\" She laughed at the idea of \"a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw up his hands, disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies.\"<ref name=roberts2006/>{{rp|87}}\n\nAuthor and Earp expert Ben Traywick doubts that Holliday killed Bailey. He could find no newspaper articles or court records to support the story. He found evidence to support that Holliday was being held in his hotel room under guard, but for \"illegal gambling\", and that the story of Horony starting a fire as a diversion to free him was true. The story about Bailey as told in  ''San Francisco Enquirer'' interview of Earp was likely fabricated by the writer. Years later, Earp wrote:\n\n{{quote|Of all the nonsensical guff which has been written around my life, there has been none more inaccurate or farfetched than that which has dealt with Doc Holliday.  After Holliday died, I gave a San Francisco newspaper reporter a short sketch of his life.  Apparently the reporter was not satisfied.  The sketch appeared in print with a lot of things added that never existed outside the reporter's imagination ...<ref name=wilcox/>}}\n\n== Photos of Holliday ==\n\nThree photos of unknown provenance are often reported to be of Holliday, some of them supposedly taken by [[C.S. Fly]] in Tombstone, but sometimes reported to have been taken in Dallas. Holliday lived in a rooming house in front of Fly's photography studio. Many persons share similar facial features, and the faces of people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers, and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.<ref name=rowe>{{cite web |url=http://maineantiquedigest.com/articles_archive/articles/oct02/josi1002.htm |first=Jeremy |last=Rowe |year=2002 |title=Thoughts on Kaloma, the Purported Photograph of Josie Earp |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320071207/http://maineantiquedigest.com/articles_archive/articles/oct02/josi1002.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2012  }}</ref>\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:DocHollidayCloseUp.jpg|Cropped from a larger version, Holliday's graduation photo from the Pennsylvania School of Dental Surgery in March 1872, age 20, known [[provenance]] and authenticated as Holliday\nImage:Doc Holliday in Prescott AZ (closeup).jpg|Cropped from a larger version, Holliday in Prescott, Arizona in 1879, age 27, known [[provenance]] and authenticated as Holliday\nImage:DocHolliday.jpg|Uncreased print of supposed 1882 Tombstone photo of Holliday, left side is upturned, detachable shirt collar toward camera, no cowlick, unknown provenance\nImage:HollidayLcollar.jpg|Creased and darker version of photo at left, unknown provenance\nImage:Doc Holliday.jpg|Person most often reported to be Holliday with a [[cowlick]] and folded-down collar, heavily retouched, oval, inscribed portrait, unknown provenance\nImage:HollidayandBowler.jpg|Person with a [[bowler hat]] and open vest and coat, unknown provenance\n</gallery>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n[[File:Wyatt and Doc.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Life-sized statues of lawman Wyatt Earp and deputy Doc Holliday at the [[Tucson (Amtrak station)|Historic Railroad Depot]]]]\nDoc Holliday is one of the most recognizable figures in the American Old West, but he is most remembered for his friendship with Wyatt Earp and his role in the Gunfight at the O.K.

Movie World Germany]] (1996\u20132004).\n\nThe stunt show is based loosely on the ''[[Police Academy (franchise)|Police Academy]]'' films released by [[Warner Bros.]], with only a passing mention made of the main characters in the line: \"I remember the days of Mahoney, Hightower and Tackleberry! We need recruits of that caliber...\", suggesting that the show takes place after the events of the film series.\n\n==Locations==\n===Australia===\n{{See also|Warner Bros.

The show described below is the Australian version.''\n\nThe show begins with the elusive silk stocking gang, a criminal duo, escaping from prison and stealing a police motorcycle and side car. Following that, the Proctor (a role that can be performed by a male or female, as with some of the characters in the show) emerges and gives a short monologue about the stunts in the performance, as well as a safety warning.\n\nThe strict Captain Harris (typically male) appears to recruit audience members as part of the show, typically recruiting one middle-aged male (usually a father, to facilitate the jokes), one pre-teen boy (to which the Captain sneers \"you remind me of my little brother! I hate my little brother...\"), a female (jokingly introduced as \"six foot six, muscle-bound...\") and one company stuntman, a character named \"Rodney\", typically dressed in a garish ocean-print shirt and hat. Following the recruitment, four green cadets and the commissioner emerge for the morning ceremony and flag raising. This is preceded by a series of car stunts, with the cadets driving a police car, souped-up hot rod and a golf buggy. A few slapstick stunts (falling on the floor etc.) follow.\n\nCadet Verbinski wishes to pass an urgent letter to the commissioner, but he/she is accidentally pulled up the flag pole wrapped in the flag, then falls on top of the commissioner. The commissioner reads the letter, informing him about the silk stocking gang's intentions. The \"recruits\" from the audience are then called upon and are positioned around the set. The silk stocking gang then suddenly appears on top of the roof, and a wild gunfight sequence ensues. Rodney is accidentally \"shot\", and falls from his second floor post onto a disguised cushion. The cadet responsible is then reprimanded for the action. Two other cadets then climb up the scaffolding to reach the silk stocking gang who have successfully robbed the nearby payroll building.\n\nA slapstick confrontation follows, ending in one cadet being kicked off the top of the second floor. He/she lands in a disguised cushioned dumping container, and emerges unscathed later. In the meantime, the commissioner uses a portable toilet, but it is accidentally lifted into the air by a crane and the door falls out, nearly dropping him out with it. The two culprits return to the motorcycle and a wild car chase follows, with Rodney being roughed up quite a bit. The sidecar detaches, but the remaining criminal wields explosives that scare the cadets. He first puts a bomb into an armoured vehicle, which explodes and flips over. He then passes a bomb to one cadet, who almost throws it into the audience but puts the bomb into a trash can in the end. \n\nThe commissioner orders the cadets to transport Rodney to a safe place, and they choose the tool shed. The last bomb goes into there, and the explosion blasts open the side panels of the shed and seemingly catapults Rodney (most likely a safety dummy) up onto the roof. One member of the duo will shout to the other to \"get the chopper!\" setting the scene for the climatic finale. A helicopter with rotors spinning and machine guns firing (though with nobody in the cockpit) emerges from the roof. The cadets, as well as an \"injured\" Rodney, rush to man the cannons. The first shot is unsuccessful, but the second \"hits\" the helicopter which spews smoke and descends into the roof slowly. \n\nThe aftermath is the show's biggest explosion, a huge rooftop blaze where the audience is actually able to feel the radiating heat. The \"pilot\" then rushes out of the door, vest blazing. He is extinguished and apprehended by the policemen, and the show ends.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Stunt Golf Cart parking.jpg|A performer parking the buggy.\nFile:Police Academy Stunt Show - flag pole.jpg|A police officer is hoisted up a flag pole.\nFile:Police Academy Stunt Show - explosion and car flip.jpg|A police car being flipped after an explosion.\nFile:Catapulted Stuntman.jpg|Rodney seemingly catapulted into the air.\nFile:Stunt Show Helicopter.jpg|The working helicopter model before its \"destruction\".\nFile:Police Academy Stunt Show explosion.jpg|The climatic ending explosion.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Warner Bros.

Formerly, the show was also at [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] (1991\u20132008), [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] (1994), and [[Warner Bros. Movie World Germany]] (1996\u20132004).\n\nThe stunt show is based loosely on the ''[[Police Academy (franchise)|Police Academy]]'' films released by [[Warner Bros.]], with only a passing mention made of the main characters in the line: \"I remember the days of Mahoney, Hightower and Tackleberry! We need recruits of that caliber...\", suggesting that the show takes place after the events of the film series.\n\n==Locations==\n===Australia===\n{{See also|Warner Bros.

The show described below is the Australian version.''\n\nThe show begins with the elusive silk stocking gang, a criminal duo, escaping from prison and stealing a police motorcycle and side car. Following that, the Proctor (a role that can be performed by a male or female, as with some of the characters in the show) emerges and gives a short monologue about the stunts in the performance, as well as a safety warning.\n\nThe strict Captain Harris (typically male) appears to recruit audience members as part of the show, typically recruiting one middle-aged male (usually a father, to facilitate the jokes), one pre-teen boy (to which the Captain sneers \"you remind me of my little brother! I hate my little brother...\"), a female (jokingly introduced as \"six foot six, muscle-bound...\") and one company stuntman, a character named \"Rodney\", typically dressed in a garish ocean-print shirt and hat. Following the recruitment, four green cadets and the commissioner emerge for the morning ceremony and flag raising. This is preceded by a series of car stunts, with the cadets driving a police car, souped-up hot rod and a golf buggy. A few slapstick stunts (falling on the floor etc.) follow.\n\nCadet Verbinski wishes to pass an urgent letter to the commissioner, but he/she is accidentally pulled up the flag pole wrapped in the flag, then falls on top of the commissioner. The commissioner reads the letter, informing him about the silk stocking gang's intentions. The \"recruits\" from the audience are then called upon and are positioned around the set. The silk stocking gang then suddenly appears on top of the roof, and a wild gunfight sequence ensues. Rodney is accidentally \"shot\", and falls from his second floor post onto a disguised cushion. The cadet responsible is then reprimanded for the action. Two other cadets then climb up the scaffolding to reach the silk stocking gang who have successfully robbed the nearby payroll building.\n\nA slapstick confrontation follows, ending in one cadet being kicked off the top of the second floor. He/she lands in a disguised cushioned dumping container, and emerges unscathed later. In the meantime, the commissioner uses a portable toilet, but it is accidentally lifted into the air by a crane and the door falls out, nearly dropping him out with it. The two culprits return to the motorcycle and a wild car chase follows, with Rodney being roughed up quite a bit. The sidecar detaches, but the remaining criminal wields explosives that scare the cadets. He first puts a bomb into an armoured vehicle, which explodes and flips over. He then passes a bomb to one cadet, who almost throws it into the audience but puts the bomb into a trash can in the end. \n\nThe commissioner orders the cadets to transport Rodney to a safe place, and they choose the tool shed. The last bomb goes into there, and the explosion blasts open the side panels of the shed and seemingly catapults Rodney (most likely a safety dummy) up onto the roof. One member of the duo will shout to the other to \"get the chopper!\" setting the scene for the climatic finale. A helicopter with rotors spinning and machine guns firing (though with nobody in the cockpit) emerges from the roof. The cadets, as well as an \"injured\" Rodney, rush to man the cannons. The first shot is unsuccessful, but the second \"hits\" the helicopter which spews smoke and descends into the roof slowly. \n\nThe aftermath is the show's biggest explosion, a huge rooftop blaze where the audience is actually able to feel the radiating heat. The \"pilot\" then rushes out of the door, vest blazing. He is extinguished and apprehended by the policemen, and the show ends.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Stunt Golf Cart parking.jpg|A performer parking the buggy.\nFile:Police Academy Stunt Show - flag pole.jpg|A police officer is hoisted up a flag pole.\nFile:Police Academy Stunt Show - explosion and car flip.jpg|A police car being flipped after an explosion.\nFile:Catapulted Stuntman.jpg|Rodney seemingly catapulted into the air.\nFile:Stunt Show Helicopter.jpg|The working helicopter model before its \"destruction\".\nFile:Police Academy Stunt Show explosion.jpg|The climatic ending explosion.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Warner Bros.
