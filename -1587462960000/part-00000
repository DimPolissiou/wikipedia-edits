The Israeli settlements were, on the other hand, administered subsequently as [[Judea and Samaria Area]] directly by Israel.\n\nSince the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]], the [[Palestinian Authority]] officially controls a geographically non-contiguous territory comprising approximately 11% of the West Bank (known as [[Area A]]) which remains subject to Israeli incursions. Area B (approximately 28%) is subject to joint Israeli-Palestinian military and Palestinian civil control. [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]] (approximately 61%) is under full Israeli control.

[[Moshe Dayan]] proposed a plan which [[Gershom Gorenberg]] likens to a \"photo negative of Allon's.\"{{efn|\"In fact, Dayan had submitted his own secret plan.

British and Arab commercial banks operating in the West Bank were closed down soon after Israel assumed power there. [[Bank Leumi]] then opened nine branches, without successfully replacing the earlier system. Farmers could get loans, but Palestinian businessmen avoided taking out loans from them since they charged 9% compared to 5% interest in Jordan.{{sfn|Cohen|1985|p=245}}{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|pp=112\u2013113}} By June 1967, only a third of West Bank land had been registered under Jordan's ''Settlement of Disputes over Land and Water Law'' and in 1968 Israel moved to cancel the possibility of registering one's title with the Jordanian Land Register.{{sfn|Nicoletti|Hearne|2012|p=14}} [[Ian Lustick]] states that Israel \"virtually prevented\" Palestinian investment in local industry and agriculture.{{sfn|Lustick|2018|p=11}} At the same time, Israel encouraged Arab labour to enter into Israel's economy, and regarded them as a new, expanded and protected market for Israeli exports.

With Military Order No. 393 (14 June 1970), the local commander was given the power and authority to block any construction if, in his evaluation, the building might pose a danger to Israel's security. The overall effect was to obstruct manufacturing development and subordinate any local industrial activity to the exigencies of Israel's economy, or to block the creation of industries that might compete with Israel's. For example, entrepreneurs were denied a permit for a cement factory in Hebron. In order to protect Israeli farmers, melon production was forbidden, imports of grapes and dates were banned, and limits were set to how many cucumbers and tomatoes could be produced.{{sfn|Quigley|2005|p=186}} Israeli milk producers exerted pressure on the [[Ministry of Economy (Israel)|Ministry for Industry and Trade]] to stop the establishment of a competitive dairy in [[Ramallah]].{{sfn|El-Farra|MacMillen|2000|pp=161\u2013161}}\n\nThe sum effect after two decades was that 15% of all Palestinian firms in the West Bank (and Gaza) employing over eight people, and 32% with seven or less, were prohibited from selling their products in Israel.{{sfn|El-Farra|MacMillen|2000|p=164}} Israeli [[Protectionism|protectionist policies]] thus distorted wider trade relations to the point that, by 1996, 90% of all West Bank imports came from Israel, with consumers paying more than they would for comparable products had they been able to exercise commercial autonomy.{{sfn|Kadri|1998|pp=517\u2013518}}\n\n===Legal status===\n{{main|Israeli occupation of the West Bank}}\n[[File:1947-UN-Partition-Plan-1949-Armistice-Comparison.svg|thumb|upright|alt=Map comparing the borders of the 1947 partition plan and the armistice of 1949.|{{Partition Plan-Armistice Lines comparison map legend}}]]\nFrom 1517 to 1917 the West Bank was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

[...] It is understood that realizing the full potential of such investments requires other changes as well \u2013 first, the rolling back of the movement and access restrictions in force outside Area C, which prevent the easy export of Palestinian products and inhibit tourists and investors from accessing Area C; and second, further reforms by the Palestinian Authority to better enable potential investors to register businesses, enforce contracts, and acquire finance. [...] Neglecting indirect positive effects, we estimate that the potential additional output from the sectors evaluated in this report alone would amount to at least USD 2.2 billion per annum in valued added terms \u2013 a sum equivalent to 23 percent of 2011 Palestinian GDP. The bulk of this would come from agriculture and Dead Sea minerals exploitation. [...] x. Tapping this potential output could dramatically improve the PA's fiscal position. Even without any improvements in the efficiency of tax collection, at the current rate of tax/GDP of 20 percent the additional tax revenues associated with such an increase in GDP would amount to some USD 800 million. Assuming that expenditures remain at the same level, this extra resource would notionally cut the fiscal deficit by half \u2013 significantly reducing the need for donor recurrent budget support. This major improvement in fiscal sustainability would in turn generate significant positive reputational benefits for the PA and would considerably enhance investor confidence. xi. The impact on Palestinian livelihoods would be impressive. An increase in GDP equivalent to 35 percent would be expected to create substantial employment, sufficient to put a significant dent in the currently high rate of unemployment. If an earlier estimated one-to-one relationship between growth and employment was to hold, this increase in GDP would lead to a 35 percent increase in employment. This level of growth in employment would also put a large dent in poverty, as recent estimates show that unemployed Palestinians are twice as likely to be poor as their employed counterparts. |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801210703/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/23/000442464_20140123122135/Rendered/PDF/AUS29220REPLAC0EVISION0January02014.pdf |archivedate= 1 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Water supply===\n{{main|Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories}}\nAmnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources:\n\n{{quote|Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) do not have access to adequate, safe water supplies...Discriminatory Israeli policies in the OPT are the root cause of the striking disparity in access to water between Palestinians and Israelis...The inequality is even more pronounced between Palestinian communities and unlawful Israeli settlements, established in the OPT in violation of international law.

These materials consist of such things as sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries.{{sfn|Aloni|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nIn 2007 it was estimated that 38% (35 mcm a year) of all wastewater flowing into the West Bank derived from settlements and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|p=7}} Of the 121 settlements surveyed, 81 had wastewater treatrment plant, much of it inadequate or subject to breakdown, with much sewage flowing into lowland streams and terrain where Palestinian villages are located. Only 4 of 53 indictments for waste pollution were made over the years from 2000 to 2008, whereas in Israel the laws are strictly applied and, in 2006 alone, 230 enforcements for the same abuse were enforced.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=8\u201312}} At the same time 90\u201395% of Palestinian wastewater was not treated, with only 1 of 4 Israeli plants built in the 1970s to that purpose functioning, and the neglect to improve the infrastructure is attributed to Israeli budgetary problems.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19\u201321}} After the Oslo Accords, the global community earmarked $250,000,000 for West Bank wastewater infrastructure. Israel at times insisted its approval was conditional on linking the grid to Israeli settlements, which neither the donors nor Palestinians accepted. Most the infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by IDF military operations.{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.11}} The PA did raise funds from Germany for 15 plants, but only managed to build one, at [[al-Bireh]], within Area B, though even there Israel insisted the plant process waste from the settlement of [[Psagot]], though refusing to pay fees for the treatment.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19\u201321}} Palestinian towns like [[Salfit]] have been deeply affected by sewage overflow channeled past the town from the settlement of Ariel.{{sfn|Ashly|2017}}{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.14}}\n\nUnlike the data available for sewage treatment within Israel, the Israeli Water Commission refuses to provide public reports on 15&nbsp;million cubic metres of sewage flowing from Israeli settlements in the West Bank. It claims 75% is treated adequately but independent Israeli studies (2000) suggest that only 6% met Israeli treatment standards, while 48% was either not treated adequastely or discharged raw. Since then some improvements have been implemented.{{sfn|Tagar|Keinen|Bromberg|2007|pp=419\u2013420}}\n\nThe landfill near [[Al-Jiftlik]] in the [[Jericho Governorate]], built on [[Israeli land and property laws|absentee Palestinian property]] without planning or an environment impact analysis, is for the exclusive use of waste, 1,000 tons per day, produced by Israeli settlements and cities within Israel.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Palestinians are restricted to 3 landfills, and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage.

World Bank, April 2009.</ref>\n\n===Resource extraction===\nBased on the number of quarries per km<sup>2</sup> in Areas A and B, it is calculated that, were Israel to lift restrictions, a further 275 quarries could be opened in Area C.  The World Bank estimates that Israel's virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241&nbsp;million per year.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}}\nIn International law drawing on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] (Article 55), it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets, and that the [[usufruct]] must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority. Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell 94% of their material to Israel, which arguably constitutes \"depletion\" and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Thus the German [[HeidelbergCement|cement firm quarrying at Nahal Raba]] paid out \u20ac430,000 ($479,000) in taxes to the [[Samaria Regional Council]] in 2014 alone.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} The Israeli High Court rejected a petition that such quarrying was a violation by stating that after 4 decades Israeli law must adapt to \"the realities on the ground\". The state did undertake not to open more quarries.{{sfn|Gross|2011}} As an illustrative example, a Human Rights Watch report contrasts the difference between a Palestinian-owned quarry company in [[Beit Fajar]] and that of a European one working on what Israeli considers its state land. The European company obtained a concession and license to harvest stone, whereas Israel refuses permits for most of the roughly 40 Beit Fajar quarries, or nearly any other Palestinian-owned quarry in the West Bank under Israeli administration.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}\n\nIsrael had denied Palestinians permits to process minerals in that area of the West Bank.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} The products of the Israeli cosmetics firm [[Ahava]], established in 1988, were developed in laboratories at the West Bank Dead Sea settlements of [[Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Kalya]]. 60% of their production is sold in the EU market.{{sfn|Nicoletti|Hearne|2012|pp=21\u201322}} In 2018 The UN, stating that the violations were both \"pervasive and devastating\" to the local Palestinian population, identified some 206 companies which do business with Israeli settlements in the West Bank.{{sfn|Nebehay|2018}}\nRoughly 73 percent of global [[bromine]] production comes from Israeli and Jordanian exploitation of the Dead Sea. The potential incremental value that could accrue to the Palestinian economy from the production and sales of [[potash]], bromine and magnesium has been conservatively estimated at US$918&nbsp;million per annum, or 9 percent of GDP.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Beckouche|2017|p=156}} The lost earnings from not being allowed to process Dead Sea minerals such as potash, and for making bromide-based flame retardants, based on calculations of comparable use by Israel and Jordan, suggest a figure of $642&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=58\u201360}}\n\n===Loss of cultural property===\nAlbert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony, by confiscating Arab cultural resources. In 1967 it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum{{efn|\"The one center of archaeological activity that might have provided a base for Palestinian archaeologists was the Palestine Archaeological Museum in Jerusalem, which was under the control not of Jordan but of trustees made up of the directors of the several foreign schools of archaeology in the city. It is therefore not clear why persons like [[Dimitri Baramki]] did not continue their work as archaeologists employed by the Palestine Museum. In any event, Jordan nationalized the museum only months before the June 1967 war, enabling the Israelis to claim it as theirs by right of conquest,\"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=77}}}} and its library in East Jerusalem.{{efn|\"Fourth, the disappearance of the Palestinian patrimony (material evidence) through the deliberate confiscation of Arab cultural resources by Israelis (such as the large library of Dr. [[Tawfiq Canaan]] in 1948, the [[Rockefeller Museum|Palestine Archaeological Museum]] and its library in Jerusalem in 1967, and the library of the Palestine Research Center in Beirut in 1982), as well as the destruction of cultural property in the form of entire villages in 1948\u201349. This last is particularly crucial, since the Palestinians' link to their past is largely through the villages, few towns, and fewer cities that predominated in their land during the last thirteen centuries.\"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=71}}}} Often these losses are personal, as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables. The journalist Hamdi Faraj, jailed for endangering public order, had his 500-volume library confiscated, including copies of the Bible and Qur'an and, when he applied for their restitution, was told all the books had been accidentally burnt.{{sfn|Friedman|1983|p=96}}\nThe Israeli occupation has wrought a profound change in Palestinian identity, which clings to a sense of a \"paradise lost\" before the changes brought out by the 1967 conquest.{{sfn|Kamrava|2016|p=116}}{{efn|Israeli settlers forced to evacuate their settlements have also called their prior state as one of a \"lost paradise\".{{sfn|Perugini|2014|p=55}}}}\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in the Palestinian territories}}\nThe Palestinian territories contain several of the most significant sites for Muslims, Christians and Jews, and are endowed with a world-class heritage highly attractive to tourists and pilgrims.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|p=20}} The West Bank Palestinians themselves have difficulties in accessing the territory for recreation.\n\nBased on 1967 figures, the Palestinian [[Dead Sea]] Coastline is roughly 40&nbsp;km in length, of which 15% (6&nbsp;kilometres) could lend itself to the same tourist infrastructure developed by Jordan and Israel in their respective areas. Were Israel to permit a parallel development of this Palestinian sector, the World Bank estimates that 2,900 jobs would be added, allowing the Palestinian economy a potential value-added input of something like $126&nbsp;million annually.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=65\u201366}} It is also the only maritime recreational outlet for West Bankers, but according to an [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel|Acri]] complaint to the Israeli Supreme Court in 2008 Palestinians are often barred or turned away from the beaches at their only access point, the [[Beit HaArava|Beit Ha'arava checkpoint]] on [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Route 90]]. Acri claimed the ban responds to fears by settlers who operate tourist concessions in this West Bank area that they will lose Jewish customers if there are too many West Bank Palestinians on the beaches.{{efn|'The ban came to light after the testimony of two Israeli army reservists who said that at the beginning of their tour of duty in May they were told that the purpose of the checkpoint was to \"prevent Palestinians coming from the Jordan Valley to the Dead Sea beaches\".. One of the reservists, Doron Karbel, testified that as a \"side note\", the Jordan Valley Brigade Commander, Colonel Yigal Slovik, had said the reason for the checkpoint was that \"when Jews and Palestinian vacationers were sitting on the beaches side by side it hurt the business of the surrounding [[yishuv]]im (Jewish communities).\" {{sfn|Macintyre|2008}} }}\nThe key Palestinian towns in the West Bank for tourism are East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho. All access points are controlled by Israel and the road system, checkpoints and obstacles in place for visitors desiring to visit Palestinian towns leaves their hotels half-empty.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=147}} From 92 to 94 cents in every dollar of the tourist trade goes to Israel.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=144}} The general itineraries under Israeli management focus predominantly on Jewish history.

At best drivers must wait for several hours for them to be returned, when, as can happen, the IDs themselves are lost as soldiers change shifts, in which case Palestinians are directed to some regional office the next day, and more checkpoints to get there.{{sfn|Efrat|2006|p=85}} Even before the Al Aqsa Intifada, [[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]] estimated that 20% of pregnant West Bank women were unable to access [[prenatal care]] because of the difficulties and delays caused by crossing checkpoints, and dozens were forced to deliver their children on the roadside.{{sfn|Aswad|2007}}\nConstant uncertainty and the inability to plan are the results for Palestinians of the Israeli military rules governing their movements.  The [[World Bank]] noted that additional costs arising from longer travelling caused by restrictions on movement through three major routes in the West Bank alone ran to (2013) USD 185&nbsp;million a year, adding that other, earlier calculations (2007) suggest restrictions on the Palestinian labour market cost the West Bank approximately US$229&nbsp;million per annum. It concluded that such imposed restrictions had a major negative impact on the local economy, hindering stability and growth.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|p=30}} In 2007, official Israeli statistics indicated that there were 180,000 Palestinians on Israel's secret travel ban list. 561 roadblocks and checkpoints were in place (October), the number of Palestinians licensed to drive private cars was 46,166 and the annual cost of permits was $454.{{sfn|Makdisi|2010|pp=63\u201364}} These checkpoints, together with the separation wall and the restricted networks restructure the West Bank into \"land cells\", freezing the flow of normal everyday Palestinian lives.{{sfn|Handel|2010|pp=259,261}} Israel sets up [[Random checkpoint|flying checkpoints]] without notice. Some 2,941 flying checkpoints were rigged up along West Bank roads, averaging some 327 a month, in 2017. A further 476 unstaffed physical obstacles, such as dirt mounds, concrete blocks, gates and fenced sections had been placed on roads for Palestinian use. Of the gates erected at village entrances, 59 were always closed.{{sfn|B'Tselem|2017b}} The checkpoint system did not ease up after the Oslo Accords, but was strengthened after them, which has been interpreted as suggesting their function is to assert control over Palestinians, and as a sign of an unwillingness to yield ground in the West Bank.{{sfn|Efrat|2006|p=86}} According to [[Health Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|PA Health Ministry statistics]] relating to the period from 2000 to 2006, of 68 Palestinian women who gave birth to their children while held up at checkpoints, 35 miscarried and 5 died while delivering their child there.{{sfn|BBC|2008}} [[Machsom Watch]] accumulated over a mere five years (2001\u20132006)  some 10,000 eyewitness reports and testimonies regarding the innumerable difficulties faced by Palestinians trying to negotiate West Bank checkpoints.{{sfn|Keshet|2013|p=viii}}\n\nTransportation infrastructure is particularly problematic as Palestinian use of roads in Area C is highly restricted, and travel times can be inordinate; the Palestinian Authority has also been unable to develop roads, airports or railways in or through Area C,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/10/18344690/west-bank-gaza-area-c-future-palestinian-economy|title=West Bank and Gaza \u2013 Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy|author=World Bank|website=|publisher=World Bank, Washington DC|accessdate=18 January 2014|year=2013|quote=UNOCHA analysis suggests that less than one percent of the land in Area C is currently available to Palestinians for construction; permit data also shows that it is almost impossible to obtain permission to build in Area C. Less than 6 percent of all requests made between 2000 and 2007 secured approval. This situation applies not only to housing but to public economic infrastructure (roads, water reservoirs, waste treatment plants) and industrial plant, and to the access roads and utility lines needed to connect Areas A and B across Area C. [...] The outbreak of the second Intifada in 2000 interrupted this trend, bringing increased violence and uncertainty \u2013 and most significantly, the intensification by Israel of a complex set of security-related restrictions that impeded the movement of people and goods and fragmented the Palestinian territories into small enclaves lacking economic cohesion.

[...] Neglecting indirect positive effects, we estimate that the potential additional output from the sectors evaluated in this report alone would amount to at least USD 2.2 billion per annum in valued added terms \u2013 a sum equivalent to 23 percent of 2011 Palestinian GDP. The bulk of this would come from agriculture and Dead Sea minerals exploitation. [...] x. Tapping this potential output could dramatically improve the PA's fiscal position. Even without any improvements in the efficiency of tax collection, at the current rate of tax/GDP of 20 percent the additional tax revenues associated with such an increase in GDP would amount to some USD 800 million. Assuming that expenditures remain at the same level, this extra resource would notionally cut the fiscal deficit by half \u2013 significantly reducing the need for donor recurrent budget support. This major improvement in fiscal sustainability would in turn generate significant positive reputational benefits for the PA and would considerably enhance investor confidence. xi. The impact on Palestinian livelihoods would be impressive. An increase in GDP equivalent to 35 percent would be expected to create substantial employment, sufficient to put a significant dent in the currently high rate of unemployment. If an earlier estimated one-to-one relationship between growth and employment was to hold, this increase in GDP would lead to a 35 percent increase in employment. This level of growth in employment would also put a large dent in poverty, as recent estimates show that unemployed Palestinians are twice as likely to be poor as their employed counterparts. |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801210703/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/23/000442464_20140123122135/Rendered/PDF/AUS29220REPLAC0EVISION0January02014.pdf |archivedate= 1 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Water supply===\n{{main|Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories}}\nAmnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources:\n\n{{quote|Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) do not have access to adequate, safe water supplies...Discriminatory Israeli policies in the OPT are the root cause of the striking disparity in access to water between Palestinians and Israelis...The inequality is even more pronounced between Palestinian communities and unlawful Israeli settlements, established in the OPT in violation of international law.

The military authorities do not render public the details of these operations.

Israel at times insisted its approval was conditional on linking the grid to Israeli settlements, which neither the donors nor Palestinians accepted. Most the infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by IDF military operations.{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.11}} The PA did raise funds from Germany for 15 plants, but only managed to build one, at [[al-Bireh]], within Area B, though even there Israel insisted the plant process waste from the settlement of [[Psagot]], though refusing to pay fees for the treatment.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19\u201321}} Palestinian towns like [[Salfit]] have been deeply affected by sewage overflow channeled past the town from the settlement of Ariel.{{sfn|Ashly|2017}}{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.14}}\n\nUnlike the data available for sewage treatment within Israel, the Israeli Water Commission refuses to provide public reports on 15&nbsp;million cubic metres of sewage flowing from Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

The World Bank estimates that Israel's virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241&nbsp;million per year.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}}\nIn International law drawing on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] (Article 55), it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets, and that the [[usufruct]] must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority. Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell 94% of their material to Israel, which arguably constitutes \"depletion\" and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Thus the German [[HeidelbergCement|cement firm quarrying at Nahal Raba]] paid out \u20ac430,000 ($479,000) in taxes to the [[Samaria Regional Council]] in 2014 alone.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} The Israeli High Court rejected a petition that such quarrying was a violation by stating that after 4 decades Israeli law must adapt to \"the realities on the ground\". The state did undertake not to open more quarries.{{sfn|Gross|2011}} As an illustrative example, a Human Rights Watch report contrasts the difference between a Palestinian-owned quarry company in [[Beit Fajar]] and that of a European one working on what Israeli considers its state land. The European company obtained a concession and license to harvest stone, whereas Israel refuses permits for most of the roughly 40 Beit Fajar quarries, or nearly any other Palestinian-owned quarry in the West Bank under Israeli administration.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}\n\nIsrael had denied Palestinians permits to process minerals in that area of the West Bank.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} The products of the Israeli cosmetics firm [[Ahava]], established in 1988, were developed in laboratories at the West Bank Dead Sea settlements of [[Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Kalya]]. 60% of their production is sold in the EU market.{{sfn|Nicoletti|Hearne|2012|pp=21\u201322}} In 2018 The UN, stating that the violations were both \"pervasive and devastating\" to the local Palestinian population, identified some 206 companies which do business with Israeli settlements in the West Bank.{{sfn|Nebehay|2018}}\nRoughly 73 percent of global [[bromine]] production comes from Israeli and Jordanian exploitation of the Dead Sea. The potential incremental value that could accrue to the Palestinian economy from the production and sales of [[potash]], bromine and magnesium has been conservatively estimated at US$918&nbsp;million per annum, or 9 percent of GDP.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Beckouche|2017|p=156}} The lost earnings from not being allowed to process Dead Sea minerals such as potash, and for making bromide-based flame retardants, based on calculations of comparable use by Israel and Jordan, suggest a figure of $642&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=58\u201360}}\n\n===Loss of cultural property===\nAlbert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony, by confiscating Arab cultural resources. In 1967 it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum{{efn|\"The one center of archaeological activity that might have provided a base for Palestinian archaeologists was the Palestine Archaeological Museum in Jerusalem, which was under the control not of Jordan but of trustees made up of the directors of the several foreign schools of archaeology in the city. It is therefore not clear why persons like [[Dimitri Baramki]] did not continue their work as archaeologists employed by the Palestine Museum. In any event, Jordan nationalized the museum only months before the June 1967 war, enabling the Israelis to claim it as theirs by right of conquest,\"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=77}}}} and its library in East Jerusalem.{{efn|\"Fourth, the disappearance of the Palestinian patrimony (material evidence) through the deliberate confiscation of Arab cultural resources by Israelis (such as the large library of Dr. [[Tawfiq Canaan]] in 1948, the [[Rockefeller Museum|Palestine Archaeological Museum]] and its library in Jerusalem in 1967, and the library of the Palestine Research Center in Beirut in 1982), as well as the destruction of cultural property in the form of entire villages in 1948\u201349. This last is particularly crucial, since the Palestinians' link to their past is largely through the villages, few towns, and fewer cities that predominated in their land during the last thirteen centuries.\"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=71}}}} Often these losses are personal, as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables.

Were Israel to permit a parallel development of this Palestinian sector, the World Bank estimates that 2,900 jobs would be added, allowing the Palestinian economy a potential value-added input of something like $126&nbsp;million annually.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=65\u201366}} It is also the only maritime recreational outlet for West Bankers, but according to an [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel|Acri]] complaint to the Israeli Supreme Court in 2008 Palestinians are often barred or turned away from the beaches at their only access point, the [[Beit HaArava|Beit Ha'arava checkpoint]] on [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Route 90]]. Acri claimed the ban responds to fears by settlers who operate tourist concessions in this West Bank area that they will lose Jewish customers if there are too many West Bank Palestinians on the beaches.{{efn|'The ban came to light after the testimony of two Israeli army reservists who said that at the beginning of their tour of duty in May they were told that the purpose of the checkpoint was to \"prevent Palestinians coming from the Jordan Valley to the Dead Sea beaches\".. One of the reservists, Doron Karbel, testified that as a \"side note\", the Jordan Valley Brigade Commander, Colonel Yigal Slovik, had said the reason for the checkpoint was that \"when Jews and Palestinian vacationers were sitting on the beaches side by side it hurt the business of the surrounding [[yishuv]]im (Jewish communities).\" {{sfn|Macintyre|2008}} }}\nThe key Palestinian towns in the West Bank for tourism are East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho.

Less than 6 percent of all requests made between 2000 and 2007 secured approval. This situation applies not only to housing but to public economic infrastructure (roads, water reservoirs, waste treatment plants) and industrial plant, and to the access roads and utility lines needed to connect Areas A and B across Area C. [...] The outbreak of the second Intifada in 2000 interrupted this trend, bringing increased violence and uncertainty \u2013 and most significantly, the intensification by Israel of a complex set of security-related restrictions that impeded the movement of people and goods and fragmented the Palestinian territories into small enclaves lacking economic cohesion.

It is the only English speaking country in South America, and is culturally considered part of the [[British West Indies|Anglophone-Caribbean]] sphere. In addition, it is one of the founding member countries of the [[Caribbean Community]] organization (CARICOM). Guyana is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the north, [[Brazil]] to the south and southwest, [[Venezuela]] to the west, and [[Suriname]] to the east. With an area of {{convert|215000|sqkm|sqmi}}, Guyana is the third-smallest [[sovereign state]] on mainland South America after [[Uruguay]] and [[Suriname]].\n\nThe region known as \"[[the Guianas]]\" consists of the [[Guiana Shield|large shield landmass]] north of the [[Amazon River]] and east of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] known as the \"land of many waters\". Major rivers in Guyana include the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]], the [[Berbice River|Berbice]], and the [[Demerara River|Demerara]].  Originally inhabited by many indigenous groups, Guyana was settled by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] before coming under [[British Empire|British control]] in the late 18th century. It was governed as [[British Guiana]], with a mostly plantation-style economy until the 1950s. It gained independence in 1966, and officially became a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1970. The legacy of British rule is reflected in the country's political administration and diverse population, which includes [[Indo-Guyanese|Indian]], African, Amerindian, and multiracial groups.\n\nGuyana is the only South American nation in which English is the official language. The majority of the population, however, speak [[Guyanese Creole]], an [[English-based creole language]], as a first language. Guyana is considered part of the [[Anglophone Caribbean]]. CARICOM, of which Guyana is a member, is [[Secretariat (administrative office)|headquartered]] in Guyana's capital and largest city, [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]]. In 2008, the country joined the [[Union of South American Nations]] as a founding member.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Guyana\" derives from ''Guiana'', the original name for the region that formerly included Guyana ([[British Guiana]]), [[Suriname]] ([[Dutch colonization of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]]), [[French Guiana]] , and parts of [[Colombia]], Venezuela and Brazil. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Guyana\" comes from an indigenous Amerindian language and means \"Land of Many Waters\".<ref>\n{{cite web | url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Guyana | title= Guyana | publisher= Oxford Dictionaries | accessdate= 9 May 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150707214123/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Guyana | archive-date= 7 July 2015 | url-status=live | df= dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Guyana}}\n[[File:LocationNetherlandsGuiana.png|thumb|left|A map of Dutch Guiana 1667\u20131814]]\n\nThere are nine [[Indigenous peoples in Guyana|indigenous]] tribes residing in Guyana: the [[Wai-wai people|Wai Wai]], [[Macushi people|Macushi]], [[Patamona people|Patamona]], [[Lokono]], [[Kalina people|Kalina]], [[Wapishana people|Wapishana]], [[Pemon people|Pemon]], [[Akawaio people|Akawaio]] and [[Warao people|Warao]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html |title=Ministry of Amerindian Affairs \u2013 Georgetown, Guyana |publisher=Amerindian.gov.gy |accessdate=30 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602173603/http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html |archivedate=2 June 2013  }}</ref> Historically, the Lokono and Kalina tribes dominated Guyana. Although [[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight Guyana during his third voyage (in 1498), and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] wrote an account in 1596, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to establish colonies: [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] (1616), [[Berbice]] (1627), and [[Demerara]] (1752).

In 1831 the three separate colonies became a single British colony known as [[British Guiana]].\n\n[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|Map of [[British Guiana]] from 1896]]\nSince its independence in 1824, Venezuela has claimed the area of land to the west of the [[Essequibo River]]. [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of Spanish claims on the area dating to the sixteenth century, claimed was theirs. In 1899 an international tribunal ruled the land belonged to Great Britain.<ref>https://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXVIII/331-340.pdf</ref> The British territorial claim stemmed from Dutch involvement and colonization of the area also dating to the sixteenth century, which was ceded to the British.\n\nGuyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom as a dominion on 26 May 1966 and became a republic on 23 February 1970, remaining a member of the Commonwealth. The [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] and the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), along with the British government, played a strong role in influencing political control in Guyana during this time.<ref>[http://www.guyana.org/govt/US-declassifed-documents-1964-1968.html US Declassified Documents (1964\u20131968)]. guyana.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212125256/http://www.guyana.org/govt/US-declassifed-documents-1964-1968.html |date=12 February 2007 }}</ref> The American government supported [[Forbes Burnham]] during the early years of independence because [[Cheddi Jagan]] was identified as a [[Marxist]]. They provided secret financial support and political campaign advice to Burnham's [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]], to the detriment of the Jagan-led [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]], which was mostly supported by Guyanese of East Indian background.\n\nIn 1974, the Guyana government leased 3,800 acres of land to [[Peoples Temple]], an American new religious movement, led by pastor [[Jim Jones]]. The settlement, informally called \"[[Jonestown]]\", eventually grew to a population of about 1,000 people, mostly emigrated from the United States. In 1978, Guyana received worldwide attention when 909 people died in a mass murder/suicide in Jonestown by drinking cyanide-laced [[Flavor Aid]]. A day prior, U.S. congressman [[Leo Ryan]] had visited and toured the settlement as part of an investigation. As he was preparing to leave at the [[Port Kaituma]] airstrip, a group of Peoples Temple members pulled up and opened fire on the visiting delegation, killing Ryan and four other people.\n\nIn May 2008, President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the Union of South American Nations. The Guyanese government officially ratified the treaty in 2010.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Guyana}}\n[[File:Rupununi Savannah.jpg|thumb|[[Rupununi Savannah]]]]\n\nThe territory controlled by Guyana lies between latitudes [[1st parallel north|1\u00b0]] and [[9th parallel north|9\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[56th meridian west|56\u00b0]] and [[62nd meridian west|62\u00b0W]], and one of the world's most sparsely populated countries.\n\nThe country can be divided into five natural regions; a narrow and fertile marshy plain along the Atlantic coast (low coastal plain) where most of the population lives; a white sand belt more inland (hilly sand and clay region), containing most of Guyana's mineral deposits; the dense [[rain forest]]s (Forested Highland Region) in the southern part of the country; the drier [[savannah]] areas in the south-west; and the smallest interior lowlands (interior savannah) consisting mostly of mountains that gradually rise to the Brazilian border.\n\nSome of Guyana's highest mountains are [[Mount Ayanganna]] ({{convert|2042|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), [[Monte Cabura\u00ed]] ({{convert|1465|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) and [[Mount Roraima]] ({{convert|2772|m|ft|0|disp=or}} \u2013 the highest mountain in Guyana) on the Brazil-Guyana-Venezuela [[tripoint]] border, part of the [[Pakaraima]] range. Mount Roraima and Guyana's table-top mountains ([[tepui]]s) are said to have been the inspiration for [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 novel ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]''. There are also many volcanic [[escarpment]]s and waterfalls, including [[Kaieteur Falls]] which is believed to be the largest single-drop waterfall in the world.<ref name=independent>{{cite news|title= South America: Do the continental: The best of what's new; spectacular waterfalls, forgotten cities, pre-Inca trails |work = The Independent |date=14 November 2004 |page = Features, page 3 |first = Mark |last = Rowe }}</ref> North of the [[Rupununi River]] lies the [[Rupununi savannah]], south of which lie the [[Kanuku Mountains]].\n\nThe four longest rivers are the Essequibo at {{convert|1010|km|mi|0}} long, the [[Courentyne River]] at {{convert|724|km|mi|0}}, the [[Berbice River|Berbice]] at {{convert|595|km|mi|0}}, and the [[Demerara River|Demerara]] at {{convert|346|km|mi|0}}. The Courentyne river forms the border with Suriname. At the mouth of the Essequibo are several large islands, including the {{convert|145|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide [[Shell Beach, Guyana|Shell Beach]] along the northwest coast, which is also a major breeding area for [[sea turtle]]s (mainly [[leatherback sea turtle|leatherbacks]]) and other wildlife.\n\nThe local climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and generally hot and humid, though moderated by northeast [[trade winds]] along the coast. There are two rainy seasons, the first from May to mid-August, the second from mid-November to mid-January.\n\nGuyana has one of the largest unspoiled [[rainforest]]s in South America, some parts of which are almost inaccessible by humans. The rich natural history of Guyana was described by early explorers [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Charles Waterton]] and later by naturalists Sir [[David Attenborough]] and [[Gerald Durrell]]. In 2008, the [[BBC]] broadcast a three-part programme called ''Lost Land of the Jaguar'' which highlighted the huge diversity of wildlife, including undiscovered species and rare species such as the [[giant otter]] and [[harpy eagle]].\n\nIn 2012, Guyana received a $45 million reward from Norway for its rainforest protection efforts. This stems from a 2009 agreement between the nations for a total of $250 million for protecting and maintaining the natural habitat.

Venezuela did not agree with this as it claimed all lands west of the Essequibo River.

After an exchange of gunfire, the [[Surinamese]] were driven from the triangle.\n\n=== Environment and biodiversity ===\n{{See also|Category:Flora of Guyana|Category:Fauna of Guyana|Category:Orchids_of_Guyana}}\n[[File:Guyana BMNG.png|thumb|upright|Satellite image of Guyana from 2004]]\n[[File:Golden frog Kaieteur (2).jpg|thumb|''[[Anomaloglossus beebei]]'' (Kaieteur), specific to the Guianas]]\n[[File:Rurrenabaque Bolivia - The Amazon.jpg|thumb|The [[hoatzin]] is the national bird of Guyana.]]\n\nThe following habitats have been categorised for Guyana: coastal, marine, littoral, estuarine palustrine, mangrove, riverine, lacustrine, swamp, savanna, white sand forest, brown sand forest, montane, cloud forest, moist lowland and dry evergreen scrub forests (NBAP, 1999). About 14 areas of biological interest have been identified as possible hotspots for a National Protected Area System.\nMore than 80% of Guyana is still covered by forests, those forest also contains the world's rarest [[orchids]] ranging from dry evergreen and seasonal forests to montane and lowland evergreen rain forests. These forests are home to more than a thousand species of trees. Guyana's tropical climate, unique geology, and relatively pristine ecosystems support extensive areas of species-rich rain forests and natural habitats with high levels of [[endemism]]. Approximately eight thousand species of plants occur in Guyana, half of which are found nowhere else.\n\nGuyana has one of the highest levels of [[biodiversity]] in the world. With 1,168 [[vertebrate]] species and 814 bird species, it boasts one of the richest mammalian fauna assemblages of any comparably sized area in the world. The Guiana Shield region is little known and extremely rich biologically. Unlike other areas of South America, over 70% of the natural habitat remains pristine.\n\nThe rich natural history of British Guiana was described by early explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Charles Waterton and later by naturalists Sir David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell.\n\nIn February 2004, the Government of Guyana issued a title to more than {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}} of land in the Konashen Indigenous District declaring this land as the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area (COCA), to be managed by the [[Wai-Wai (people)|Wai Wai]]. In doing so Guyana created the world's largest Community-Owned Conservation Area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.org/Documents/CI_Konashen_COCA_Biodiversity_Booklet.pdf |title=Biodiversity in the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area, Guyana |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206142519/http://www.conservation.org/Documents/CI_Konashen_COCA_Biodiversity_Booklet.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThis important event followed a request made by the Wai Wai community to the government of Guyana and Conservation International Guyana (CIG) for assistance in developing a sustainable plan for their lands in Konashen. The three parties signed a Memorandum of Cooperation which outlines a plan for sustainable use of the Konashen COCA's biological resources, identifies threats to the area's biodiversity, and helps develop projects to increase awareness of the COCA as well as generate the income necessary to maintain its protected status.\n\nThe Konashen Indigenous District of Southern Guyana houses the headwaters of the Essequibo River, Guyana's principal water source, and drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. Southern Guyana is host to some of the most pristine expanses of evergreen forests in the northern part of South America. Most of the forests found here are tall, evergreen hill-land and lower montane forests, with large expanses of flooded forest along major rivers. Thanks to the very low human population density of the area, most of these forests are still intact. The Smithsonian Institution has identified nearly 2,700 species of plants from this region, representing 239 distinct families, and there are certainly additional species still to be recorded.\n\nThe diversity of plants supports diverse animal life, recently documented by a biological survey organised by Conservation International. The reportedly clean, unpolluted waters of the Essequibo watershed support a remarkable diversity of fish and aquatic invertebrates, and are home to [[giant otters]], [[capybaras]], and several species of [[caimans]].\n\nOn land, large mammals, such as [[jaguar]]s, [[tapirs]], [[bush dog]]s, [[giant anteater]]s, and [[saki monkey]]s are still common. Over 400 species of birds have been reported from the region, and the reptile and amphibian faunas are similarly rich. The Konashen COCA forests are also home to countless species of insects, arachnids, and other invertebrates, many of which are still undiscovered or unnamed.\n\nThe Konashen COCA contains a high level of biological diversity and richness that remains in nearly pristine condition; such places have become rare on earth. This fact has given rise to various non-exploitative, environmentally sustainable industries such as ecotourism, successfully capitalising on the biological wealth of the Konashen COCA with comparatively little enduring impact.\n\n=== World Heritage sites ===\n{{unsourced |section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:GuyanaKaieteurFalls2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kaieteur Falls]] is the world's largest single-drop waterfall by volume.]]\n\nGuyana signed the [[Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage#Convention and background|Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage]] treaty in 1977, the first South American country to do so. In the mid-1990s, Guyana began the process of selecting sites for World Heritage nomination, and three sites were considered: [[Kaieteur National Park]], Shell Beach and Historic Georgetown. By 1997, work on Kaieteur National Park was started, and in 1998 work on Historic Georgetown was begun. To date, however, Guyana has not made a successful nomination.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuyana submitted the Kaieteur National Park, including the [[Kaieteur Falls]], to UNESCO as its first World Heritage Site nomination. The proposed area and surrounds have some of Guyana's most diversified life zones with one of the highest levels of [[endemic]] species found in South America. The Kaieteur Falls are the most spectacular feature of the park, falling a distance of 226&nbsp;metres. The nomination of Kaieteur National Park as a World Heritage Site was not successful, primarily because the area was seen by the evaluators as being too small, especially when compared with the Central Suriname Nature Reserve that had just been nominated as a World Heritage Site (2000). The dossier was thus returned to Guyana for revision.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuyana continues in its bid for a World Heritage Site. Work continues, after a period of hiatus, on the nomination dossier for Historic Georgetown. A tentative list indicating an intention to nominate Historic Georgetown was submitted to UNESCO in December 2004. In April 2005, two Dutch experts in conservation spent two weeks in Georgetown supervising architecture staff and students of the [[University of Guyana]] in a historic building survey of the selected area. This is part of the data collection for the nomination dossier.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the Kaieteur National Park being considered too small, there is a proposal to prepare a nomination for a Cluster Site that will include the Kaieteur National Park, the [[Iwokrama Forest]] and the Kanuku Mountains. The Iwokrama rain forest, an area rich in biological diversity, has been described by Major General (Retired) Joseph Singh as \"a flagship project for conservation.\" The Kanuku Mountains area is in a pristine state and is home to more than four hundred species of birds and other animals. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuyana holds two of the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[Global 200]] eco-regions,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} the Guianan and [[Guiana Highlands]] moist forests. It is also home to several endemic species including the [[Chlorocardium|greenheart]] tree.\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n[[File:St georges.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St George's Cathedral, Georgetown]]]]\n\n* St George's Anglican Cathedral: A historic Anglican Cathedral made of wood.\n* [[Demerara Harbour Bridge]]: The world's fourth-longest floating bridge.\n* [[Berbice Bridge]]: The world's sixth-longest floating bridge.\n* [[Secretariat of the Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Building]]: Houses the headquarters of the largest and most powerful economic union in the Caribbean.\n* [[Providence Stadium]]: Situated on Providence on the north bank of the Demerara River and built in time for the ICC World Cup 2007, it is the largest sports stadium in the country.

The sugar industry, which accounts for 28% of all export earnings, is largely run by the company [[GuySuCo]], which employs more people than any other industry. Many industries have a large foreign investment. For example, the American company [[Reynolds Metals]] and the British-Australian [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto's]] Rio Tinto Alcan subsidiary are heavily invested in Guyana's mineral industry; the Korean/Malaysian Barama Company has a large stake in the logging industry. Since 2015, foreign companies have made several significant deep water [[Petroleum exploration in Guyana|oil discoveries]].\n\nChronic problems include a shortage of skilled [[labour (economics)|labour]], deficient infrastructure, and until recently, sizable external debt. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities, combined with troubles in the bauxite and sugar industries, had threatened the government's tenuous fiscal position and dimmed prospects for the future. However, the Guyanese economy has rebounded slightly and exhibited moderate economic growth since 1999, thanks to an expansion in the agricultural and mining sectors, a more favourable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support of international organisations. In 2008, the economy witnessed a 3% increase in growth amid the global [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|economic crisis]]. It grew 5.4% in 2011 and 3.7% in 2012.\n\nThe production of [[balat\u00e1]] (natural [[latex]]) was once big business in Guyana. Most of the balata bleeding in Guyana took place in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains in the Rupununi. Early exploitation also took place in the North West District, but most of the trees in the area were destroyed by illicit bleeding methods that involved cutting down the trees rather than making incisions in them. Uses of balat\u00e1 included the making of [[cricket]] balls, the temporary filling of troublesome tooth cavities, and the crafting of figurines and other decorative items (particularly by the Macushi people of the Kanuku mountains).\n\nMajor [[private sector]] organisations include the Private Sector Commission (PSC)<ref>{{cite web |author=RedSpider, Romona Khan |url=http://www.psc.org.gy |title=Private Sector Commission |publisher=Psc.org.gy |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628041741/http://www.psc.org.gy/ |archive-date=28 June 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> and the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgetownchamberofcommerce.org |title=Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) |publisher=Georgetownchamberofcommerce.org |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217153022/http://www.georgetownchamberofcommerce.org/ |archivedate=17 December 2010  }}</ref>\n\nThe government initiated a major overhaul of the tax code in early 2007. A [[Value Added Tax]] (VAT) replaced six different taxes. Prior to the implementation of the VAT, it had been relatively easy to evade sales tax, and many businesses were in violation of tax code. Many businesses opposed VAT introduction because of the extra paperwork required; however, the Government has remained firm on the VAT. By replacing several taxes with one flat tax rate, it will also be easier for government auditors to spot [[embezzlement]]. This was prevalent under the former PPP/C government who authorised the VAT to be equal to 50% of the value of the good.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nPresident Bharrat Jagdeo had made [[debt relief]] a priority. He convinced the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank Group|the World Bank]] and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) to write off US$800&nbsp;million of debt, and millions more owed to industrial nations.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the President and the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the President and the [[National Assembly of Guyana]]. Historically, politics are a source of tension in the country, and violent riots have often broken out during elections. During the 1970s and 1980s, the political landscape was dominated by the People's National Congress.\n\nIn 1992, the first \"free and fair\" elections were overseen by former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]], and the People's Progressive Party led the country until 2015. The two parties are principally organised along ethnic lines and as a result often clash on issues related to the allocation of resources. In the General Elections held on 28 November 2011, the People's Progressive Party (PPP) retained a majority, and their presidential candidate [[Donald Ramotar]] was elected as President.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, early general elections were held. A coalition of the A Partnership for National Unity-Alliance for Change (APNU-AFC) parties won 33 of the 65 seats in the National Assembly. On 16 May 2015, retired army general [[David A. Granger]] became the eighth President of Guyana. However, on 21 December 2018, a vote of confidence was called for, regarding terms under which the government granted a franchise for offshore oil exploration. Legislator Charrandass Persaud defected from the coalition and the vote failed, requiring new elections.

With an area of {{convert|215000|sqkm|sqmi}}, Guyana is the third-smallest [[sovereign state]] on mainland South America after [[Uruguay]] and [[Suriname]].\n\nThe region known as \"[[the Guianas]]\" consists of the [[Guiana Shield|large shield landmass]] north of the [[Amazon River]] and east of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] known as the \"land of many waters\". Major rivers in Guyana include the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]], the [[Berbice River|Berbice]], and the [[Demerara River|Demerara]].  Originally inhabited by many indigenous groups, Guyana was settled by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] before coming under [[British Empire|British control]] in the late 18th century. It was governed as [[British Guiana]], with a mostly plantation-style economy until the 1950s. It gained independence in 1966, and officially became a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1970. The legacy of British rule is reflected in the country's political administration and diverse population, which includes [[Indo-Guyanese|Indian]], African, Amerindian, and multiracial groups.\n\nGuyana is the only South American nation in which English is the official language. The majority of the population, however, speak [[Guyanese Creole]], an [[English-based creole language]], as a first language. Guyana is considered part of the [[Anglophone Caribbean]]. CARICOM, of which Guyana is a member, is [[Secretariat (administrative office)|headquartered]] in Guyana's capital and largest city, [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]]. In 2008, the country joined the [[Union of South American Nations]] as a founding member.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Guyana\" derives from ''Guiana'', the original name for the region that formerly included Guyana ([[British Guiana]]), [[Suriname]] ([[Dutch colonization of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]]), [[French Guiana]] , and parts of [[Colombia]], Venezuela and Brazil. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Guyana\" comes from an indigenous Amerindian language and means \"Land of Many Waters\".<ref>\n{{cite web | url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Guyana | title= Guyana | publisher= Oxford Dictionaries | accessdate= 9 May 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150707214123/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Guyana | archive-date= 7 July 2015 | url-status=live | df= dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Guyana}}\n[[File:LocationNetherlandsGuiana.png|thumb|left|A map of Dutch Guiana 1667\u20131814]]\n\nThere are nine [[Indigenous peoples in Guyana|indigenous]] tribes residing in Guyana: the [[Wai-wai people|Wai Wai]], [[Macushi people|Macushi]], [[Patamona people|Patamona]], [[Lokono]], [[Kalina people|Kalina]], [[Wapishana people|Wapishana]], [[Pemon people|Pemon]], [[Akawaio people|Akawaio]] and [[Warao people|Warao]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html |title=Ministry of Amerindian Affairs \u2013 Georgetown, Guyana |publisher=Amerindian.gov.gy |accessdate=30 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602173603/http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html |archivedate=2 June 2013  }}</ref> Historically, the Lokono and Kalina tribes dominated Guyana.

[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of Spanish claims on the area dating to the sixteenth century, claimed was theirs. In 1899 an international tribunal ruled the land belonged to Great Britain.<ref>https://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXVIII/331-340.pdf</ref> The British territorial claim stemmed from Dutch involvement and colonization of the area also dating to the sixteenth century, which was ceded to the British.\n\nGuyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom as a dominion on 26 May 1966 and became a republic on 23 February 1970, remaining a member of the Commonwealth. The [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] and the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), along with the British government, played a strong role in influencing political control in Guyana during this time.<ref>[http://www.guyana.org/govt/US-declassifed-documents-1964-1968.html US Declassified Documents (1964\u20131968)]. guyana.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212125256/http://www.guyana.org/govt/US-declassifed-documents-1964-1968.html |date=12 February 2007 }}</ref> The American government supported [[Forbes Burnham]] during the early years of independence because [[Cheddi Jagan]] was identified as a [[Marxist]].

The settlement, informally called \"[[Jonestown]]\", eventually grew to a population of about 1,000 people, mostly emigrated from the United States. In 1978, Guyana received worldwide attention when 909 people died in a mass murder/suicide in Jonestown by drinking cyanide-laced [[Flavor Aid]]. A day prior, U.S. congressman [[Leo Ryan]] had visited and toured the settlement as part of an investigation. As he was preparing to leave at the [[Port Kaituma]] airstrip, a group of Peoples Temple members pulled up and opened fire on the visiting delegation, killing Ryan and four other people.\n\nIn May 2008, President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the Union of South American Nations. The Guyanese government officially ratified the treaty in 2010.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Guyana}}\n[[File:Rupununi Savannah.jpg|thumb|[[Rupununi Savannah]]]]\n\nThe territory controlled by Guyana lies between latitudes [[1st parallel north|1\u00b0]] and [[9th parallel north|9\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[56th meridian west|56\u00b0]] and [[62nd meridian west|62\u00b0W]], and one of the world's most sparsely populated countries.\n\nThe country can be divided into five natural regions; a narrow and fertile marshy plain along the Atlantic coast (low coastal plain) where most of the population lives; a white sand belt more inland (hilly sand and clay region), containing most of Guyana's mineral deposits; the dense [[rain forest]]s (Forested Highland Region) in the southern part of the country; the drier [[savannah]] areas in the south-west; and the smallest interior lowlands (interior savannah) consisting mostly of mountains that gradually rise to the Brazilian border.\n\nSome of Guyana's highest mountains are [[Mount Ayanganna]] ({{convert|2042|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), [[Monte Cabura\u00ed]] ({{convert|1465|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) and [[Mount Roraima]] ({{convert|2772|m|ft|0|disp=or}} \u2013 the highest mountain in Guyana) on the Brazil-Guyana-Venezuela [[tripoint]] border, part of the [[Pakaraima]] range. Mount Roraima and Guyana's table-top mountains ([[tepui]]s) are said to have been the inspiration for [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 novel ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]''. There are also many volcanic [[escarpment]]s and waterfalls, including [[Kaieteur Falls]] which is believed to be the largest single-drop waterfall in the world.<ref name=independent>{{cite news|title= South America: Do the continental: The best of what's new; spectacular waterfalls, forgotten cities, pre-Inca trails |work = The Independent |date=14 November 2004 |page = Features, page 3 |first = Mark |last = Rowe }}</ref> North of the [[Rupununi River]] lies the [[Rupununi savannah]], south of which lie the [[Kanuku Mountains]].\n\nThe four longest rivers are the Essequibo at {{convert|1010|km|mi|0}} long, the [[Courentyne River]] at {{convert|724|km|mi|0}}, the [[Berbice River|Berbice]] at {{convert|595|km|mi|0}}, and the [[Demerara River|Demerara]] at {{convert|346|km|mi|0}}. The Courentyne river forms the border with Suriname. At the mouth of the Essequibo are several large islands, including the {{convert|145|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide [[Shell Beach, Guyana|Shell Beach]] along the northwest coast, which is also a major breeding area for [[sea turtle]]s (mainly [[leatherback sea turtle|leatherbacks]]) and other wildlife.\n\nThe local climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and generally hot and humid, though moderated by northeast [[trade winds]] along the coast. There are two rainy seasons, the first from May to mid-August, the second from mid-November to mid-January.\n\nGuyana has one of the largest unspoiled [[rainforest]]s in South America, some parts of which are almost inaccessible by humans. The rich natural history of Guyana was described by early explorers [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Charles Waterton]] and later by naturalists Sir [[David Attenborough]] and [[Gerald Durrell]]. In 2008, the [[BBC]] broadcast a three-part programme called ''Lost Land of the Jaguar'' which highlighted the huge diversity of wildlife, including undiscovered species and rare species such as the [[giant otter]] and [[harpy eagle]].\n\nIn 2012, Guyana received a $45 million reward from Norway for its rainforest protection efforts. This stems from a 2009 agreement between the nations for a total of $250 million for protecting and maintaining the natural habitat. Thus far, the country has received $115 million of the total grant.\n\n=== Regions and Neighbourhood Councils === <!--Linked from [[Administrative divisions of Guyana]]-->\n{{Main|Regions of Guyana|Neighbourhood Councils of Guyana}}\nGuyana is divided into 10 regions:<ref>[http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/Chapter3_Population_Redistribution_Internal_Migration.pdf Bureau of Statistics \u2013 Guyana] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANd8NvxO?url=http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/Chapter3_Population_Redistribution_Internal_Migration.pdf |date=2 September 2012 }}, CHAPTER III: POPULATION REDISTRIBUTION AND INTERNAL MIGRATION, Table 3.4: Population Density, Guyana: 1980\u20132002</ref><ref>[http://gina.gov.gy/natprofile/gnprof.html Guyana \u2013 Government Information Agency], National Profile. gina.gov.gy {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814020614/http://gina.gov.gy/natprofile/gnprof.html |date=14 August 2007 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|- style=\"background:#bbb;\"\n!

About 14 areas of biological interest have been identified as possible hotspots for a National Protected Area System.\nMore than 80% of Guyana is still covered by forests, those forest also contains the world's rarest [[orchids]] ranging from dry evergreen and seasonal forests to montane and lowland evergreen rain forests. These forests are home to more than a thousand species of trees. Guyana's tropical climate, unique geology, and relatively pristine ecosystems support extensive areas of species-rich rain forests and natural habitats with high levels of [[endemism]]. Approximately eight thousand species of plants occur in Guyana, half of which are found nowhere else.\n\nGuyana has one of the highest levels of [[biodiversity]] in the world. With 1,168 [[vertebrate]] species and 814 bird species, it boasts one of the richest mammalian fauna assemblages of any comparably sized area in the world. The Guiana Shield region is little known and extremely rich biologically. Unlike other areas of South America, over 70% of the natural habitat remains pristine.\n\nThe rich natural history of British Guiana was described by early explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Charles Waterton and later by naturalists Sir David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell.\n\nIn February 2004, the Government of Guyana issued a title to more than {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}} of land in the Konashen Indigenous District declaring this land as the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area (COCA), to be managed by the [[Wai-Wai (people)|Wai Wai]]. In doing so Guyana created the world's largest Community-Owned Conservation Area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.org/Documents/CI_Konashen_COCA_Biodiversity_Booklet.pdf |title=Biodiversity in the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area, Guyana |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206142519/http://www.conservation.org/Documents/CI_Konashen_COCA_Biodiversity_Booklet.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThis important event followed a request made by the Wai Wai community to the government of Guyana and Conservation International Guyana (CIG) for assistance in developing a sustainable plan for their lands in Konashen. The three parties signed a Memorandum of Cooperation which outlines a plan for sustainable use of the Konashen COCA's biological resources, identifies threats to the area's biodiversity, and helps develop projects to increase awareness of the COCA as well as generate the income necessary to maintain its protected status.\n\nThe Konashen Indigenous District of Southern Guyana houses the headwaters of the Essequibo River, Guyana's principal water source, and drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. Southern Guyana is host to some of the most pristine expanses of evergreen forests in the northern part of South America. Most of the forests found here are tall, evergreen hill-land and lower montane forests, with large expanses of flooded forest along major rivers. Thanks to the very low human population density of the area, most of these forests are still intact. The Smithsonian Institution has identified nearly 2,700 species of plants from this region, representing 239 distinct families, and there are certainly additional species still to be recorded.\n\nThe diversity of plants supports diverse animal life, recently documented by a biological survey organised by Conservation International. The reportedly clean, unpolluted waters of the Essequibo watershed support a remarkable diversity of fish and aquatic invertebrates, and are home to [[giant otters]], [[capybaras]], and several species of [[caimans]].\n\nOn land, large mammals, such as [[jaguar]]s, [[tapirs]], [[bush dog]]s, [[giant anteater]]s, and [[saki monkey]]s are still common. Over 400 species of birds have been reported from the region, and the reptile and amphibian faunas are similarly rich. The Konashen COCA forests are also home to countless species of insects, arachnids, and other invertebrates, many of which are still undiscovered or unnamed.\n\nThe Konashen COCA contains a high level of biological diversity and richness that remains in nearly pristine condition; such places have become rare on earth. This fact has given rise to various non-exploitative, environmentally sustainable industries such as ecotourism, successfully capitalising on the biological wealth of the Konashen COCA with comparatively little enduring impact.\n\n=== World Heritage sites ===\n{{unsourced |section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:GuyanaKaieteurFalls2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kaieteur Falls]] is the world's largest single-drop waterfall by volume.]]\n\nGuyana signed the [[Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage#Convention and background|Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage]] treaty in 1977, the first South American country to do so. In the mid-1990s, Guyana began the process of selecting sites for World Heritage nomination, and three sites were considered: [[Kaieteur National Park]], Shell Beach and Historic Georgetown. By 1997, work on Kaieteur National Park was started, and in 1998 work on Historic Georgetown was begun. To date, however, Guyana has not made a successful nomination.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuyana submitted the Kaieteur National Park, including the [[Kaieteur Falls]], to UNESCO as its first World Heritage Site nomination. The proposed area and surrounds have some of Guyana's most diversified life zones with one of the highest levels of [[endemic]] species found in South America. The Kaieteur Falls are the most spectacular feature of the park, falling a distance of 226&nbsp;metres. The nomination of Kaieteur National Park as a World Heritage Site was not successful, primarily because the area was seen by the evaluators as being too small, especially when compared with the Central Suriname Nature Reserve that had just been nominated as a World Heritage Site (2000).

Work continues, after a period of hiatus, on the nomination dossier for Historic Georgetown. A tentative list indicating an intention to nominate Historic Georgetown was submitted to UNESCO in December 2004. In April 2005, two Dutch experts in conservation spent two weeks in Georgetown supervising architecture staff and students of the [[University of Guyana]] in a historic building survey of the selected area. This is part of the data collection for the nomination dossier.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the Kaieteur National Park being considered too small, there is a proposal to prepare a nomination for a Cluster Site that will include the Kaieteur National Park, the [[Iwokrama Forest]] and the Kanuku Mountains.

The sugar industry, which accounts for 28% of all export earnings, is largely run by the company [[GuySuCo]], which employs more people than any other industry. Many industries have a large foreign investment. For example, the American company [[Reynolds Metals]] and the British-Australian [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto's]] Rio Tinto Alcan subsidiary are heavily invested in Guyana's mineral industry; the Korean/Malaysian Barama Company has a large stake in the logging industry. Since 2015, foreign companies have made several significant deep water [[Petroleum exploration in Guyana|oil discoveries]].\n\nChronic problems include a shortage of skilled [[labour (economics)|labour]], deficient infrastructure, and until recently, sizable external debt. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities, combined with troubles in the bauxite and sugar industries, had threatened the government's tenuous fiscal position and dimmed prospects for the future. However, the Guyanese economy has rebounded slightly and exhibited moderate economic growth since 1999, thanks to an expansion in the agricultural and mining sectors, a more favourable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support of international organisations. In 2008, the economy witnessed a 3% increase in growth amid the global [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|economic crisis]]. It grew 5.4% in 2011 and 3.7% in 2012.\n\nThe production of [[balat\u00e1]] (natural [[latex]]) was once big business in Guyana. Most of the balata bleeding in Guyana took place in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains in the Rupununi. Early exploitation also took place in the North West District, but most of the trees in the area were destroyed by illicit bleeding methods that involved cutting down the trees rather than making incisions in them. Uses of balat\u00e1 included the making of [[cricket]] balls, the temporary filling of troublesome tooth cavities, and the crafting of figurines and other decorative items (particularly by the Macushi people of the Kanuku mountains).\n\nMajor [[private sector]] organisations include the Private Sector Commission (PSC)<ref>{{cite web |author=RedSpider, Romona Khan |url=http://www.psc.org.gy |title=Private Sector Commission |publisher=Psc.org.gy |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628041741/http://www.psc.org.gy/ |archive-date=28 June 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> and the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgetownchamberofcommerce.org |title=Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) |publisher=Georgetownchamberofcommerce.org |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217153022/http://www.georgetownchamberofcommerce.org/ |archivedate=17 December 2010  }}</ref>\n\nThe government initiated a major overhaul of the tax code in early 2007. A [[Value Added Tax]] (VAT) replaced six different taxes. Prior to the implementation of the VAT, it had been relatively easy to evade sales tax, and many businesses were in violation of tax code. Many businesses opposed VAT introduction because of the extra paperwork required; however, the Government has remained firm on the VAT. By replacing several taxes with one flat tax rate, it will also be easier for government auditors to spot [[embezzlement]]. This was prevalent under the former PPP/C government who authorised the VAT to be equal to 50% of the value of the good.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nPresident Bharrat Jagdeo had made [[debt relief]] a priority. He convinced the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank Group|the World Bank]] and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) to write off US$800&nbsp;million of debt, and millions more owed to industrial nations.

Historically, politics are a source of tension in the country, and violent riots have often broken out during elections. During the 1970s and 1980s, the political landscape was dominated by the People's National Congress.\n\nIn 1992, the first \"free and fair\" elections were overseen by former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]], and the People's Progressive Party led the country until 2015. The two parties are principally organised along ethnic lines and as a result often clash on issues related to the allocation of resources.

Guyana is a founding member of the [[Caricom]] (Caribbean Community) economic bloc and also the home of the Bloc's Headquarters, the CARICOM Secretariat.\n\nGuyana's geographical location, its sparsely populated rain-forest regions, and its substantial Amerindian population differentiate it from English-speaking Caribbean countries. Its blend of Indo-Guyanese (East Indian) and Afro-Guyanese (African) cultures gives it similarities to [[Trinidad]] and distinguishes it from other parts of the Americas. Guyana shares similar interests with the islands in the West Indies, such as food, festive events, music, sports, etc.\n\nGuyana plays international cricket as a part of the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies cricket team]], and the [[Guyanese cricket team|Guyana team]] plays [[first class cricket|first-class cricket]] against other nations of the Caribbean. In March and April 2007 Guyana co-hosted the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]]. In addition to its CARICOM membership, Guyana is a member of [[CONCACAF]], the international football federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nEvents include [[Mashramani]] (Mash), [[Phagwah]] ([[Holi]]), and [[Deepavali]] ([[Diwali]]).\n\n== Wildlife ==\nGuyana is home to more than 900 species of birds; 225 species of mammals; 880 species of reptiles and more than 6,500 different species of trees and plants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myadventuresacrosstheworld.com/wildlife-in-guyana/|title=The Most Amazing Wildlife in Guyana|last=Tavani|first=Claudia|date=14 August 2018|website=My Adventures Across the World|language=en-US|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref> Among these wildlife categories the most notably famous are the [[Arapaima]], which is the world's largest scaled freshwater fish, [[Giant Anteater]], the largest anteater, [[Giant River Otter]], the world's largest and rarest river otter and lastly the most notably famous of birds, cock of the rock (''[[Rupicola rupicola]]'').<ref>Attenborough, S. 1998 BBC.

[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]]. Vol 53, no 779. September 2002.</ref> The town of Bourke had become the key centre for pastoralists in western New South Wales since its formation in 1861.

It was established in 1981 as \"[[Technikon]] Free State\". As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status.\n==About CUT==\nThe university (then still known as the \u201cTechnikon Free State\u201d) opened its doors in 1981, with 285 students enrolled in mainly secretarial, art and design programmes.  Today, the institution boasts more than 21 000 students who have decided to make CUT their academic partner in earning a qualification and gaining appropriate work-integrated learning to equip and prepare them for professional practice. With the restructuring of the higher education landscape in 2004, CUT embraced its new status as a university of technology (UoT), positioning itself to succeed as such.   The qualifications on offer reside in four faculties, namely Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology (IT); and Faculty of Management Sciences.  The university offers certificates and diplomas at undergraduate level, as well as advanced diplomas, postgraduate diplomas at honours level, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in order to increase the production of world-class postgraduate programmes and high-quality outputs for research.\n\nCUT\u2019s vision is to be \u201can engaged university that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic development, primarily in the Central region of South Africa\u201d. This vision has four pillars, namely planning, products, people and pennies, each describing an important aspect of the university\u2019s future. It does not come as a surprise, then, that Management, staff and students have formulated a strategic vision for the future that is all about heart. They call it the\n\u201cVision 2020 Statement\u201d, and within it are ideas and goals that are supported and inspired by the university across all platforms and programmes. It represents the university\u2019s aspirations and determination as a UoT, and has allowed the university to contribute substantively to addressing the developmental needs of the Free State, the Central region, South Africa and the continent.\n\nThe university\u2019s goal is to be a leader in areas of social and technological innovations and research. CUT believes that no successful geographical region has ever established a technology-based industry without a leading educational institution in its midst, and the university wants to become this institution. In this lies the strength of the planning pillar, which outlines the step-by-step implementation and review of the main practices and outcomes of Vision 2020.\n\n===Campuses===\nCUT is the foremost higher education institution in the heartland of South Africa. The university has two campuses \u2013 one in Bloemfontein, the judicial capital of South Africa, and one in Welkom, in the heart of the Free State goldfields.

The Buccaneers gained infamy as the first team to play an entire 14-game season without winning or tying a single game (including five games where they never even scored). They did not score until their third game and did not score a touchdown until their fourth. They lost by more than a touchdown eleven times. Colorful, maverick former [[USC Trojans football|USC]] coach [[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]], whose wisecracking remarks occasionally agitated fans and the league, led the team. [[Lee Roy Selmon]], the Buccaneers\u2019 first [[NFL Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] representative, made his rookie debut in an injury-plagued season.\n\nThe expansion draft was largely made up of aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team's problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They were last in the league in points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns.<ref name=\"Martz, Ron 2005. p. 11\">Martz, Ron. \u201c30 Seasons: 1976\u20132005.

Aided by a string of great tailbacks, including [[Heisman Trophy]] winners [[O. J. Simpson]] and [[Mike Garrett]], McKay was credited with popularizing the [[I formation]]. Other candidates considered included [[Hank Stram]], [[Ara Parseghian]], and [[Joe Paterno]]. McKay was reportedly offered a five-year contract worth $750,000, plus cars, insurance, and real estate, and turned down an offer from [[1976 Seattle Seahawks season|the Seattle Seahawks]] and a counter-offer from USC to take the job. Critical of the NFL, he had turned down offers from professional teams in the past. McKay cited [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] cutbacks in finances and recruiting as motivations for leaving the college ranks, saying simply that it was \u201ctime to try something else\u201d.<ref>Cardon, Mark. \u201cBucs Get Man They Wanted In McKay\u201d.

One was the stinginess of owner Culverhouse, who went so far as to lease the team jet from McCullough (the chainsaw manufacturer) Airlines. At times Culverhouse had to pay for fuel with his own credit card, because of McCullough's financial difficulties.<ref name=\"Kaufman\"/> The offense was able to move the ball freely at times, but had difficulty getting the ball into the end zone. McKay and Spurrier had a difficult relationship, with Spurrier at times taking public potshots at McKay.<ref name=\"Zier\"/> Frustrated by the lack of quality receivers, Spurrier criticized McKay for playing his own son Johnny ahead of receivers Spurrier considered more capable.
