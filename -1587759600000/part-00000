In [[2006 in NASCAR Busch Series|2006]], the No. 12 car has seen several different drivers through the first 25 races of the season. [[Joel Kauffman]] was slated to run the full schedule for the team this year, however after struggling the team scaled back his schedule. [[David Reutimann]] ran the car at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] because Kauffman had not received approval for superspeedway racing. [[Tracy Hines]] and [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] drove the car in multiple races. For the 2007 season, Fitz Motorsports switched to the No. 22 and signed David Stremme and Mike Bliss as their principal drivers. Both drivers had great success in the No. 22, with Bliss scoring the team's best finish of second at [[Memphis Motorsports Park|Memphis]]. When the team came to [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve|Montreal]] for the inaugural NAPA Auto Parts 200, the team - in a last-second decision - placed Canadian CART regular [[Patrick Carpentier]] in the car. Carpentier won the pole position for the race and charged from 6th with less than 2 laps to go to finish second to [[Kevin Harvick]]. \n\nBliss returned in 2008 to drive full-time, but left for [[Phoenix Racing (NASCAR team)|Phoenix Racing]] after six races, and was replaced by various Cup drivers including Robby Gordon and Reed Sorenson. [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] development driver [[Josh Wise]] became the new driver for thirteen races with one top-five finish.

Atwood came back in 2004, and had seven top-tens, when he was dismissed after [[Lowe's Motor Speedway|Lowe's]].<ref name=\"MRN-AtwoodOut-FB-Oct2004\" /> His immediate replacement was [[Dave Blaney]] for one race,<ref name=\"MRN-AtwoodOut-FB-Oct2004\" /> with [[Braun Racing]]'s [[David Stremme]] named as his permanent replacement. As part of the arrangement to bring Stremme to the team, FitzBradshaw agreed to align themselves with [[Chip Ganassi Racing]], who had him under contract as part of a driver development deal. This would allow the team to finish the season as a Chevrolet team, but beginning the next year both the No. 12 and the No. 14 would switch to Dodge as Ganassi's team was fielding the vehicles at the time.\n\nStremme ran the No. 14 full-time in 2005, and had ten top-tens, finishing 13th in points, before moving up to compete in the [[NEXTEL Cup]] series. [[Tracy Hines]] was hired to run in the No. 14 Dodge for the 2006 season, however sponsorship issuesforced the team to compete on a limited basis. [[Steadman Marlin]] competed for the team in two races and [[A. J. Foyt IV]] competed in one race for the team. It was announced in July 2006 that [[Family Dollar]] would sponsor the car for nine races and the team would feature [[Ricky Craven]], [[Carlos Contreras (racing driver)|Carlos Contreras]], and [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] as drivers. Fitz Motorsports changed the car number to No. 44 for 2007 and [[Ruben Pardo]] qualified for the team's first race at the [[Telcel-Motorola M\u00e9xico 200]], followed up by another start at [[Nashville Superspeedway]]. [[Mike Bliss]] also drove the No. 44 with [[Family Dollar]] sponsorship at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] in May 2007. For 2008, [[Kenny Wallace]] was signed to drive the No. 36 with sponsorship from [[Shark Energy Drink]]. Although Wallace missed the season opener at Daytona, he ran all following races until owner Armando Fitz announced on March 17 that the No. 36 team would only run part-time due to a lack of product distribution, and the owner points of the 36 were switched the No. 28 of Wallace's new team.

In [[2006 in NASCAR Busch Series|2006]], the No. 12 car has seen several different drivers through the first 25 races of the season. [[Joel Kauffman]] was slated to run the full schedule for the team this year, however after struggling the team scaled back his schedule. [[David Reutimann]] ran the car at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] because Kauffman had not received approval for superspeedway racing. [[Tracy Hines]] and [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] drove the car in multiple races. For the 2007 season, Fitz Motorsports switched to the No. 22 and signed David Stremme and Mike Bliss as their principal drivers. Both drivers had great success in the No. 22, with Bliss scoring the team's best finish of second at [[Memphis Motorsports Park|Memphis]]. When the team came to [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve|Montreal]] for the inaugural NAPA Auto Parts 200, the team - in a last-second decision - placed Canadian CART regular [[Patrick Carpentier]] in the car. Carpentier won the pole position for the race and charged from 6th with less than 2 laps to go to finish second to [[Kevin Harvick]]. \n\nBliss returned in 2008 to drive full-time, but left for [[Phoenix Racing (NASCAR team)|Phoenix Racing]] after six races, and was replaced by various Cup drivers including Robby Gordon and Reed Sorenson. [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] development driver [[Josh Wise]] became the new driver for thirteen races with one top-five finish. Of note, Fitz switched temporarily to Toyota during Wise's runs with the team.

Atwood came back in 2004, and had seven top-tens, when he was dismissed after [[Lowe's Motor Speedway|Lowe's]].<ref name=\"MRN-AtwoodOut-FB-Oct2004\" /> His immediate replacement was [[Dave Blaney]] for one race,<ref name=\"MRN-AtwoodOut-FB-Oct2004\" /> with [[Braun Racing]]'s [[David Stremme]] named as his permanent replacement. As part of the arrangement to bring Stremme to the team, FitzBradshaw agreed to align themselves with [[Chip Ganassi Racing]], who had him under contract as part of a driver development deal. This would allow the team to finish the season as a Chevrolet team, but beginning the next year both the No. 12 and the No. 14 would switch to Dodge as Ganassi's team was fielding the vehicles at the time.\n\nStremme ran the No. 14 full-time in 2005, and had ten top-tens, finishing 13th in points, before moving up to compete in the [[NEXTEL Cup]] series. [[Tracy Hines]] was hired to run in the No. 14 Dodge for the 2006 season, however sponsorship issuesforced the team to compete on a limited basis. [[Steadman Marlin]] competed for the team in two races and [[A. J. Foyt IV]] competed in one race for the team. It was announced in July 2006 that [[Family Dollar]] would sponsor the car for nine races and the team would feature [[Ricky Craven]], [[Carlos Contreras (racing driver)|Carlos Contreras]], and [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] as drivers. Fitz Motorsports changed the car number to No. 44 for 2007 and [[Ruben Pardo]] qualified for the team's first race at the [[Telcel-Motorola M\u00e9xico 200]], followed up by another start at [[Nashville Superspeedway]]. [[Mike Bliss]] also drove the No. 44 with [[Family Dollar]] sponsorship at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] in May 2007. For 2008, [[Kenny Wallace]] was signed to drive the No. 36 with sponsorship from [[Shark Energy Drink]]. Although Wallace missed the season opener at Daytona, he ran all following races until owner Armando Fitz announced on March 17 that the No. 36 team would only run part-time due to a lack of product distribution, and the owner points of the 36 were switched the No. 28 of Wallace's new team.

Hirzel Canning Company is continually ran by Hirzel family members with the 4th generation currently in leadership roles within the company.</big>\n\n\n== <big>History</big> ==\n<big>Carl R. Hirzel was a brewmaster who switched to growing and canning vegetables during the onset of [[Prohibition]]. He traveled from Switzerland to New York with his wife, Lena to become brewers in the United States. He later moved near [[Toledo, Ohio]] to be closer to his brothers.  Upon seeing the quality of soil the area had to offer, Carl purchased Hirzel Farms and began growing and selling cabbage in 1920.  A plentiful cabbage harvest in 1923 convinced Carl to begin producing [[sauerkraut]], a process very similar to beer making.  He started selling his sauerkraut under the name Star Cross.  Star Cross Sauerkraut became so popular among local shop owners that just one year later the Hirzel family was receiving requests to grow [[Tomato|tomatoes]].  In 1924, Hirzel Farms harvested their first tomatoes.</big> <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiogrocers.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Canning-Spotlight.pdf|title=Canning Spotlight|last=|first=|date=September 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.deifratelli.com/about-our-family/|title=Our Family {{!}} Dei Fratelli Tomatoes|website=www.deifratelli.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/buckeye-built/buckeye-built-dei-fratelli-keeps-roots-planted-in-ohio-selling-canned-tomatoes-products-across-us|title=Buckeye Built: Dei Fratelli keeps roots planted in Ohio, selling canned tomato products across US|date=2019-11-15|website=WEWS|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Star_Cross_Delivery.jpg|left|300x300px]]\n<big>With the success of the tomatoes and sauerkraut, Hirzel Canning Company was incorporated in 1947 with Karl A.

Hirzel Canning Company has stayed close to their roots being headquartered in [[Northwood, Ohio]] on the same property where the original Hirzel Family home stands. Since their incorporation, Hirzel Canning Company has thrived and has underwent multiple expansions throughout the years. In 1954, the [[Pemberville, Ohio]] plant was purchased and in 1982 the company expanded again to a third plant in [[Ottawa, Ohio]].

Hirzel was a brewmaster who switched to growing and canning vegetables during the onset of [[Prohibition]]. He traveled from Switzerland to New York with his wife, Lena to become brewers in the United States. He later moved near [[Toledo, Ohio]] to be closer to his brothers.  Upon seeing the quality of soil the area had to offer, Carl purchased Hirzel Farms and began growing and selling cabbage in 1920.  A plentiful cabbage harvest in 1923 convinced Carl to begin producing [[sauerkraut]], a process very similar to beer making.  He started selling his sauerkraut under the name Star Cross.  Star Cross Sauerkraut became so popular among local shop owners that just one year later the Hirzel family was receiving requests to grow [[Tomato|tomatoes]].  In 1924, Hirzel Farms harvested their first tomatoes.</big> <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiogrocers.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Canning-Spotlight.pdf|title=Canning Spotlight|last=|first=|date=September 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.deifratelli.com/about-our-family/|title=Our Family {{!}} Dei Fratelli Tomatoes|website=www.deifratelli.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/buckeye-built/buckeye-built-dei-fratelli-keeps-roots-planted-in-ohio-selling-canned-tomatoes-products-across-us|title=Buckeye Built: Dei Fratelli keeps roots planted in Ohio, selling canned tomato products across US|date=2019-11-15|website=WEWS|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Star_Cross_Delivery.jpg|left|300x300px]]\n<big>With the success of the tomatoes and sauerkraut, Hirzel Canning Company was incorporated in 1947 with Karl A.

Many of these discoveries have concerned unusual molecules involving the main group elements.\n\nAromatic molecules constitute a particularly important class of organic compounds.

The iconic aromatic molecule is benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.

The series first aired in 1987 as a 13-episode pilot called ''Family Portraits'' and has almost 900 episodes to date. As of 2005, the show's daily audience averaged around 1.2 million within North America.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Chick-fil-A giving away 'Adventures in Odyssey' | newspaper= Herald-Journal | pages=E6 | date=October 23, 2005}}</ref> The ''Odyssey'' radio series also includes several spin-off items, including a home-video series, several computer games, and books. The series centers on the [[List of fictional towns and villages|fictional town]] of Odyssey, and the lives of the people who live there, and in particular, an ice-cream and discovery emporium named Whit's End, and its owner, John Avery Whittaker, who was originally voiced by [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1982, [[Focus on the Family]] began creating several short dramas for inclusion in the ministry's daily half-hour radio show; these radio dramas were commissioned by Focus on the Family founder and then-president Brandon Watkins as an alternative to Saturday-morning cartoons. This effort culminated in with a thirteen-week test series titled ''Family Portraits'' which aired in early 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitsend.org/aboutshow/History.aspx |title=The History of Adventures in Odyssey |work=WhitsEnd.org |accessdate=June 15, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720231938/http://www.whitsend.org/aboutshow/History.aspx| archivedate= 20 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> It was created by Steve Harris and Phil Lollar, who set it in a small [[Midwest]] town they called Odyssey. The test episodes engendered a favorable audience response, and led to a continuing radio program in November 1987, called ''Odyssey USA''.<ref name=\"RadioWorld\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/71464 |title='Radio Theatre': Tales With a Message |last=Deutsch |first=Ken |work=[[Radio World]] |date=December 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503214624/http://www.radioworld.com/article/71464 |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The title was later changed in 1988 to ''Adventures in Odyssey'' to \"increase international appeal\".<ref name=\"Official Guide\">{{Cite book| last=Hoobler | first=Nathan | title=Adventures in Odyssey: The Official Guide| publisher=Tyndale | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-58997-475-3 }}</ref>\n\nThe goal of the Odyssey staff was to create a \"values-based\" radio show with production values comparable with or surpassing those of most mainstream audio dramas. While the show aimed to promote Christian values, according to Odyssey's co-creator [[Phil Lollar]], the goal is not to be \"a preaching program\", but to be an \"entertaining program\".<ref>{{Cite news| title= Radio Show is Family Adventure | newspaper=[[The Modesto Bee]] | pages=H2 | date=November 23, 1997 | url=http://www.newsbank.com/}}</ref> Large amounts of work were put into each individual story; for the first few years, each thirty-minute episode typically took over one hundred hours to produce.<ref name=\"proquest\">{{Cite news| title= A Growing Grass-Roots Renaissance for Radio Drama | newspaper= Los Angeles Times | pages=1 | date=December 26, 1988 | id= {{ProQuest|280626184}} }}</ref>\n\nSeveral well-known voice actors were brought in to provide the lead roles.

In September 2009, [[Andre Stojka]] was selected as the third actor to voice Mr. Whittaker; only months later, on 2 February 2010, Paul Herlinger died from his illness. In March 2010, regular episodes resumed airing as Album 51, ''Take it from the Top'', premiered.<ref name=\"Official Guide\"/>\n\nThe show has been adapted into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] audio and [[Hindi]] live-action videos, with plans to create Mandarin audio as well.<ref name=\"RadioWorld\" />\n[[File:Adventures_in_Odyssey_Club_Logo.png|180px|left|Adventures in Odyssey Club Logo]]\nOn January 2, 2014 a subscription service for Adventures in Odyssey fans and their families launched, the ''Adventures In Odyssey Club''.

The series first aired in 1987 as a 13-episode pilot called ''Family Portraits'' and has almost 900 episodes to date. As of 2005, the show's daily audience averaged around 1.2 million within North America.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Chick-fil-A giving away 'Adventures in Odyssey' | newspaper= Herald-Journal | pages=E6 | date=October 23, 2005}}</ref> The ''Odyssey'' radio series also includes several spin-off items, including a home-video series, several computer games, and books. The series centers on the [[List of fictional towns and villages|fictional town]] of Odyssey, and the lives of the people who live there, and in particular, an ice-cream and discovery emporium named Whit's End, and its owner, John Avery Whittaker, who was originally voiced by [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1982, [[Focus on the Family]] began creating several short dramas for inclusion in the ministry's daily half-hour radio show; these radio dramas were commissioned by Focus on the Family founder and then-president Brandon Watkins as an alternative to Saturday-morning cartoons. This effort culminated in with a thirteen-week test series titled ''Family Portraits'' which aired in early 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitsend.org/aboutshow/History.aspx |title=The History of Adventures in Odyssey |work=WhitsEnd.org |accessdate=June 15, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720231938/http://www.whitsend.org/aboutshow/History.aspx| archivedate= 20 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> It was created by Steve Harris and Phil Lollar, who set it in a small [[Midwest]] town they called Odyssey. The test episodes engendered a favorable audience response, and led to a continuing radio program in November 1987, called ''Odyssey USA''.<ref name=\"RadioWorld\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/71464 |title='Radio Theatre': Tales With a Message |last=Deutsch |first=Ken |work=[[Radio World]] |date=December 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503214624/http://www.radioworld.com/article/71464 |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The title was later changed in 1988 to ''Adventures in Odyssey'' to \"increase international appeal\".<ref name=\"Official Guide\">{{Cite book| last=Hoobler | first=Nathan | title=Adventures in Odyssey: The Official Guide| publisher=Tyndale | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-58997-475-3 }}</ref>\n\nThe goal of the Odyssey staff was to create a \"values-based\" radio show with production values comparable with or surpassing those of most mainstream audio dramas. While the show aimed to promote Christian values, according to Odyssey's co-creator [[Phil Lollar]], the goal is not to be \"a preaching program\", but to be an \"entertaining program\".<ref>{{Cite news| title= Radio Show is Family Adventure | newspaper=[[The Modesto Bee]] | pages=H2 | date=November 23, 1997 | url=http://www.newsbank.com/}}</ref> Large amounts of work were put into each individual story; for the first few years, each thirty-minute episode typically took over one hundred hours to produce.<ref name=\"proquest\">{{Cite news| title= A Growing Grass-Roots Renaissance for Radio Drama | newspaper= Los Angeles Times | pages=1 | date=December 26, 1988 | id= {{ProQuest|280626184}} }}</ref>\n\nSeveral well-known voice actors were brought in to provide the lead roles.

In September 2009, [[Andre Stojka]] was selected as the third actor to voice Mr. Whittaker; only months later, on 2 February 2010, Paul Herlinger died from his illness. In March 2010, regular episodes resumed airing as Album 51, ''Take it from the Top'', premiered.<ref name=\"Official Guide\"/>\n\nThe show has been adapted into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] audio and [[Hindi]] live-action videos, with plans to create Mandarin audio as well.<ref name=\"RadioWorld\" />\n[[File:Adventures_in_Odyssey_Club_Logo.png|180px|left|Adventures in Odyssey Club Logo]]\nOn January 2, 2014 a subscription service for Adventures in Odyssey fans and their families launched, the ''Adventures In Odyssey Club''.
