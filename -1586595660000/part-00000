It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

They are frequently encountered at high elevations on the Great Dividing Range, especially in sparser snow gum woodland and similar habitat, and during the summer breeding season are one of the most reliably observed species around the summit of Mount Macedon, NW of Melbourne.\n\nIn spring and summer, the flame robin is more often found in wet eucalypt forest in hilly or mountainous areas, particularly the tops and slopes, to an elevation of {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It generally prefers areas with more clearings and less [[understory]]. In particular it prefers tall forests dominated by such trees as snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora]]''), mountain ash ( ''[[Eucalyptus regnans|E.&nbsp;regnans]]''), alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis|E.&nbsp;delegatensis]]''), manna gum (''[[Eucalyptus viminalis|E.&nbsp;viminalis]]''), messmate stringybark (''[[Eucalyptus obliqua|E.&nbsp;obliqua]]''), black gum (''[[Eucalyptus aggregata|E.&nbsp;aggregata]]''), white mountain gum (''[[Eucalyptus dalrympleana|E.&nbsp;dalrympleana]]''), brown barrel (''[[Eucalyptus fastigata|E.&nbsp;fastigata]]''), narrow-leaved peppermint (''[[Eucalyptus radiata|E.&nbsp;radiata]]''), and black peppermint (''[[Eucalyptus amygdalina|E.&nbsp;amygdalina]]''). It is occasionally encountered in [[temperate rainforest]]. In the autumn and winter, birds move to more open areas such as grasslands and open woodlands, such as those containing river red gum (''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis|E.&nbsp;camaldulensis]]''), Blakely's red gum (''[[Eucalyptus blakelyi|E.&nbsp;blakelyi]]''), yellow box (''[[Eucalyptus melliodora|E.&nbsp;melliodora]]''), grey box (''[[Eucalyptus microcarpa|E.&nbsp;microcarpa]]''), and mugga ironbark  (''[[Eucalyptus sideroxylon|E.&nbsp;sideroxylon]]''), at lower altitude.<ref name=Higgins667/><!-- cites para -->\n\nFlame robins often become more abundant in areas recently burnt by [[bushfire]]s, but move away once the undergrowth regrows.<ref name=Higgins667/> They may also move into logged or cleared areas in forests.<ref name=Higgins668/> However, a field study in the Boola Boola State Forest in central [[Gippsland]] revealed they are not found in areas where the regrowth after logging is dense.<ref name=\"Loyn80\">{{cite journal|last=Loyn|first=Richard H.|year=1980|title=Bird populations in a mixed Eucalypt forest used for production of wood in Gippsland, Victoria|journal=Emu|volume=80|issue=3|pages=146\u201356|doi=10.1071/mu9800145}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Petroica phoenicea 2 - Goat's Beach.jpg|thumb]]\nThe flame robin mostly breeds in and around the [[Great Dividing Range]], the Tasmanian highlands and islands in Bass Strait.<ref name=Ber03/> With the coming of cooler autumn weather, most birds disperse to lower and warmer areas, some travelling as far as eastern [[South Australia]], southern Queensland, or (in the case of some Tasmanian birds) across Bass Strait to Victoria.

It was first introduced in the 1980s by '''P & M Software''', founded by Paul Meiners. GT Power can be used both to host a BBS as well as to connect to other BBS systems via its full-featured dial-up \"terminal mode.\"  GT Power was a [[shareware]] package that required a registration fee in order to access its [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[computer network|network]] mail transport/handling software and, by default, the ''GT Power Network''.  The software is distributed in two \"flavors\"; a terminal-only version, nicknamed ''GTO'', and the full-featured host and terminal version.  \n\nThe [[source code]] for GT Power was sold twice during the late 1990s, again in 2008 and is currently the property of Tom Watt.{{fact|date=July 2017}}\n\nAlthough GT Power was written to run under DOS, it is also quite capable under the [[Microsoft Windows]] (versions with DOS support) and [[OS/2]] / [[eComStation]] [[operating systems]].  When it is running under OS/2 or eComStation, GT Power can also be used as a [[telnet]] BBS host and terminal program via use of an OS/2 shareware virtual [[modem]] application called [[VMODEM]].\n\n==History==\nGT Power was originally a telecommunications/terminal application, known as ''GT Powercomm'', which could be used to dial-up other BBS systems.  As time passed, a [[bulletin board system|host mode]] was written into the application which allowed the user to accept incoming data calls.  Before the release of version 13.00 (released Autumn, 1987), the host mode portion of the application had been expanded to become a full-blown BBS host application, complete with message and file areas, file [[uploading]] and [[downloading]], the capability to host [[BBS door]] programs, and a [[sysop]]-to-user chat mode.<ref>READ.ME file contained in GT 13.00 documentation.  As per the documentation, version 12.00 was the first version with an \"expanded\" host mode.</ref>\n\nThe name was shortened to ''GT Power'' sometime before the release of version 14.03 in the Autumn of 1988.\n\nWith version 13.00, P & M software began offering a proprietary ''Netmail Suite''; a set of  applications which allow GT Power BBS systems to connect and exchange routed person-to-person '''netmail'''.<ref>READ.ME file contained in GT 13.00 documentation</ref>  By the time version 14.03 was released, the suite was expanded to include the ability to also exchange '''echomail''' between systems,<ref>GT Power documentation</ref> similar to [[FidoNet]] echomail.  Upon registering GT Power, the user obtained a special [[password]] which enabled the Netmail Suite applications, and a [[key code]] that disabled any registration reminder delays in GT Power.\n\nThe Netmail Suite consisted of a mail transfer program and two mail handling programs.  The mail transfer program, called ''MDRIVer'', was used to dial other GT Power systems, to authenticate their identity, and to transfer mail between the two systems.  The mail handling programs were used to \"bag\" mail and prepare it for transfer (''MBAGger''), and to unpack received mail and distribute it to the proper message areas (''MDIST'').\n\nP & M  Software released its last version of GT Power, version 19.00, in September, 1994.  In mid-February, 1998, it was announced that P&M Software had sold the GT Power source code to '''New Millennium Software'''.  New Millennium renamed the project '''GT 2000''' but, by the end of April,  it was announced that New Millennium would not develop the product. The source was sold again to Dennis Berry, a GT Power sysop.\n\nIn late 1999, Berry released a [[Y2K]] [[bug fix]] for the Netmail Suite. A third party Y2K fix for the Suite, as well as other [[third party software component|third party companion software]], was also released. The GT Power application itself appeared to have no Y2K issues, with 19.00 being the latest release.\n\nThe source code and rights were sold to Tom Watt in June 2008 and he has resumed development of GT-Power. For the first time since Paul stopped development, the source code has been made to compile the EXEs as they were last released in 1994.\n\n==Features==\nThe following list of features applies to the most-recent version of GT Power (19.00).\n\nFeatures of both the terminal and host modes:\n\n* ANSI and VT-52 terminal emulation;\n* ANSI color graphics and music support that does not require ANSI.SYS (introduced version 12.20);\n* RIP graphics support (ver. 19.00);\n* support for multiple dialing directories, with up to 999 entries each (terminal mode);\n* circular dialing queue, and redial-on-busy (terminal mode);\n* a script language, for creating dialing and other scripts;\n* user-assignable function key/macro support;\n* built-in file-transfer protocols, including Xmodem, WXmodem, Ymodem, SEAlink, Telink, & MegaLink;\n* support for up to 18 additional \"external\" file-transfer protocols, such as Zmodem and HS/Link;\n* support for non-standard COM ports (3-8), & non-standard IRQs (up to IRQ 15);\n* support for 300-33.6k baud modems, 16550 UART, and locked port speeds up to 115200;\n* DESQview, DoubleDos, Windows, and OS/2 aware;\n* caller-id support;\n* optional capture mode and scroll-back buffering;\n* the ability to use PC-Pursuit  to make outgoing calls, both in terminal mode and with ''MDRIVer''.\n\nIn addition, the BBS host mode has the following features:\n\n* Built-in QWK mail and QWK networking support (non-proprietary);\n* semi-configurable menus and prompts;\n* support for multiple message areas (ver. 12.10) and file areas (prior to ver. 12.00);\n* proprietary Netmail Suite with netmail and echomail support (ver. 13.00);\n* full-screen ANSI message editing;\n* CD-ROM file area support;\n* FILE.DIZ support for file uploads;\n* multinode capable, on a network or under multitasking software, such as DESQview or OS/2;\n* multinode ''CB'' chat (users can chat between nodes);\n* time banking;\n* threaded reading of messages;\n* Carbon-Copy list support in messages;\n* Return Receipt message support in netmail;\n* support for up to 999 external BBS door programs (ver. 19.00; doors introduced ver. 12.20);\n* mailboxes for private user-to-user mail exchange (ver. 19.00);\n* variable substitution and ''@ macros'' for bulletin and menu files;\n* user-configurable multiple language support;\n* user-configurable questionnaire/voting booth functions (ver. 12.20);\n* user-configurable automatic virus scan of uploaded files;\n* the ability to set up \"freebie\" file downloads and file areas;\n* user-configurable access levels and controls (introduced before ver. 12.00);\n* a task scheduler, for scheduling daily maintenance, etc. (ver. 13.00);\n* two distinct varieties of ''RINGBACK'' service, one of which allows sysops to run a BBS on a voice line (ver. 13.00);\n* a user maintenance program, called ''SYSOP'' (ver. 15.00);\n* the ability to accept a \"hand-off\" from front-end programs, such as Binkleyterm.\n\nOther features can be added via the use of third-party software and add-ons.\n\n===Telnet use===\n\nGT Power also has the undocumented feature of telnet compatibility, in both BBS host and terminal mode, when used with a virtual modem software package called VMODEM under the OS/2 and eComStation operating systems.\n\n==Third party software==\nMany [[third party software component|third party software packages]] were developed to support the GT Power BBS.  Early distributions of GT Power included a third party application called ''GTCTL'', written by James Davis, followed later by ''Sysop Tools'',  written by Chris Smith.  Both were later replaced by the P & M ''SYSOP'' program.  Unlike SYSOP, Sysop Tools had an ANSI-style DOS graphic user interface.  All three were used mostly for user and control file maintenance.  Other third-party software includes:\n\n* external message readers, allowing the sysop to read & enter messages locally without [[logging into]] the BBS;\n* a QWK mail application, which could be added as a door or external menu option, that pre-dates and is more configurable than the built-in version (it could also be used for QWK networking);\n* [[Command line]]/[[batch file]] applications which allow GT Power systems to participate in Fidonet, [[RIME]], and QWK networking;\n* applications which create popular door drop file formats, such as DOORINF and [[DOOR.SYS]], allowing GT Power systems access to more BBS door software;\n* an application that allowed full-screen message editing, before it was included in GT Power;\n* an interface which allowed earlier GT Power systems to run the [[PCBoard]] door ''Prodoor'';\n* applications which allow GT Power systems to add [[Usenet]] [[newsgroups]] and [[Internet]] [[e-mail]] capability;\n* an application which allowed GT Power systems to exchange mail via Internet e-mail file attachments;\n* applications which allowed GT Power users to change their passwords online (since added to GT Power), as well as to force users to change passwords after a specified time;\n* various usage reporting applications;\n* various other applications.\n\nA third-party mail transfer program, called ''Mailrun'', was developed which allows GT Power Network systems to transfer mail using the bi-directional [[HS/Link]] protocol.  In theory, the use of the bi-directional protocol (which sent and received files at the same time) will shorten the length of dial-up netmail calls, saving the sysop some long-distance phone charges.  This program can be used as a replacement for the proprietary MDRIVer program, but requires the use of the proprietary MBAGger & MDIST programs.  With proper setup, Mailrun can co-exist with MDRIVer, allowing systems to use both programs to transfer mail.  Mailrun is [[freeware]], but does require a free key code from the developer in order to connect with other systems.  Mailrun is stated to be compatible with GT Power versions 17.00 through 19.00, but can work with earlier versions.\n\nIn addition, in 1989, a third-party mail handling application, called ''JDMAL'', was released.  It was developed by James Davis, who had previously worked with Meiners in developing the proprietary suite.  It could be used as a replacement for the proprietary MBAGger & MDIST  programs, but did not replace the MDRIVer program.  The last few releases of JDMAL, versions 8.1 and later, were freeware, and were compatible with GT Power versions 13.00 through 14.03.\n\n==The GT Power Network==\nAs the GT Power software application evolved to include a BBS host mode, P & M Software developed a Netmail Suite package which allowed registered users of GT Power to participate in the GT Power Network.  With this Netmail Suite, GT Power BBS systems could exchange netmail and echomail with each other.\n\nAs use of GT Power increased, the network grew.  At various times during the late 1980s/early 1990s, the Network included hundreds of nodes in the continental [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hawaii]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Caribbean]] and much of [[Europe]].<ref>GT Power Network Historical Nodelist</ref>  The proprietary nature of the networking software, combined with the lack of easy-to-configure built-in support for other networking methods, has held the number of nodes below those found on [[Fidonet]].\n\nLike Fidonet, the GT Power Network offered both netmail and echomail. Where netmail is usually system-to-system, person-to-person mail, echomail was intended to be read & possibly replied to by users on all GT Power Network BBS systems.  Each echo had a different topic, such as politics, computer technical support, and ANSI art.  The GT Power Network's application of echomail was different from Fidonet in that echomail messages traveled back to the moderator's (or \"sponsor's\") BBS before being distributed to the rest of the network.  This had the advantage of allowing the moderator to review every message before it was allowed to echo to the rest of the network, creating the potential for a truly moderated echo conference.  On the downside, a slight disruption in network routing could cause active echos to appear quite stale.\n\nAround the beginning of 1990, there was a rift in the GT Power Network, resulting in the formation of a second network based on GT Power.  The ''Alliance of Free Sysops Network'', or ''AFSN'', was formed, with some GT Power sysops finding ways to participate in both networks.  By 1992, as AFSN sysops began migrating to other BBS software, the network had expanded to include both GT Power and QWK networking nodes, some of which had never run GT Power software.  The AFSN either folded, or merged with another QWK network, sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nLike many other BBS networks, as use of the Internet increased, the GT Power network began a decline.  Today, the GT Power Network continues on, albeit on a much smaller scale than before.  Many nodes on the network today participate in echomail via QWK networking as the former GT Power sysops have migrated to Windows and [[Linux]] native BBS applications.  These other applications do not support the GT Power proprietary mail programs.\n\n==GT Power today==\nMost GT Power sysops have either retired their BBS systems or have migrated to other applications.  Nearly all of the remaining GT Power Network BBS systems have replaced their dial-up networking with forms of mail transfer that take advantage of the Internet, by using either e-mail file attachments or some form of automated [[ftp]].\n\nAt least one dial-up GT Power BBS still exists in [[North America]].<ref>[http://www.bbsing.com/bbslists/bbslists.html The BBS Corner's US & Canada Dial-Up BBS Guide] via bbsing.com, and verified May 17, 2008</ref>  The [[Capitol City Online]] BBS, which has been online for over 20 years, currently offers both dial-up and telnet access to its callers.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[List of BBS software]]\n* [[List of bulletin board systems]]\n* ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]''\n* [[ANSI art]]\n* [[terminal emulator|Terminal software]]\n* [[QWK (file format)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gtpowerbbs.com GT-Power Homepage], the new home page for GT-Power.\n*[http://members.iglou.com/mlp/cco Capitol City Online] homepage, a bbs running GT Power.\n*[http://home.clara.net/orac/gt.htm Paul Ratcliffe's GT Utilities page], home of third party companion programs ''Mailrun'' and ''PDQWK''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gt-Power}}\n[[Category:Bulletin board system software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = GT-Power\n| logo                   = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| logo alt               = \n| screenshot             = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| caption                = \n| screenshot alt         = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = Paul Meiners\n| developer              = P & M Software\n| released               = 1980s<!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = \n| latest release date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| status                 = \n| programming language   = \n| operating system       = \n| platform               = [[MS-DOS]]\n| size                   = \n| language               = \n| language count         = <!-- Number only -->\n| language footnote      = \n| genre                  = [[bulletin board system]] (BBS), [[Plain old telephone service|dial-up telecommunications]]/terminal application\n| license                = \n| alexa                  = \n| website                = <!--{{URL|example.org}}-->\n| standard               = \n| AsOf                   = \n}}\n'''GT Power''' is a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) and [[Plain old telephone service|dial-up telecommunications]]/terminal application for [[MS-DOS]].  It was first introduced in the 1980s by '''P & M Software''', founded by Paul Meiners. GT Power can be used both to host a BBS as well as to connect to other BBS systems via its full-featured dial-up \"terminal mode.\"  GT Power was a [[shareware]] package that required a registration fee in order to access its [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[computer network|network]] mail transport/handling software and, by default, the ''GT Power Network''.  The software is distributed in two \"flavors\"; a terminal-only version, nicknamed ''GTO'', and the full-featured host and terminal version.  \n\nThe [[source code]] for GT Power was sold twice during the late 1990s, again in 2008 and is currently the property of Tom Watt.{{fact|date=July 2017}}\n\nAlthough GT Power was written to run under DOS, it is also quite capable under the [[Microsoft Windows]] (versions with DOS support) and [[OS/2]] / [[eComStation]] [[operating systems]].  When it is running under OS/2 or eComStation, GT Power can also be used as a [[telnet]] BBS host and terminal program via use of an OS/2 shareware virtual [[modem]] application called [[VMODEM]].\n\n==History==\nGT Power was originally a telecommunications/terminal application, known as ''GT Powercomm'', which could be used to dial-up other BBS systems.  As time passed, a [[bulletin board system|host mode]] was written into the application which allowed the user to accept incoming data calls.  Before the release of version 13.00 (released Autumn, 1987), the host mode portion of the application had been expanded to become a full-blown BBS host application, complete with message and file areas, file [[uploading]] and [[downloading]], the capability to host [[BBS door]] programs, and a [[sysop]]-to-user chat mode.<ref>READ.ME file contained in GT 13.00 documentation.  As per the documentation, version 12.00 was the first version with an \"expanded\" host mode.</ref>\n\nThe name was shortened to ''GT Power'' sometime before the release of version 14.03 in the Autumn of 1988.\n\nWith version 13.00, P & M software began offering a proprietary ''Netmail Suite''; a set of  applications which allow GT Power BBS systems to connect and exchange routed person-to-person '''netmail'''.<ref>READ.ME file contained in GT 13.00 documentation</ref>  By the time version 14.03 was released, the suite was expanded to include the ability to also exchange '''echomail''' between systems,<ref>GT Power documentation</ref> similar to [[FidoNet]] echomail.  Upon registering GT Power, the user obtained a special [[password]] which enabled the Netmail Suite applications, and a [[key code]] that disabled any registration reminder delays in GT Power.\n\nThe Netmail Suite consisted of a mail transfer program and two mail handling programs.  The mail transfer program, called ''MDRIVer'', was used to dial other GT Power systems, to authenticate their identity, and to transfer mail between the two systems.  The mail handling programs were used to \"bag\" mail and prepare it for transfer (''MBAGger''), and to unpack received mail and distribute it to the proper message areas (''MDIST'').\n\nP & M  Software released its last version of GT Power, version 19.00, in September, 1994.  In mid-February, 1998, it was announced that P&M Software had sold the GT Power source code to '''New Millennium Software'''.  New Millennium renamed the project '''GT 2000''' but, by the end of April,  it was announced that New Millennium would not develop the product. The source was sold again to Dennis Berry, a GT Power sysop.\n\nIn late 1999, Berry released a [[Y2K]] [[bug fix]] for the Netmail Suite. A third party Y2K fix for the Suite, as well as other [[third party software component|third party companion software]], was also released. The GT Power application itself appeared to have no Y2K issues, with 19.00 being the latest release.\n\nThe source code and rights were sold to Tom Watt in June 2008 and he has resumed development of GT-Power. For the first time since Paul stopped development, the source code has been made to compile the EXEs as they were last released in 1994.\n\n==Features==\nThe following list of features applies to the most-recent version of GT Power (19.00).<ref>GT Power 19.00 documentation</ref>\n\nFeatures of both the terminal and host modes:\n\n* [[ANSI]] and [[VT-52]] [[terminal emulation]];\n* [[ANSI art|ANSI]] color graphics and music support that does not require [[ANSI.SYS]] (introduced version 12.20);\n* [[Remote Imaging Protocol|RIP]] graphics support (ver. 19.00);\n* support for multiple dialing directories, with up to 999 entries each (terminal mode);\n* circular dialing queue, and redial-on-busy (terminal mode);\n* a script language, for creating dialing and other scripts;\n* user-assignable function key/macro support;\n* built-in [[file transfer protocol|file-transfer protocols]], including [[Xmodem]], [[WXmodem]], [[Ymodem]], [[SEAlink]], [[Telink]], & MegaLink;\n* support for up to 18 additional \"external\" file-transfer protocols, such as [[Zmodem]] and [[HS/Link]];\n* support for non-standard [[COM port]]s (3-8), & non-standard IRQs (up to [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] 15);\n* support for 300-33.6k [[baud]] [[modems]], [[16550 UART]], and locked port speeds up to 115200;\n* [[DESQview]], DoubleDos, Windows, and OS/2 aware;\n* [[caller-id]] support;\n* optional capture mode and scroll-back buffering;\n* the ability to use PC-Pursuit<ref>PC Pursuit was a semi-nationwide network pay service which allowed BBS users to dial local numbers to access BBS systems that would otherwise be a long-distance telephone call.  The system being called had to be located in a city that was \"PC-Pursuitable.\"  PC-Pursuit would complete the call and connect the systems.</ref>  to make outgoing calls, both in terminal mode and with ''MDRIVer''.\n\nIn addition, the BBS host mode has the following features:\n\n* Built-in [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] mail and QWK networking support (non-proprietary);\n* semi-configurable menus and prompts;\n* support for multiple message areas (ver. 12.10) and file areas (prior to ver. 12.00);\n* proprietary Netmail Suite with netmail and echomail support (ver. 13.00);\n* full-screen ANSI message editing;\n* [[CD-ROM]] file area support;\n* FILE.DIZ support for file uploads;\n* multinode capable, on a network or under [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] software, such as DESQview or OS/2;\n* multinode ''CB'' chat (users can chat between nodes);\n* time banking;\n* threaded reading of messages;\n* Carbon-Copy list support in messages;\n* Return Receipt message support in netmail;\n* support for up to 999 external BBS door programs (ver. 19.00; doors introduced ver. 12.20);\n* mailboxes for private user-to-user mail exchange (ver. 19.00);\n* variable substitution and ''@ macros'' for bulletin and menu files;\n* user-configurable multiple language support;\n* user-configurable questionnaire/voting booth functions (ver. 12.20);\n* user-configurable automatic [[virus scan]] of uploaded files;\n* the ability to set up \"freebie\" file downloads and file areas;\n* user-configurable access levels and controls (introduced before ver. 12.00);\n* a task scheduler, for scheduling daily maintenance, etc. (ver. 13.00);\n* two distinct varieties of ''RINGBACK'' service, one of which allows sysops to run a BBS on a voice line (ver. 13.00);\n* a user maintenance program, called ''SYSOP'' (ver. 15.00);\n* the ability to accept a \"hand-off\" from front-end programs, such as [[Binkleyterm]].\n\nOther features can be added via the use of third-party software and add-ons.\n\n===Telnet use===\n\nGT Power also has the [[undocumented feature]] of [[telnet]] compatibility, in both BBS host and terminal mode, when used with a virtual modem software package called VMODEM under the OS/2 and eComStation operating systems.\n\n==Third party software==\nMany [[third party software component|third party software packages]] were developed to support the GT Power BBS.  Early distributions of GT Power included a third party application called ''GTCTL'', written by James Davis, followed later by ''Sysop Tools'',  written by Chris Smith.  Both were later replaced by the P & M ''SYSOP'' program.  Unlike SYSOP, Sysop Tools had an ANSI-style DOS graphic user interface.  All three were used mostly for user and control file maintenance.  Other third-party software includes:\n\n* external message readers, allowing the sysop to read & enter messages locally without [[logging into]] the BBS;\n* a QWK mail application, which could be added as a door or external menu option, that pre-dates and is more configurable than the built-in version (it could also be used for QWK networking);\n* [[Command line]]/[[batch file]] applications which allow GT Power systems to participate in Fidonet, [[RIME]], and QWK networking;\n* applications which create popular door drop file formats, such as DOORINF and [[DOOR.SYS]], allowing GT Power systems access to more BBS door software;\n* an application that allowed full-screen message editing, before it was included in GT Power;\n* an interface which allowed earlier GT Power systems to run the [[PCBoard]] door ''Prodoor'';\n* applications which allow GT Power systems to add [[Usenet]] [[newsgroups]] and [[Internet]] [[e-mail]] capability;\n* an application which allowed GT Power systems to exchange mail via Internet e-mail file attachments;\n* applications which allowed GT Power users to change their passwords online (since added to GT Power), as well as to force users to change passwords after a specified time;\n* various usage reporting applications;\n* various other applications.\n\nA third-party mail transfer program, called ''Mailrun'', was developed which allows GT Power Network systems to transfer mail using the bi-directional [[HS/Link]] protocol.  In theory, the use of the bi-directional protocol (which sent and received files at the same time) will shorten the length of dial-up netmail calls, saving the sysop some long-distance phone charges.  This program can be used as a replacement for the proprietary MDRIVer program, but requires the use of the proprietary MBAGger & MDIST programs.  With proper setup, Mailrun can co-exist with MDRIVer, allowing systems to use both programs to transfer mail.  Mailrun is [[freeware]], but does require a free key code from the developer in order to connect with other systems.  Mailrun is stated to be compatible with GT Power versions 17.00 through 19.00, but can work with earlier versions.\n\nIn addition, in 1989, a third-party mail handling application, called ''JDMAL'', was released.  It was developed by James Davis, who had previously worked with Meiners in developing the proprietary suite.  It could be used as a replacement for the proprietary MBAGger & MDIST  programs, but did not replace the MDRIVer program.  The last few releases of JDMAL, versions 8.1 and later, were freeware, and were compatible with GT Power versions 13.00 through 14.03.\n\n==The GT Power Network==\nAs the GT Power software application evolved to include a BBS host mode, P & M Software developed a Netmail Suite package which allowed registered users of GT Power to participate in the GT Power Network.  With this Netmail Suite, GT Power BBS systems could exchange netmail and echomail with each other.\n\nAs use of GT Power increased, the network grew.  At various times during the late 1980s/early 1990s, the Network included hundreds of nodes in the continental [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hawaii]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Caribbean]] and much of [[Europe]].<ref>GT Power Network Historical Nodelist</ref>  The proprietary nature of the networking software, combined with the lack of easy-to-configure built-in support for other networking methods, has held the number of nodes below those found on [[Fidonet]].\n\nLike Fidonet, the GT Power Network offered both netmail and echomail. Where netmail is usually system-to-system, person-to-person mail, echomail was intended to be read & possibly replied to by users on all GT Power Network BBS systems.  Each echo had a different topic, such as politics, computer technical support, and ANSI art.  The GT Power Network's application of echomail was different from Fidonet in that echomail messages traveled back to the moderator's (or \"sponsor's\") BBS before being distributed to the rest of the network.  This had the advantage of allowing the moderator to review every message before it was allowed to echo to the rest of the network, creating the potential for a truly moderated echo conference.  On the downside, a slight disruption in network routing could cause active echos to appear quite stale.\n\nAround the beginning of 1990, there was a rift in the GT Power Network, resulting in the formation of a second network based on GT Power.  The ''Alliance of Free Sysops Network'', or ''AFSN'', was formed, with some GT Power sysops finding ways to participate in both networks.  By 1992, as AFSN sysops began migrating to other BBS software, the network had expanded to include both GT Power and QWK networking nodes, some of which had never run GT Power software.  The AFSN either folded, or merged with another QWK network, sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nLike many other BBS networks, as use of the Internet increased, the GT Power network began a decline.  Today, the GT Power Network continues on, albeit on a much smaller scale than before.  Many nodes on the network today participate in echomail via QWK networking as the former GT Power sysops have migrated to Windows and [[Linux]] native BBS applications.  These other applications do not support the GT Power proprietary mail programs.\n\n==GT Power today==\nMost GT Power sysops have either retired their BBS systems or have migrated to other applications.  Nearly all of the remaining GT Power Network BBS systems have replaced their dial-up networking with forms of mail transfer that take advantage of the Internet, by using either e-mail file attachments or some form of automated [[ftp]].\n\nAt least one dial-up GT Power BBS still exists in [[North America]].<ref>[http://www.bbsing.com/bbslists/bbslists.html The BBS Corner's US & Canada Dial-Up BBS Guide] via bbsing.com, and verified May 17, 2008</ref>  The [[Capitol City Online]] BBS, which has been online for over 20 years, currently offers both dial-up and telnet access to its callers.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[List of BBS software]]\n* [[List of bulletin board systems]]\n* ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]''\n* [[ANSI art]]\n* [[terminal emulator|Terminal software]]\n* [[QWK (file format)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gtpowerbbs.com GT-Power Homepage], the new home page for GT-Power.\n*[http://members.iglou.com/mlp/cco Capitol City Online] homepage, a bbs running GT Power.\n*[http://home.clara.net/orac/gt.htm Paul Ratcliffe's GT Utilities page], home of third party companion programs ''Mailrun'' and ''PDQWK''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gt-Power}}\n[[Category:Bulletin board system software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n", "name_user": "111.119.187.18", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GT-Power"}

Their population is believed to have been about 12,000. While exploring [[New England]], [[Bartholomew Gosnold]] landed on [[Cuttyhunk Island]] on May 15, 1602.  From there, he explored [[Cape Cod]] and the neighboring areas, including the site of present-day New Bedford.  However, rather than settle the area, he returned to England at the request of his crew.\n\n=== Old Dartmouth ===\nA group of English [[Quakers]] from the [[Plymouth Colony]]\u2014who as pacifists held ideological differences with the [[Puritan migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|Puritans]] on the question of taxes to fund a military\u2014separated and established the first European settlement on the [[South Coast (Massachusetts)|South Coast]] in 1652.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20140602/NEWS/140609959|title=The story of Dartmouth's first settlers: The Quakers|last=Wittenberg|first=Ariel|website=southcoasttoday.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> They purchased [[Old Dartmouth]]\u2014a region that is now [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts|Dartmouth]], [[Acushnet, Massachusetts|Acushnet]], New Bedford, [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]], and [[Westport, Massachusetts|Westport]]\u2014from Chief [[Massasoit]] of the native [[Wampanoag]] to start a new society. Whether the transfer of the land was legitimately done has been the subject of intense controversy. Like other native tribes, the Wampanoags did not share the settlers' concepts of private property. The tribe may have understood they were granting usage rights to the land, not giving it up permanently.\n\nAt first, Old Dartmouth's 115,000 acres of territory was devoid of major town centers, and had isolated farms and small villages instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/harboring-hope-in-old-dartmouth/old-dartmouth-purchase|title=The Old Dartmouth Purchase|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> At this time, the economy primarily ran on agriculture and fishing. Land availability attracted many Quakers and [[Baptists]] from [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] in [[Rhode Island]], as well as more Puritans migrating from [[Great Britain|Britain]].\n\nThe rising European population and increasing demand for land led the colonists\u2019 relationship with the Native Peoples of New England to deteriorate. Tensions erupted in 1675 with the start of [[King Philip's War|King Philip's War]], which brought devastation to the settlements of Old Dartmouth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/harboring-hope-in-old-dartmouth/conflict|title=Conflict - Irreconcilable Differences|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n{{Further|New Bedford Meeting House}}\n\n=== New Bedford ===\nA section of Old Dartmouth near the west bank of the Acushnet River, originally called Bedford Village, was officially incorporated as the [[New England town|town]] of New Bedford on February 23, 1787 after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The name was suggested by the Russell family, who were prominent citizens of the community. The [[Dukes of Bedford]], a leading English aristocratic house, also bore the surname Russell. ([[Bedford, Massachusetts]] had been incorporated in 1729; hence \"New\" Bedford.)\n\nThe late 18th century was a time of growth for the town. A small whale fishery developed, as well as modest international trade. In the 1760s, between the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolution]], shipwrights, carpenters, mechanics, and blacksmiths, settled around New Bedford harbor, creating a skilled and comprehensive maritime community. \n\nNew Bedford's first newspaper, ''[[The Medley (New Bedford)|The Medley]]'' (also known as ''[[The Medley (New Bedford)|New Bedford Marine Journal]]''), was founded in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83020640/|title=The Medley, or, Newbedford marine journal|publisher=|via=chroniclingamerica.loc.gov}}</ref> On June 12, 1792, the town set up its first post office. William Tobey was its first postmaster. The construction of a bridge (originally a toll bridge) between New Bedford and present-day Fairhaven in 1796 also spurred growth. (Fairhaven separated from New Bedford in 1812, forming an independent town that included both present-day Fairhaven and present-day Acushnet.)\n\n=== Whaling City ===\nNantucket had been the dominant whaling port, though the industry was controlled by a cartel of merchants in Boston, Newport, and Providence. In the 1760s, Nantucket's most prominent whaling families moved to New Bedford, refining their own oil and making their own premium candles.\n\nThe [[American Revolutionary War]] completely paralyzed the whaling industry. [[List of British units in the American Revolutionary War|British forces]] blockaded American ports and captured or destroyed American commercial ships; they even [[Grey's raid|marched down King's Street]] in New Bedford (defiantly renamed Union Street after the Revolution) and set businesses on fire. \n\nNantucket was even more exposed, and the physical destruction, frozen economy, and import taxes imposed after the war obliterated previous fortunes. New Bedford also had a deeper harbor and was located on the mainland. As a result, New Bedford supplanted Nantucket as the nation's preeminent [[whaling]] port, and so began the Golden Age of Whaling.\n[[File:New Bedford, Massachusetts-old harbor.jpeg|thumb|The New Bedford waterfront 1867.]]\nAfter the [[War of 1812]]\u2019s embargo was lifted, New Bedford started amassing a number of colossal, sturdy, square-rigged whaling ships, many of them built at the shipyard of [[Mattapoisett, Massachusetts|Mattapoisett]].

The mills grew and expanded constantly, eventually comprising multiple sites along the [[Acushnet River]]. In 1875 alone, the [[Wamsutta Mills]] processed 19,000 bales of cotton into 20 million yards of cloth, which had a wholesale value comparable to that of the entire whaling catch, and continued to produce over 20 million yards of cloth yearly after 1883.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hough|first=Henry Beetle|url=https://books.google.co.ma/books?id=BzcEAAAAMAAJ&q=19,000+wamsutta+mills&dq=19,000+wamsutta+mills&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijxbCYttLnAhXBzoUKHcCPBxwQ6AEIJzAA|title=Wamsutta of New Bedford, 1846-1946: A Story of New England Enterprise|date=1946|publisher=Wamsutta Mills|language=en}}</ref> The Wamsutta Mills remained the world's largest weaving plant until 1892.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.historic-structures.com/ma/new_bedford/wamsutta_mill.php|title=Wamsutta Mill, New Bedford Massachusetts|work=Historic Structures|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\nThe textile mills redefined wealth in New Bedford, and gave birth to a prosperity greater than that of the whaling industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/programs/migration-and-mill-work-2017/|title=Migration and Mill Work|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> New Bedford, funded by industrial fortunes, developed a thriving art scene.

During the first half of the 19th century many Irish people came to Massachusetts. In 1818, Irish immigrants established the Catholic mission that built St. Mary's Church. Later in that century, immigrants from [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and its colonial possessions in the Atlantic\u2014[[Cape Verde]], the [[Azores]], and [[Madeira]]\u2014began arriving in New Bedford and the surrounding area, attracted by jobs in the whaling industry; many had family members who had worked on whaling ships. As the [[Luso-American|Portuguese community]] began to increase, they established the first Portuguese parish in the city, St. John the Baptist (1871). French Canadians also secured a foothold in New Bedford at about the same time, and they built the Church of the Sacred Heart in 1877.\n\nSimilarly, [[Polish Americans|Polish immigrants]] began arriving in the late 19th century and established the parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in 1903. A number of [[History of the Jews in the United States|Jewish]] families, arriving in the late 19th century, were active in the whaling industry, selling provisions and outfitting ships. During the years leading up to the [[World War I|First World War]], a sizable eastern-European Jewish community joined them in New Bedford. Some became prominent merchants and businessmen, mainly in textiles and manufacturing.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:New Bedford, Massachusetts-view of harbor.jpeg|thumb|View of ships docked at New Bedford]]\nFishing and manufacturing continue to be two of the largest businesses in the area, and healthcare has become a major employer.

The river empties into the bay beyond Clark's Point, the southernmost point of the city.  To the west of Clark's Point is Clark's Cove, which extends landward approximately one and a half mile from the bay.  Just south of Palmer's Island, beginning near Fort Phoenix in Fairhaven, lies a two-mile-long hurricane barrier, constructed in the 1960s to protect the inner harbor where the fishing fleet anchors.  Along with Palmer's Island, the city also lays claim to [[Fish Island, Massachusetts|Fish Island]] and [[Pope's Island]].  Between these two islands lies one of the three sections, the central section, of the New Bedford-Fairhaven Bridge.  The central span, a swing bridge, connects the two islands as well as allowing boats and ships passage to the upper harbor.

Most stem from the ongoing feuds between gangs of the United Front and Monte Park neighborhoods ([[Public housing|projects]]). The gangs are located in the south and west ends of the city.\n\nOn March 6, 1983 [[Cheryl Ann Araujo]], 21, was gang-raped by four men on a pool table in Big Dan's tavern in New Bedford while other patrons watched, but did not intervene. During the prosecution, the defendants' attorneys cross-examined Araujo to such an extent that the case became widely seen as a template for \"[[blaming the victim]]\" in rape cases. The case also raised tensions between the Portuguese-American community and other ethnic groups in New Bedford, as the defendants were Portuguese immigrants. The 1988 film ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'' was loosely based on the incident, and the crime is referenced in [[Dennis Lehane]]'s book ''[[Gone, Baby, Gone (novel)|Gone Baby Gone]]'' as well as its [[Gone Baby Gone|2007 film adaptation]].\n\nIn 2000, [[crime]] had dropped to a 20-year low. Some 3,166 total crimes tracked by the Crime Reporting Unit of the Massachusetts State Police, of which 789 were violent crimes (the lowest violent crime rate since 1975), and 2,377 were property crimes.<ref>\"[http://db.state.ma.us/msp/select.asp State and National Crime Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050706013711/http://db.state.ma.us/msp/select.asp |date=2005-07-06 }}\".

Males had a median income of $37,388 versus $27,278 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $15,602. About 17.3% of families and 20.2% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 29.1% of those under age 18 and 15.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:New Bedford, Massachusetts-old harbor.jpeg|thumb|View of historic New Bedford harbor]]\nThe economy of the Pilgrim settlement in the New Bedford area was initially based around a few farming and fishing villages. The early Bedford Village quickly became a commercial zone and from there became a major [[whaling]] and foreign trade port. In the early 18th century, the Russell family purchased this area and developed it into a larger village (Joseph Russell III having made the most significant contributions). Age of Sail ships built in New Bedford include the schooner ''[[Caroline (schooner)|Caroline]]'' and whaleship ''[[Charles W. Morgan (ship)|Charles W. Morgan]]''. By the 18th century, entrepreneurs in the area, such as whaling merchants from Nantucket, were attracted to the village and helped make it into one of the top whaling cities in the country. The most significant of these merchants was [[Joseph Rotch]], who bought 10 acres (four hectares) of land in 1765 from Joseph Russell III on which he and his sons ran the family business. Rotch moved his business to New Bedford since it would be better for refining whale oil and manufacturing candles made from whales. As these parts of the whaling industry had been monopolized by a merchant cartel in Boston, [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and Providence, Rhode Island, Rotch felt that it would be better for business to handle these himself by moving to the mainland.\n\nThe relationship between New Bedford and Nantucket allowed the two cities to dominate the whaling industry. In 1848 New Bedford resident [[Lewis Temple]] invented the [[toggling harpoon]], an invention that would revolutionize the whaling industry. This helped make New Bedford the preeminent city in the U.S. whaling industry. Another factor was the increased draft of whaling ships, in part the result of greater use of steel in their construction, which made them too deep for Nantucket harbor. [[Syren (clipper)|''Syren'']], the longest lived of the clipper ships, spent over a decade transporting [[whale oil]] and whaling products to New Bedford, principally from [[Honolulu]], and was owned for several years by William H. Besse of New Bedford. As a result of its control over whaling products that were used widely throughout the world (most importantly whale oil), New Bedford became one of the richest per capita cities in the world.\n\nMany whalers would quit their jobs in 1849, though, as the [[Gold Rush]] attracted many of them to leave New Bedford for California. During this time [[Herman Melville]], who worked in New Bedford as a whaler, wrote the novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' and published it in 1851; the city would be the initial setting of the book, including a scene set in the [[Seaman's Bethel]], which still stands today. Despite the power it gave to New Bedford, the whaling industry began to decline starting in 1859 when [[petroleum]], which would become an alternative to [[whale oil]], was discovered. Another blow came with the [[Whaling Disaster of 1871]], in which twenty-two New Bedford whalers were lost in the ice off the coast of Alaska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whalingmuseum.org/library/amwhale/am_arctic.html |title=Overview of American Whaling: Arctic Whaling |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110090142/http://www.whalingmuseum.org/library/amwhale/am_arctic.html |archivedate=November 10, 2011 }}</ref> The New Bedford firm [[J. & W.

Manta''.\n\n[[File:Hathaway Mills.jpg|thumb|Hathaway Mills]]\n\nIn the mid-1840s, New Bedford was the site of the first petroleum fuel refinery in the United States, as newly discovered Pennsylvania crude oil was shipped to New Bedford to be refined for lamp oil and other oil. Standard Oil would ultimately buy this refinery, located on Fish Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=69dGAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA198&lpg=PA198&dq=Standard+Oil+Fish+Island#v=onepage&q=Standard+Oil+Fish+Island&f=false|title=Congressional Edition|date=June 17, 2017|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|via=Google Books}}</ref> Fish Island was also the site of an early experiment in coal gasification, leading to the explosion of a building.\n\nNew Bedford was able to remain wealthy because of its [[textile industry]]. Starting in 1881, the textile industry grew large enough to sustain the city's economy. At its height, over 30,000 people were employed by the 32 cotton-manufacturing companies that owned the textile factories of New Bedford (which were worth $100 million in total). The creation of the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth#History|New Bedford Textile School]] in 1895\u20131899 ushered in an era of textile prosperity that began to decline in the great depression and ended with the end of the textile period in the 1940s. The industry garnered national headlines in 1928 when it was hit with a [[1928 New Bedford textile strike|strike of 30,000 workers]].<ref>See, for example: Daniel Georgianna with Roberta Hazen Aaronson, ''The Strike of '28.'' New Bedford, MA: Spinner Publications, 1993.</ref> The walkout of mostly immigrant workers was given critical support by the [[Communist Party, USA|Workers (Communist) Party]] and was the precursor of a more tumultuous [[Loray Mill strike|textile strike in North Carolina]] held the following year.\n\nTool and die operations also left the area steadily, starting in the 1970s.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n[[File:2019 New Bedford Folk Festival.jpg|thumb|2019 New Bedford Folk Festival]]\nWhile accurate figures are hard to come by, [[tourism]] appears to be a growing industry. New Bedford tourism centers on fairs and festivals including the Folk Festival, Whaling City Festival, Fourth of July, Jazzfest, Working Waterfront Festival, Polish Fest, New Bedford Day of Portugal, Senhor Da Pedra feast, Holy Ghost of Pico feast, and the Portuguese Feast of the [[Blessed Sacrament]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portuguesefeast.com|title=FEAST OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENT|website=portuguesefeast.com|language=en|access-date=March 27, 2017}}</ref> (the largest Portuguese cultural celebration in the nation). Tourism also focuses on the historic whaling industry, and the [[New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park]] is the only national park unit that focuses on the whaling industry's impact on the history of the United States. The [[Buttonwood Park Zoo]] features various species, including two [[Asian elephant|Asian Elephants]], Emily and Ruth, the only ones in New England.\n\nDriven in part by increased tourism, a [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inn and Suites]] hotel opened in New Bedford in late May 2010, on the edge of the city's harbor. This became the first hotel in the city to open in over 40 years, though it is well-supplied with bed and breakfast establishments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121221/SCBULLETIN/301010312|title=Fairfield Inn earns 'Small Business of Year' award|publisher=}}</ref> A secondary hotel, New Bedford Harbor Hotel, opened during the summer of 2018.\n\n===Fishing===\nDespite the historical decline of fishing and whaling in New England, New Bedford continues to be a leading fishing port. In 2016, New Bedford was the highest-valued port in the nation, a title it has held for seventeen straight years. $327 million worth of seafood crossed its docks, making it more valuable than even the most productive Alaskan fishing ports. While volume is below other major ports, New Bedford retains is top position due largely to its [[scallop]] fishery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/US-seafood-catch-reaches-17-year-high-3877199.php|title= US seafood catch reaches 17-year high|via= www.seattlepi.com|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20171101/new-bedford-retains-title-of-highest-valued-port-for-17th-straight-year\"New Bedford retains title of highest valued port for 17th-straight year,\" ''South Coast Today'' Accessed March 3, 2017]</ref>\n[[File:1899 NewBedford public library Massachusetts.png|thumb|New Bedford Public Library, 1899]]\n\n===Income===\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\nData is from the 2009\u20132013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_DP03&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150117113227/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_DP03&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 17, 2015|title=SELECTED ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=January 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_DP05&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150105011252/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_DP05&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2015|title=ACS DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING ESTIMATES 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=January 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_S1101&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212210258/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_S1101&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|title=HOUSEHOLDS AND FAMILIES 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=January 12, 2015}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

New Bedford is nicknamed \"The Whaling City\" because it was one of the world's most important [[whaling]] ports in the nineteenth century, along with [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]] and [[New London, Connecticut]].<ref name=\"Huntington\">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2009/6/2009_6_10_dept.shtml Tom Huntington]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes }} \"Treasure Trove of Documents Discovered in Whaling Town,\" ''American Heritage'', Winter 2009.</ref>  New Bedford, [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] are the three largest cities in the [[South Coast (Massachusetts)|South Coast]] region of Massachusetts.

Their population is believed to have been about 12,000. While exploring [[New England]], [[Bartholomew Gosnold]] landed on [[Cuttyhunk Island]] on May 15, 1602.  From there, he explored [[Cape Cod]] and the neighboring areas, including the site of present-day New Bedford.  However, rather than settle the area, he returned to England at the request of his crew.\n\n=== Old Dartmouth ===\nA group of English [[Quakers]] from the [[Plymouth Colony]]\u2014who as pacifists held ideological differences with the [[Puritan migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|Puritans]] on the question of taxes to fund a military\u2014separated and established the first European settlement on the [[South Coast (Massachusetts)|South Coast]] in 1652.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20140602/NEWS/140609959|title=The story of Dartmouth's first settlers: The Quakers|last=Wittenberg|first=Ariel|website=southcoasttoday.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> They purchased [[Old Dartmouth]]\u2014a region that is now [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts|Dartmouth]], [[Acushnet, Massachusetts|Acushnet]], New Bedford, [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]], and [[Westport, Massachusetts|Westport]]\u2014from Chief [[Massasoit]] of the native [[Wampanoag]] to start a new society. Whether the transfer of the land was legitimately done has been the subject of intense controversy. Like other native tribes, the Wampanoags did not share the settlers' concepts of private property. The tribe may have understood they were granting usage rights to the land, not giving it up permanently.\n\nAt first, Old Dartmouth's 115,000 acres of territory was devoid of major town centers, and had isolated farms and small villages instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/harboring-hope-in-old-dartmouth/old-dartmouth-purchase|title=The Old Dartmouth Purchase|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> At this time, the economy primarily on agriculture and fishing. Land availability attracted many Quakers and [[Baptists]] from [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] in [[Rhode Island]], as well as more Puritans migrating from [[Great Britain|Britain]].\n\nThe rising European population and increasing demand for land led the colonists\u2019 relationship with the Native Peoples of New England to deteriorate. Tensions erupted in 1675 with the start of [[King Philip's War|King Philip's War]], which brought devastation to the settlements of Old Dartmouth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/harboring-hope-in-old-dartmouth/conflict|title=Conflict - Irreconcilable Differences|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n{{Further|New Bedford Meeting House}}\n\n=== New Bedford ===\nA section of Old Dartmouth near the west bank of the Acushnet River, originally called Bedford Village, was officially incorporated as the [[New England town|town]] of New Bedford on February 23, 1787 after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The name was suggested by the Russell family, who were prominent citizens of the community. The [[Dukes of Bedford]], a leading English aristocratic house, also bore the surname Russell. ([[Bedford, Massachusetts]] had been incorporated in 1729; hence \"New\" Bedford.)\n\nThe late 18th century was a time of growth for the town. A small whale fishery developed, as well as modest international trade. In the 1760s, between the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolution]], shipwrights, carpenters, mechanics, and blacksmiths, settled around New Bedford harbor, creating a skilled and comprehensive maritime community. \n\nNew Bedford's first newspaper, ''[[The Medley (New Bedford)|The Medley]]'' (also known as ''[[The Medley (New Bedford)|New Bedford Marine Journal]]''), was founded in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83020640/|title=The Medley, or, Newbedford marine journal|publisher=|via=chroniclingamerica.loc.gov}}</ref> On June 12, 1792, the town set up its first post office. William Tobey was its first postmaster. The construction of a bridge (originally a toll bridge) between New Bedford and present-day Fairhaven in 1796 also spurred growth. (Fairhaven separated from New Bedford in 1812, forming an independent town that included both present-day Fairhaven and present-day Acushnet.)\n\n=== Whaling City ===\nNantucket had been the dominant whaling port, though the industry was controlled by a cartel of merchants in Boston, Newport, and Providence. In the 1760s, Nantucket's most prominent whaling families moved to New Bedford, refining their own oil and making their own premium candles.\n\nThe [[American Revolutionary War]] completely paralyzed the whaling industry. [[List of British units in the American Revolutionary War|British forces]] blockaded American ports and captured or destroyed American commercial ships; they even [[Grey's raid|marched down King's Street]] in New Bedford (defiantly renamed Union Street after the Revolution) and set businesses on fire. \n\nNantucket was even more exposed, and the physical destruction, frozen economy, and import taxes imposed after the war obliterated previous fortunes. New Bedford also had a deeper harbor and was located on the mainland. As a result, New Bedford supplanted Nantucket as the nation's preeminent [[whaling]] port, and so began the Golden Age of Whaling.\n[[File:New Bedford, Massachusetts-old harbor.jpeg|thumb|The New Bedford waterfront 1867.]]\nAfter the [[War of 1812]]\u2019s embargo was lifted, New Bedford started amassing a number of colossal, sturdy, square-rigged whaling ships, many of them built at the shipyard of [[Mattapoisett, Massachusetts|Mattapoisett]].

In 1875 alone, the [[Wamsutta Mills]] processed 19,000 bales of cotton into 20 million yards of cloth, which had a wholesale value comparable to that of the entire whaling catch, and continued to produce over 20 million yards of cloth yearly after 1883.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hough|first=Henry Beetle|url=https://books.google.co.ma/books?id=BzcEAAAAMAAJ&q=19,000+wamsutta+mills&dq=19,000+wamsutta+mills&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijxbCYttLnAhXBzoUKHcCPBxwQ6AEIJzAA|title=Wamsutta of New Bedford, 1846-1946: A Story of New England Enterprise|date=1946|publisher=Wamsutta Mills|language=en}}</ref> The Wamsutta Mills remained the world's largest weaving plant until 1892.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.historic-structures.com/ma/new_bedford/wamsutta_mill.php|title=Wamsutta Mill, New Bedford Massachusetts|work=Historic Structures|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\nThe textile mills redefined wealth in New Bedford, and gave birth to a prosperity greater than that of the whaling industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/programs/migration-and-mill-work-2017/|title=Migration and Mill Work|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> New Bedford, funded by industrial fortunes, developed a thriving art scene.

During the first half of the 19th century many Irish people came to Massachusetts. In 1818, Irish immigrants established the Catholic mission that built St. Mary's Church. Later in that century, immigrants from [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and its colonial possessions in the Atlantic\u2014[[Cape Verde]], the [[Azores]], and [[Madeira]]\u2014began arriving in New Bedford and the surrounding area, attracted by jobs in the whaling industry; many had family members who had worked on whaling ships. As the [[Luso-American|Portuguese community]] began to increase, they established the first Portuguese parish in the city, St. John the Baptist (1871). French Canadians also secured a foothold in New Bedford at about the same time, and they built the Church of the Sacred Heart in 1877.\n\nSimilarly, [[Polish Americans|Polish immigrants]] began arriving in the late 19th century and established the parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in 1903. A number of [[History of the Jews in the United States|Jewish]] families, arriving in the late 19th century, were active in the whaling industry, selling provisions and outfitting ships. During the years leading up to the [[World War I|First World War]], a sizable eastern-European Jewish community joined them in New Bedford. Some became prominent merchants and businessmen, mainly in textiles and manufacturing.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:New Bedford, Massachusetts-view of harbor.jpeg|thumb|View of ships docked at New Bedford]]\nFishing and manufacturing continue to be two of the largest businesses in the area, and healthcare has become a major employer. The three largest single employers based in New Bedford are [[Southcoast Hospitals Group]], one of the top ten employers in Massachusetts (healthcare), [[Titleist]] (golf clubs, balls, apparel, manufacturing), and [[Riverside Manufacturing LLC|Riverside Manufacturing]] (apparel manufacturing).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAccording to a 2001 study by the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] Center for Policy Analysis, the three largest employment sectors in the Greater New Bedford area (the area includes New Bedford and Acushnet, Dartmouth, Fairhaven, Freetown, Lakeville, Marion, Mattapoisett, Rochester, and Wareham) were as follows: services (26% of total employment); wholesale trade (22%); manufacturing (19%). The largest industries by employment in the area were as follows: health services, eating and drinking places, wholesale trade, food stores, and social services. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn 2002, the city received $61,194,358 in taxation revenue, $44,536,201 in local receipts, and $12,044,152 classified as ''other available''.\n\nIn 2005 the unemployment rate was 7.3%, having dropped throughout the 1990s from 12.5% to 5.3% in 2000, and then having risen to 10.4% in 2003.  By 2009, in the midst of the economic crisis of the era, the unemployment rate got as high as 12.4%.\n\nIn 2005, the city received $104,925,772 for education, and $22,755,439 for general government from the [[Massachusetts|State of Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 2016, the city hopes its proximity to Massachusetts' southern coastline will allow it to become a center for the growing [[Wind power|wind energy]] market.

The river empties into the bay beyond Clark's Point, the southernmost point of the city.  To the west of Clark's Point is Clark's Cove, which extends landward approximately one and a half mile from the bay.  Just south of Palmer's Island, beginning near Fort Phoenix in Fairhaven, lies a two-mile-long hurricane barrier, constructed in the 1960s to protect the inner harbor where the fishing fleet anchors.  Along with Palmer's Island, the city also lays claim to [[Fish Island, Massachusetts|Fish Island]] and [[Pope's Island]].  Between these two islands lies one of the three sections, the central section, of the New Bedford-Fairhaven Bridge.  The central span, a swing bridge, connects the two islands as well as allowing boats and ships passage to the upper harbor.  Two conventional bridges connect each of the islands to the nearest mainland, Fish Island to New Bedford and Pope's Island to Fairhaven.  In addition to the harbor, there are several small brooks and ponds within the city limits.\n\n===Parks===\n[[File:Clasky Common Park panorama, New Bedford, Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Soldiers and Sailors Monument stands in the center of Clasky Common Park]]{{clear}}\nThere are several parks and playgrounds, some with splash pads, scattered throughout the city, with the first four being primary parks:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://3t848o30ike211t7x11nzgxi.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/parks-recreation-beaches/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/ParksUpdated2.pdf|title=Parks in New Bedford|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n{{col div|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Abolition Row Park]]\n* Acushnet Cedar Swamp State Reservation\n* Allen C.

About 17.3% of families and 20.2% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 29.1% of those under age 18 and 15.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:New Bedford, Massachusetts-old harbor.jpeg|thumb|View of historic New Bedford harbor]]\nThe economy of the Pilgrim settlement in the New Bedford area was initially based around a few farming and fishing villages. The early Bedford Village quickly became a commercial zone and from there became a major [[whaling]] and foreign trade port. In the early 18th century, the Russell family purchased this area and developed it into a larger village (Joseph Russell III having made the most significant contributions). Age of Sail ships built in New Bedford include the schooner ''[[Caroline (schooner)|Caroline]]'' and whaleship ''[[Charles W. Morgan (ship)|Charles W. Morgan]]''. By the 18th century, entrepreneurs in the area, such as whaling merchants from Nantucket, were attracted to the village and helped make it into one of the top whaling cities in the country. The most significant of these merchants was [[Joseph Rotch]], who bought 10 acres (four hectares) of land in 1765 from Joseph Russell III on which he and his sons ran the family business. Rotch moved his business to New Bedford since it would be better for refining whale oil and manufacturing candles made from whales. As these parts of the whaling industry had been monopolized by a merchant cartel in Boston, [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and Providence, Rhode Island, Rotch felt that it would be better for business to handle these himself by moving to the mainland.\n\nThe relationship between New Bedford and Nantucket allowed the two cities to dominate the whaling industry. In 1848 New Bedford resident [[Lewis Temple]] invented the [[toggling harpoon]], an invention that would revolutionize the whaling industry. This helped make New Bedford the preeminent city in the U.S. whaling industry. Another factor was the increased draft of whaling ships, in part the result of greater use of steel in their construction, which made them too deep for Nantucket harbor. [[Syren (clipper)|''Syren'']], the longest lived of the clipper ships, spent over a decade transporting [[whale oil]] and whaling products to New Bedford, principally from [[Honolulu]], and was owned for several years by William H. Besse of New Bedford. As a result of its control over whaling products that were used widely throughout the world (most importantly whale oil), New Bedford became one of the richest per capita cities in the world.\n\nMany whalers would quit their jobs in 1849, though, as the [[Gold Rush]] attracted many of them to leave New Bedford for California. During this time [[Herman Melville]], who worked in New Bedford as a whaler, wrote the novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' and published it in 1851; the city would be the initial setting of the book, including a scene set in the [[Seaman's Bethel]], which still stands today. Despite the power it gave to New Bedford, the whaling industry began to decline starting in 1859 when [[petroleum]], which would become an alternative to [[whale oil]], was discovered. Another blow came with the [[Whaling Disaster of 1871]], in which twenty-two New Bedford whalers were lost in the ice off the coast of Alaska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whalingmuseum.org/library/amwhale/am_arctic.html |title=Overview of American Whaling: Arctic Whaling |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110090142/http://www.whalingmuseum.org/library/amwhale/am_arctic.html |archivedate=November 10, 2011 }}</ref> The New Bedford firm [[J. & W.

Standard Oil would ultimately buy this refinery, located on Fish Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=69dGAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA198&lpg=PA198&dq=Standard+Oil+Fish+Island#v=onepage&q=Standard+Oil+Fish+Island&f=false|title=Congressional Edition|date=June 17, 2017|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|via=Google Books}}</ref> Fish Island was also the site of an early experiment in coal gasification, leading to the explosion of a building.\n\nNew Bedford was able to remain wealthy because of its [[textile industry]]. Starting in 1881, the textile industry grew large enough to sustain the city's economy. At its height, over 30,000 people were employed by the 32 cotton-manufacturing companies that owned the textile factories of New Bedford (which were worth $100 million in total). The creation of the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth#History|New Bedford Textile School]] in 1895\u20131899 ushered in an era of textile prosperity that began to decline in the great depression and ended with the end of the textile period in the 1940s. The industry garnered national headlines in 1928 when it was hit with a [[1928 New Bedford textile strike|strike of 30,000 workers]].<ref>See, for example: Daniel Georgianna with Roberta Hazen Aaronson, ''The Strike of '28.'' New Bedford, MA: Spinner Publications, 1993.</ref> The walkout of mostly immigrant workers was given critical support by the [[Communist Party, USA|Workers (Communist) Party]] and was the precursor of a more tumultuous [[Loray Mill strike|textile strike in North Carolina]] held the following year.\n\nTool and die operations also left the area steadily, starting in the 1970s.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n[[File:2019 New Bedford Folk Festival.jpg|thumb|2019 New Bedford Folk Festival]]\nWhile accurate figures are hard to come by, [[tourism]] appears to be a growing industry. New Bedford tourism centers on fairs and festivals including the Folk Festival, Whaling City Festival, Fourth of July, Jazzfest, Working Waterfront Festival, Polish Fest, New Bedford Day of Portugal, Senhor Da Pedra feast, Holy Ghost of Pico feast, and the Portuguese Feast of the [[Blessed Sacrament]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portuguesefeast.com|title=FEAST OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENT|website=portuguesefeast.com|language=en|access-date=March 27, 2017}}</ref> (the largest Portuguese cultural celebration in the nation). Tourism also focuses on the historic whaling industry, and the [[New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park]] is the only national park unit that focuses on the whaling industry's impact on the history of the United States. The [[Buttonwood Park Zoo]] features various species, including two [[Asian elephant|Asian Elephants]], Emily and Ruth, the only ones in New England.\n\nDriven in part by increased tourism, a [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inn and Suites]] hotel opened in New Bedford in late May 2010, on the edge of the city's harbor. This became the first hotel in the city to open in over 40 years, though it is well-supplied with bed and breakfast establishments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121221/SCBULLETIN/301010312|title=Fairfield Inn earns 'Small Business of Year' award|publisher=}}</ref> A secondary hotel, New Bedford Harbor Hotel, opened during the summer of 2018.\n\n===Fishing===\nDespite the historical decline of fishing and whaling in New England, New Bedford continues to be a leading fishing port. In 2016, New Bedford was the highest-valued port in the nation, a title it has held for seventeen straight years. $327 million worth of seafood crossed its docks, making it more valuable than even the most productive Alaskan fishing ports. While volume is below other major ports, New Bedford retains is top position due largely to its [[scallop]] fishery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/US-seafood-catch-reaches-17-year-high-3877199.php|title= US seafood catch reaches 17-year high|via= www.seattlepi.com|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20171101/new-bedford-retains-title-of-highest-valued-port-for-17th-straight-year\"New Bedford retains title of highest valued port for 17th-straight year,\" ''South Coast Today'' Accessed March 3, 2017]</ref>\n[[File:1899 NewBedford public library Massachusetts.png|thumb|New Bedford Public Library, 1899]]\n\n===Income===\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\nData is from the 2009\u20132013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_DP03&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150117113227/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_DP03&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 17, 2015|title=SELECTED ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=January 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_DP05&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150105011252/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_DP05&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2015|title=ACS DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING ESTIMATES 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=January 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_S1101&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212210258/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_S1101&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|title=HOUSEHOLDS AND FAMILIES 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=January 12, 2015}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!

The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late-night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late-night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe series was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Siguenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Siguenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.\n\n==Production==\n{{empty section|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Episodes==\nThirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed. [[Traditional animation#Animatic|Animatics]] for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the series' cancellation.

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy vs. The Real World.\" The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment - Part 1.\"\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the series' \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe series won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe series was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Siguenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Siguenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.\n\n==Production==\n{{empty section|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Episodes==\nThirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed.

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy vs. The Real World.\" The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment - Part 1.\"\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the series' \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe series won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
