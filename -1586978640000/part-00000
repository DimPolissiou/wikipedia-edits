He was one of the pioneers in developing the first [[periodic table]] of [[chemical element]]s. Both [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] and Meyer worked with [[Robert Bunsen]].  He never used his first given name, and was known throughout his life simply as Lothar Meyer.\n\n==Career==\nLothar Meyer was born in [[Varel]], Germany (then part of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg]]). He was the son of Friedrich August Meyer, a physician, and Anna Biermann. After attending the Altes Gymnasium in Oldenburg, he studied medicine at the [[University of Zurich]] in 1851. Two years later, he studied at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]], where he studied [[pathology]], as a student of [[Rudolf Virchow]]. At Zurich, he had studied under [[Carl Ludwig]], which had prompted him to devote his attention to physiological chemistry. After graduating as a Doctor of Medicine from W\u00fcrzburg in 1854, he went to the [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]], where [[Robert Bunsen]] held the chair of chemistry. In 1858, he received a Ph.D. in chemistry from the [[University of Breslau]] with a thesis on the effects of [[carbon monoxide]] on the [[blood]]. With this interest in the [[physiology]] of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], he had recognized that [[oxygen]] combines with the [[hemoglobin]] in blood.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=g-kKPYLzBR0C&pg=PA54&dq=Julius+Lothar+Meyer+hemoglobin&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Julius%20Lothar%20Meyer%20hemoglobin&f=false Sergei Vinogradskii and the Cycle of Life: From the Thermodynamics of Life ...], Lloyd Ackert</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4S60ronf9ooC&pg=PA51&dq=Julius+Lothar+Meyer+hemoglobin&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Julius%20Lothar%20Meyer%20hemoglobin&f=false The Disappearing Spoon...and other true tales from the Periodic Table], Sam Kean</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the mathematical teaching of [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], he took up the study of mathematical physics at the University of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] under [[Franz Ernst Neumann]], and in 1859, after having received his [[habilitation]] (certification for university teaching), he became ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in physics and chemistry at the University of [[Breslau]]. In 1866, Meyer accepted a post at the [[Eberswalde Forestry Academy]] at Neustadt-Eberswalde but two years later was appointed to a professorship at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Polytechnic]].<ref name=\"eb\">{{1911|wstitle=Meyer, Julius Lothar|volume=18|pages=348\u2013349}}</ref>\n\nIn 1872, Meyer was the first to suggest that the six [[carbon]] atoms in the [[benzene]] ring (that had been proposed a few years earlier by [[August Kekul\u00e9]]) were interconnected by single bonds only, the fourth valence of each carbon atom being directed toward the interior of the ring.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-German campaign]], the Polytechnic was used as a hospital, and Meyer took an active role in the care of the wounded. In 1876, Meyer became Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], where he served until his death.<ref name=\"eb\"/>\n\n==Periodic table==\nMeyer is best known for his part in the periodic classification of the elements. He noted, as [[J. A. R. Newlands]] did in England, if each element is arranged in the order of their atomic weights, they fall into groups of similar chemical and physical properties repeated at periodic intervals. According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates and the atomic volumes as abscissae\u2014the curve obtained a series of maxima and minima\u2014the most electro-positive elements appearing at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights.<ref name=\"eb\"/>\n\n[[File:Periodic table Meyer 1864.png|upright=1.75|thumb|Lothar Meyer's periodic table, published in \"Die modernen Theorien der Chemie\" (1864)<ref name = \"Meyer table\"> Meyer, Julius Lothar; Die modernen Theorien der Chemie (1864); table on page 137, https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb10073411.html?pageNo=147</ref>]]\nHis book, ''Die modernen Theorien der Chemie'', which he began writing in Breslau in 1862 and which was published two years later, contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by [[atomic weight]], until then had been stymied by the widespread use of equivalent weights for the elements, rather than atomic weights.<ref>{{cite book |author=Alan J. Rocke|title=Chemical Atomism in the Nineteenth Century: From Dalton to Cannizzaro|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=1984}}</ref>\n\nHe published articles about classification table of the elements in horizontal form (1864) and vertical form (1870), in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group.<ref>\n{{cite journal|author=Makeyev A.K. |title=Julius Lothar Meyer was first to build the periodic table of elements |url=http://www.ortpublishing.de/p/blog-page.html |journal=European Applied Sciences |year=2013 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=49\u201361 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715213743/http://www.ortpublishing.de/p/blog-page.html |archivedate=15 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published a periodic table of all elements known at that time (he later predicted several new elements to complete the table, and corrected some atomic weights).  A few months later, Meyer published a paper that included a revised version of his 1864 table that now included virtually all of the known elements, which was similar to the table published by Mendeleev.  Meyer had developed his fuller periodic table independently, but he acknowledged Mendeleev's priority.

He was one of the pioneers in developing the first [[periodic table]] of [[chemical element]]s. Both [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] and Meyer worked with [[Robert Bunsen]].  He never used his first given name, and was known throughout his life simply as Lothar Meyer.\n\n==Career==\nLothar Meyer was born in [[Varel]], Germany (then part of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg]]). He was the son of Friedrich August Meyer, a physician, and Anna Biermann. After attending the Altes Gymnasium in Oldenburg, he studied medicine at the [[University of Zurich]] in 1851. Two years later, he studied at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]], where he studied [[pathology]], as a student of [[Rudolf Virchow]]. At Zurich, he had studied under [[Carl Ludwig]], which had prompted him to devote his attention to physiological chemistry. After graduating as a Doctor of Medicine from W\u00fcrzburg in 1854, he went to the [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]], where [[Robert Bunsen]] held the chair of chemistry. In 1858, he received a Ph.D. in chemistry from the [[University of Breslau]] with a thesis on the effects of [[carbon monoxide]] on the [[blood]]. With this interest in the [[physiology]] of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], he had recognized that [[oxygen]] combines with the [[hemoglobin]] in blood.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=g-kKPYLzBR0C&pg=PA54&dq=Julius+Lothar+Meyer+hemoglobin&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Julius%20Lothar%20Meyer%20hemoglobin&f=false Sergei Vinogradskii and the Cycle of Life: From the Thermodynamics of Life ...], Lloyd Ackert</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4S60ronf9ooC&pg=PA51&dq=Julius+Lothar+Meyer+hemoglobin&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Julius%20Lothar%20Meyer%20hemoglobin&f=false The Disappearing Spoon...and other true tales from the Periodic Table], Sam Kean</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the mathematical teaching of [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], he took up the study of mathematical physics at the University of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] under [[Franz Ernst Neumann]], and in 1859, after having received his [[habilitation]] (certification for university teaching), he became ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in physics and chemistry at the University of [[Breslau]]. In 1866, Meyer accepted a post at the [[Eberswalde Forestry Academy]] at Neustadt-Eberswalde but two years later was appointed to a professorship at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Polytechnic]].<ref name=\"eb\">{{1911|wstitle=Meyer, Julius Lothar|volume=18|pages=348\u2013349}}</ref>\n\nIn 1872, Meyer was the first to suggest that the six [[carbon]] atoms in the [[benzene]] ring (that had been proposed a few years earlier by [[August Kekul\u00e9]]) were interconnected by single bonds only, the fourth valence of each carbon atom being directed toward the interior of the ring.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-German campaign]], the Polytechnic was used as a hospital, and Meyer took an active role in the care of the wounded. In 1876, Meyer became Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], where he served until his death.<ref name=\"eb\"/>\n\n==Periodic table==\nMeyer is best known for his part in the periodic classification of the elements. He noted, as [[J. A. R. Newlands]] did in England, if each element is arranged in the order of their atomic weights, they fall into groups of similar chemical and physical properties repeated at periodic intervals. According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates and the atomic volumes as abscissae\u2014the curve obtained a series of maxima and minima\u2014the most electro-positive elements appearing at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights.<ref name=\"eb\"/>\n\n[[File:Periodic table Meyer 1864.png|upright=1.75|thumb|Lothar Meyer's periodic table, published in \"Die modernen Theorien der Chemie\" (1864)<ref name = \"Meyer table\"> Meyer, Julius Lothar; Die modernen Theorien der Chemie (1864); table on page 137, https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb10073411.html?pageNo=147</ref>]]\nHis book, ''Die modernen Theorien der Chemie'', which he began writing in Breslau in 1862 and which was published two years later, contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by [[atomic weight]], until then had been stymied by the widespread use of equivalent weights for the elements, rather than atomic weights.<ref>{{cite book |author=Alan J. Rocke|title=Chemical Atomism in the Nineteenth Century: From Dalton to Cannizzaro|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=1984}}</ref>\n\nHe published articles about classification table of the elements in horizontal form (1864) and vertical form (1870), in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group.<ref>\n{{cite journal|author=Makeyev A.K. |title=Julius Lothar Meyer was first to build the periodic table of elements |url=http://www.ortpublishing.de/p/blog-page.html |journal=European Applied Sciences |year=2013 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=49\u201361 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715213743/http://www.ortpublishing.de/p/blog-page.html |archivedate=15 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published a periodic table of all elements known at that time (he later predicted several new elements to complete the table, and corrected some atomic weights).  A few months later, Meyer published a paper that included a revised version of his 1864 table that now included virtually all of the known elements, which was similar to the table published by Mendeleev.  Meyer had developed his fuller periodic table independently, but he acknowledged Mendeleev's priority. Included in Meyer's paper was a line chart of atomic volumes as a function of atomic weights, showing graphically the periodicity of the elements.  Like Mendeleev, he also included predictions of future elements, but unlike Mendeleev did not emphasize these predictions nor suggest details of the physical and chemical properties of the future elements.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Scerri|title=The Periodic Table: Its Story and Its Significance|url=https://archive.org/details/periodictableits0000scer|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1882, both Meyer and Mendeleev received the [[Davy Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]] in recognition of their work on the Periodic Law.\n\nThe newly discovered mineral lotharmeyerite, Ca(Zn,Mn<sup>3+</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u20222(H<sub>2</sub>O,OH), was named in recognition of Meyer's work on the Periodic Law in 1983.

Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the [[Swedish Vallhund]]. A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two.\n\nThe Pembroke is the more popular breed of the two, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi appearing on [[The Kennel Club]]'s list of [[Vulnerable Native Breeds]]. There are several physical differences between the two types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but [[Docking (animal)|docking]] had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis were more likely to have eye problems than the Cardigan breed. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained its popularity over the Cardigan Welsh Corgi because Queen [[Elizabeth II]] preferred the Pembroke. The favored corgis had longer bodies, thick coats of fur, and some are born without a tail.<ref name=\":0\" /> Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi-[[Dachshund]] crosses (known as [[Dog crossbreed#Portmanteau names|dorgis]]).\nCorgis are burrito dogs\n\n==History of the breed==\nWelsh Corgis have historically been used as [[herding dogs]], specifically for cattle. They are of the type of herding dog referred to as \"heelers\", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move.{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=17}} Both [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Cardiganshire|Cardigan]] are historically agricultural areas of Wales.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=7}} The combination of the low height off the ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle.{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=17}} The term \"Corgi\" means either [[cur]] dog or dwarf dog (''cor'' = dwarf, ''gi'' = [[lenition|lenitive]] of ''ci'', dog) in the [[Welsh language]], which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=7}} There is also a folk legend that says Corgis were a gift from the woodland fairies, and that the breed's markings were left on its coat by fairy harnesses and saddles; however, the origins of this legend are dubious.<ref>https://writinginmargins.weebly.com/home/did-fairies-really-ride-corgis</ref>{{sfn | Niccoli| 1989| p=4}}\n\nPembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are adjoining historical counties in SW Wales. The geographical distance{{Fix|text=there isn't any!}} between the two areas for which the modern breeds are named, may have resulted in separate evolution of the breeds.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=8}} Different tales have been told of the Corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry,{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=18}} while others attribute the import of the [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]] to [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers starting around the 10th century.{{sfn | McGreevy| 1999| p=300}} Further theories on the origin of the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either Deutsche Bracken, or the [[Dachshund]] breed.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=8}}\n\nThe [[Cardigan Welsh Corgi]] has been attributed to the influences of [[Norsemen|Nordic]] settlers in the region.{{sfn | McGreevy| 1999| p=301}} Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the [[Swedish Vallhund]],<ref name=\"canismajor\">{{cite web |url=http://www.canismajor.com/dog/corgi.html |last=Bennett Woolf|first=Norman|title=Welsh Corgis: Small Dogs With Big Dog Hearts |accessdate=27 June 2019}}</ref> and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=9}} Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the [[Welsh Sheepdog]], and this is the source of the [[Merle (dog coat)|merle]] colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh Corgis have been attributed to cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=9}}\n\nThe first recorded date for Corgis appearing in the show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership of 59 members. A general [[breed standard]] was drawn up, and Corgis began to appear in [[conformation shows]]. Until this point, neither breed had been specifically bred for looks. Members of this club were primarily interested in the Pembroke variety, although the Cardigan variety also appeared. At that point the breeds were referred to as the Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire varieties; the names were later shortened. There were a number of disputes between breeders of the two types in early shows, as judges who were breeders of one type would often favour them.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=10}} The Welsh Corgi appeared at [[Crufts]] for the first time in 1927.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local Successes at Crufts'|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19270210/043/0008|accessdate=10 April 2016|work=Hull Daily Mail|issue=12901|date=10 February 1927|page=8|url-access=subscription |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[Championship (dog)|Championship]] was awarded at a Cardiff show in 1928, to a red and white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach. The breeds continued to be judged together until 1934, when [[The Kennel Club]] recognised each breed separately. In that initial registration, some 59 Cardigans and 240 Pembrokes were listed in the pedigree books. The decisions about the breed to which each dog belonged were sometimes left to the owners, who were free to choose whichever they felt was the most appropriate.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=10}} The first dog to be named Best in Show at an open conformation show was [[Championship (dog)|Ch.]] Bowhit Pivot.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=13}}\n\nCardigan Welsh Corgis continued to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the [[Second World War]], although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 by the end of the war.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=10}} Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the [[English Cocker Spaniel]], the [[German Shepherd]] and the [[Pekingese]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Steinkoff|first1=Alan|title=Putting on Royal Dog|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4908918//|accessdate=11 April 2016|work=The Oil City Derrick|issue=27636|date=21 March 1953|page=8|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}</ref> In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten by the [[Poodle|Standard Poodle]] Ch.

She had previously been well known for breeding [[Old English Sheepdog]]s. Roesler purchased a Pembroke corgi, Little Madam, at London's [[Paddington Station]] for \u00a312. Wanting a mate for the dog, she visited several Corgi kennels and bought a dog called Captain William Lewis. The [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) first registered Welsh Corgis in 1934, as a single breed, and Little Madam was the first registered animal of the breed. The first litter was registered later that year, by Mr E.M. Tidd in Oakland, California, from a bitch named Toots which he had purchased in Canada.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=13}}\n\nTidd imported Ch. Bowhit Pivot for his breeding lines in 1935, registering him with the AKC as Sierra Bowhit Pivot. In addition to his British titles, he became the first Corgi to be awarded Champion status in the US, and the first such dog to be named [[Best of Group]] at a conformation show in the United States. A month after those achievements, Little Madam repeated his victories.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} The Pembroke Welsh Corgi club was formed in 1937,{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=13}} and the first show was held at [[Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge]]'s [[Giralda Farms]] in New Jersey. Following the Second World War, there were imports from the United Kingdom, including Rozavel Uncle Sam which dominated the show circuit for Corgis. In 1949, he became the first Pembroke winner of Best in Show at an open conformation show in the United States. By 1998, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 37th most popular breed of dog in the United States.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=14}}\n\nA pair of Cardigan Welsh Corgis were imported to the US in 1931, but the first member of that breed to be registered with the AKC was Blodwen of Robinscroft in 1935. They have never had the draw in the United States given to the Corgis of the Pembroke type. In 1997, some 752 Cardigan Welsh Corgis were registered with the AKC, compared to 8,281 of the Pembrokes.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=14}}\n\n==Modern breeds==\n[[file:Kelsey n Penny (Welsh Corgis).jpg|thumb|left|A Cardigan Welsh Corgi (''left'') and a Pembroke Welsh Corgi (''right'')]]\n[[File:Welsh Corgi Pembroke. St. Petersburg.jpg|thumb|Welsh Corgi Pembroke at Corgi Symphony 2019. March 17, 2019.]]\nThere are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each named for the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their [[Coat (animal)|coats]], which are water resistant and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer than that of the Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground.{{sfn | McGreevy| 1999| p=300}}{{sfn | McGreevy| 1999| p=301}} But they are not as square in outline as a typical [[Terrier]], or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund.{{sfn | Niccoli| 1989| p=6}} There are only minor differences in the shape of the head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=15}} It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.{{sfn | Niccoli| 1989| p=6}}\n\nCorgis in the modern era often compete in [[dog agility]] trials, [[obedience training|obedience]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], [[tracking (dog)|tracking]], and [[herding]] events. [[Herding]] instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Cardigan and Pembroke Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials&nbsp;\u2013 known colloquially as a \"mad run\".{{sfn | Hartnagle-Taylor|Taylor| 2010| p=82}} Welsh Corgis were once used to guard children.<ref name=\"canismajor\" />\n\n===Cardigan Welsh Corgi===\n[[File:WELSH CORGI CARDIGAN, Nickname\u2019s Bangaway (24264727026).jpg|thumb|A Cardigan Welsh Corgi]]\n\nThe differences between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large rounded ears and a {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=mid|-long}} fox-like, flowing tail set in line with the body.{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=18}} Though the Cardigan is allowed more colours than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its [[coat (dog)|coat]].{{sfn | Cunliffe  | 2000| p=237}} The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick.<ref name=\"canismajor\" /> According to the breed standard, the breed stands between {{convert|10.5|-|12.5|in|cm}} at the [[withers]], and should weigh between {{convert|30|-|38|lbs|kg}}. The skeletal structure of the Cardigan differs from the Pembroke, in that there is a more exaggerated bend in the front two legs, which fits around the [[ribcage]] of the animal. In addition, the Cardigan is more heavily set than the Pembroke, with denser bone mass.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=15}}\n\nThere are a greater number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed standard allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable and [[brindle]]. White markings are expected on this breed of Corgi, and one with a black coat is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle markings are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=16}} There are several disqualification criteria in the breed standard for the purpose of conformation showing. This would include drop ears, a white coat, blue eyes or non-solid black noses in dogs without merle colouration.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=17}}\n\n===Pembroke Welsh Corgi===\n[[File:Grupp 1, WELSH CORGI PEMBROKE, BE CH C.I.B.

They are low-set, intelligent, strong and sturdy with stamina sufficient to work a day on the farm.{{sfn | Cunliffe  | 2000| p=237}} The common height at the withers is between {{convert|10|-|12|in|cm}}, while a male dog of this breed should weigh no more than {{convert|30|lb|kg}}, and a female {{convert|25|lb|kg}}.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=15}}  The tail is shorter than that of a Cardigan, which can be accomplished through breeding or docking.{{sfn | Cunliffe  | 2000| p=237}} Historically, the Pembroke was a breed with a natural bob tail (a very short tail), and today, if the Pembroke has a tail at all, it is usually curly. Due to the advent of [[docking (dog)|tail docking in dogs]],{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=17}} the bobtail was not aggressively pursued, with breeders focusing instead on other characteristics, and the tail artificially shortened if need be. Given that some countries now ban docking, some breeders are again attempting to select dogs with the genes for natural bob tails.{{sfn | Hausman | Hausman |1997| pp=275-277}}\n\nFewer colors of coat appear in the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn and black, each of which can be with or without white markings. Plain white or grey coats can also be seen, but these would be considered to be a serious fault for the purposes of conformation shows.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=16}} However, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has no specific disqualification criteria present in the breed standard.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=17}}\n\nPembroke Welsh Corgis have two coats that vary in length along their body. The first coat is a shorter, inner coat that is resistant to harsh weather, while the outer coat is rougher and longer, but still of medium length. The length of the coat differs upon various parts of the body. Fur tends to be longer and thicker behind their fore and hind legs, as well as underneath their bodies. In addition, they appear to have more voluminous fur on their chest, neck, and shoulders. Pembroke Welsh corgis have shedding coats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Standard of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi|url=http://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/PembrokeWelshCorgi.pdf|website=American Kennel Club|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\nAccording to the Kennel Club ''Purebred Dog Health Survey'' conducted in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: the median age at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans.

Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the [[Swedish Vallhund]]. A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two.\n\nThe Pembroke is the more popular breed of the two, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi appearing on [[The Kennel Club]]'s list of [[Vulnerable Native Breeds]]. There are several physical differences between the two types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but [[Docking (animal)|docking]] had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis were more likely to have eye problems than the Cardigan breed. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained its popularity over the Cardigan Welsh Corgi because Queen [[Elizabeth II]] preferred the Pembroke. The favored corgis had longer bodies, thick coats of fur, and some are born without a tail.<ref name=\":0\" /> Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi-[[Dachshund]] crosses (known as [[Dog crossbreed#Portmanteau names|dorgis]]).\n\n==History of the breed==\nWelsh Corgis have historically been used as [[herding dogs]], specifically for cattle. They are of the type of herding dog referred to as \"heelers\", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move.{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=17}} Both [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Cardiganshire|Cardigan]] are historically agricultural areas of Wales.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=7}} The combination of the low height off the ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle.{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=17}} The term \"Corgi\" means either [[cur]] dog or dwarf dog (''cor'' = dwarf, ''gi'' = [[lenition|lenitive]] of ''ci'', dog) in the [[Welsh language]], which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=7}} There is also a folk legend that says Corgis were a gift from the woodland fairies, and that the breed's markings were left on its coat by fairy harnesses and saddles; however, the origins of this legend are dubious.<ref>https://writinginmargins.weebly.com/home/did-fairies-really-ride-corgis</ref>{{sfn | Niccoli| 1989| p=4}}\n\nPembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are adjoining historical counties in SW Wales. The geographical distance{{Fix|text=there isn't any!}} between the two areas for which the modern breeds are named, may have resulted in separate evolution of the breeds.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=8}} Different tales have been told of the Corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry,{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=18}} while others attribute the import of the [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]] to [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers starting around the 10th century.{{sfn | McGreevy| 1999| p=300}} Further theories on the origin of the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either Deutsche Bracken, or the [[Dachshund]] breed.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=8}}\n\nThe [[Cardigan Welsh Corgi]] has been attributed to the influences of [[Norsemen|Nordic]] settlers in the region.{{sfn | McGreevy| 1999| p=301}} Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the [[Swedish Vallhund]],<ref name=\"canismajor\">{{cite web |url=http://www.canismajor.com/dog/corgi.html |last=Bennett Woolf|first=Norman|title=Welsh Corgis: Small Dogs With Big Dog Hearts |accessdate=27 June 2019}}</ref> and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=9}} Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the [[Welsh Sheepdog]], and this is the source of the [[Merle (dog coat)|merle]] colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh Corgis have been attributed to cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=9}}\n\nThe first recorded date for Corgis appearing in the show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership of 59 members. A general [[breed standard]] was drawn up, and Corgis began to appear in [[conformation shows]]. Until this point, neither breed had been specifically bred for looks. Members of this club were primarily interested in the Pembroke variety, although the Cardigan variety also appeared. At that point the breeds were referred to as the Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire varieties; the names were later shortened. There were a number of disputes between breeders of the two types in early shows, as judges who were breeders of one type would often favour them.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=10}} The Welsh Corgi appeared at [[Crufts]] for the first time in 1927.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local Successes at Crufts'|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19270210/043/0008|accessdate=10 April 2016|work=Hull Daily Mail|issue=12901|date=10 February 1927|page=8|url-access=subscription |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[Championship (dog)|Championship]] was awarded at a Cardiff show in 1928, to a red and white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach. The breeds continued to be judged together until 1934, when [[The Kennel Club]] recognised each breed separately. In that initial registration, some 59 Cardigans and 240 Pembrokes were listed in the pedigree books. The decisions about the breed to which each dog belonged were sometimes left to the owners, who were free to choose whichever they felt was the most appropriate.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=10}} The first dog to be named Best in Show at an open conformation show was [[Championship (dog)|Ch.]] Bowhit Pivot.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=13}}\n\nCardigan Welsh Corgis continued to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940.

She had previously been well known for breeding [[Old English Sheepdog]]s. Roesler purchased a Pembroke corgi, Little Madam, at London's [[Paddington Station]] for \u00a312. Wanting a mate for the dog, she visited several Corgi kennels and bought a dog called Captain William Lewis. The [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) first registered Welsh Corgis in 1934, as a single breed, and Little Madam was the first registered animal of the breed. The first litter was registered later that year, by Mr E.M. Tidd in Oakland, California, from a bitch named Toots which he had purchased in Canada.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=13}}\n\nTidd imported Ch. Bowhit Pivot for his breeding lines in 1935, registering him with the AKC as Sierra Bowhit Pivot. In addition to his British titles, he became the first Corgi to be awarded Champion status in the US, and the first such dog to be named [[Best of Group]] at a conformation show in the United States. A month after those achievements, Little Madam repeated his victories.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} The Pembroke Welsh Corgi club was formed in 1937,{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=13}} and the first show was held at [[Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge]]'s [[Giralda Farms]] in New Jersey. Following the Second World War, there were imports from the United Kingdom, including Rozavel Uncle Sam which dominated the show circuit for Corgis. In 1949, he became the first Pembroke winner of Best in Show at an open conformation show in the United States. By 1998, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 37th most popular breed of dog in the United States.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=14}}\n\nA pair of Cardigan Welsh Corgis were imported to the US in 1931, but the first member of that breed to be registered with the AKC was Blodwen of Robinscroft in 1935. They have never had the draw in the United States given to the Corgis of the Pembroke type. In 1997, some 752 Cardigan Welsh Corgis were registered with the AKC, compared to 8,281 of the Pembrokes.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=14}}\n\n==Modern breeds==\n[[file:Kelsey n Penny (Welsh Corgis).jpg|thumb|left|A Cardigan Welsh Corgi (''left'') and a Pembroke Welsh Corgi (''right'')]]\n[[File:Welsh Corgi Pembroke.

The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=15}} It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.{{sfn | Niccoli| 1989| p=6}}\n\nCorgis in the modern era often compete in [[dog agility]] trials, [[obedience training|obedience]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], [[tracking (dog)|tracking]], and [[herding]] events. [[Herding]] instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Cardigan and Pembroke Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials&nbsp;\u2013 known colloquially as a \"mad run\".{{sfn | Hartnagle-Taylor|Taylor| 2010| p=82}} Welsh Corgis were once used to guard children.<ref name=\"canismajor\" />\n\n===Cardigan Welsh Corgi===\n[[File:WELSH CORGI CARDIGAN, Nickname\u2019s Bangaway (24264727026).jpg|thumb|A Cardigan Welsh Corgi]]\n\nThe differences between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large rounded ears and a {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=mid|-long}} fox-like, flowing tail set in line with the body.{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=18}} Though the Cardigan is allowed more colours than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its [[coat (dog)|coat]].{{sfn | Cunliffe  | 2000| p=237}} The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick.<ref name=\"canismajor\" /> According to the breed standard, the breed stands between {{convert|10.5|-|12.5|in|cm}} at the [[withers]], and should weigh between {{convert|30|-|38|lbs|kg}}. The skeletal structure of the Cardigan differs from the Pembroke, in that there is a more exaggerated bend in the front two legs, which fits around the [[ribcage]] of the animal. In addition, the Cardigan is more heavily set than the Pembroke, with denser bone mass.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=15}}\n\nThere are a greater number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed standard allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable and [[brindle]]. White markings are expected on this breed of Corgi, and one with a black coat is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle markings are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=16}} There are several disqualification criteria in the breed standard for the purpose of conformation showing. This would include drop ears, a white coat, blue eyes or non-solid black noses in dogs without merle colouration.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=17}}\n\n===Pembroke Welsh Corgi===\n[[File:Grupp 1, WELSH CORGI PEMBROKE, BE CH C.I.B.

They are low-set, intelligent, strong and sturdy with stamina sufficient to work a day on the farm.{{sfn | Cunliffe  | 2000| p=237}} The common height at the withers is between {{convert|10|-|12|in|cm}}, while a male dog of this breed should weigh no more than {{convert|30|lb|kg}}, and a female {{convert|25|lb|kg}}.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=15}}  The tail is shorter than that of a Cardigan, which can be accomplished through breeding or docking.{{sfn | Cunliffe  | 2000| p=237}} Historically, the Pembroke was a breed with a natural bob tail (a very short tail), and today, if the Pembroke has a tail at all, it is usually curly. Due to the advent of [[docking (dog)|tail docking in dogs]],{{sfn | Boorer| 1975| p=17}} the bobtail was not aggressively pursued, with breeders focusing instead on other characteristics, and the tail artificially shortened if need be. Given that some countries now ban docking, some breeders are again attempting to select dogs with the genes for natural bob tails.{{sfn | Hausman | Hausman |1997| pp=275-277}}\n\nFewer colors of coat appear in the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn and black, each of which can be with or without white markings. Plain white or grey coats can also be seen, but these would be considered to be a serious fault for the purposes of conformation shows.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=16}} However, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has no specific disqualification criteria present in the breed standard.{{sfn | Beauchamp| 1999| p=17}}\n\nPembroke Welsh Corgis have two coats that vary in length along their body. The first coat is a shorter, inner coat that is resistant to harsh weather, while the outer coat is rougher and longer, but still of medium length. The length of the coat differs upon various parts of the body. Fur tends to be longer and thicker behind their fore and hind legs, as well as underneath their bodies. In addition, they appear to have more voluminous fur on their chest, neck, and shoulders. Pembroke Welsh corgis have shedding coats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Standard of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi|url=http://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/PembrokeWelshCorgi.pdf|website=American Kennel Club|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\nAccording to the Kennel Club ''Purebred Dog Health Survey'' conducted in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: the median age at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans.
