Data sets formed from the long-term average of historical weather parameters are sometimes called a \"climatology\".]]\n\nVarious subfields of climatology study different aspects of the climate. There are different categorizations of the fields in climatology. The [[American Meteorological Society]] for instance identifies descriptive climatology, scientific climatology and applied climatology as the three subcategories of climatology, a categorization based on the complexity and the purpose of the research.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0096.xml|title=Climatology - Geography - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|last=Collins|first=Jennifer M.|date=25 October 2018|website=|language=en|doi=10.1093/obo/9780199874002-0096|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> Applied climatologists apply their expertise to different industries such as [[manufacturing]] and [[agriculture]].{{sfn|Wang|Gillies|2012|p=IX}}\n\n[[Paleoclimatology]] seeks to reconstruct and understand past climates by examining records such as [[ice cores]] and [[growth ring|tree rings]] ([[dendroclimatology]]). [[Paleotempestology]] uses these same records to help determine hurricane frequency over millennia.  [[Historical climatology]] is the study of climate as related to human history and thus focuses only on the last few thousand years.\n\nBoundary-layer climatology is preoccupied with exchanges in water, energy and momentum near the surface.<ref>{{harvnb|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=6}}</ref> Further identified subfields are physical climatology, dynamic climatology, [[tornado climatology]], regional climatology, [[bioclimatology]], applied climatology, and synoptic climatology. The study of the [[Water cycle|hydrological cycle]] at long time scales (hydroclimatology) is further subdivided within the subfields of snow climatology and hail climatology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Methods ==\nThe study of contemporary climates incorporates meteorological data accumulated over many years, such as records of rainfall, temperature and atmospheric composition. Knowledge of the atmosphere and its dynamics is also embodied in [[model (abstract)|models]], either [[statistical model|statistical]] or [[mathematical model|mathematical]], which help by integrating different observations and testing how they fit together. Modeling is used for understanding past, present and potential future climates.\n\nClimate research is made difficult by the large scale, long time periods, and complex processes which govern climate. Climate is governed by physical laws which can be expressed as [[differential equations]]. These equations are coupled and nonlinear, so that approximate solutions are obtained by using numerical methods to create [[global climate model]]s. Climate is sometimes modeled as a [[stochastic process]] but this is generally accepted as an approximation to processes that are otherwise too complicated to analyze.\n\n=== Climate data ===\nThe collection of long record of climate variables is essential for the study of climate. Climatology deals with the aggregate data that meteorology has collected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/processing-climate-data|title=How do weather observations become climate data? {{!}} NOAA Climate.gov|website=www.climate.gov|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> Scientists use both direct and indirect observations of the climate, from [[Earth observation satellite|Earth observing satellites]] and scientific instrumentation such as a global network of [[Thermometer|thermometers]], to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] ice extracted from [[Glacier|glaciers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/34/what-kinds-of-data-do-scientists-use-to-study-climate|title=What kinds of data do scientists use to study climate?|website=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> As measuring technology changes over time, records of data cannot be compared directly. As cities are generally warmer than the surrounding areas, [[urbanization]] has made it necessary to constantly correct data for this [[urban heat island]] effect.{{sfn|Rohli|Vega|2011|p=8}}\n\n=== Models ===\n{{Main|Climate models}}\nClimate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.  They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate.  All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any unbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth. Most climate models include the radiative effects of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]] such as [[carbon dioxide]]. These models predict an upward trend in the [[Instrumental temperature record|surface temperatures]], as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher latitudes.\n\nModels can range from relatively simple to complex:\n\n* A simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy\n* this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally\n* Coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean\u2013[[sea ice]] [[General circulation model|global climate models]] discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.\n*[[Earth system models]] further include the biosphere.\n\n== Topics of research ==\nTopics that climatologists study fall roughly into three categories: [[climate variability]], [[Climate change (general concept)|mechanisms of climate change]] and [[Global warming|modern climate change]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-climatology-3443689|title=How Climatology Is Different From Meteorology|last=Oblack|first=Rachelle|last2=McDougal|first2=Holt|date=3 July 2019|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-23|last3=weather.}}</ref>\n\n=== Climatological processes ===\nVarious factors impact the average state of the atmosphere at a particular location. For instance, midlatitudes will have a pronounced [[Season|seasonal cycle]] in temperature whereas [[Tropics|tropical regions]] show little variation in temperature over the year.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=25}} Another major control in climate is continentality: the distance to major water bodies such as [[Ocean|oceans]]. Oceans act as a moderating factor, so that land close to it has typically has mild [[Winter|winters]] and moderate summers.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=}} The atmosphere interacts with other spheres of the [[climate system]], with winds generating [[Ocean current|ocean currents]] that transport heat around the globe.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=54}}\n\n=== Climate classification ===\nClassification is an important aspect of many sciences as a tool of simplifying complicated processes. Different [[Climate classification|climate classifications]] have been developed over the centuries, with the first ones in [[Ancient Greece]]. How climates are classified depends on what the application is. A [[Wind power|wind energy]] producer will require different information (wind) in the classification than somebody interested in agriculture, for who precipitation and temperature are more important.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=159}} The most widely used classification, the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], was developed in the late nineteenth century and is based on vegetation. It uses monthly temperature and [[precipitation]] data.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=160}}\n\n=== Climate variability ===\n[[File:El Nino regional impacts.png|thumb|El Ni\u00f1o impacts]]\nThere are different modes of variability: recurring patterns of temperature or other climate variables. They are quantified with different indices. Much in the way the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], which is based on the stock prices of 30 companies, is used to represent the fluctuations in the stock market as a whole, climate indices are used to represent the essential elements of climate. Climate indices are generally devised with the twin objectives of simplicity and completeness, and each index typically represents the status and timing of the climate factor it represents. By their very nature, indices are simple, and combine many details into a generalized, overall description of the atmosphere or ocean which can be used to characterize the factors which impact the global climate system.\n\n[[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean responsible for most of the global variability in temperature,{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=54}} and has a cycle between two and seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|title=ENSO FAQ: How often do El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a typically occur?|accessdate=July 26, 2009|date=December 19, 2005|author=Climate Prediction Center|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827143632/http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|archive-date=August 27, 2009|url-status=dead|author-link=Climate Prediction Center}}</ref> The [[North Atlantic oscillation]] is a mode of variability that is mainly contained to the lower atmosphere, the [[troposphere]]. The layer of atmosphere above, the [[stratosphere]] is also capable of creating its own variability, most importantly in the [[Madden\u2013Julian oscillation]] (MJO), which has a cycle of approximately 30-60 days. The [[Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation|interdecadal pacific oscillation]] can create changes in the Pacific Ocean and lower atmosphere on decadal time scales.\n\n=== Climatic change ===\nClimate change occurs when changes in Earth's [[climate system]] result in new [[weather]] patterns that remain in place for an extended period of time. This length of time can be as short as a few decades to as long as millions of years. The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun. The climate system also gives off energy to [[outer space]]. The balance of incoming and outgoing energy, and the passage of the energy through the climate system, determines [[Earth's energy budget]]. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy, earth's energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and earth experiences cooling. Climate change also influences the average [[sea level]].\n\n[[Modern climate change]] is driven by the human emissions of [[greenhouse gas]] from the burning of fossil fuel driving up [[Surface air temperature|global mean surface temperatures]]. Rising temperatures are only one aspect of modern climate change though, with includes observed changes in [[precipitation]], [[Storm track|storm tracks]] and cloudiness. Warmer temperatures are driving further changes in the [[climate system]], such as the [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|widespread melt of glaciers]], [[sea level rise]] and shifts in flora and fauna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-effects/|title=Global Warming Effects|date=2019-01-14|website=National Geographic|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n== Differences with meteorology ==\nIn contrast to [[meteorology]], which focuses on short term [[weather]] systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. [[:Category:climatologists|Climatologists]] study both the nature of climates \u2013 local, regional or global \u2013 and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help [[prediction|predict]] future [[climate change]].\n\nPhenomena of climatological interest include the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], [[atmospheric circulation|circulation patterns]], [[heat transfer]] ([[thermal radiation|radiative]], [[convection|convective]] and [[latent heat flux|latent]]), interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans and land surface (particularly vegetation, [[land use]] and [[topography]]), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere.\n\n== Use in weather forecasting ==\n{{Main|Weather forecasting}}\nA more complicated way of making a forecast, the analog technique requires remembering a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event.  What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future.<ref>[http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/fcst/mth/oth.rxml Other Forecasting Methods:  climatology, analogue and numerical weather prediction.] Retrieved on February 16, 2006.</ref>  Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition, which remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans with knowledge of how satellite imagery relates to precipitation rates over land,<ref>Kenneth C.

The [[American Meteorological Society]] for instance identifies descriptive climatology, scientific climatology and applied climatology as the three subcategories of climatology, a categorization based on the complexity and the purpose of the research.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0096.xml|title=Climatology - Geography - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|last=Collins|first=Jennifer M.|date=25 October 2018|website=|language=en|doi=10.1093/obo/9780199874002-0096|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> Applied climatologists apply their expertise to different industries such as [[manufacturing]] and [[agriculture]].{{sfn|Wang|Gillies|2012|p=IX}}\n\n[[Paleoclimatology]] seeks to reconstruct and understand past climates by examining records such as [[ice cores]] and [[growth ring|tree rings]] ([[dendroclimatology]]). [[Paleotempestology]] uses these same records to help determine hurricane frequency over millennia.  [[Historical climatology]] is the study of climate as related to human history and thus focuses only on the last few thousand years.\n\nBoundary-layer climatology is preoccupied with exchanges in water, energy and momentum near the surface.<ref>{{harvnb|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=6}}</ref> Further identified subfields are physical climatology, dynamic climatology, [[tornado climatology]], regional climatology, [[bioclimatology]], applied climatology, and synoptic climatology. The study of the [[Water cycle|hydrological cycle]] at long time scales (hydroclimatology) is further subdivided within the subfields of snow climatology and hail climatology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Methods ==\nThe study of contemporary climates incorporates meteorological data accumulated over many years, such as records of rainfall, temperature and atmospheric composition. Knowledge of the atmosphere and its dynamics is also embodied in [[model (abstract)|models]], either [[statistical model|statistical]] or [[mathematical model|mathematical]], which help by integrating different observations and testing how they fit together. Modeling is used for understanding past, present and potential future climates.\n\nClimate research is made difficult by the large scale, long time periods, and complex processes which govern climate. Climate is governed by physical laws which can be expressed as [[differential equations]]. These equations are coupled and nonlinear, so that approximate solutions are obtained by using numerical methods to create [[global climate model]]s. Climate is sometimes modeled as a [[stochastic process]] but this is generally accepted as an approximation to processes that are otherwise too complicated to analyze.\n\n=== Climate data ===\nThe collection of long record of climate variables is essential for the study of climate. Climatology deals with the aggregate data that meteorology has collected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/processing-climate-data|title=How do weather observations become climate data? {{!}} NOAA Climate.gov|website=www.climate.gov|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> Scientists use both direct and indirect observations of the climate, from [[Earth observation satellite|Earth observing satellites]] and scientific instrumentation such as a global network of [[Thermometer|thermometers]], to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] ice extracted from [[Glacier|glaciers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/34/what-kinds-of-data-do-scientists-use-to-study-climate|title=What kinds of data do scientists use to study climate?|website=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> As measuring technology changes over time, records of data cannot be compared directly. As cities are generally warmer than the surrounding areas, [[urbanization]] has made it necessary to constantly correct data for this [[urban heat island]] effect.{{sfn|Rohli|Vega|2011|p=8}}\n\n=== Models ===\n{{Main|Climate models}}\nClimate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.  They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate.  All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any unbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth. Most climate models include the radiative effects of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]] such as [[carbon dioxide]]. These models predict an upward trend in the [[Instrumental temperature record|surface temperatures]], as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher latitudes.\n\nModels can range from relatively simple to complex:\n\n* A simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy\n* this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally\n* Coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean\u2013[[sea ice]] [[General circulation model|global climate models]] discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.\n*[[Earth system models]] further include the biosphere.\n\n== Topics of research ==\nTopics that climatologists study fall roughly into three categories: [[climate variability]], [[Climate change (general concept)|mechanisms of climate change]] and [[Global warming|modern climate change]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-climatology-3443689|title=How Climatology Is Different From Meteorology|last=Oblack|first=Rachelle|last2=McDougal|first2=Holt|date=3 July 2019|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-23|last3=weather.}}</ref>\n\n=== Climatological processes ===\nVarious factors impact the average state of the atmosphere at a particular location. For instance, midlatitudes will have a pronounced [[Season|seasonal cycle]] in temperature whereas [[Tropics|tropical regions]] show little variation in temperature over the year.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=25}} Another major control in climate is continentality: the distance to major water bodies such as [[Ocean|oceans]]. Oceans act as a moderating factor, so that land close to it has typically has mild [[Winter|winters]] and moderate summers.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=}} The atmosphere interacts with other spheres of the [[climate system]], with winds generating [[Ocean current|ocean currents]] that transport heat around the globe.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=54}}\n\n=== Climate classification ===\nClassification is an important aspect of many sciences as a tool of simplifying complicated processes. Different [[Climate classification|climate classifications]] have been developed over the centuries, with the first ones in [[Ancient Greece]]. How climates are classified depends on what the application is. A [[Wind power|wind energy]] producer will require different information (wind) in the classification than somebody interested in agriculture, for who precipitation and temperature are more important.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=159}} The most widely used classification, the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], was developed in the late nineteenth century and is based on vegetation. It uses monthly temperature and [[precipitation]] data.{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=160}}\n\n=== Climate variability ===\n[[File:El Nino regional impacts.png|thumb|El Ni\u00f1o impacts]]\nThere are different modes of variability: recurring patterns of temperature or other climate variables. They are quantified with different indices. Much in the way the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], which is based on the stock prices of 30 companies, is used to represent the fluctuations in the stock market as a whole, climate indices are used to represent the essential elements of climate. Climate indices are generally devised with the twin objectives of simplicity and completeness, and each index typically represents the status and timing of the climate factor it represents. By their very nature, indices are simple, and combine many details into a generalized, overall description of the atmosphere or ocean which can be used to characterize the factors which impact the global climate system.\n\n[[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean responsible for most of the global variability in temperature,{{Sfn|Rohli|Vega|2018|p=54}} and has a cycle between two and seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|title=ENSO FAQ: How often do El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a typically occur?|accessdate=July 26, 2009|date=December 19, 2005|author=Climate Prediction Center|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827143632/http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|archive-date=August 27, 2009|url-status=dead|author-link=Climate Prediction Center}}</ref> The [[North Atlantic oscillation]] is a mode of variability that is mainly contained to the lower atmosphere, the [[troposphere]]. The layer of atmosphere above, the [[stratosphere]] is also capable of creating its own variability, most importantly in the [[Madden\u2013Julian oscillation]] (MJO), which has a cycle of approximately 30-60 days. The [[Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation|interdecadal pacific oscillation]] can create changes in the pacific ocean and lower atmosphere on decadal time scales.\n\n=== Climatic change ===\nClimate change occurs when changes in Earth's [[climate system]] result in new [[weather]] patterns that remain in place for an extended period of time. This length of time can be as short as a few decades to as long as millions of years. The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun. The climate system also gives off energy to [[outer space]]. The balance of incoming and outgoing energy, and the passage of the energy through the climate system, determines [[Earth's energy budget]]. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy, earth's energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and earth experiences cooling. Climate change also influences the average [[sea level]].\n\n[[Modern climate change]] is driven by the human emissions of [[greenhouse gas]] from the burning of fossil fuel driving up [[Surface air temperature|global mean surface temperatures]]. Rising temperatures are only one aspect of modern climate change though, with includes observed changes in [[precipitation]], [[Storm track|storm tracks]] and cloudiness. Warmer temperatures are driving further changes in the [[climate system]], such as the [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|widespread melt of glaciers]], [[sea level rise]] and shifts in flora and fauna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-effects/|title=Global Warming Effects|date=2019-01-14|website=National Geographic|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n== Differences with meteorology ==\nIn contrast to [[meteorology]], which focuses on short term [[weather]] systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. [[:Category:climatologists|Climatologists]] study both the nature of climates \u2013 local, regional or global \u2013 and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help [[prediction|predict]] future [[climate change]].\n\nPhenomena of climatological interest include the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], [[atmospheric circulation|circulation patterns]], [[heat transfer]] ([[thermal radiation|radiative]], [[convection|convective]] and [[latent heat flux|latent]]), interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans and land surface (particularly vegetation, [[land use]] and [[topography]]), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere.\n\n== Use in weather forecasting ==\n{{Main|Weather forecasting}}\nA more complicated way of making a forecast, the analog technique requires remembering a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event.  What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future.<ref>[http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/fcst/mth/oth.rxml Other Forecasting Methods:  climatology, analogue and numerical weather prediction.] Retrieved on February 16, 2006.</ref>  Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition, which remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans with knowledge of how satellite imagery relates to precipitation rates over land,<ref>Kenneth C.

Paleoclimatology uses a variety of [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] methods from the [[Earth sciences|Earth]] and [[life sciences]] to obtain data previously preserved within [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[sediment]]s, [[Borehole|boreholes]], [[ice sheet]]s, [[tree ring]]s, [[coral]]s, [[mollusc shell|shells]], and [[microfossil]]s. Combined with techniques to date the proxies, these paleoclimate records are used to determine the past states of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. \n\nThe scientific field of paleoclimatology came to maturity in the 20th century. Notable periods studied by paleoclimatologists are the frequent [[Glacial period|glaciations]] the Earth has undergone, rapid cooling events such as the [[Younger Dryas]], and the fast rate of warming during the [[Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum]]. Studies of past changes in the environment and biodiversity often reflect on the current situation, specifically the impact of climate on [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]] and biotic recovery and current [[global warming]].<ref name=\"SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction\">{{cite journal|url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf|last1=Sahney|first1=S.|last2=Benton|first2=M.J.|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2008|title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370|volume=275|pages=759\u201365|pmid=18198148|issue=1636|pmc=2596898}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Cronin|2010|p=1}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of climate change science|Historical climatology}}\nNotions of a changing climate probably evolved in [[ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]] and [[History of China|China]], where prolonged periods of droughts and floods were experienced.<ref name=Fairbridge>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Paleoclimatology and Ancient Environments|chapter=history of paleoclimatology|last=Fairbridge|first=Rhodes|editor-last=Gornitz|editor-first=Vivien|pp=414\u2013426|isbn=978-1-4020-4551-6|publisher=Springer Nature|date=31 October 2008}}</ref> In the seventeenth century, [[Robert Hooke]] postulated that fossils of giant turtles found in Dorset could only be explained by a once warmer climate, which he thought could be explained by a shift in Earth's axis.<ref name=Fairbridge /> Fossils were in that time often explained as a consequence of a Biblical flood.<ref name='Cronin' /> Systematic observations of sunspots started by amateur astronomer [[Heinrich Schwabe]] in the early 19th century, starting a discussion of the Sun's influence on Earth's climate.<ref name=\"Fairbridge\" />\n\nThe scientific study field of paleoclimatology began to further take shape in the early 19th century, when discoveries about glaciations and natural changes in Earth's past climate helped to understand the [[greenhouse effect]]. It was only in the 20th century that paleoclimatology became a unified scientific field. Before, different aspects of Earth's climate history were studied by a variety of disciplines.<ref name='Cronin'>{{Cite book|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/principles-of-paleoclimatology/9780231109550|title=Principles of Paleoclimatology|last=Cronin|first=Thomas M.|date=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231503044|pp=8\u201310}}</ref> At the end of the 20th century, the empirical research into Earth's ancient climates started to be combined with computer models of increasing complexity. A new objective also developed in this period: finding ancient analog climates that could provide information about current [[global warming|climate change]].<ref name='Cronin' />\n\n==Reconstructing ancient climates==\n[[File:All palaeotemps.svg|thumb|right|600px|Palaeotemperature graphs compressed together]]\n[[File:Sauerstoffgehalt-1000mj.svg|thumb|360px|The oxygen content in the atmosphere over the last billion years]]\n{{Main|Proxy (climate)}}\nPaleoclimatologists employ a wide variety of techniques to deduce ancient climates. The techniques used depend on which variable has to be reconstructed ([[temperature]], [[precipitation]] or something else) and on how long ago the climate of interest occurred. For instance, the deep marine record, the source of most isotopic data, exists only on oceanic plates, which are eventually [[subduction|subducted]]: the oldest remaining material is {{ma|200|million years}} old. Older sediments are also more prone to corruption by [[diagenesis]]. Resolution and confidence in the data decrease over time.\n\n===Proxies for climate===\n\n====Ice====\nMountain [[glacier]]s and the polar [[ice caps]]/[[ice sheets]] provide much data in paleoclimatology. Ice-coring projects in the ice caps of [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] have yielded data going back several hundred thousand years, over 800,000 years in the case of the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] project.\n\n* Air trapped within fallen [[snow]] becomes encased in tiny bubbles as the snow is compressed into ice in the glacier under the weight of later years' snow. The trapped air has proven a tremendously valuable source for direct measurement of the composition of air from the time the ice was formed.\n* Layering can be observed because of seasonal pauses in ice accumulation and can be used to establish chronology, associating specific depths of the core with ranges of time.\n* Changes in the layering thickness can be used to determine changes in precipitation or temperature.\n* [[Oxygen-18]] quantity changes ({{delta|18|O|link}}) in ice layers represent changes in average ocean surface temperature. Water molecules containing the heavier O-18 evaporate at a higher temperature than water molecules containing the normal [[Oxygen-16]] isotope. The ratio of O-18 to O-16 will be higher as temperature increases. It also depends on other factors such as the water's salinity and the volume of water locked up in ice sheets. Various cycles in those isotope ratios have been detected.\n* [[Pollen#Pollen in the fossil record|Pollen]] has been observed in the ice cores and can be used to understand which plants were present as the layer formed. Pollen is produced in abundance and its distribution is typically well understood. A pollen count for a specific layer can be produced by observing the total amount of pollen categorized by type (shape) in a controlled sample of that layer. Changes in plant frequency over time can be plotted through statistical analysis of pollen counts in the core. Knowing which plants were present leads to an understanding of precipitation and temperature, and types of fauna present. [[Palynology]] includes the study of pollen for these purposes.\n* [[Volcanic ash]] is contained in some layers, and can be used to establish the time of the layer's formation. Each volcanic event distributed ash with a unique set of properties (shape and color of particles, chemical signature). Establishing the ash's source will establish a range of time to associate with layer of ice.\n\nA multinational consortium, the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica]] (EPICA), has drilled an ice core in Dome C on the East Antarctic ice sheet and retrieved ice from roughly 800,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jouzel|first=Jean|title=Orbital and Millennial Antarctic Climate Variability over the Past 800,000 Years|journal=Science|date=10 August 2007|volume=317|pages=793\u2013796|doi=10.1126/science.1141038|last2=Masson-Delmotte|first2=V.|last3=Cattani|first3=O.|last4=Dreyfus|first4=G.|last5=Falourd|first5=S.|last6=Hoffmann|first6=G.|last7=Minster|first7=B.|last8=Nouet|first8=J.|last9=Barnola|first9=J.

Generally, trees respond to changes in climatic variables by speeding up or slowing down growth, which in turn is generally reflected by a greater or lesser thickness in growth rings. Different species, however, respond to changes in climatic variables in different ways. A tree-ring record is established by compiling information from many living trees in a specific area.\n\nOlder intact wood that has escaped decay can extend the time covered by the record by matching the ring depth changes to contemporary specimens. By using that method, some areas have tree-ring records dating back a few thousand years. Older wood not connected to a contemporary record can be dated generally with radiocarbon techniques. A tree-ring record can be used to produce information regarding precipitation, temperature, hydrology, and fire corresponding to a particular area.\n\n====Sedimentary content====\nOn a longer time scale, geologists must refer to the sedimentary record for data.\n\n* Sediments, sometimes lithified to form rock, may contain remnants of preserved vegetation, animals, plankton, or [[palynology|pollen]], which may be characteristic of certain climatic zones.\n* Biomarker molecules such as the [[alkenones]] may yield information about their temperature of formation.\n* Chemical signatures, particularly [[Mg/Ca]] ratio of [[calcite]] in [[Foraminifera]] tests, can be used to reconstruct past temperature.\n* Isotopic ratios can provide further information. Specifically, the {{delta|18|O|link}} record responds to changes in temperature and ice volume, and the {{delta|13|C|link}} record reflects a range of factors, which are often difficult to disentangle.\n\n[[File:Core+Repository+core samples2.jpg|right|thumb|Sea floor core sample labelled to identify the exact spot on the sea floor where the sample was taken. Sediments from nearby locations can show significant differences in chemical and biological composition.]]\n;[[Sedimentary facies]]\nOn a longer time scale, the rock record may show signs of [[sea level]] rise and fall, and features such as [[Dune#Lithified dunes|\"fossilised\" sand dunes]] can be identified. Scientists can get a grasp of long term climate by studying [[sedimentary rock]] going back billions of years. The division of earth history into separate periods is largely based on visible changes in sedimentary rock layers that demarcate major changes in conditions. Often, they include major shifts in climate.\n\n====Sclerochronology====\n\n;Corals (see also [[sclerochronology]])\nCoral \"rings\" are similar to tree rings except that they respond to different things, such as the water temperature, freshwater influx, pH changes, and wave action. From there, certain equipment can be used to derive the sea surface temperature and water salinity from the past few centuries. The \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O of [[coralline algae|coralline]] red algae provides a useful proxy of the combined sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity at high latitudes and the tropics, where many traditional techniques are limited.<ref name=Geology2008>{{cite journal|last=Halfar|first=J.|year=2008|doi=10.1130/G24635A.1|title=Coralline red algae as high-resolution climate recorders|journal=Geology|volume=36|pages=463|last2=Steneck|first2=R.S.|last3=Joachimski|first3=M.|last4=Kronz|first4=A.|last5=Wanamaker|first5=A.D.|issue=6|bibcode=2008Geo....36..463H}}</ref><ref name=Cobb>{{cite journal|last1=Cobb|first1=K.|last2=Charles|first2=C.

For recent proxy archives of tree rings and corals the individual year rings can be counted and an exact year can be determined. [[Radiometric dating]] uses the properties of radioactive elements in proxies. In older material, more of the radioactive material will have decayed and the proportion of different elements will be different than of newer proxies. One example of radiometric dating is [[radiocarbon dating]]. In the air, [[Cosmic ray|cosmic rays]] constantly convert nitrogen into a specific radioactive carbon isotope, [[Carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]]. When plants then use this carbon to grow, this isotope is not replenished anymore and starts decaying. The proportion of 'normal' carbon and Carbon-14 gives information of how long the plant material has not been in contact with the atmosphere.<ref>{{harvnb|Cronin|2010|pp=32-34}}.</ref>\n\n==Notable climate events in Earth history==\n{{See also|List of periods and events in climate history|Timeline of glaciation|History of Earth}}\n\nKnowledge of precise climatic events decreases as the record goes back in time, but some notable climate events are known:\n* [[Faint young Sun paradox]] (start)\n* [[Huronian glaciation]] (~2400 Mya Earth completely covered in ice probably due to [[Great Oxygenation Event]])\n* Later Neoproterozoic [[Snowball Earth]] (~600 Mya, precursor to the [[Cambrian Explosion]])\n* [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] (~450 Mya)\n* [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (~300 Mya)\n* [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] (251.4 Mya)\n* [[Anoxic event|Oceanic anoxic events]] (~120 Mya, 93 Mya, and others)\n* [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] ({{period start|Paleogene}} Mya)\n* [[Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum]] ([[Paleocene]]\u2013[[Eocene]], 55Mya)\n* [[Younger Dryas]]/The Big Freeze (~11,000 BC)\n* [[Holocene climatic optimum]] (~7000\u20133000 BC)\n* [[Extreme weather events of 535\u2013536]] (535\u2013536 AD)\n* [[Medieval Warm Period]] (900\u20131300)\n* [[Little Ice Age]] (1300\u20131800)\n* [[Year Without a Summer]] (1816)\n\n==History of the atmosphere==\n{{Life timeline}}\n{{See also|Atmosphere of Earth|History of Earth}}\n\n===Earliest atmosphere===\nThe [[paleoatmosphere|first atmosphere]] would have consisted of gases in the [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|solar nebula]], primarily [[hydrogen]]. In addition, there would probably have been simple [[hydride]]s such as those now found in gas giants like [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], notably [[water]] vapor, [[methane]], and [[ammonia]]. As the solar nebula dissipated, the gases would have escaped, partly driven off by the [[solar wind]].<ref name=Zahnle>{{cite journal|last1=Zahnle|first1=K.|last2=Schaefer|first2=L.|last3=Fegley|first3=B.|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a004895|title=Earth's Earliest Atmospheres|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|volume=2|issue=10|pages=a004895|year=2010|pmid=20573713|pmc=2944365}}</ref>\n\n===Second atmosphere===\nThe next atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and inert gases, was produced by outgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge [[asteroids]].<ref name=Zahnle/> A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.\n\nWater-related sediments have been found dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.<ref>B. Windley: ''The Evolving Continents.'' Wiley Press, New York 1984</ref> About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen was the major part of the then stable \"second atmosphere\". An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere because hints of early life forms have been dated to as early as 3.5 billion years ago.<ref>J. Schopf: ''Earth's Earliest Biosphere: Its Origin and Evolution.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1983</ref> The fact that it is not perfectly in line with the 30% lower solar radiance (compared to today) of the early Sun has been described as the \"[[faint young Sun paradox]]\".\n\nThe geological record, however, shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early [[temperature record]] of Earth with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late [[Archean|Archaean]] eon, an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently from photosynthesizing [[cyanobacteria]] (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]) which have been found as [[stromatolite]] fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy ([[isotope ratio]] proportions) was very much in line with what is found today, suggesting that the fundamental features of the [[carbon cycle]] were established as early as 4 billion years ago.\n\n===Third atmosphere===\nThe constant rearrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], and its appearance is indicated by the end of the [[banded iron formations]]. Until then, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials. That point was a shift from a [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere to an [[oxidizing]] atmosphere. O<sub>2</sub> showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.<ref>Christopher R. Scotese, [http://www.scotese.com/precamb_chart.htm Back to Earth History: Summary Chart for the Precambrian], Paleomar Project</ref> The following time span was the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, during which oxygen-breathing [[metazoan]] life forms began to appear.\n\nThe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of 35%<ref name=Beerling2007>{{cite book|last=Beerling|first=David|author-link=David Beerling|year=2007|title=The emerald planet: how plants changed Earth's history|publisher=Oxford University press|isbn=9780192806024|page=47}}</ref> during the [[Carboniferous]] period, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: plants [[photosynthesis|use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]], releasing oxygen and the breakdown of [[pyrite]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s release [[sulfur]] into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for rapid development of animals.<ref>Peter Ward:[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11630] Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere</ref>\n\n==Climate during geological ages==\n[[File:GlaciationsinEarthExistancelicenced annotated.jpg|thumb|600px|right|Timeline of glaciations, shown in blue]]\n{{See also|Timeline of glaciation}}\n* The [[Huronian glaciation]], is the first known glaciation in Earth's history, and lasted from 2400-2100 million years ago.\n* The [[Cryogenian glaciation]] lasted from 720-635 million years ago.\n* The [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] lasted from 450\u2013420 million years ago.\n* The [[Karoo glaciation]] lasted from 360\u2013260 million years ago.\n* The [[Quaternary glaciation]] is the current glaciation period and began 2.58 million years ago.\n\n===Precambrian climate===\n{{Main|Precambrian}}\nThe climate of the late Precambrian showed some major [[glaciation]] events spreading over much of the earth. At this time the continents were bunched up in the [[Rodinia]] supercontinent. Massive deposits of [[tillite]]s and anomalous [[isotopic signature]]s are found, which gave rise to the [[Snowball Earth]] hypothesis. As the [[Proterozoic|Proterozoic Eon]] drew to a close, the Earth started to warm up. By the dawn of the Cambrian and the Phanerozoic, life forms were abundant in the [[Cambrian explosion]] with average global temperatures of about 22 \u00b0[[Celsius|C]].\n\n===Phanerozoic climate===\n[[File:Phanerozoic Climate Change.png|thumb|450px|Changes in [[oxygen-18]] ratios over the last 500 million years, indicating climate change]]\n{{Main|Phanerozoic}}\nMajor drivers for the preindustrial ages have been variations of the sun, volcanic ashes and exhalations, relative movements of the earth towards the sun, and tectonically induced effects as for major sea currents, watersheds, and ocean oscillations. In the early Phanerozoic, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have been linked to driving or amplifying increased global temperatures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Came|first=Rosemarie E.|last2=Eiler|first2=John M.|last3=Veizer|first3=Jan|last4=Azmy|first4=Karem|last5=Brand|first5=Uwe|last6=Weidman|first6=Christopher R|title=Coupling of surface temperatures and atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations during the Palaeozoic era|journal=Nature|volume=449|pages=198\u2013201|date=September 2007|doi=10.1038/nature06085|pmid=17851520|issue=7159|bibcode=2007Natur.449..198C|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/35545/2/nature06085-s1.pdf}}</ref> Royer et al. 2004<ref name=\"Dana\">{{cite journal|last1=Royer|first1=Dana L.|last2=Berner|first2=Robert A.|last3=Monta\u00f1ez|first3=Isabel P.|last4=Tabor|first4=Neil J.|last5=Beerling|first5=David J.|author5-link=David J.

The constant rearrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] can also shape long-term climate evolution.

Notable periods studied by paleoclimatologists are the frequent [[Glacial period|glaciations]] the Earth has undergone, rapid cooling events such as the [[Younger Dryas]], and the fast rate of warming during the [[Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum]].

A new objective also developed in this period: finding ancient analog climates that could provide information about current [[global warming|climate change]].<ref name='Cronin' />\n\n==Reconstructing ancient climates==\n[[File:All palaeotemps.svg|thumb|right|600px|Palaeotemperature graphs compressed together]]\n[[File:Sauerstoffgehalt-1000mj.svg|thumb|360px|The oxygen content in the atmosphere over the last billion years]]\n{{Main|Proxy (climate)}}\nPaleoclimatologists employ a wide variety of techniques to deduce ancient climates. The techniques used depend on which variable has to be reconstructed ([[temperature]], [[precipitation]] or something else) and on how long ago the climate of interest occurred. For instance, the deep marine record, the source of most isotopic data, exists only on oceanic plates, which are eventually [[subduction|subducted]]: the oldest remaining material is {{ma|200|million years}} old. Older sediments are also more prone to corruption by [[diagenesis]]. Resolution and confidence in the data decrease over time.\n\n===Proxies for climate===\n\n====Ice====\nMountain [[glacier]]s and the polar [[ice caps]]/[[ice sheets]] provide much data in paleoclimatology. Ice-coring projects in the ice caps of [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] have yielded data going back several hundred thousand years, over 800,000 years in the case of the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] project.\n\n* Air trapped within fallen [[snow]] becomes encased in tiny bubbles as the snow is compressed into ice in the glacier under the weight of later years' snow. The trapped air has proven a tremendously valuable source for direct measurement of the composition of air from the time the ice was formed.\n* Layering can be observed because of seasonal pauses in ice accumulation and can be used to establish chronology, associating specific depths of the core with ranges of time.\n* Changes in the layering thickness can be used to determine changes in precipitation or temperature.\n* [[Oxygen-18]] quantity changes ({{delta|18|O|link}}) in ice layers represent changes in average ocean surface temperature. Water molecules containing the heavier O-18 evaporate at a higher temperature than water molecules containing the normal [[Oxygen-16]] isotope. The ratio of O-18 to O-16 will be higher as temperature increases. It also depends on other factors such as the water's salinity and the volume of water locked up in ice sheets. Various cycles in those isotope ratios have been detected.\n* [[Pollen#Pollen in the fossil record|Pollen]] has been observed in the ice cores and can be used to understand which plants were present as the layer formed. Pollen is produced in abundance and its distribution is typically well understood. A pollen count for a specific layer can be produced by observing the total amount of pollen categorized by type (shape) in a controlled sample of that layer. Changes in plant frequency over time can be plotted through statistical analysis of pollen counts in the core. Knowing which plants were present leads to an understanding of precipitation and temperature, and types of fauna present. [[Palynology]] includes the study of pollen for these purposes.\n* [[Volcanic ash]] is contained in some layers, and can be used to establish the time of the layer's formation. Each volcanic event distributed ash with a unique set of properties (shape and color of particles, chemical signature). Establishing the ash's source will establish a range of time to associate with layer of ice.\n\nA multinational consortium, the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica]] (EPICA), has drilled an ice core in Dome C on the East Antarctic ice sheet and retrieved ice from roughly 800,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jouzel|first=Jean|title=Orbital and Millennial Antarctic Climate Variability over the Past 800,000 Years|journal=Science|date=10 August 2007|volume=317|pages=793\u2013796|doi=10.1126/science.1141038|last2=Masson-Delmotte|first2=V.|last3=Cattani|first3=O.|last4=Dreyfus|first4=G.|last5=Falourd|first5=S.|last6=Hoffmann|first6=G.|last7=Minster|first7=B.|last8=Nouet|first8=J.|last9=Barnola|first9=J.

Generally, trees respond to changes in climatic variables by speeding up or slowing down growth, which in turn is generally reflected by a greater or lesser thickness in growth rings. Different species, however, respond to changes in climatic variables in different ways. A tree-ring record is established by compiling information from many living trees in a specific area.\n\nOlder intact wood that has escaped decay can extend the time covered by the record by matching the ring depth changes to contemporary specimens. By using that method, some areas have tree-ring records dating back a few thousand years. Older wood not connected to a contemporary record can be dated generally with radiocarbon techniques. A tree-ring record can be used to produce information regarding precipitation, temperature, hydrology, and fire corresponding to a particular area.\n\n====Sedimentary content====\nOn a longer time scale, geologists must refer to the sedimentary record for data.\n\n* Sediments, sometimes lithified to form rock, may contain remnants of preserved vegetation, animals, plankton, or [[palynology|pollen]], which may be characteristic of certain climatic zones.\n* Biomarker molecules such as the [[alkenones]] may yield information about their temperature of formation.\n* Chemical signatures, particularly [[Mg/Ca]] ratio of [[calcite]] in [[Foraminifera]] tests, can be used to reconstruct past temperature.\n* Isotopic ratios can provide further information. Specifically, the {{delta|18|O|link}} record responds to changes in temperature and ice volume, and the {{delta|13|C|link}} record reflects a range of factors, which are often difficult to disentangle.\n\n[[File:Core+Repository+core samples2.jpg|right|thumb|Sea floor core sample labelled to identify the exact spot on the sea floor where the sample was taken. Sediments from nearby locations can show significant differences in chemical and biological composition.]]\n;[[Sedimentary facies]]\nOn a longer time scale, the rock record may show signs of [[sea level]] rise and fall, and features such as [[Dune#Lithified dunes|\"fossilised\" sand dunes]] can be identified. Scientists can get a grasp of long term climate by studying [[sedimentary rock]] going back billions of years. The division of earth history into separate periods is largely based on visible changes in sedimentary rock layers that demarcate major changes in conditions. Often, they include major shifts in climate.\n\n====Sclerochronology====\n\n;Corals (see also [[sclerochronology]])\nCoral \"rings\" are similar to tree rings except that they respond to different things, such as the water temperature, freshwater influx, pH changes, and wave action. From there, certain equipment can be used to derive the sea surface temperature and water salinity from the past few centuries. The \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O of [[coralline algae|coralline]] red algae provides a useful proxy of the combined sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity at high latitudes and the tropics, where many traditional techniques are limited.<ref name=Geology2008>{{cite journal|last=Halfar|first=J.|year=2008|doi=10.1130/G24635A.1|title=Coralline red algae as high-resolution climate recorders|journal=Geology|volume=36|pages=463|last2=Steneck|first2=R.S.|last3=Joachimski|first3=M.|last4=Kronz|first4=A.|last5=Wanamaker|first5=A.D.|issue=6|bibcode=2008Geo....36..463H}}</ref><ref name=Cobb>{{cite journal|last1=Cobb|first1=K.|last2=Charles|first2=C.

For recent proxy archives of tree rings and corals the individual year rings can be counted and an exact year can be determined. [[Radiometric dating]] uses the properties of radioactive elements in proxies. In older material, more of the radioactive material will have decayed and the proportion of different elements will be different than of newer proxies. One example of radiometric dating is [[radiocarbon dating]]. In the air, [[Cosmic ray|cosmic rays]] constantly convert nitrogen into a specific radioactive carbon isotope, [[Carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]]. When plants then use this carbon to grow, this isotope is not replenished anymore and starts decaying. The proportion of 'normal' carbon and Carbon-14 gives information of how long the plant material has not been in contact with the atmosphere.<ref>{{harvnb|Cronin|2010|pp=32-34}}.</ref>\n\n==Notable climate events in Earth history==\n{{See also|List of periods and events in climate history|Timeline of glaciation|History of Earth}}\n\nKnowledge of precise climatic events decreases as the record goes back in time, but some notable climate events are known:\n* [[Faint young Sun paradox]] (start)\n* [[Huronian glaciation]] (~2400 Mya Earth completely covered in ice probably due to [[Great Oxygenation Event]])\n* Later Neoproterozoic [[Snowball Earth]] (~600 Mya, precursor to the [[Cambrian Explosion]])\n* [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] (~450 Mya)\n* [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (~300 Mya)\n* [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] (251.4 Mya)\n* [[Anoxic event|Oceanic anoxic events]] (~120 Mya, 93 Mya, and others)\n* [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] ({{period start|Paleogene}} Mya)\n* [[Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum]] ([[Paleocene]]\u2013[[Eocene]], 55Mya)\n* [[Younger Dryas]]/The Big Freeze (~11,000 BC)\n* [[Holocene climatic optimum]] (~7000\u20133000 BC)\n* [[Extreme weather events of 535\u2013536]] (535\u2013536 AD)\n* [[Medieval Warm Period]] (900\u20131300)\n* [[Little Ice Age]] (1300\u20131800)\n* [[Year Without a Summer]] (1816)\n\n==History of the atmosphere==\n{{Life timeline}}\n{{See also|Atmosphere of Earth|History of Earth}}\n\n===Earliest atmosphere===\nThe [[paleoatmosphere|first atmosphere]] would have consisted of gases in the [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|solar nebula]], primarily [[hydrogen]].

The early basic carbon isotopy ([[isotope ratio]] proportions) was very much in line with what is found today, suggesting that the fundamental features of the [[carbon cycle]] were established as early as 4 billion years ago.\n\n===Third atmosphere===\nThe constant rearrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], and its appearance is indicated by the end of the [[banded iron formations]]. Until then, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials. That point was a shift from a [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere to an [[oxidizing]] atmosphere. O<sub>2</sub> showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.<ref>Christopher R. Scotese, [http://www.scotese.com/precamb_chart.htm Back to Earth History: Summary Chart for the Precambrian], Paleomar Project</ref> The following time span was the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, during which oxygen-breathing [[metazoan]] life forms began to appear.\n\nThe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of 35%<ref name=Beerling2007>{{cite book|last=Beerling|first=David|author-link=David Beerling|year=2007|title=The emerald planet: how plants changed Earth's history|publisher=Oxford University press|isbn=9780192806024|page=47}}</ref> during the [[Carboniferous]] period, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: plants [[photosynthesis|use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]], releasing oxygen and the breakdown of [[pyrite]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s release [[sulfur]] into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for rapid development of animals.<ref>Peter Ward:[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11630] Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere</ref>\n\n==Climate during geological ages==\n[[File:GlaciationsinEarthExistancelicenced annotated.jpg|thumb|600px|right|Timeline of glaciations, shown in blue]]\n{{See also|Timeline of glaciation}}\n* The [[Huronian glaciation]], is the first known glaciation in Earth's history, and lasted from 2400-2100 million years ago.\n* The [[Cryogenian glaciation]] lasted from 720-635 million years ago.\n* The [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] lasted from 450\u2013420 million years ago.\n* The [[Karoo glaciation]] lasted from 360\u2013260 million years ago.\n* The [[Quaternary glaciation]] is the current glaciation period and began 2.58 million years ago.\n\n===Precambrian climate===\n{{Main|Precambrian}}\nThe climate of the late Precambrian showed some major [[glaciation]] events spreading over much of the earth. At this time the continents were bunched up in the [[Rodinia]] supercontinent. Massive deposits of [[tillite]]s and anomalous [[isotopic signature]]s are found, which gave rise to the [[Snowball Earth]] hypothesis. As the [[Proterozoic|Proterozoic Eon]] drew to a close, the Earth started to warm up.

The constant rearrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] can also shape long-term climate evolution. However, the presence or absence of land masses at the poles is not sufficient to guarantee glaciations or exclude polar ice caps. Evidence exists of past warm periods in Earth's climate when polar land masses similar to [[Antarctica]] were home to [[deciduous]] forests rather than ice sheets.\n\nThe relatively warm local minimum between [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] goes along with an increase of subduction and mid-ocean ridge volcanism <ref>{{cite journal|author1=Douwe G.

The Russians originally called the Kazakhs 'Kirgiz' and later Kirghiz-Kaisak to distinguish them from the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] proper.\n\nIn the 17th century, Russian convention seeking to distinguish the Qazaqs of the steppes from the [[Cossacks]] of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] suggested spelling the final consonant with \"kh\" instead of \"q\" or \"k\", which was officially adopted by the USSR in 1936.<ref>[[:s:ru:\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0426\u0418\u041a \u0438 \u0421\u041d\u041a \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0410\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u00ab\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u00bb|\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0426\u0418\u041a \u0438 \u0421\u041d\u041a \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0410\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u2116 133 \u043e\u0442 5.02.1936 \u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u00ab\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u00bb]]</ref>\n* Kazakh&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|ru|\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445}}\n* Cossack&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|ru|\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a}}\n\nThe Ukrainian term Cossack probably comes from the same Kypchak etymological root: wanderer, brigand, independent free-booter.\n\n=== Oral history ===\nTheir [[nomad]]ic pastoral lifestyle made Kazakhs keep an epic tradition of [[oral history]]. The nation, which amalgamated nomadic tribes of various Kazakh origins, managed to preserve the distant memory of the original founding clans. It was important for Kazakhs to know their genealogical tree for no less than seven generations back (known as ''{{lang|kk-Latn|\u015fejire}}'', from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{lang|ar-Latn|shajara}}''&nbsp;\u2013 \"tree\").\n\n== Three Kazakh Zhuz (Hordes) ==\n{{Main|Kazakh tribes}}\n[[File:\u0416\u0443\u0437.svg|thumb|250px|right|Approximate areas occupied by the three Kazakh j\u00fcz in the early 20th century.\n{|\n|{{legend|#ccff99|[[Junior juz]]}}\n|{{legend|#fdd99b|[[Middle Juz|Middle juz]]}}\n|{{legend|#ffaaaa|[[Great juz]]}}\n|}]]\nIn modern Kazakhstan, [[tribalism]] is fading away in business and government life. Still it is common for Kazakhs to ask each other the tribe they belong to when they become acquainted with one another. Now, it is more of a tradition than necessity, and there is no hostility between tribes. Kazakhs, regardless of their tribal origin, consider themselves one nation.\n\nThose modern-day Kazakhs who yet remember their tribes know that their tribes belong to one of the three [[Zhuz]] (juz, roughly translatable as \"horde\" or \"hundred\"):\n* The [[Zhuz#Senior zhuz|Senior Horde (also called Elder or Great)]] (Uly juz)\n* The [[Zhuz#Middle zhuz|Middle (also called Central)]] (Orta juz)\n* The [[Zhuz#Junior zhuz|Junior (also called Younger or Lesser)]] (Kishi juz)\n\n=== History of the Hordes ===\nThere is much debate surrounding the origins of the Hordes. Their age is unknown so far in extant historical texts, with the earliest mentions in the 17th century. The Turkologist Velyaminov-Zernov believed that it was the capture of the important cities of [[Tashkent]], [[Turkestan (city)|Yasi]], and [[Sayram (city)|Sayram]] in 1598 by Tevvekel (Tauekel/Tavakkul) Khan that separated the Qazaqs, as they possessed the cities for only part of the 17th century.<ref>Russian, Mongolia, China in the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries. Vol II. Baddeley (1919, MacMillan, London). Reprint&nbsp;\u2013 Burt Franklin, New York. 1963 p. 59</ref> The theory suggests that the Qazaqs then divided among a wider territory after expanding from [[Zhetysu]] into most of the Dasht-i Qipchaq, with a focus on the trade available through the cities of the middle [[Syr Darya]], to which Sayram and Yasi belonged. The Junior juz originated from the [[Nogais]] of the [[Nogai Horde]].\n\n== Language ==\n{{Main|Kazakh language|Kazakh alphabet}}\n[[File:Kazakh-Mongolian Eagle Hunter.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Kazakh eagle hunter in [[Altai Tavan Bogd National Park]], [[Mongolia]].]]\n\nThe Kazakh language is a member of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[language family]], as are [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], and many other living and historical languages spoken in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Siberia]].\n\nKazakh belongs to the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] (Northwestern) group of the Turkic language family. Kazakh is characterized, in distinction to other Turkic languages, by the presence of {{IPA|/s/}} in place of reconstructed proto-Turkic {{IPA|*/\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in place of {{IPA|*/t\u0283/}}; furthermore, Kazakh has {{IPAslink|\u0292}} where other Turkic languages have {{IPAslink|j}}.\n\nKazakh, like most of the Turkic language family lacks phonemic [[vowel length]], and as such there is no distinction between long and short vowels.\n\nKazakh was written with the Arabic script during the 19th century, when a number of poets, educated in Islamic schools, incited a revolt against Russia. Russia's response was to set up secular schools and devise a way of writing Kazakh with the Cyrillic alphabet, which was not widely accepted. By 1917, the Arabic script was reintroduced, even in schools and local government.\n\nIn 1927, a Kazakh nationalist movement sprang up but was soon suppressed. At the same time the Arabic script was banned and the [[Latin]] alphabet was imposed for writing Kazakh. The native Latin alphabet was in turn replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1940 by soviet interventionists. Today, there are efforts to return to the Latin script.\n\nKazakh is a state (official) language in [[Kazakhstan]]. It is also spoken in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] region of the [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous Region in the [[China|People's Republic of China]], where the Arabic script is used, and in western parts of [[Mongolia]] ([[Bayan-\u00d6lgii]] and [[Khovd Province|Khovd]] province), where Cyrillic script is in use. European Kazakhs use the Latin alphabet.\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:Historical Kazakh wedding garb photo.jpg|thumb|alt=Old photo of a bride, |Kazakh bride in traditional wedding dress]]\n\nAncestors of modern Kazakhs believed in [[Shamanism]] and [[Tengrism]], then [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]] including [[Church of the East]]. [[Islam]] was first introduced to ancestors of modern Kazakhs during the 8th century when the [[Arab]] missionaries entered Central Asia. Islam initially took hold in the southern portions of [[Turkestan]] and thereafter gradually spread northward.<ref>Atabaki, Touraj. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora'', pg. 24</ref> Islam also took root because of the missionary work of [[Samanid]] rulers, notably in areas surrounding [[Taraz]]<ref>Ibn Athir, volume 8, pg. 396</ref> where a significant number of Turks accepted Islam. Additionally, in the late 14th century, the [[Golden Horde]] propagated Islam among Kazakhs and other tribes. During the 18th century, Russian influence toward the region rapidly increased throughout [[Central Asia]]. Led by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]], the Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing [[Islam]] to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the region to preach to the Kazakhs, whom the Russians viewed as \"savages\" and \"ignorant\" of morals and ethics.<ref>Khodarkovsky, Michael. ''Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making of a Colonial Empire, 1500\u20131800'', pg. 39.</ref><ref name=EncycSex572>Ember, Carol R. and Melvin Ember. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures'', pg. 572</ref> However, Russian policy gradually changed toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of [[collective consciousness]].<ref name=Hunter14>Hunter, Shireen. \"Islam in Russia: The Politics of Identity and Security\", pg. 14</ref> Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite [[Russia]]n military institutions.<ref name=Hunter14 /> In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring in [[pan-Turkism]], though many were persecuted as a result.<ref>Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 304</ref> During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Muslim]] institutions survived only in areas that Kazakhs significantly outnumbered non-Muslims, such as non-indigenous Russians, by everyday Muslim practices.<ref>Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 340</ref> In an attempt to conform Kazakhs into [[Communist]] ideologies, gender relations and other aspects of Kazakh culture were key targets of social change.<ref name=EncycSex572 />\n\nIn more recent times, however, Kazakhs have gradually employed a determined effort in revitalizing Islamic religious institutions after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. Some Kazakhs continue to identify with their Islamic faith,<ref>Page, Kogan. ''Asia and Pacific Review 2003/04'', pg. 99</ref> and even more devotedly in the countryside. Those who claim descent from the original [[Muslim]] soldiers and missionaries of the 8th-century command substantial respect in their communities.<ref>Atabaki, Touraj. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora''.</ref> Kazakh political figures have also stressed the need to sponsor Islamic awareness. For example, the Kazakh Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Marat Tazhin]], recently emphasized that Kazakhstan attaches importance to the use of \"positive potential Islam, learning of its history, culture and heritage.\"<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&id=154837 inform.kz | 154837] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020120928/http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&id=154837 |date=20 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nPre-Islamic beliefs, such as worship of the sky, the ancestors, and fire, continued to a great extent to be preserved among the common people, however. Kazakhs believed in the supernatural forces of good and evil spirits, of wood goblins and giants. To protect themselves from them and from the evil eye, Kazakhs wore protection beads and talismans. Shamanic beliefs are still widely preserved among Kazakhs, as well as the belief in the strength of the bearers of that worship, the shamans, which Kazakhs call ''bakhsy''. Unlike the Siberian shamans, who used drums during their rituals, Kazakh shamans, who could also be men or women, played (with a bow) on a stringed instrument similar to a large violin. At present both Islamic and pre-Islamic beliefs continue to be found among Kazakhs, especially among the elderly.<ref name=\"Everyculture.com\" /> According to 2009 national census 39,172 Kazakhs are [[Christianity|Christians]].<ref name=\"2009 Census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.kz/news/Pages/n2_12_11_10.aspx |title=\u0418\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f 2009 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 (Summary of the 2009 national census) |language=Russian |publisher=Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan |accessdate=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612063733/http://www.stat.kz/news/Pages/n2_12_11_10.aspx |archivedate=12 June 2013 }}</ref>\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044b. \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0438.jpg|thumb| Headpiece of the bride.

The Russians originally called the Kazakhs 'Kirgiz' and later Kirghiz-Kaisak to distinguish them from the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] proper.\n\nIn the 17th century, Russian convention seeking to distinguish the Qazaqs of the steppes from the [[Cossacks]] of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] suggested spelling the final consonant with \"kh\" instead of \"q\" or \"k\", which was officially adopted by the USSR in 1936.<ref>[[:s:ru:\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0426\u0418\u041a \u0438 \u0421\u041d\u041a \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0410\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u00ab\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u00bb|\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0426\u0418\u041a \u0438 \u0421\u041d\u041a \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0410\u0421\u0421\u0420 \u2116 133 \u043e\u0442 5.02.1936 \u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u00ab\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u00bb]]</ref>\n* Kazakh&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|ru|\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445}}\n* Cossack&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|ru|\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a}}\n\nThe Ukrainian term Cossack probably comes from the same Kypchak etymological root: wanderer, brigand, independent free-booter.\n\n=== Oral history ===\nTheir [[nomad]]ic pastoral lifestyle made Kazakhs keep an epic tradition of [[oral history]]. The nation, which amalgamated nomadic tribes of various Kazakh origins, managed to preserve the distant memory of the original founding clans. It was important for Kazakhs to know their genealogical tree for no less than seven generations back (known as ''{{lang|kk-Latn|\u015fejire}}'', from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{lang|ar-Latn|shajara}}''&nbsp;\u2013 \"tree\").\n\n== Three Kazakh Zhuz (Hordes) ==\n{{Main|Kazakh tribes}}\n[[File:\u0416\u0443\u0437.svg|thumb|250px|right|Approximate areas occupied by the three Kazakh j\u00fcz in the early 20th century.\n{|\n|{{legend|#ccff99|[[Junior juz]]}}\n|{{legend|#fdd99b|[[Middle Juz|Middle juz]]}}\n|{{legend|#ffaaaa|[[Great juz]]}}\n|}]]\nIn modern Kazakhstan, [[tribalism]] is fading away in business and government life. Still it is common for Kazakhs to ask each other the tribe they belong to when they become acquainted with one another. Now, it is more of a tradition than necessity, and there is no hostility between tribes. Kazakhs, regardless of their tribal origin, consider themselves one nation.\n\nThose modern-day Kazakhs who yet remember their tribes know that their tribes belong to one of the three [[Zhuz]] (juz, roughly translatable as \"horde\" or \"hundred\"):\n* The [[Zhuz#Senior zhuz|Senior Horde (also called Elder or Great)]] (Uly juz)\n* The [[Zhuz#Middle zhuz|Middle (also called Central)]] (Orta juz)\n* The [[Zhuz#Junior zhuz|Junior (also called Younger or Lesser)]] (Kishi juz)\n\n=== History of the Hordes ===\nThere is much debate surrounding the origins of the Hordes. Their age is unknown so far in extant historical texts, with the earliest mentions in the 17th century. The Turkologist Velyaminov-Zernov believed that it was the capture of the important cities of [[Tashkent]], [[Turkestan (city)|Yasi]], and [[Sayram (city)|Sayram]] in 1598 by Tevvekel (Tauekel/Tavakkul) Khan that separated the Qazaqs, as they possessed the cities for only part of the 17th century.<ref>Russian, Mongolia, China in the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries. Vol II. Baddeley (1919, MacMillan, London). Reprint&nbsp;\u2013 Burt Franklin, New York. 1963 p. 59</ref> The theory suggests that the Qazaqs then divided among a wider territory after expanding from [[Zhetysu]] into most of the Dasht-i Qipchaq, with a focus on the trade available through the cities of the middle [[Syr Darya]], to which Sayram and Yasi belonged. The Junior juz originated from the [[Nogais]] of the [[Nogai Horde]].\n\n== Language ==\n{{Main|Kazakh language|Kazakh alphabet}}\n[[File:Kazakh-Mongolian Eagle Hunter.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Kazakh eagle hunter in [[Altai Tavan Bogd National Park]], [[Mongolia]].]]\n\nThe Kazakh language is a member of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[language family]], as are [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], and many other living and historical languages spoken in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Siberia]].\n\nKazakh belongs to the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] (Northwestern) group of the Turkic language family. Kazakh is characterized, in distinction to other Turkic languages, by the presence of {{IPA|/s/}} in place of reconstructed proto-Turkic {{IPA|*/\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in place of {{IPA|*/t\u0283/}}; furthermore, Kazakh has {{IPAslink|\u0292}} where other Turkic languages have {{IPAslink|j}}.\n\nKazakh, like most of the Turkic language family lacks phonemic [[vowel length]], and as such there is no distinction between long and short vowels.\n\nKazakh was written with the Arabic script during the 19th century, when a number of poets, educated in Islamic schools, incited a revolt against Russia. Russia's response was to set up secular schools and devise a way of writing Kazakh with the Cyrillic alphabet, which was not widely accepted. By 1917, the Arabic script was reintroduced, even in schools and local government.\n\nIn 1927, a Kazakh nationalist movement sprang up but was soon suppressed. At the same time the Arabic script was banned and the [[Latin]] alphabet was imposed for writing Kazakh. The native Latin alphabet was in turn replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1940 by soviet interventionists. Today, there are efforts to return to the Latin script.\n\nKazakh is a state (official) language in [[Kazakhstan]]. It is also spoken in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] region of the [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous Region in the [[China|People's Republic of China]], where the Arabic script is used, and in western parts of [[Mongolia]] ([[Bayan-\u00d6lgii]] and [[Khovd Province|Khovd]] province), where Cyrillic script is in use. European Kazakhs use the Latin alphabet.\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:Historical Kazakh wedding garb photo.jpg|thumb|alt=Old photo of a bride, |Kazakh bride in traditional wedding dress]]\n\nAncestors of modern Kazakhs believed in [[Shamanism]] and [[Tengrism]], then [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]] including [[Church of the East]]. [[Islam]] was first introduced to ancestors of modern Kazakhs during the 8th century when the [[Arab]] missionaries entered Central Asia. Islam initially took hold in the southern portions of [[Turkestan]] and thereafter gradually spread northward.<ref>Atabaki, Touraj. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora'', pg. 24</ref> Islam also took root because of the missionary work of [[Samanid]] rulers, notably in areas surrounding [[Taraz]]<ref>Ibn Athir, volume 8, pg. 396</ref> where a significant number of Turks accepted Islam. Additionally, in the late 14th century, the [[Golden Horde]] propagated Islam among Kazakhs and other tribes. During the 18th century, Russian influence toward the region rapidly increased throughout [[Central Asia]]. Led by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]], the Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing [[Islam]] to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the region to preach to the Kazakhs, whom the Russians viewed as \"savages\" and \"ignorant\" of morals and ethics.<ref>Khodarkovsky, Michael. ''Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making of a Colonial Empire, 1500\u20131800'', pg. 39.</ref><ref name=EncycSex572>Ember, Carol R. and Melvin Ember. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures'', pg. 572</ref> However, Russian policy gradually changed toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of [[collective consciousness]].<ref name=Hunter14>Hunter, Shireen. \"Islam in Russia: The Politics of Identity and Security\", pg. 14</ref> Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite [[Russia]]n military institutions.<ref name=Hunter14 /> In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring in [[pan-Turkism]], though many were persecuted as a result.<ref>Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 304</ref> During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Muslim]] institutions survived only in areas that Kazakhs significantly outnumbered non-Muslims, such as non-indigenous Russians, by everyday Muslim practices.<ref>Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 340</ref> In an attempt to conform Kazakhs into [[Communist]] ideologies, gender relations and other aspects of Kazakh culture were key targets of social change.<ref name=EncycSex572 />\n\nIn more recent times, however, Kazakhs have gradually employed a determined effort in revitalizing Islamic religious institutions after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. Some Kazakhs continue to identify with their Islamic faith,<ref>Page, Kogan. ''Asia and Pacific Review 2003/04'', pg. 99</ref> and even more devotedly in the countryside. Those who claim descent from the original [[Muslim]] soldiers and missionaries of the 8th-century command substantial respect in their communities.<ref>Atabaki, Touraj. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora''.</ref> Kazakh political figures have also stressed the need to sponsor Islamic awareness. For example, the Kazakh Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Marat Tazhin]], recently emphasized that Kazakhstan attaches importance to the use of \"positive potential Islam, learning of its history, culture and heritage.\"<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&id=154837 inform.kz | 154837] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020120928/http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&id=154837 |date=20 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nPre-Islamic beliefs, such as worship of the sky, the ancestors, and fire, continued to a great extent to be preserved among the common people, however. Kazakhs believed in the supernatural forces of good and evil spirits, of wood goblins and giants. To protect themselves from them and from the evil eye, Kazakhs wore protection beads and talismans. Shamanic beliefs are still widely preserved among Kazakhs, as well as the belief in the strength of the bearers of that worship, the shamans, which Kazakhs call ''bakhsy''. Unlike the Siberian shamans, who used drums during their rituals, Kazakh shamans, who could also be men or women, played (with a bow) on a stringed instrument similar to a large violin. At present both Islamic and pre-Islamic beliefs continue to be found among Kazakhs, especially among the elderly.<ref name=\"Everyculture.com\" /> According to 2009 national census 39,172 Kazakhs are [[Christianity|Christians]].<ref name=\"2009 Census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.kz/news/Pages/n2_12_11_10.aspx |title=\u0418\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f 2009 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 (Summary of the 2009 national census) |language=Russian |publisher=Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan |accessdate=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612063733/http://www.stat.kz/news/Pages/n2_12_11_10.aspx |archivedate=12 June 2013 }}</ref>\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044b. \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0438.jpg|thumb| Headpiece of the bride.

Only later did this word come to refer to a specific ethnonym. The term derives from ''T\u00fcrk'' plus the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] affix of similarity  ''-myn'', ''-men'', and means \"resembling a T\u00fcrk\" or \"co-T\u00fcrk\".<ref>[[Yury Zuev|Yu.

Curtis, ed. \"Origins and Early History\", Turkmenistan: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1996. pg. 13</ref> however, today the terms are usually restricted to two Turkic groups: the Turkmen people of [[Turkmenistan]] and adjacent parts of [[Central Asia]], and the [[Turkomans of Iraq]] and [[Syrian Turkmen|Syria]].\n\nThe modern Turkmen people descend from the Oghuz Turks of [[Transoxiana]], the western portion of [[Turkestan]], a region that largely corresponds to much of Central Asia as far east as [[Xinjiang]]. Famous historian and [[Khanate of Khiva|ruler of Khorezm]] of the XVII century [[Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur]] links the origin of all Turkmens to 24 [[Oghuz (tribe)|Oghuz tribes]] in his literary work \"[[Genealogy of the Turkmens]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus6/Abulgazi/framepred.htm|title=Genealogy of the Turkmens.

They also penetrated as far west as the [[Volga]] basin and the [[Balkans]]. These early Turkmens are believed to have mixed with native [[Sogdia|Sogdian]] peoples and lived as pastoral nomads until being conquered by the Russians in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Amazon.com: Central Asians under Russian Rule: A Study in Culture Change (Cornell Paperbacks): Elizabeth E.

Following the decline of the Mongols, [[Tamerlane]] conquered the area and his [[Timurid Empire]] would rule, until it too fractured, as the [[Safavids]], [[Khanate of Bukhara]], and [[Khanate of Khiva]] all contested the area. The expanding [[Russian Empire]] took notice of [[Economy of Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan's extensive cotton industry]], during the reign of [[Peter the Great]], and invaded the area. Following the decisive [[Battle of Geok Tepe]] in January 1881, a bulk of Turkmen tribes found themselves under the rule of the [[Russian Emperor]]. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] control was established by 1921, and in 1924 Turkmenistan became [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialistic Republic]].

The term derives from ''T\u00fcrk'' plus the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] affix of similarity  ''-myn'', ''-men'', and means \"resembling a T\u00fcrk\" or \"co-T\u00fcrk\".<ref>[[Yury Zuev|Yu.

Subsequently, [[Turkmen tribes]] founded lasting dynasties in Central Asia, [[Middle East]], [[Persia]] and [[Anatolia]] that had a profound influence on the course of history of those regions.<ref>Stefano Carboni, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Lap\u00e9rouse, Historical overview - \"Turkmen Jewelry: Silver Ornaments from the Marshall and Marilyn R.

Following the decline of the Mongols, [[Tamerlane]] conquered the area and his [[Timurid Empire]] would rule, until it too fractured, as the [[Safavids]], [[Khanate of Bukhara]], and [[Khanate of Khiva]] all contested the area. The expanding [[Russian Empire]] took notice of [[Economy of Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan's extensive cotton industry]], during the reign of [[Peter the Great]], and invaded the area. Following the decisive [[Battle of Geok Tepe]] in January 1881, a bulk of Turkmen tribes found themselves under the rule of the [[Russian Emperor]]. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] control was established by 1921, and in 1924 Turkmenistan became [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialistic Republic]]. [[Turkmenistan]] gained independence in 1991.\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Turkmen language}}\nTurkmen (Latin: T\u00fcrkmen\u00e7e, Cyrillic: \u0422\u04af\u0440\u043a\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435) is the language of the nation of [[Turkmenistan]]. It is spoken by over 5,200,000 people in [[Turkmenistan]], and by roughly 3,000,000 people in other countries, including [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tuk|title=Turkmen|work=Ethnologue|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> Up to 30% of native speakers in Turkmenistan also claim a good knowledge of [[Russian language|Russian]], a legacy of the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union]].\n\nTurkmen is not a literary language in Iran and Afghanistan, where many Turkmen tend towards bilingualism, usually conversant in the countries' different dialects of [[Persian language|Persian]], such as [[Dari language|Dari]] in Afghanistan. Variations of the [[Persian alphabet]] are, however, used in Iran.\n\n==Ethnogenesis==\nA genetic study on the [[mitochondrial DNA]] ([[mtDNA]]) haplogroups of a Turkmen sample describes a mixture of mostly West Eurasian lineages and minority of East Eurasian lineages. Turkmens also have two unusual mtDNA markers with polymorphic characteristics, only found in Turkmens and southern Siberians.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11353941 |journal=Russian Journal of Genetics |title=Mitochondrial DNA Polymorphism in Populations of the Caspian Region and Southeastern Europe |number=4 |volume=38 |date=1 April 2002 |pages=434\u2013438 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2011060...00004/00375256;jsessionid=1i2j4imsmaj3n.alice |archive-date=6 June 2011|doi=10.1023/A:1015262522048 |last1=Malyarchuk |first1=B.

According to the CIA World Factbook, Turkmenistan is 89% Muslim and 10% Eastern Orthodox. Most ethnic Russians are Orthodox Christians. The remaining 1% is unknown. A 2009 Pew Research Center report indicates a higher percentage of Muslims with 93.1% of Turkmenistan's population adhering to Islam.\nThe great majority of Turkmen readily identify themselves as Muslims and acknowledge Islam as an integral part of their cultural heritage. However, there are some who only support a revival of the religion's status merely as an element of national revival.\n\n==Culture and society==\n\n===Nomadic heritage===\n[[File:Tekke Chuval.tiff|thumb|left|Tekke ''chuval'' with Salor [[Gul (design)|g\u00fcl]]s, late 19th century]]\n\nBefore the establishment of [[Soviet power]] in [[Central Asia]], it was difficult to identify distinct ethnic groups in the region. Sub-ethnic and [[supra-ethnic]] loyalties were more important to people than ethnicity. When asked to identify themselves, most Central Asians would name their kin group, neighborhood, village, religion or the state in which they lived; the idea that a state should exist to serve an ethnic group was unknown.<ref name=\"Adrienne Lynn Edgar 2007 18\">{{cite book|author= Adrienne Lynn Edgar|title=Tribal Nation: The Making of Soviet Turkmenistan|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q11AQAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=18|isbn=9781400844296}}</ref>\n\nMost Turkmen were nomads and were not settled in cities and towns until the advent of the Soviet government. This mobile lifestyle precluded identification with anyone outside one's kin group and led to frequent conflicts between different [[Turkmen tribes]]. In collaboration with the local nationalists, the Soviet government sought to transform the Turkmen and other \u201cbackward\u201d ethnic groups in the USSR into modern socialist nations that based their identity on a fixed territory and a common language.\n\nThe Soviet-led standardization of the Turkmen language, education, and projects to promote ethnic Turkmen in the industry, government and higher education had led growing numbers of Turkmen to identify with a larger national Turkmen culture rather than with sub-national, pre-modern forms of identity.<ref name=\"Adrienne Lynn Edgar 2007 261\">{{cite book|author= Adrienne Lynn Edgar|title=Tribal Nation: The Making of Soviet Turkmenistan|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q11AQAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=261|isbn=9781400844296}}</ref> Before the Soviet era, a proverb stated that the Turkmen\u2019s home was where his horse happened to stand.

Many Turkmen still live in extended families where various generations can be found under the same roof, especially in rural areas.<ref name=\"Turkmen Society\"/>\n\nThe music of the nomadic and rural Turkmen people reflects rich oral traditions, where epics such as [[Koroglu]] are usually sung by itinerant bards.

They established settlements from Balkh Province to Herat Province, where they are now concentrated; smaller groups settled in Kunduz Province. Others came in considerable numbers as a result of the failure of the Basmachi revolts against the Bolsheviks in the 1920s.<ref name=\"lcweb2.loc.gov\"/> Turkmen tribes, of which there are twelve major groups in Afghanistan, base their structure on genealogies traced through the male line. Senior members wield considerable authority. Formerly a nomadic and warlike people feared for their lightning raids on caravans, Turkmen in Afghanistan are farmer-herdsmen and important contributors to the economy. They brought karakul sheep to Afghanistan and are also renowned makers of carpets, which, with karakul pelts, are major hard currency export commodities. [[Turkmen jewelry]] is also highly prized.<ref name=\"lcweb2.loc.gov\"/>\n\n===Turkmen of Stavropol Region of Russia===\n\nIn the [[Stavropol Krai]] of southern [[Russian Federation|Russia]], there is a long established colony of Turkmen.

These migrants belonged mainly to the Chaudorov (Chavodur), Sonchadj and Ikdir tribes. The early settlers were nomadic but over time a process of sedentarization took place. In their cultural life the Trukhmens of today differ very little from their neighbours and are now settled farmers and stockbreeders.<ref name=\"eki.ee\"/>\n\nAlthough the Turkmen language belongs to the Oghuz group of Turkic languages, in Stavropol it has been strongly influenced by the [[Nogai language]], which belongs to the [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]] group.
