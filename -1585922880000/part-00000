The fourth generation Coaster incorporates many safety features as standard including air-bags for the driver and front passenger, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), a ringed frame body for increased roll-over protection, pre-tensioners for the seat belts and force limiters which reduce the pressure on the passenger's chest in the event of a collision.\n\nThe height was increased by {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the width was increased by {{convert|40|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and the window height was increased by {{convert|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} over the outgoing model. The door step were also lengthened by {{convert|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} for easier entry and exit. The body was designed in a square shape for a more spacious seating space. The windshield was widened for increased outward visibility. The Coaster is available in three configurations; the standard wheelbase configuration can seat 25 passengers, the long wheelbase configuration can either seat 24 or 29 passengers while a school bus configuration can seat 3 adults and 49 children.

It is available with the same engine choices as the outgoing model. The Coaster was the first vehicle to undergo a full redesign under Toyota's newly incorporated Commercial Vehicle (CV) company responsible for the design and development of commercial vehicles. The fourth generation Coaster incorporates many safety features as standard including air-bags for the driver and front passenger, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), a ringed frame body for increased roll-over protection, pre-tensioners for the seat belts and force limiters which reduce the pressure on the passenger's chest in the event of a collision.\n\nThe height was increased by {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the width was increased by {{convert|40|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and the window height was increased by {{convert|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} over the outgoing model. The door step were also lengthened by {{convert|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} for easier entry and exit. The body was designed in a square shape for a more spacious seating space. The windshield was widened for increased outward visibility. The Coaster is available in three configurations; the standard wheelbase configuration can seat 25 passengers, the long wheelbase configuration can either seat 24 or 29 passengers while a school bus configuration can seat 3 adults and 49 children. The school bus configuration does not have a front passenger seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.toyota/en/detail/14574035|title=Toyota 'Coaster' Undergoes Model Change After 24 Years|date=22 December 2016|work=[[Toyota]]|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autodeal.com.ph/articles/car-news-philippines/toyota-launch-all-new-coaster-model-after-24-years|title=Toyota to launch all-new Coaster model after 24 years|date=23 December 2016|first=Jacob|last=Oliva|publisher=Auto Deal|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n<!--\nhttps://toyota.jp/pages/contents/coaster/005_b_003/pdf/spec/coaster_bus_spec_201907.pdf\nhttps://toyota.jp/pages/contents/coaster/005_b_003/pdf/spec/coaster_bigvan_spec_201907.pdf\nhttps://toyota.jp/pages/contents/coaster/005_b_003/pdf/spec/coaster_child_spec_201907.pdf\n-->\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Variants==\n* BB10{{Snd}} [[Toyota B engine#2B|2B engine]]{{Snd}} First Generation diesel, 22\u201325 passengers<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.customcoasterconversions.com.au/Toyota-Coaster.html |title=Toyota Coaster Variants |publisher=Custom Coaster |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>\n* RB20{{Snd}} [[Toyota R engine#22R|22R]] 2.4-litre petrol engine, 26 passengers\n* BB21/BB22/BB23{{Snd}} 3B/13B/14B 4-cyl engine, 26 passengers (1981\u20131993)\n* HB30{{Snd}} 2H Engine, 30 passengers\n* HB31{{Snd}} 12H-T turbo engine for EX models, sliding door (1981\u20131990)\n* HDB30{{Snd}} 1HD-T turbo engine for EX models (1989\u20131993)\n* HZB30{{Snd}} 1HZ engine, 30 passengers (1990\u20131993)\n* BB40{{Snd}} 3B engine, 26 passenger (1993\u20132003)\n* HZB40{{Snd}} 1HZ engine, 26 passengers\n* HZB50{{Snd}} 1HZ engine, 30 passengers (1993\u20132016)\n* HZB51{{Snd}} 1HZ turbo engine, Intercooler 30 passengers (1993\u20132012)\n* HDB50{{Snd}} 1HD turbo engine, non airbag suspension (1993\u20132003)\n* HDB51{{Snd}} 1HD turbo engine, airbag suspension (1993\u20132003)\n* BB50{{Snd}} 15B-FTE 4-cyl turbo intercooled engine, 6-speed manual or auto (2003\u20132006)\n* XZB50/XZB51/XZB56 - Hino N04C 4-cyl turbo intercooled engine (2004\u20132016)\n* BB58{{Snd}} 15B (1997\u20131999) / 15B-FT (1999\u20132004) 4x4 factory built, uses Mega Cruiser's transmission and front portal axle differentials\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur 2017 08 (cropped).jpg|Toyota Coaster 1st generation\nFile:ToyotaCoaster 80s SmallDestinationDisplay.jpg|Toyota Coaster 2nd generation\nFile:Blue Poppy Toyota Coaster.JPG|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (pre-facelift, with round headlamps)\nFile:2008Computex Intel Staff Shuttle Bus A4-571.jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (pre-facelift, with rectangular headlamps)\nFile:Hokutetsu-Okunoto Coaster.jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (4WD, BB58)\nFile:MinibusRR992,NT411.jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (2001 facelift, low roof)\nFile:LD5080 Hong Kong Island 27 16-02-2019.jpg|Toyota Coaster LPG 3rd generation (2001 facelift)\nFile:MW-78-61(Ka-Ho St. Jose School) 15-05-2019.jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (2007 facelift)\nFile:TG6403 Hong Kong Island 36X 11-04-2019.jpg|Toyota Coaster LPG 3rd generation (2007 facelift)\nFile:050016 ToyotacoasterJZ534,NT65A.jpg|Toyota Coaster LPG 3rd generation (2007 facelift)\nFile:UK5446 at Java Rd, North Point (20181005104023).jpg|Toyota Coaster 3rd generation (2007 facelift, super long wheelbase)\nFile:\u6de1\u6c34\u5ba2\u904b KKA-2615.jpg|Toyota Coaster 4th generation\nFile:WP9187 New Territories 806A 03-03-2020.jpg|Toyota Coaster LPG 4th generation\n</gallery>\n\n==Conversions==\nThe Toyota Coaster is used for [[motor home]] conversions.
