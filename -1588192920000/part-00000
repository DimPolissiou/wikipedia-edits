Its screenplay, by [[James Ivory]], who also co-produced, is based on the [[Call Me by Your Name (novel)|2007 novel of the same name]] by [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]]. The film is the final installment in Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' (2009), and ''[[A Bigger Splash (2015 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars the French actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[location scout]], and eventually became sole director, and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name (film)|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2017]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of 1983. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old [[Jewish American]], lives with his parents in rural [[northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, who is also Jewish-American, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who has a carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom to Oliver for the duration of his stay, and spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with childhood friend, Marzia. Meanwhile, Oliver admits being attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.\n\nElio and Oliver swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to him. During a trip to the local post office, Elio indirectly confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, the two kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. They grow distant.\n\nIn response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a message on his desk suggesting they meet at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia, but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and their rendezvous results in the two sleeping together for the first time. They become more physically and emotionally intimate in the days that follow, frequenting sexual encounters while still keeping their relationship a secret. One day, in bed, Oliver says to Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.\" Now completely smitten with Oliver, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, he and Elio both find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are privately aware of the bond between the two but do not address it openly, recommend he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns home to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow, instead of just moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married. He tells Elio that he remembers everything very clearly. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reminiscing, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner. The movie ends when Elio, still seated by the fireplace and now appearing to be more content, throws a glance into the camera as his mother calls for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as [[Elio Perlman]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Samuel Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's full name is mentioned in the film as Samuel Perlman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|title=Michael Stuhlbarg's 'fragile balancing act' in playing a supportive dad in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122213946/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|archivedate=January 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* [[Amira Casar]] as Annella Perlman\n* [[Esther Garrel]] as Marzia\n* [[Victoire Du Bois]] as Chiara\n* Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda\n* Antonio Rimoldi as Anchise\n* Elena Bucci as Bambi\n* Marco Sgrosso as Nico\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]] as Mounir\n* [[Peter Spears]] as Isaac\n* [[Beppe Grillo]] as himself <small>(archive footage)</small><ref>{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Francesco|date=February 14, 2017|title=Luca Guadagnino, la mia storia gay per famiglie|trans-title=Luca Guadagnino, my gay story for families|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|language=it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|access-date=February 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014018/http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Styles and themes==\n''Call Me by Your Name'' is the final installment in a thematic trilogy Guadagnino calls his \"Desire\" trilogy;

Its screenplay, by [[James Ivory]], who also co-produced, is based on the [[Call Me by Your Name (novel)|2007 novel of the same name]] by [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]]. The film is the final installment in Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' (2009), and ''[[A Bigger Splash (2015 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars the French actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[location scout]], and eventually became sole director, and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name (film)|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2017]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of 1983. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old [[Jewish American]], lives with his parents in rural [[northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, who is also Jewish-American, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who has a carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom to Oliver for the duration of his stay, and spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with childhood friend, Marzia. Meanwhile, Oliver admits being attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.\n\nElio and Oliver swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to him. During a trip to the local post office, Elio indirectly confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, the two kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. They grow distant.\n\nIn response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a message on his desk suggesting they meet at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia, but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and their rendezvous results in the two sleeping together for the first time. They become more physically and emotionally intimate in the days that follow, frequenting sexual encounters while still keeping their relationship a secret. One day, in bed, Oliver says to Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.\" Now completely smitten with Oliver, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, he and Elio both find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are privately aware of the bond between the two but do not address it openly, recommend he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns home to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow, instead of just moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married. He tells Elio that he remembers everything very clearly. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reminiscing, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner. The movie ends when Elio, still seated by the fireplace and now appearing to be more content, throws a glance into the camera as his mother calls for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as [[Elio Perlman]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Samuel Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's full name is mentioned in the film as Samuel Perlman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|title=Michael Stuhlbarg's 'fragile balancing act' in playing a supportive dad in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122213946/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|archivedate=January 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* [[Amira Casar]] as Annella Perlman\n* [[Esther Garrel]] as Marzia\n* [[Victoire Du Bois]] as Chiara\n* Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda\n* Antonio Rimoldi as Anchise\n* Elena Bucci as Bambi\n* Marco Sgrosso as Nico\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]] as Mounir\n* [[Peter Spears]] as Isaac\n* [[Beppe Grillo]] as himself <small>(archive footage)</small><ref>{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Francesco|date=February 14, 2017|title=Luca Guadagnino, la mia storia gay per famiglie|trans-title=Luca Guadagnino, my gay story for families|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|language=it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|access-date=February 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225014018/http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Styles and themes==\n''Call Me by Your Name'' is the final installment in a thematic trilogy Guadagnino calls his \"Desire\" trilogy;

With the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'', [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada|Lower]] Canada were joined to become the [[United Province of Canada]]. \n\nBy the 1860s, interest developed in forming a new federation between the Canadas and the other British colonies of [[British North America]], that led to Confederation in 1867. A number of other British colonies that are today part of Canada, such as [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and [[Colony of British Columbia (1866\u20131871)|British Columbia]], and large territories such as [[Rupert's Land]], initially remained outside the newly formed federation.\n\n==New France under British rule==\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|left|340px|Map showing British territorial gains following the Treaty of Paris in pink, and Spanish territorial gains after the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] in yellow.]]\nIn North America, the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]] had seen Great Britain conquer all of the French [[Canada (New France)|colony of Canada]]. The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763. As part of the treaty, France formally renounced its claims to all its North American lands to Britain (of which the French colony of Canada was a part), except [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] (which had been instead ceded to Spain), and two islands off the shores of Newfoundland ([[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Canada: History |work=Country Profiles |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ |format=PDF |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012021238/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===St. Lawrence valley===\n{{Main|Canada (New France)}}\nWith the addition of Canada to the British Empire, Britain gained control of a strip of territory along the [[St. Lawrence River]] with a population of at least 70,000 [[francophone]] [[Roman Catholic]]s, which was expanded and renamed as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] under the ''[[Quebec Act]]''. Although many British people (including the American colonies to the south) hoped the French Canadians would be assimilated this was not the case as distinct rules of governance for Quebec were set out in the ''Quebec Act'' such as allowing the French Canadians to retain their [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] religion and their French system of civil law. The ''Quebec Act'' became one of the [[Intolerable Acts]] that infuriated the thirteen British colonies in what would become the [[United States of America]].\n\n===Atlantic coast===\n\nThe island colony of [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] had been dominated by the British for a long time before the French finally abandoned their legal claims to the area, and thus an anglophone society had already taken shape prior to the legal transfer of ownership. In Acadia, the British had expelled French-speaking populations in 1755 from Acadia to Louisiana, creating the [[Cajun]] population, but this would not be repeated in 1763. In the former French territory of [[Acadia]], the British were confronted by a relatively large and well-established Catholic [[Mi'kmaq]] and [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] (which included [[Nova Scotia peninsula]], while present-day New Brunswick remained in dispute) happened in 1710, much earlier than in what would become the rest of modern-day Canada. The Mi'kmaq never ceded land to either France or England. The first immigration of Protestants happened in the province with the founding of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. The establishment of Halifax sparked [[Father Le Loutre's War]], which, in turn, led to the British [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelling the Acadians]] from the region during the [[French and Indian War]].<ref>Jobb, Dean (2005).

Support for the Patriot cause was mixed; the clergy and landowners were generally opposed to it, while English-speaking merchants and migrants from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were generally supportive of it. The ''[[habitants]]'' were divided; in some areas (notably the region between Montreal and [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu|Saint-Jean]]), there was significant support, and militia companies were raised in support of the Patriots by [[James Livingston (American Revolution)|James Livingston]].\n[[File:American attack on Quebec.svg|thumb|240px|right|Patriot attack on Quebec: routes of the Arnold and Montgomery expeditions]]\nThe Patriots [[Siege of Fort St. Jean|laid siege to Fort Saint-Jean]], capturing it and Montreal in November 1775. They then marched on Quebec City, where an [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attempt to take the city]] on December 31, 1775, failed. Following an ineffectual siege, the arrival of British troops in May 1776 sent the Patriots into retreat back toward Montreal. An [[Battle of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res|attempt against British troops at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] failed, and the Patriots were driven from the province in June. Leaving with the rebel army were about 250 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in two regiments: James Livingston's [[1st Canadian Regiment]], and [[Moses Hazen]]'s [[2nd Canadian Regiment]].\n\nQuebeckers living in the forts of the [[Great Lakes]] region also massively sided with the Patriots and were instrumental in the taking of the fort by the Patriots. Major [[Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin]], Pierre Ayotte, Antoine Paulin, Louis Gosselin, Germain Dionne, Pierre Douville, [[Edward Antill (soldier)|Edward Antill]] and Moses Hazen and 747 Quebec militiamen were all in Quebec when they joined the Patriots and defeated the British at Yorktown in 1781. In a key act leading up to the [[Siege of Yorktown]], [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]], the French-born nephew of [[Canada (New France)|French Canada]]'s last French governor, the [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|Marquis de Vaudreuil]], assisted Bougainville and de Grasse in preventing the British Navy from resupplying or relieving Cornwallis' army in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]].\n\nIn Nova Scotia there was some agitation against British rule, largely instigated by [[Jonathan Eddy]] and [[John Allan (colonel)|John Allan]], migrants from Massachusetts who had settled in the [[Chignecto Isthmus]] area near [[Fort Cumberland (Canada)|Fort Cumberland]] (formerly Fort Beaus\u00e9jour). The only major event of their resistance was the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]], when Eddy and a combined force of Massachusetts Patriots, Acadians, and aboriginals, besieged the fort in November 1776. The siege was broken and Eddy's forces were scattered when British reinforcements arrived. Eddy and Allan continued to make trouble on the frontier between what is now [[Maine]] and [[New Brunswick]] from a base in [[Machias, Maine|Machias]] for several years.\n\nThe Maritime provinces were also affected by [[privateering]], and raids on settlements by privateers in violation of their [[letter of marque|letters of marque]]. In notable instances, [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] and [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]] were subjected to these raids.\n\nDuring and after the Revolution, approximately 70,000 [[United Empire Loyalist]]s fled the United States. Of these, roughly 50,000 Loyalists settled in the British North American colonies, which then consisted of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island (created 1769). The Loyalists who settled in western Nova Scotia wanted political freedom from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], so Britain split off the colony of New Brunswick in 1784. Quebec was also divided into [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] under the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], permitting the 8,000 Loyalists who settled in southwestern Quebec (which became Upper Canada) to have a province in which British laws and institutions could be established.\n\nA number of Loyalists that came north after the American Revolution were of [[Black Loyalist|African descent]] including former slaves who had been freed as a result of service to the British and over 2,000 [[Slavery in Canada|African slaves]].<ref>[[James W.

Many of the inhabitants of Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) were Americans who had very recently arrived in the colony, and some of them did support the invading force; however, the rest of the population was made up of the descendants of Loyalists or the original French colonists, who did not want to be part of the United States. The first American invasion came in October 1812, but they were defeated by General [[Isaac Brock]] at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]. The Americans invaded again in 1813, capturing [[Battle of York|Fort York]] (now Toronto). Later in the year, the Americans took control of the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] after the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] and the [[Battle of the Thames]], but they had much less success in Lower Canada, where they were defeated at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2teauguay]] and the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]]. The Americans were driven out of Upper Canada in 1814 after the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]], although they still controlled the Great Lakes and defeated the British at the [[Battle of Lake Champlain (1814)|Battle of Lake Champlain]]. In English Canada, it is seen as a victory against American invasions, with heroic legends surrounding many of the participants (such as Isaac Brock and [[Laura Secord]]) and battles (especially those in the [[Niagara Peninsula]]).\n\n==Fur trade==\n{{further|North American fur trade}}\nFor centuries one of the most important economic ventures in North America was the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]]. This trade, which had been pioneered by the French, came to be dominated by the British as they gained increasing territory on the continent. The main British fur trading posts were located inside of what became the United States (the British were forced to relocate northward as borders were established with the new nation).<ref>Gilman (1992), p. 72\u201374.</ref> [[First Nations]] were central to the trade as they were the primary fur trappers. The role gave the peoples of many of the First Nations a political voice as, though they were viewed as an underclass, they were too important to simply be ignored. The American Revolution led to intense competition between the British and the U.S. By the 1830s changing fashions in Europe had begun a steep decline in fur prices and an overall collapse in the market. Apart from the economic losses to ''whites'' involved in the fur trade, many of the First Nations were devastated, both in terms of economic loss and in terms of loss of influence in local politics.\n\n==Timber trade==\n{{Main|Economic history of Canada#Timber}}\n{{See also|Ottawa River timber trade}}\n[[File:Timber on the Ottawa River.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Timber booms on the [[Ottawa River]], Canada, 1872.]]\nAs the fur trade declined in importance, the timber trade became Canada's most important commodity. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] system. Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of New Brunswick were cut and transported to Saint John where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand, and the trade moved to the St. Lawrence River where logs were shipped to Quebec City before being sent on to Europe. This area also became insufficient, and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the [[Ottawa River]] system, which by 1845 provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business. In one summer 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone.\n\n==\"Responsible government\" and the Rebellions of 1837-38==\n{{Main|Rebellions of 1837}}\n\n[[File:Saint-Eustache-Patriotes.jpg|left|thumb|280px|The Papineau Rebellion of 1837.]]\nAfter the War of 1812, the first half of the 19th century saw the growth of political reform movements in both Upper and Lower Canada, largely influenced by American and French republicanism. The colonial legislatures set out by the Constitutional Act had become dominated by wealthy elites, the [[Family Compact]] in Upper Canada and the [[Ch\u00e2teau Clique]] in Lower Canada. The moderate reformers, such as [[Robert Baldwin]] and [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine]], argued for a more representational form of government which they called \"[[responsible government]]\".\n\nBy \"responsible,\" the reformers meant that such a government would be ultimately responsible to the will of the subjects of the colonies, not to authorities in London.  The critical move toward responsible government came between 1846 and 1850. In practice, it meant that the Executive Council of each colony formulated policy with the assistance of the legislative branch. The legislature voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacted those policies that it had approved. It was a transition from the older system when the governor took advice from an executive council, and use the legislature chiefly to raise money.<ref>Phillip A. Buckner, ''The Transition to Responsible Government: British Policy in British North America, 1815-1850'' (1985) ch. 4</ref> The radical reformers, such as [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] and [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] demanded equality or a complete break from British rule and the establishment of a republic.\n\nLouis-Joseph Papineau was elected speaker of the colonial assembly in 1815. His attempts at reform were ignored by the British, and in 1834, the assembly passed The [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]], outlining its grievances against the legislative council. Papineau organized boycotts and civil disobedience. The colonial government illegally ordered the arrest of Papineau. The ''Patriotes'' resorted to armed resistance and planned the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] in the fall of 1837. British troops in the colony quickly put down the rebellion and forced Papineau to flee to the United States. A second rebellion by the [[Fr\u00e8res chasseurs]] of [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]] broke out one year later, but the British put it down as well, with much loss of life and destruction of property.\n\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie, a Scottish immigrant and reformist mayor of York (Toronto), organized the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] in December 1837 after the Patriotes rebellion had begun. Upper Canadians had similar grievances; they were annoyed at the undemocratic governance of the colony, and especially by the corrupt and inefficient [[Bank of Upper Canada]] and the [[Canada Company]]. On December 4, the rebels assembled near [[Battle of Montgomery's Tavern|Montgomery's Tavern]], where the British troops stationed in the city met them on December 7. The rebels were hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned and were defeated in less than an hour. Mackenzie escaped to the United States.\n\nAlso in December, a group of Irish immigrants attempted to seize southwestern Ontario by force in the [[Patriot War]]. They were defeated by government troops at [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\n==Lord Durham's report==\n{{Main|Report on the Affairs of British North America}}\n\n[[John George Lambton, Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was appointed [[Governor General of Canada]] in 1838. He was assigned to investigate the causes of the Rebellions, and concluded that the problem was essentially animosity between the British and French inhabitants of Canada. His ''[[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|Report on the Affairs of British North America]]'' contains the famous description of \"two nations warring in the bosom of a single state.\" For Durham, the French Canadians were culturally backwards, and he was convinced that only a union of French and English Canada would allow the colony to progress in the interest of Great Britain. A political union would, he hoped, cause the French-speakers to be assimilated by English-speaking settlements, solving the problem of French Canadian nationalism once and for all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=durham_report|title=The Durham Report and Its Solutions {{!}} Site for Language Management in Canada (SLMC) \u2013 Official Languages and Bilingualism Institute (OLBI)|website=slmc.uottawa.ca|language=en|access-date=August 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823163347/https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=durham_report|archive-date=August 23, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Act of Union (1840)==\n{{Main|Act of Union 1840|United Province of Canada}}\n\nLord Durham was succeeded by [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham|Lord Sydenham]] who was responsible for implementing Durham's recommendations in the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'' passed on July 23, 1840, by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and proclaimed February 10, 1841. Upper and Lower Canada became, respectively, [[Canada West]] and [[Canada East]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP7CH5PA3LE.html|title=1841 - The First Election after the Act of Union|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> both with 42 seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] despite Lower Canada being more populated. The official language of the province became English and French was explicitly banned in the Parliament and in the courts.\n[[File:Incendie Parlement Montreal.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal]]&nbsp;\u2013 1849, [[Joseph L\u00e9gar\u00e9]], c.1849]]\nThe moderate reformers Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin fought two successive governors general Sir [[Charles Bagot]] and Sir [[Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe|Charles Metcalfe]] to secure what became known as responsible government. Metcalfe fought to preserve the prerogatives of [[the Crown]] and the governor's control over the administration and [[patronage]]. He nonetheless had to make some concessions to win support, and the most notable of these was persuading the [[Colonial Office]] to grant amnesty to the rebels of 1837\u201338, and to abandon forced anglicization of the French-speaking population. Lafontaine and Baldwin reintroduced French as an official language alongside English in the Assembly, the Courts and other governmental bodies. Under the progressive Governor General [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|James Bruce]] (Lord Elgin), a bill was passed to allow the leaders of former Patriote movement to return to their homeland; Papineau returned and for a short time re-entered Canadian politics. A similar bill was passed for the former Upper Canadian rebels. Elgin also implemented the practice of responsible government in 1848, several months after it had already been granted to the colony of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe parliament of United Canada in [[Montreal]] was [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|set on fire by a mob of Tories]] in 1849 after the passing of an indemnity bill for the people who suffered losses during the rebellions of Lower Canada.\n\nOne noted achievement of the Union was the [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] of 1855 which sanctioned [[free trade]] in resources. However, the achievement must be seen in the wider politics of British North America which had seen the major boundary disputes with the United States settled (see [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]], [[Treaty of 1818]], [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]], [[Oregon Treaty]]), thus easing tensions which for most of the first half of the 19th century had Americans threatening war or retaliation.\n\nThe ''Union Act'' of 1840 was ultimately unsuccessful, and led to calls for a greater political union in the 1850s and 1860s. Support for independence was strengthened by events such as the [[Battle of Ridgeway]], an 1866 invasion into Ontario by some 1500 Irish nationalists which was repulsed largely by local militia.\n\n==British colonies on the northwest coast==\n{{Main|History of British Columbia}}\n[[File:Sir James Douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir James Douglas, governor of the Colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island]]\n\nAlthough Spain had taken the lead in the exploration of the northwest Pacific Coast, with the voyages of Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez in 1774 and 1775,<ref>Margaret A. Ormsby, ''British Columbia: a History'' MacMillan Company of Canada, 1971, p. 7-8</ref> by the time the Spanish determined to build a fort on Vancouver Island, the British navigator [[James Cook]] had himself visited [[Nootka Sound]] and charted the coast as far as Alaska,<ref>Ormsby, pp 9\u201311</ref> while British and American traders had begun settling on the coast so as to develop resources for trade with Europe and Asia. In 1793 [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]]. a Scottish born Canadian working for the North West Company crossed the continent and with his aboriginal guides, French-Canadian voyageurs and another Scot, reached the mouth of the Bella Coola River, completing the first continental crossing of North America north of Mexico, missing [[George Vancouver]]'s charting expedition to the region by only a few weeks. The competing imperial claims between Russia, Spain and Britain were compounded by treaties between the former two powers and the United States, which pressed for the annexation of most of what is now British Columbia.\n\nWith the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, the United States agreed to establish its northern border with western British North America along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]].<ref>Ormsby, p. 89</ref> By 1857, Americans and British were beginning to respond to rumours of gold in the [[Fraser River]] area.<ref>Ormsby, p. 130</ref> Almost overnight, some ten to twenty thousand men moved into the region around present-day [[Yale, British Columbia]], sparking the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]. Governor [[James Douglas (Governor)|James Douglas]] was suddenly faced with having to exert British authority over a largely alien population. In order to normalize its jurisdiction, and undercut any Hudsons's Bay Company claims to the resource wealth of the mainland, the [[Crown colony]] of [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] was established August 2, 1858.<ref>Ormsby, p. 148</ref> In 1866, it was united with the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] into the [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia]].\n\nBy the mid-1850s, politicians in the [[Province of Canada]] began to contemplate western expansion. They questioned the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]'s tenure of Rupert's Land and the Arctic territories, and launched a series of exploring expeditions to familiarize themselves and the Canadian population with the geography and climate of the region.\n\n==Trade with the United States==\nIn 1854, the Governor General of British North America, Lord Elgin, signed a significant [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Agreement|trade agreement]] with the United States on behalf of the colonies. This agreement endured for ten years until the American government abrogated it in 1865.\n\n==Confederation==\n{{Main|Canadian Confederation}}\n[[File:JaMAC.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[John A. Macdonald]] became the first [[prime minister of Canada]].]]\nEffective governance of the United Province of Canada after 1840 required a careful balancing of the interests of French and English- speaking populations; and between Catholics and Protestants. [[John A. Macdonald]] emerged in the 1850s as a personality who could manage that task. A political conservative, MacDonald forged political relationships and coalitions with [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], the leader of powerful French Canadian ''[[Parti bleu|bleus]]'' and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] of the more stridently reformist English-Canadian and anti-French \"Grits\",<ref>Richard Gwyn, ''John A.: the Man Who Made Us,'' Random House of Canada Limited, 2007, pp. 174-182</ref> MacDonald came to realize that Canada's likeliest hope of resisting absorption into the United States was to reform itself into a workable federation. A delegation from the Canadas made its way to a [[Charlottetown Conference|conference]] being held in [[Charlottetown]] in 1864 by representatives from the [[Maritimes]] who had intended hold discussions regarding a federation of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.<ref>Gwyn, p. 302</ref> This conference was followed by a subsequent [[Quebec Conference, 1864|conference in Quebec City]]. The [[Seventy-Two Resolutions]] from the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|1864 Quebec Conference]] laid out the framework for uniting British colonies in North America into a [[federation]]. They were adopted by the majority of the provinces of Canada and became the basis for the London Conference of 1866, which led to the formation of the Dominion of Canada on July 1, 1867. Federation emerged from multiple impulses: the British wanted Canada to defend itself; the Maritimes needed railroad connections, which were promised in 1867; British-Canadian nationalism sought to unite the lands into one country, dominated by the English language and British culture; many French-Canadians saw an opportunity to exert political control within a new largely French-speaking Quebec.<ref>Gwyn, pp. 323-324</ref> Finally, but by no means least significant, were fears of possible U.S. expansion northward in the wake of the end of the [[United States Civil War]]. On a political level, there was a desire for the expansion of responsible government and elimination of the legislative deadlock between Upper and Lower Canada, and their replacement with provincial legislatures in a federation. This was especially pushed by the liberal [[Reform Party (pre-Confederation)|Reform movement of Upper Canada]] and the French-Canadian ''[[Parti rouge|rouges]]'' in Lower Canada who favoured a decentralized union in comparison to the Upper Canadian Conservative party and to some degree the French-Canadian ''bleus'' which favoured a centralized union.<ref>Paul Romney, ''Getting it Wrong: How Canadians Forgot Their Past and Imperilled Confederation.'' (1999), p.78</ref> Even Queen Victoria was supportive, noting \"...the impossibility of our being able to hold Canada, but we must struggle for it; and by far the best solution would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an English prince.\"<ref>Stacey, C.P.

The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], which with the ''[[Constitutional Act 1791]]'' became known as [[the Canadas]]. With the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'', [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada|Lower]] Canada were joined to become the [[United Province of Canada]]. \n\nBy the 1860s, interest developed in forming a new federation between the Canadas and the other British colonies of [[British North America]], that led to Confederation in 1867. A number of other British colonies that are today part of Canada, such as [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and [[Colony of British Columbia (1866\u20131871)|British Columbia]], and large territories such as [[Rupert's Land]], initially remained outside the newly formed federation.\n\n==New France under British rule==\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|left|340px|Map showing British territorial gains following the Treaty of Paris in pink, and Spanish territorial gains after the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] in yellow.]]\nIn North America, the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]] had seen Great Britain conquer all of the French [[Canada (New France)|colony of Canada]]. The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763. As part of the treaty, France formally renounced its claims to all its North American lands to Britain (of which the French colony of Canada was a part), except [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] (which had been instead ceded to Spain), and two islands off the shores of Newfoundland ([[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Canada: History |work=Country Profiles |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ |format=PDF |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012021238/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===St. Lawrence valley===\n{{Main|Canada (New France)}}\nWith the addition of Canada to the British Empire, Britain gained control of a strip of territory along the [[St. Lawrence River]] with a population of at least 70,000 [[francophone]] [[Roman Catholic]]s, which was expanded and renamed as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] under the ''[[Quebec Act]]''. Although many British people (including the American colonies to the south) hoped the French Canadians would be assimilated this was not the case as distinct rules of governance for Quebec were set out in the ''Quebec Act'' such as allowing the French Canadians to retain their [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] religion and their French system of civil law. The ''Quebec Act'' became one of the [[Intolerable Acts]] that infuriated the thirteen British colonies in what would become the [[United States of America]].\n\n===Atlantic coast===\n\nThe island colony of [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] had been dominated by the British for a long time before the French finally abandoned their legal claims to the area, and thus an anglophone society had already taken shape prior to the legal transfer of ownership. In Acadia, the British had expelled French-speaking populations in 1755 from Acadia to Louisiana, creating the [[Cajun]] population, but this would not be repeated in 1763. In the former French territory of [[Acadia]], the British were confronted by a relatively large and well-established Catholic [[Mi'kmaq]] and [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] (which included [[Nova Scotia peninsula]], while present-day New Brunswick remained in dispute) happened in 1710, much earlier than in what would become the rest of modern-day Canada. The Mi'kmaq never ceded land to either France or England. The first immigration of Protestants happened in the province with the founding of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. The establishment of Halifax sparked [[Father Le Loutre's War]], which, in turn, led to the British [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelling the Acadians]] from the region during the [[French and Indian War]].<ref>Jobb, Dean (2005).

Support for the Patriot cause was mixed; the clergy and landowners were generally opposed to it, while English-speaking merchants and migrants from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were generally supportive of it. The ''[[habitants]]'' were divided; in some areas (notably the region between Montreal and [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu|Saint-Jean]]), there was significant support, and militia companies were raised in support of the Patriots by [[James Livingston (American Revolution)|James Livingston]].\n[[File:American attack on Quebec.svg|thumb|240px|right|Patriot attack on Quebec: routes of the Arnold and Montgomery expeditions]]\nThe Patriots [[Siege of Fort St. Jean|laid siege to Fort Saint-Jean]], capturing it and Montreal in November 1775. They then marched on Quebec City, where an [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attempt to take the city]] on December 31, 1775, failed. Following an ineffectual siege, the arrival of British troops in May 1776 sent the Patriots into retreat back toward Montreal. An [[Battle of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res|attempt against British troops at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] failed, and the Patriots were driven from the province in June. Leaving with the rebel army were about 250 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in two regiments: James Livingston's [[1st Canadian Regiment]], and [[Moses Hazen]]'s [[2nd Canadian Regiment]].\n\nQuebeckers living in the forts of the [[Great Lakes]] region also massively sided with the Patriots and were instrumental in the taking of the fort by the Patriots. Major [[Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin]], Pierre Ayotte, Antoine Paulin, Louis Gosselin, Germain Dionne, Pierre Douville, [[Edward Antill (soldier)|Edward Antill]] and Moses Hazen and 747 Quebec militiamen were all in Quebec when they joined the Patriots and defeated the British at Yorktown in 1781. In a key act leading up to the [[Siege of Yorktown]], [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]], the French-born nephew of [[Canada (New France)|French Canada]]'s last French governor, the [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|Marquis de Vaudreuil]], assisted Bougainville and de Grasse in preventing the British Navy from resupplying or relieving Cornwallis' army in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]].\n\nIn Nova Scotia there was some agitation against British rule, largely instigated by [[Jonathan Eddy]] and [[John Allan (colonel)|John Allan]], migrants from Massachusetts who had settled in the [[Chignecto Isthmus]] area near [[Fort Cumberland (Canada)|Fort Cumberland]] (formerly Fort Beaus\u00e9jour). The only major event of their resistance was the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]], when Eddy and a combined force of Massachusetts Patriots, Acadians, and aboriginals, besieged the fort in November 1776. The siege was broken and Eddy's forces were scattered when British reinforcements arrived. Eddy and Allan continued to make trouble on the frontier between what is now [[Maine]] and [[New Brunswick]] from a base in [[Machias, Maine|Machias]] for several years.\n\nThe Maritime provinces were also affected by [[privateering]], and raids on settlements by privateers in violation of their [[letter of marque|letters of marque]]. In notable instances, [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] and [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]] were subjected to these raids.\n\nDuring and after the Revolution, approximately 70,000 [[United Empire Loyalist]]s fled the United States. Of these, roughly 50,000 Loyalists settled in the British North American colonies, which then consisted of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island (created 1769). The Loyalists who settled in western Nova Scotia wanted political freedom from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], so Britain split off the colony of New Brunswick in 1784. Quebec was also divided into [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] under the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], permitting the 8,000 Loyalists who settled in southwestern Quebec (which became Upper Canada) to have a province in which British laws and institutions could be established.\n\nA number of Loyalists that came north after the American Revolution were of [[Black Loyalist|African descent]] including former slaves who had been freed as a result of service to the British and over 2,000 [[Slavery in Canada|African slaves]].<ref>[[James W.

Many of the inhabitants of Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) were Americans who had very recently arrived in the colony, and some of them did support the invading force; however, the rest of the population was made up of the descendants of Loyalists or the original French colonists, who did not want to be part of the United States. The first American invasion came in October 1812, but they were defeated by General [[Isaac Brock]] at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]. The Americans invaded again in 1813, capturing [[Battle of York|Fort York]] (now Toronto). Later in the year, the Americans took control of the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] after the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] and the [[Battle of the Thames]], but they had much less success in Lower Canada, where they were defeated at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2teauguay]] and the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]]. The Americans were driven out of Upper Canada in 1814 after the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]], although they still controlled the Great Lakes and defeated the British at the [[Battle of Lake Champlain (1814)|Battle of Lake Champlain]]. In English Canada, it is seen as a victory against American invasions, with heroic legends surrounding many of the participants (such as Isaac Brock and [[Laura Secord]]) and battles (especially those in the [[Niagara Peninsula]]).\n\n==Fur trade==\n{{further|North American fur trade}}\nFor centuries one of the most important economic ventures in North America was the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]]. This trade, which had been pioneered by the French, came to be dominated by the British as they gained increasing territory on the continent. The main British fur trading posts were located inside of what became the United States (the British were forced to relocate northward as borders were established with the new nation).<ref>Gilman (1992), p. 72\u201374.</ref> [[First Nations]] were central to the trade as they were the primary fur trappers. The role gave the peoples of many of the First Nations a political voice as, though they were viewed as an underclass, they were too important to simply be ignored. The American Revolution led to intense competition between the British and the U.S. By the 1830s changing fashions in Europe had begun a steep decline in fur prices and an overall collapse in the market. Apart from the economic losses to ''whites'' involved in the fur trade, many of the First Nations were devastated, both in terms of economic loss and in terms of loss of influence in local politics.\n\n==Timber trade==\n{{Main|Economic history of Canada#Timber}}\n{{See also|Ottawa River timber trade}}\n[[File:Timber on the Ottawa River.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Timber booms on the [[Ottawa River]], Canada, 1872.]]\nAs the fur trade declined in importance, the timber trade became Canada's most important commodity. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] system. Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of New Brunswick were cut and transported to Saint John where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand, and the trade moved to the St. Lawrence River where logs were shipped to Quebec City before being sent on to Europe. This area also became insufficient, and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the [[Ottawa River]] system, which by 1845 provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business. In one summer 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone.\n\n==\"Responsible government\" and the Rebellions of 1837-38==\n{{Main|Rebellions of 1837}}\n\n[[File:Saint-Eustache-Patriotes.jpg|left|thumb|280px|The Papineau Rebellion of 1837.]]\nAfter the War of 1812, the first half of the 19th century saw the growth of political reform movements in both Upper and Lower Canada, largely influenced by American and French republicanism. The colonial legislatures set out by the Constitutional Act had become dominated by wealthy elites, the [[Family Compact]] in Upper Canada and the [[Ch\u00e2teau Clique]] in Lower Canada. The moderate reformers, such as [[Robert Baldwin]] and [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine]], argued for a more representational form of government which they called \"[[responsible government]]\".\n\nBy \"responsible,\" the reformers meant that such a government would be ultimately responsible to the will of the subjects of the colonies, not to authorities in London.  The critical move toward responsible government came between 1846 and 1850. In practice, it meant that the Executive Council of each colony formulated policy with the assistance of the legislative branch. The legislature voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacted those policies that it had approved. It was a transition from the older system when the governor took advice from an executive council, and use the legislature chiefly to raise money.<ref>Phillip A. Buckner, ''The Transition to Responsible Government: British Policy in British North America, 1815-1850'' (1985) ch. 4</ref> The radical reformers, such as [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] and [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] demanded equality or a complete break from British rule and the establishment of a republic.\n\nLouis-Joseph Papineau was elected speaker of the colonial assembly in 1815. His attempts at reform were ignored by the British, and in 1834, the assembly passed The [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]], outlining its grievances against the legislative council. Papineau organized boycotts and civil disobedience. The colonial government illegally ordered the arrest of Papineau. The ''Patriotes'' resorted to armed resistance and planned the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] in the fall of 1837. British troops in the colony quickly put down the rebellion and forced Papineau to flee to the United States. A second rebellion by the [[Fr\u00e8res chasseurs]] of [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]] broke out one year later, but the British put it down as well, with much loss of life and destruction of property.\n\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie, a Scottish immigrant and reformist mayor of York (Toronto), organized the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] in December 1837 after the Patriotes rebellion had begun. Upper Canadians had similar grievances; they were annoyed at the undemocratic governance of the colony, and especially by the corrupt and inefficient [[Bank of Upper Canada]] and the [[Canada Company]]. On December 4, the rebels assembled near [[Battle of Montgomery's Tavern|Montgomery's Tavern]], where the British troops stationed in the city met them on December 7. The rebels were hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned and were defeated in less than an hour. Mackenzie escaped to the United States.\n\nAlso in December, a group of Irish immigrants attempted to seize southwestern Ontario by force in the [[Patriot War]]. They were defeated by government troops at [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\n==Lord Durham's report==\n{{Main|Report on the Affairs of British North America}}\n\n[[John George Lambton, Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was appointed [[Governor General of Canada]] in 1838. He was assigned to investigate the causes of the Rebellions, and concluded that the problem was essentially animosity between the British and French inhabitants of Canada. His ''[[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|Report on the Affairs of British North America]]'' contains the famous description of \"two nations warring in the bosom of a single state.\" For Durham, the French Canadians were culturally backwards, and he was convinced that only a union of French and English Canada would allow the colony to progress in the interest of Great Britain. A political union would, he hoped, cause the French-speakers to be assimilated by English-speaking settlements, solving the problem of French Canadian nationalism once and for all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=durham_report|title=The Durham Report and Its Solutions {{!}} Site for Language Management in Canada (SLMC) \u2013 Official Languages and Bilingualism Institute (OLBI)|website=slmc.uottawa.ca|language=en|access-date=August 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823163347/https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=durham_report|archive-date=August 23, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Act of Union (1840)==\n{{Main|Act of Union 1840|United Province of Canada}}\n\nLord Durham was succeeded by [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham|Lord Sydenham]] who was responsible for implementing Durham's recommendations in the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'' passed on July 23, 1840, by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and proclaimed February 10, 1841.

The official language of the province became English and French was explicitly banned in the Parliament and in the courts.\n[[File:Incendie Parlement Montreal.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal]]&nbsp;\u2013 1849, [[Joseph L\u00e9gar\u00e9]], c.1849]]\nThe moderate reformers Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin fought two successive governors general Sir [[Charles Bagot]] and Sir [[Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe|Charles Metcalfe]] to secure what became known as responsible government. Metcalfe fought to preserve the prerogatives of [[the Crown]] and the governor's control over the administration and [[patronage]]. He nonetheless had to make some concessions to win support, and the most notable of these was persuading the [[Colonial Office]] to grant amnesty to the rebels of 1837\u201338, and to abandon forced anglicization of the French-speaking population. Lafontaine and Baldwin reintroduced French as an official language alongside English in the Assembly, the Courts and other governmental bodies. Under the progressive Governor General [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|James Bruce]] (Lord Elgin), a bill was passed to allow the leaders of former Patriote movement to return to their homeland; Papineau returned and for a short time re-entered Canadian politics. A similar bill was passed for the former Upper Canadian rebels. Elgin also implemented the practice of responsible government in 1848, several months after it had already been granted to the colony of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe parliament of United Canada in [[Montreal]] was [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|set on fire by a mob of Tories]] in 1849 after the passing of an indemnity bill for the people who suffered losses during the rebellions of Lower Canada.\n\nOne noted achievement of the Union was the [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] of 1855 which sanctioned [[free trade]] in resources. However, the achievement must be seen in the wider politics of British North America which had seen the major boundary disputes with the United States settled (see [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]], [[Treaty of 1818]], [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]], [[Oregon Treaty]]), thus easing tensions which for most of the first half of the 19th century had Americans threatening war or retaliation.\n\nThe ''Union Act'' of 1840 was ultimately unsuccessful, and led to calls for a greater political union in the 1850s and 1860s. Support for independence was strengthened by events such as the [[Battle of Ridgeway]], an 1866 invasion into Ontario by some 1500 Irish nationalists which was repulsed largely by local militia.\n\n==British colonies on the northwest coast==\n{{Main|History of British Columbia}}\n[[File:Sir James Douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir James Douglas, governor of the Colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island]]\n\nAlthough Spain had taken the lead in the exploration of the northwest Pacific Coast, with the voyages of Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez in 1774 and 1775,<ref>Margaret A.

The competing imperial claims between Russia, Spain and Britain were compounded by treaties between the former two powers and the United States, which pressed for the annexation of most of what is now British Columbia.\n\nWith the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, the United States agreed to establish its northern border with western British North America along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]].<ref>Ormsby, p. 89</ref> By 1857, Americans and British were beginning to respond to rumours of gold in the [[Fraser River]] area.<ref>Ormsby, p. 130</ref> Almost overnight, some ten to twenty thousand men moved into the region around present-day [[Yale, British Columbia]], sparking the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]. Governor [[James Douglas (Governor)|James Douglas]] was suddenly faced with having to exert British authority over a largely alien population. In order to normalize its jurisdiction, and undercut any Hudsons's Bay Company claims to the resource wealth of the mainland, the [[Crown colony]] of [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] was established August 2, 1858.<ref>Ormsby, p. 148</ref> In 1866, it was united with the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] into the [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia]].\n\nBy the mid-1850s, politicians in the [[Province of Canada]] began to contemplate western expansion. They questioned the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]'s tenure of Rupert's Land and the Arctic territories, and launched a series of exploring expeditions to familiarize themselves and the Canadian population with the geography and climate of the region.\n\n==Trade with the United States==\nIn 1854, the Governor General of British North America, Lord Elgin, signed a significant [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Agreement|trade agreement]] with the United States on behalf of the colonies. This agreement endured for ten years until the American government abrogated it in 1865.\n\n==Confederation==\n{{Main|Canadian Confederation}}\n[[File:JaMAC.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[John A. Macdonald]] became the first [[prime minister of Canada]].]]\nEffective governance of the United Province of Canada after 1840 required a careful balancing of the interests of French and English- speaking populations; and between Catholics and Protestants. [[John A. Macdonald]] emerged in the 1850s as a personality who could manage that task. A political conservative, MacDonald forged political relationships and coalitions with [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], the leader of powerful French Canadian ''[[Parti bleu|bleus]]'' and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] of the more stridently reformist English-Canadian and anti-French \"Grits\",<ref>Richard Gwyn, ''John A.: the Man Who Made Us,'' Random House of Canada Limited, 2007, pp. 174-182</ref> MacDonald came to realize that Canada's likeliest hope of resisting absorption into the United States was to reform itself into a workable federation. A delegation from the Canadas made its way to a [[Charlottetown Conference|conference]] being held in [[Charlottetown]] in 1864 by representatives from the [[Maritimes]] who had intended hold discussions regarding a federation of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.<ref>Gwyn, p. 302</ref> This conference was followed by a subsequent [[Quebec Conference, 1864|conference in Quebec City]]. The [[Seventy-Two Resolutions]] from the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|1864 Quebec Conference]] laid out the framework for uniting British colonies in North America into a [[federation]]. They were adopted by the majority of the provinces of Canada and became the basis for the London Conference of 1866, which led to the formation of the Dominion of Canada on July 1, 1867. Federation emerged from multiple impulses: the British wanted Canada to defend itself; the Maritimes needed railroad connections, which were promised in 1867; British-Canadian nationalism sought to unite the lands into one country, dominated by the English language and British culture; many French-Canadians saw an opportunity to exert political control within a new largely French-speaking Quebec.<ref>Gwyn, pp. 323-324</ref> Finally, but by no means least significant, were fears of possible U.S. expansion northward in the wake of the end of the [[United States Civil War]]. On a political level, there was a desire for the expansion of responsible government and elimination of the legislative deadlock between Upper and Lower Canada, and their replacement with provincial legislatures in a federation. This was especially pushed by the liberal [[Reform Party (pre-Confederation)|Reform movement of Upper Canada]] and the French-Canadian ''[[Parti rouge|rouges]]'' in Lower Canada who favoured a decentralized union in comparison to the Upper Canadian Conservative party and to some degree the French-Canadian ''bleus'' which favoured a centralized union.<ref>Paul Romney, ''Getting it Wrong: How Canadians Forgot Their Past and Imperilled Confederation.'' (1999), p.78</ref> Even Queen Victoria was supportive, noting \"...the impossibility of our being able to hold Canada, but we must struggle for it; and by far the best solution would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an English prince.\"<ref>Stacey, C.P. ''British Military Policy in the Era of Confederation'', CHA Annual Report and Historical Papers 13 (1934), p. 25.</ref> In the end Canada went as a ''Dominion'' under the Crown of the United Kingdom itself. It was a fresh start, but not one that was greeted with universal joy. While some envisaged Confederation for the British North American colonies as a way forward together, ''La Minerve'', a newspaper in the new Province of Quebec endorsed the federation because it provided \"''la seule voie qui nous soit offerte pour arriver \u00e0 l'ind\u00e9pendance politique.''\" (\"the only way offered to us to achieve political independence\").<ref name=\"Gwyn, p. 436\">Gwyn, p. 436</ref> A change of heart toward Confederation was evident in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the ''Morning Chronicle'' newspaper announced on the front page of its July 1, 1867, edition the death of \"the free and enlightened Province of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"Gwyn, p. 436\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History|Canada|British Empire}}\n\n* [[Heritage Minutes]]\n* [[History of Canada]]\n* [[Former colonies and territories in Canada]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{main|Bibliography of Canadian history}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Armstrong |first1=Frederick H |title=Handbook of Upper Canadian Chronology |publisher=Dundurn Press|year=1985|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZL9EJW4v2FYC&lpg=PA2&dq=Handbook%20of%20Upper%20Canadian%20Chronology&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=true|isbn= 0-919670-92-X}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Wwo9AAAAIAAJ |title=Canada Under British Rule 1760-1905|first=John G|last=Bourinot|publisher=The Project Gutenberg eBook|year=1900}}\n* Craig, Gerald M ''Upper Canada: the formative years 1784-1841'' McClelland and Stewart, 1963, the standard history [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=10369212 online edition]\n* Creighton, Donald.

After the band finished for the night, Powell wandered near Broad Street Station and was apprehended, drunk, by the private railroad police. He was beaten by them and incarcerated briefly by the city police.

Her parents split up when Mark was only 1 year old and she lived with her mother in Miami until the age of 9 when they moved to India so that her mother could study Thangka, a traditional Buddhist form of art. After 3 years living in a monastery in India, Mark and her mother moved to Berlin, and after graduating high school at the age of 18 she moved to New York to live with her godparents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edailybuzz.com/2019/03/12/amber-mark-wiki-bio-2019-age-height-net-worth-birthday-mother-boyfriend-social-media/|title=Amber Mark Wiki, Bio 2019: Age, Height, Net worth, Birthday, Mother, Boyfriend, Social Media.|date=March 12, 2019|work=edailybuzz.com|accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer mother, Mia, died on 3 June 2013 at the age of 60.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5Y_Mni-eU|title=Amber Mark - Monsoon (Official Video) ft.

In high school, she joined the school choir and an \u201cafter school band program\u201d. She stated in an interview that this was when she realized that being an artist was what she wanted to do.<ref>(2017, August 21) Retrieved November 19, 2019, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3pNkDnoo5k&t=102s</ref> Her mother was a huge part of her early life and one of her first songs was in dedication to her mother's passing in 2013.<ref>Ciara, H., & Calum, S.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker. Amber remembers crying after the concert was over.\n\n===2016-present:Musical career===\nMark released her debut single \"S P A C E\" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album \"3:33am\".

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage.

For example, ''b\u00edi'' begins a statement, but ''b\u00edide'' begins a statement that is part of a narrative; ''b\u00f3oth'' begins a request made in pain; ''b\u00e1ada'' begins a question that is meant in jest.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\n[[Pronoun]]s in L\u00e1adan are built up from a number of constituent parts. The consonant ''l'' marks the [[grammatical person|first person]], ''n'' the second person and ''b'' the third person. Usually, these are followed by the vowel ''e''. However, the vowel ''a'' is used to designate someone who is loved (''lhe-'' is prefixed to describe someone who is despised). The suffix ''-zh'' is used to mark a plural pronoun for numbers up to four, and ''-n'' for numbers beyond that. Therefore, ''lazh'' means \"we, several beloved\", and ''lheben'' means \"they, many despised\".\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Language and gender]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Elgin, Suzette Haden, & Diane Martin.

For example, ''b\u00edi'' begins a statement, but ''b\u00edide'' begins a statement that is part of a narrative; ''b\u00f3oth'' begins a request made in pain; ''b\u00e1ada'' begins a question that is meant in jest.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\n[[Pronoun]]s in L\u00e1adan are built up from a number of constituent parts. The consonant ''l'' marks the [[grammatical person|first person]], ''n'' the second person and ''b'' the third person. Usually, these are followed by the vowel ''e''. However, the vowel ''a'' is used to designate someone who is loved (''lhe-'' is prefixed to describe someone who is despised). The suffix ''-zh'' is used to mark a plural pronoun for numbers up to four, and ''-n'' for numbers beyond that. Therefore, ''lazh'' means \"we, several beloved\", and ''lheben'' means \"they, many despised\".\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Language and gender]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Elgin, Suzette Haden, & Diane Martin.

Ticino borders the [[canton of Uri]] to the north, the [[canton of Valais]] to the west (through the [[Nufenen Pass|Novena Pass]]), the [[canton of Graub\u00fcnden]] to the northeast, [[Italy]]'s regions of [[Piedmont]] and [[Lombardy]] to the south and it surrounds the small Italian [[enclave]] of [[Campione d'Italia]].\n\nNamed after the river [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]], it is the only canton where [[Italian language|Italian]] is the sole official language and represents the bulk of the Italian-speaking area of Switzerland along with the [[Italian Graub\u00fcnden|southern parts of Graub\u00fcnden]].\n\nThe land now occupied by the canton was annexed from [[Italian city-states|Italian cities]] in the 15th century by various Swiss forces in the last [[transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy]]. In the [[Helvetic Republic]], established 1798, it was divided between the two new cantons of [[Canton of Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] and [[Canton of Lugano|Lugano]]. The [[Act of Mediation|creation of the Swiss Confederation in 1803]] saw these two cantons combine to form the modern canton of Ticino.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Ticino'' was chosen for the newly established canton in 1803, after the [[Ticino river]] which flows through it from the [[Nufenen Pass|Novena Pass]] to [[Lake Maggiore]].<ref name=aet>{{cite web|title=Lo scorrere del fiume, l\u2019opera dell\u2019uomo|url=http://www.aet.ch/comunicati_det.html?idnews=7195|publisher=Azienda elettrica ticinese|accessdate=28 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028232235/http://www.aet.ch/comunicati_det.html?idnews=7195|archive-date=28 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nKnown as ''Ticinus'' in Roman times, the river appears on the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] as ''Ticenum''.

Later, probably around the rule of [[Augustus]], it became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. After the fall of the Western Empire, it was ruled by the [[Ostrogoths]], the [[Lombards]] and the [[Franks]]. Around 1100 it was the centre of struggle between the free communes of [[Milan]] and [[Como]]: in the 14th century it was acquired by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], Dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]. In the fifteenth century the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Confederates conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate conquests.\n\nBetween 1403 and 1422 some of these lands were already annexed by forces from the [[canton of Uri]], but subsequently lost. Uri conquered the [[Valle Leventina|Leventina Valley]] in 1440.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Switzerland | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | volume = 26 | pages = 933\u20134 | year = 1911 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA933 | accessdate = 23 October 2008}}</ref> In a second conquest Uri, [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] and [[Canton of Nidwalden|Nidwalden]] gained the town of [[Bellinzona]] and the Riviera in 1500.<ref name=\"EB\"/> Some of the land and Bellinzona itself were previously annexed by [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] in 1419 but lost again in 1422. The third conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation (at that time constituted by 12 cantons). In 1512 [[Locarno]], the [[Maggia Valley]], [[Lugano]] and [[Mendrisio]] were annexed. Subsequently, the upper valley of the river [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]], from the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif|St. Gotthard]] to the town of Biasca ([[Valle Leventina|Leventina Valley]]) was part of Uri. The remaining territory (''Baliaggi Ultramontani'', ''Ennetbergische Vogteien'', the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains) was administered by the Twelve Cantons. These districts were governed by bailiffs holding office for two years and purchasing it from the members of the League.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\n[[File:Ticino franco 1813 Cng641602.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Ticino franco|Ticinese franco]], currency of Ticino until the introduction of the [[Swiss franc]] in 1850.]]\n[[File:Verzasca Hut.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Stone house in [[Valle Verzasca]]]]\n\nThe lands of the canton of Ticino are the last lands to be conquered by the [[Swiss Confederation]]. The Confederation gave up any further conquests after their defeat at the [[battle of Marignano]] in 1515 by [[Francis I of France]]. The Val Leventina revolted unsuccessfully against [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] in 1755.<ref name=\"EB\"/> In February 1798 an attempt of annexation by the [[Cisalpine Republic]] was repelled by a volunteer militia in Lugano. Between 1798 and 1803, during the [[Helvetic Republic]], two cantons were created ([[Canton of Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] and [[Canton of Lugano|Lugano]]) but in 1803 the two were unified to form the canton of Ticino that joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member in the same year under the [[Act of Mediation]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> During the [[Napoleonic War]]s, many Ticinesi (as was the case for other [[Swiss people|Swiss]]) served in Swiss military units allied with the [[France|French]]. The canton minted its own [[currency]], the [[Ticinese franco]], between 1813 and 1850, when it began use of the [[Swiss franc]].\n\nIn the early 19th century, the contemporary Franco-Danish scholar [[Conrad Malte-Brun]] stated that: \"The canton of Tesino [Ticino] is the poorest, and the people the most ignorant of any in Switzerland.<ref>Malte-Brun, Conrad\n2015[1824] Universal Geography: or A Description of All Parts of the World, on a New Plan, According to the Great Natural Divisions of the globe; Accompanied with Analytical, Synoptical, and Elementary Tables.

In 1878, however, Bellinzona became the only and permanent capital. The 1870\u20131891 period saw a surge of political turbulence in Ticino, and the authorities needed the assistance of the federal government to restore order in several instances, in 1870, 1876, 1889 and 1890\u20131891.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/constit_gol_2001_00_3358|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/constit_gol_2001_00_3358/page/132 132]|title=Constituting Federal Sovereignty: The European Union in Comparative Context|first=Leslie Friedman|last=Goldstein|date=21 August 2001|publisher=JHU Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe current cantonal constitution dates from 1997.

The northern, highest part, the [[Sopraceneri]], is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around [[Lake Maggiore]]: [[Ticino valley]] and [[Maggia valley]]. The southern part, the [[Sottoceneri]], is the region around [[Lake Lugano]].\n\nThe [[Ticino river]] is the largest river in the canton. It drains most of the canton, flowing from the northwest through the [[Bedretto valley]] and the [[Valle Leventina|Leventina]] valley to enter Lake Maggiore near [[Locarno]]. Its main tributaries are the [[Brenno]] in the [[Blenio valley]] and the [[Moesa River|Moesa]] in the [[Mesolcina]] valley in [[Graub\u00fcnden]]. The lands of most of the canton are shaped by the river, which in its mid portion forms a wide valley, commonly known as the ''Riviera''.\n\nThe western lands of the canton, however, are drained by the [[Maggia River]]. The [[Valle Verzasca]] is between the Ticino and the Maggia. There is also a smaller area that drains directly into the [[Lake Lugano]].

In the [[Helvetic Republic]], established 1798, it was divided between the two new cantons of [[Canton of Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] and [[Canton of Lugano|Lugano]]. The [[Act of Mediation|creation of the Swiss Confederation in 1803]] saw these two cantons combine to form the modern canton of Ticino.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Ticino'' was chosen for the newly established canton in 1803, after the [[Ticino river]] which flows through it from the [[Nufenen Pass|Novena Pass]] to [[Lake Maggiore]].<ref name=aet>{{cite web|title=Lo scorrere del fiume, l\u2019opera dell\u2019uomo|url=http://www.aet.ch/comunicati_det.html?idnews=7195|publisher=Azienda elettrica ticinese|accessdate=28 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028232235/http://www.aet.ch/comunicati_det.html?idnews=7195|archive-date=28 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nKnown as ''Ticinus'' in Roman times, the river appears on the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] as ''Ticenum''.

Later, probably around the rule of [[Augustus]], it became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. After the fall of the Western Empire, it was ruled by the [[Ostrogoths]], the [[Lombards]] and the [[Franks]]. Around 1100 it was the centre of struggle between the free communes of [[Milan]] and [[Como]]: in the 14th century it was acquired by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], Dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]. In the fifteenth century the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Confederates conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate conquests.\n\nBetween 1403 and 1422 some of these lands were already annexed by forces from the [[canton of Uri]], but subsequently lost. Uri conquered the [[Valle Leventina|Leventina Valley]] in 1440.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Switzerland | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | volume = 26 | pages = 933\u20134 | year = 1911 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA933 | accessdate = 23 October 2008}}</ref> In a second conquest Uri, [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] and [[Canton of Nidwalden|Nidwalden]] gained the town of [[Bellinzona]] and the Riviera in 1500.<ref name=\"EB\"/> Some of the land and Bellinzona itself were previously annexed by [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] in 1419 but lost again in 1422. The third conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation (at that time constituted by 12 cantons). In 1512 [[Locarno]], the [[Maggia Valley]], [[Lugano]] and [[Mendrisio]] were annexed. Subsequently, the upper valley of the river [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]], from the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif|St. Gotthard]] to the town of Biasca ([[Valle Leventina|Leventina Valley]]) was part of Uri. The remaining territory (''Baliaggi Ultramontani'', ''Ennetbergische Vogteien'', the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains) was administered by the Twelve Cantons.

The Confederation gave up any further conquests after their defeat at the [[battle of Marignano]] in 1515 by [[Francis I of France]]. The Val Leventina revolted unsuccessfully against [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] in 1755.<ref name=\"EB\"/> In February 1798 an attempt of annexation by the [[Cisalpine Republic]] was repelled by a volunteer militia in Lugano. Between 1798 and 1803, during the [[Helvetic Republic]], two cantons were created ([[Canton of Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] and [[Canton of Lugano|Lugano]]) but in 1803 the two were unified to form the canton of Ticino that joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member in the same year under the [[Act of Mediation]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> During the [[Napoleonic War]]s, many Ticinesi (as was the case for other [[Swiss people|Swiss]]) served in Swiss military units allied with the [[France|French]]. The canton minted its own [[currency]], the [[Ticinese franco]], between 1813 and 1850, when it began use of the [[Swiss franc]].\n\nIn the early 19th century, the contemporary Franco-Danish scholar [[Conrad Malte-Brun]] stated that: \"The canton of Tesino [Ticino] is the poorest, and the people the most ignorant of any in Switzerland.<ref>Malte-Brun, Conrad\n2015[1824] Universal Geography: or A Description of All Parts of the World, on a New Plan, According to the Great Natural Divisions of the globe; Accompanied with Analytical, Synoptical, and Elementary Tables.

The northern, highest part, the [[Sopraceneri]], is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around [[Lake Maggiore]]: [[Ticino valley]] and [[Maggia valley]]. The southern part, the [[Sottoceneri]], is the region around [[Lake Lugano]].\n\nThe [[Ticino river]] is the largest river in the canton. It drains most of the canton, flowing from the northwest through the [[Bedretto valley]] and the [[Valle Leventina|Leventina]] valley to enter Lake Maggiore near [[Locarno]]. Its main tributaries are the [[Brenno]] in the [[Blenio valley]] and the [[Moesa River|Moesa]] in the [[Mesolcina]] valley in [[Graub\u00fcnden]]. The lands of most of the canton are shaped by the river, which in its mid portion forms a wide valley, commonly known as the ''Riviera''.\n\nThe western lands of the canton, however, are drained by the [[Maggia River]]. The [[Valle Verzasca]] is between the Ticino and the Maggia. There is also a smaller area that drains directly into the [[Lake Lugano]]. Most of the land is considered within the [[Swiss Alps|Alps]] ([[Lepontine Alps]]), but a small area is part of the plain of the [[River Po]] which drains the north of [[Italy]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Ticino, while remaining [[alpine climate|alpine]], is noticeably milder than the rest of Switzerland's, enjoying a higher number of sunshine hours and generally warmer temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkingworld.com/home/index.asp?id=30&nid=289|title=Walkingworld \u2013 original article|website=Walkingworld.com|access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref> In German-speaking Switzerland, Ticino is nicknamed ''Sonnenstube'' (sun porch), owing to the more than 2,300 [[sunshine hours]] the canton receives every year, compared to 1,700 for Zurich.<ref name=\"SteinerKarnusian2014\">{{cite book|author1=J\u00fcrg Steiner|author2=Manuschak Karnusian|author3=Omar Gisler|title=MARCO POLO Reisef\u00fchrer Tessin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rn00AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA23|date=28 March 2014|publisher=Mair Dumont Marco Polo|isbn=978-3-8297-7172-6|page=23}}</ref>\n\n===Diocese===\nThe [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lugano]] is co-extensive to the canton.\n\n===Wine region===\n{{Main|Ticino (wine region)}}\nTicino is one of the wine regions for [[Swiss wine]].

The film is loosely based on the [[Under the Skin (novel)|2000 novel]] by [[Michel Faber]]. It stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as an otherworldly woman who preys on men in [[Scotland]]. The film premiered at [[Telluride Film Festival]] on 29 August 2013. It was released in the UK on 14 March 2014 and the United States on 4 April 2014.\n\nGlazer developed ''Under the Skin'' for over a decade; he and co-screenwriter Walter Campbell pared it back from an elaborate, special effects-heavy concept to a sparse story focusing on an alien perspective of the human world. Most characters were played by non-actors, and many scenes were filmed with [[hidden camera]]s.\n\nThe film grossed \u00a35.2 million at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=undertheskin2014.htm|title=Under the Skin (2014) (2014) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> It received critical acclaim, particularly for Johansson's performance, Glazer's direction, and [[Micachu|Mica Levi]]'s score, and received [[List of accolades received by Under the Skin|multiple awards]].

Please don't add unnecessary detail. -->\nIn [[Glasgow]], a motorcyclist ([[Jeremy McWilliams]]) retrieves an inert young woman (Lynsey Taylor Mackay) from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) dons her clothes. After buying clothes and make-up at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van around Scotland, picking up men. She lures a man (Joe Szula) into a dilapidated house. As he undresses, following the woman into a void, he is submerged in a liquid abyss.\n\nAt a beach, the woman attempts to pick up a swimmer ([[Kry\u0161tof H\u00e1dek]]), but is interrupted by the cries of a drowning couple. The swimmer rescues the husband, but the husband rushes back into the water to save his wife and both drown. As the swimmer lies exhausted on the beach, the woman strikes his head with a rock, drags him to the van, and drives away, ignoring the couple's distraught baby. Later that night, the motorcyclist retrieves the swimmer's belongings, ignoring the baby, who is still on the beach.\n\nThe woman visits a nightclub and picks up another man ([[Paul Brannigan]]). At the house, he follows her into the void and is submerged in the liquid. Suspended beneath the surface, he sees the swimmer floating naked beside him, alive but bloated and almost immobile. When he reaches to touch him, the swimmer's body collapses and a red mass empties through a trough.\n\nThe next day, the woman receives a rose from a street vendor, purchased from another man in traffic. She then listens to a radio report about the missing family from the beach. The woman then seduces a lonely man with facial disfigurement ([[Adam Pearson (actor)|Adam Pearson]]) but lets him leave after examining herself in a mirror. The motorcyclist intercepts the man and bundles him into a car, then sets out in pursuit of the woman with three other motorcyclists.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Highlands]], the woman abandons the van in the fog. She walks to a restaurant and attempts to eat cake, but retches and spits it out. At a bus stop, she meets a man (Michael Moreland) who offers to help her. At his house, he prepares a meal for her and they watch television. Alone in her room, she examines her body in a mirror. They visit a ruined castle, where the man carries her over a puddle and helps her down some steps. At his house, they kiss and begin to have sex, but the woman stops and examines her genitals.\n\nWandering in a forest, the woman meets a commercial logger (Dave Acton) and shelters in a [[bothy]]. She awakes to find the logger molesting her. She runs into the wilderness but he catches and attempts to rape her; he tears her skin, revealing a black, featureless body. As the woman extricates herself from her skin, the man douses her in fuel and burns her alive. Elsewhere, the motorcyclist stands on a mountaintop and looks out across a snowy field.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nDirector [[Jonathan Glazer]] decided to adapt [[Michel Faber]]'s novel ''[[Under the Skin (novel)|Under the Skin]]'' (2000) after finishing his debut film ''[[Sexy Beast]]'' (2000), but work did not begin until he had finished his second film, ''[[Birth (film)|Birth]]'' (2004).<ref name=\":11\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/06/under-the-skin-director-jonathan-glazer-scarlett-johansson|title=Under the Skin: why did this chilling masterpiece take a decade? |last=Leigh |first=Danny | date=2014-03-06 | website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> Glazer's producer James Wilson sent him a script that closely adapted the novel; Glazer admired the script but had no interest in filming it, saying: \"I knew then that I absolutely didn't want to film the book.

It was released in the UK on 14 March 2014 and the United States on 4 April 2014.\n\nGlazer developed ''Under the Skin'' for over a decade; he and co-screenwriter Walter Campbell pared it back from an elaborate, special effects-heavy concept to a sparse story focusing on an alien perspective of the human world. Most characters were played by non-actors, and many scenes were filmed with [[hidden camera]]s.\n\nThe film grossed \u00a35.2 million at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=undertheskin2014.htm|title=Under the Skin (2014) (2014) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> It received critical acclaim, particularly for Johansson's performance, Glazer's direction, and [[Micachu|Mica Levi]]'s score, and received [[List of accolades received by Under the Skin|multiple awards]]. It ranks 61st on the [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]] list.\n\n== Plot ==<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, film summaries must be between 400 and 700  words. Please don't add unnecessary detail. -->\nIn [[Glasgow]], a motorcyclist ([[Jeremy McWilliams]]) retrieves an inert young woman (Lynsey Taylor Mackay) from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) dons her clothes. After buying clothes and make-up at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van around Scotland, picking up men. She lures a man (Joe Szula) into a dilapidated house. As he undresses, following the woman into a void, he is submerged in a liquid abyss.\n\nAt a beach, the woman attempts to pick up a swimmer ([[Kry\u0161tof H\u00e1dek]]), but is interrupted by the cries of a drowning couple. The swimmer rescues the husband, but the husband rushes back into the water to save his wife and both drown. As the swimmer lies exhausted on the beach, the woman strikes his head with a rock, drags him to the van, and drives away, ignoring the couple's distraught baby. Later that night, the motorcyclist retrieves the swimmer's belongings, ignoring the baby, who is still on the beach.\n\nThe woman visits a nightclub and picks up another man ([[Paul Brannigan]]). At the house, he follows her into the void and is submerged in the liquid. Suspended beneath the surface, he sees the swimmer floating naked beside him, alive but bloated and almost immobile. When he reaches to touch him, the swimmer's body collapses and a red mass empties through a trough.\n\nThe next day, the woman receives a rose from a street vendor, purchased from another man in traffic. She then listens to a radio report about the missing family from the beach. The woman then seduces a lonely man with facial disfigurement ([[Adam Pearson (actor)|Adam Pearson]]) but lets him leave after examining herself in a mirror. The motorcyclist intercepts the man and bundles him into a car, then sets out in pursuit of the woman with three other motorcyclists.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Highlands]], the woman abandons the van in the fog. She walks to a restaurant and attempts to eat cake, but retches and spits it out. At a bus stop, she meets a man (Michael Moreland) who offers to help her. At his house, he prepares a meal for her and they watch television. Alone in her room, she examines her body in a mirror. They visit a ruined castle, where the man carries her over a puddle and helps her down some steps. At his house, they kiss and begin to have sex, but the woman stops and examines her genitals.\n\nWandering in a forest, the woman meets a commercial logger (Dave Acton) and shelters in a [[bothy]]. She awakes to find the logger molesting her. She runs into the wilderness but he catches and attempts to rape her; he tears her skin, revealing a black, featureless body. As the woman extricates herself from her skin, the man douses her in fuel and burns her alive. Elsewhere, the motorcyclist stands on a mountaintop and looks out across a snowy field.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nDirector [[Jonathan Glazer]] decided to adapt [[Michel Faber]]'s novel ''[[Under the Skin (novel)|Under the Skin]]'' (2000) after finishing his debut film ''[[Sexy Beast]]'' (2000), but work did not begin until he had finished his second film, ''[[Birth (film)|Birth]]'' (2004).<ref name=\":11\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/06/under-the-skin-director-jonathan-glazer-scarlett-johansson|title=Under the Skin: why did this chilling masterpiece take a decade? |last=Leigh |first=Danny | date=2014-03-06 | website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref> Glazer's producer James Wilson sent him a script that closely adapted the novel; Glazer admired the script but had no interest in filming it, saying: \"I knew then that I absolutely didn't want to film the book.
