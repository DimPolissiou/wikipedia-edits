Egypt's various social groups and classes apply Islam differently in their daily lives. The literate theologians of Al-Azhar generally reject the popular version of Islam practised by religious preachers and peasants in the countryside, which is heavily Sufi-influenced. Sufism has flourished in Egypt since Islam was first adopted. Most upper- and middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression is a private matter for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cuts across class lines, have been present in most cities and in many villages for a long time.\n\nAccording to the [[constitution of Egypt]], any new legislation must at least implicitly agree with [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. The mainstream [[Hanafi]] school of Sunni Islam is largely controlled by the state, through ''Wizaret Al-Awkaf'' (Ministry of Religious Affairs). ''Al-Awkaf'' controls all mosques and supervises Muslim clerics, but the [[Shafi'i]] and [[Maliki]] madhhabs were mixed together. [[Imam]]s are trained in Imam vocational schools and at Al-Azhar.

For a while, Jews from across the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Europe were attracted to Egypt due to the relative harmony that characterized the local religious landscape in the 19th and early 20th centuries. After the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], a great number of Jews were expelled by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. Their Egyptian citizenship was revoked and their properties were confiscated. A steady stream of emigration of Egyptian Jews followed, reaching a peak after the [[Six-Day War]] with [[Israel]] in 1967.

Egypt's various social groups and classes apply Islam differently in their daily lives. The literate theologians of Al-Azhar generally reject the popular version of Islam practised by religious preachers and peasants in the countryside, which is heavily Sufi-influenced. Sufism has flourished in Egypt since Islam was first adopted.

Jews participated in all aspects of Egypt's social, economic and political life; one of the most ardent Egyptian nationalists, [[Yaqub Sanu]]' (Abu Naddara), was Jewish, as were the musician [[Dawood Hosni|Dawoud Husni]], popular singer [[Leila Mourad]] and filmmaker Togo Mizrahi. For a while, Jews from across the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Europe were attracted to Egypt due to the relative harmony that characterized the local religious landscape in the 19th and early 20th centuries. After the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], a great number of Jews were expelled by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. Their Egyptian citizenship was revoked and their properties were confiscated. A steady stream of emigration of Egyptian Jews followed, reaching a peak after the [[Six-Day War]] with [[Israel]] in 1967. As of mid-2016, there were a total of 6 Jews remaining in Cairo, including their spiritual leader, Magda Tania Haroun, all women over the age of 65.<ref name=\"egyptindependent.com\"/> There are a further 12 Jews in the city of [[Alexandria]], whose spiritual leader is [[Ben Youssef Gaon]].<ref name=\"timesofisrael.com\">{{Cite web|title = Egypt's last Jews aim to keep heritage alive |url = https://www.timesofisrael.com/egypts-last-jews-aim-to-keep-alive-heritage/|website = timesofisrael.com|date = 26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Unrecognized and persecuted beliefs===\n\n====Ahmadiyya Islam====\n{{main|Ahmadiyya in Egypt}}\nThe [[Ahmadiyya]] movement in Egypt, which numbers up to 50,000 adherents in the country,<ref>Lawrence, Bruce B.

In AD 60 the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], determined to break the power of the druids, attacked the island using his amphibious [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavian]] contingent as a surprise [[vanguard]] assault<ref>Tacitus Agricola 18.3\u20135.</ref> and then destroying the shrine and the [[nemeton|nemeta]] ([[sacred grove]]s). News of [[Boudica]]'s revolt reached him just after his victory, causing him to withdraw his army before consolidating his conquest. The island was finally brought into the Roman Empire by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], the [[Roman governor]] of Britain, in AD 78. During the Roman occupation, the area was notable for the mining of [[copper]]. The foundations of [[Caer Gybi (fort)|Caer Gybi]], a fort in [[Holyhead]], are Roman, and the present road from Holyhead to [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]] was originally a [[Roman roads|Roman road]].<ref>{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Chisholm |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Chisholm |title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog |year=1910 |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog/page/n337 18]}}</ref> The island was grouped by [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] with [[Geography of Ireland|Ireland]] (\"[[Hibernia]]\") rather than with [[Great Britain|Britain]] (\"[[Albion]]\").<ref>{{citation |author=[[Ptolemy]] |title=[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geog.]] |at=Bk. 2, Ch. 1 & 2 }}</ref>\n\n[[British Iron Age]] and Roman sites have been excavated and coins and ornaments discovered, especially by the 19th-century [[antiquarian]] [[William Owen Stanley]].<ref>Stanley, ''Anglesey'', 1871, and many Celtic contributions, especially on Celtic subjects, to ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]''.</ref> After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in the early 5th century, pirates from [[Ireland]] colonised Anglesey and the nearby [[Ll\u0177n Peninsula]]. In response to this, [[Cunedda|Cunedda ap Edern]], a [[Gododdin]] warlord from [[Scotland]], came to the area and began to drive the Irish out. This was continued by his son [[Einion Yrth ap Cunedda]] and grandson [[Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion]]; the last Irish invaders were finally defeated in battle in 470. As an island, Anglesey was in a good defensive position, and so [[Aberffraw]] became the site of the court, or ''Llys'', of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. Apart from a devastating [[Denmark|Danish]] raid in 853 it remained the capital until the 13th century, when improvements to the [[England|English]] navy made the location indefensible. Anglesey was also briefly the most southerly possession of the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norwegian Empire]].\n\nAfter the Irish, the island was invaded by [[Vikings]] \u2014 some of these raids were noted in famous [[saga]]s (see [[Menai Strait#History|Menai Strait History]]) \u2014 and by [[Saxons]], and [[Normans]], before falling to [[Edward I of England]] in the 13th century.\n\nAnglesey (together with Holy Island) is one of the 13 [[historic counties of Wales]]. In medieval times, before the conquest of Wales in 1283, ''M\u00f4n'' often had periods of temporary independence, as it was frequently bequeathed to the heirs of kings as a sub-kingdom of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. The last times this occurred were a few years after 1171, following the death of [[Owain Gwynedd]], when the island was inherited by [[Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd]], and between 1246 and c. 1255, when it was granted to [[Owain Goch]] as his share of the kingdom. After the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Anglesey was created a county under the terms of the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] of 1284. Prior to this it had been divided into the ''[[cantref]]i'' of [[Cantref Aberffraw|Aberffraw]], [[Rhosyr (cantref)|Rhosyr]] and [[Cemais (Anglesey cantref)|Cemaes]].\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[First World War]], the Presbyterian minister and celebrity preacher John Williams toured the island as part of an effort to recruit young men to volunteer for a just war.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/anglesey-during-first-world-war-2036022 |title=Anglesey during the First World War and Second World War |last=Devine |first=Darren |date=2012-02-15 |work=walesonline |access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> German [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] were kept on the island.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy the end of the war, some 1,000 of the island's men had died while on active service.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 1936 the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] opened its first branch on Anglesey.<ref>''A Years' Work of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Annual Report for 1936-1937, adopted by the Council and Corporation, May 28, 1937'', London, p. 12.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Anglesey received Italian [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The island was designated a reception zone, and was home to evacuee children from Liverpool and Manchester.<ref name=\":0\" /> The island's location made it an ideal place to monitor [[U-boat|German U-Boats]] operating in the [[Irish Sea]].

The [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]] abolished the 1974 county and the five districts on 1 April 1996. Anglesey became a separate [[unitary authority]]. In 2011, the [[Welsh Government]] appointed a panel of commissioners to administer the council, thus the elected members were not in control. The commissioners remained in control until an [[Isle of Anglesey County Council election, 2013|election]] was held in May 2013, restoring an elected Council. Before the period of direct administration, there had been a majority of independent councillors. Though members did not generally divide along party lines, these were organised into five non-partisan groups on the council, containing a mix of party and independent candidates. The position remains substantially unchanged since the election, although the Labour Party has formed a governing coalition with the independents.\n\nThe principal offices of the [[Isle of Anglesey County Council]] ({{lang-cy|Cyngor Sir Ynys M\u00f4n}}) are in [[Llangefni]] ({{IPA-cy|\u026can\u02c8\u0261\u025bvni}}), the [[county town]].<ref name=\"Academy\">{{Cite book |last1=Davies |first1=John |author1-link=John Davies (historian) |last2=Jenkins |first2=Nigel |author2-link=Nigel Jenkins |last3=Baines |first3=Menna |last4=Llynch |first4=Peredur |year=2008 |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |location=Cardiff |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6 |page=494}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Britannia Bridge Train crossing 3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Britannia Bridge]] from the east along the [[Menai Strait]]]]\nAnglesey is a relatively low-lying island, with low hills spaced evenly over the north of the island. The highest six are [[Holyhead Mountain]], {{convert|220|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd Bodafon]], {{convert|178|m|ft}}; [[Llaneilian|Mynydd Llaneilian]], {{convert|177|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd y Garn]], {{convert|170|m|ft}}; [[Bwrdd Arthur]], {{convert|164|m|ft}}; and Mynydd Llwydiarth, {{convert|158|m|ft}}. To the south and south-east, the island is separated from the Welsh mainland by the [[Menai Strait]], which at its narrowest point is about {{convert|250|m|yd}} wide. In all other directions the island is surrounded by the [[Irish Sea]]. At 714&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, it is the [[List of European islands by area|51st largest island]] in Europe, (although technically [[Madeira]] is part of Africa), and just five square kilometres smaller than [[Singapore]].\n\nThere are several small towns scattered around the island, making it quite evenly populated. The largest are [[Holyhead]], [[Llangefni]], [[Benllech]], [[Menai Bridge]], and [[Amlwch]]. [[Beaumaris]] (Welsh: ''Biwmares''), in the east of the island, features [[Beaumaris Castle]], built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as part of his [[Bastide|Bastide Town]] campaign in [[North Wales]]. Beaumaris is a [[yachting]] centre, with many boats moored in the bay or off Gallows Point. The village of [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] (Welsh: ''Niwbwrch''), in the south, created when the townsfolk of Llanfaes were relocated to make way for the building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of [[Llys Rhosyr]], another of the courts of the medieval Welsh princes, which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. [[Llangefni]] is located in the centre and is the island's administrative centre. The town of [[Menai Bridge]] (Welsh: ''Porthaethwy'', in the south-east) expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, to accommodate workers and construction. Until then, Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies [[Bryn Celli Ddu]], a [[Stone Age]] burial mound.\n\nNearby is the village with the longest name in Europe, [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]]gogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, and [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]], ancestral home of the [[Marquess of Anglesey|Marquesses of Anglesey]]. The town of [[Amlwch]] is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century by supporting an important [[copper]]-mining industry at [[Parys Mountain]].\n[[File:Penmon Lighthouse off Anglesey.jpg|thumb|[[Trwyn Du Lighthouse]]]]\n[[File:Anglesey Coast - geograph.org.uk - 1367265.jpg|thumb|Anglesey coast]]\n[[File:Menai Bridge - Anglesey August 2009 (3834581170).jpg|thumb|right|Menai Bridge]]\nOther villages and settlements include [[Cemaes]], [[Pentraeth]], [[Gaerwen]], [[Dwyran]], [[Bodedern]], [[Malltraeth]] and [[Rhosneigr]]. The [[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] is a local tourist attraction, providing a descriptive look{{clarify|date=January 2019}} at local marine [[wildlife]] from [[Homarus gammarus|common lobsters]] to [[conger]]s. All the fish and [[crustacean]]s on display are caught around the island and placed in reconstructions of their natural [[habitat]]. The zoo also breeds lobsters commercially for food, and [[oyster]]s, for pearls, both from local stocks. Sea salt (''Halen M\u00f4n'', evaporated from the local sea water), now produced in a modern facility nearby, was formerly produced at the Sea Zoo site.\n\nThere are a few natural lakes, mostly in the west, such as [[Llyn Llywenan]], the largest on the island, Llyn Coron, and Cors Cerrig y Daran, but rivers are few and small. There are two large water supply reservoirs operated by [[Welsh Water]]. These are [[Llyn Alaw]] to the north of the island and [[Llyn Cefni]] in the centre of the island, which is fed by the headwaters of the [[Afon Cefni]].\n\nThe climate is humid (though much less so than neighbouring mountainous [[Gwynedd]]) and generally equable, being influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The land is of variable quality and it was probably much more fertile in the past. Anglesey is the home of the northernmost [[olive]] grove in Europe and presumably in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=First Welsh olive grove planted on Anglesey |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-welsh-olive-grove-planted-2262852 |accessdate=2013-05-09 |date=30 April 2007 |work=WalesOnline}}</ref>\n\n==Coastal path==\nThe rural coastline has been designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. It has many sandy beaches, notably along its east coast between the towns of Beaumaris and Amlwch and the west coast from [[Ynys Llanddwyn]] through [[Rhosneigr]] to the bays around Carmel Head.

Agriculture provides the secondary source of income for the economy, with local dairies being some of the most productive in the region.\n\nMajor industry is restricted to Holyhead (Caergybi), which until 30 September 2009 supported an [[aluminium smelting|aluminium smelter]], and the [[Amlwch]] area, once a copper mining town. Nearby is the site of the former [[Wylfa Nuclear Power Station]] and a former [[bromine]] extraction plant. With construction starting in 1963, the two Wylfa reactors began producing electricity in 1971. One reactor was decommissioned in 2012 and the other in 2015. Plans were developed for a replacement reactor, planned by [[Horizon Nuclear Power|Horizon]], a subsidiary of [[Hitachi]], to start production in the 2020s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/04/reduced-subsidies-onshore-windfarms-good-news |title=Renewables industry welcomes reduced subsidies for onshore windfarms |author=Damian Carrington |work=the Guardian |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The replacement has been enthusiastically endorsed by Anglesey Council and Welsh Assembly members, but protesters have raised doubts about the economic and safety claims made for the plant,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/8596392.stm Anglesey protest over plans for new nuclear power plant] BBC News, 30 March 2014</ref> and in January 2019 Hitachi announced it was putting development work on hold, which meant the plant's future was put in serious doubt.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hitachi's Wylfa nuclear project pause 'tremendous blow' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46902723 |website=BBC News |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAnglesey also has three wind farms on land,<ref name=energy>[http://www.anglesey-today.com/energy.html Anglesey Today: Energy] accessed 15 April 2014</ref> and more than twenty offshore [[wind turbine]]s near the north coast.

The Royal Air Force station [[RAF Valley]] (Y Fali) is home to the RAF Fast Jet Training School and 22 Sqn Search and Rescue Helicopters, both units providing employment to about 500 civilians. RAF Valley is now the 22 Sqn Search and Rescue headquarters.\n\nThere is a wide range of smaller industries, mostly in industrial and business parks, especially at [[Llangefni]] and [[Gaerwen]]. These include an [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]], [[fine chemical]] manufacturing, and factories for timber production, aluminium smelting, fish farming and food processing.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The island is on one of the main road routes from Britain to [[Ireland]], via [[ferry|ferries]] from [[Holyhead]], off the west of Anglesey on Holy Island, serving [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin]] Port.\n\n==Ecology and conservation==\nMuch of Anglesey is used for relatively intensive cattle and sheep farming. However, there are several important [[wetland]] sites that have protected status. In addition, the several lakes all have significant ecological interest, including their support for a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic bird species. In the west, the [[Malltraeth Marsh]]es are believed to support an occasional visiting [[bittern]], and the nearby estuary of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]] supports a bird population made internationally famous by the paintings of [[Charles Tunnicliffe]], who lived for many years and died at [[Malltraeth]] on the Cefni estuary. The [[RAF]] airstrip at Mona is a nesting site for [[skylark]]s. The sheer cliff faces at [[South Stack]] near [[Holyhead]] provide nesting sites for huge numbers of [[auk]]s, including [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]s, [[razorbill]]s and [[common guillemot|guillemot]]s, together with [[chough]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]s. Anglesey is home to several species of tern, including the [[roseate tern]]. Three sites on Anglesey are important for breeding terns \u2013 see [[Anglesey tern colonies]].\n\nThere are marked occurrences of the [[Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow|''Juncus subnodulosus''\u2013''Cirsium palustre'' fen-meadow]] [[plant association]], a [[habitat]] marked by certain hydrophilic grasses, sedges and forbs.<ref>*C.

The coastal zone of Anglesey was designated as an AONB in 1966 and confirmed as such in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe AONB is predominantly a coastal designation, covering most of Anglesey's {{convert|125|mi|km|0}} coastline but also encompasses Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. Substantial areas of other land protected by the AONB form the backdrop to the coast. The AONB is about 221&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (85 sq mi) and it is the largest AONB in Wales, covering one third of the island.\n\nA number of the habitats in Anglesey gain still greater protection through both UK and European designations of their nature conservation value. These include:\n*6 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs)\n*4 Special Protection Areas (SPAs)\n*1 National Nature Reserve\n*26 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)\n*52 Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs)\nThese habitats support a variety of wildlife, such as [[harbour porpoise]]s and [[marsh fritillary]].\n\nThe AONB also takes in three sections of open, undeveloped coastline designated as Heritage Coast. These non-statutory designations complement the AONB and cover about {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} of the coastline. The sections of Heritage Coast are:\n#North Anglesey {{convert|28.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n#Holyhead Mountain {{convert|12.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n#Aberffraw Bay {{convert|7.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n\nPopular recreations include sailing, angling, cycling, walking, wind surfing and jet skiing.

Anglesey's biggest successes were at the [[1997 Island Games]] held in [[Jersey]], (11th in the medals table, with two gold, three silver and nine bronze medals) and the [[2005 Island Games]] in the [[Shetland Islands]], (again 11th, with 4 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze).\n\nThe annual Anglesey Show is held on the second Tuesday and Wednesday of August. Farmers from around the country compete in livestock rearing contests, including sheep and cattle.\n\nAnglesey has featured in the [[Channel 4]] archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' (series 14). The episode was transmitted on 4 February 2007.\n\nThe island hosts Gottwood, an electronic music and arts festival held each summer at the Carreglwyd estate. The Druidic college at Anglesey is referred to in the metal band [[Eluveitie]]'s song \"Inis Mona\", an incorrect spelling of Ynys M\u00f4n.\n\n[[Capital Cymru]], a commercial [[contemporary hit radio]] station, also covers [[Gwynedd]]. [[M\u00f4n FM]], a volunteer community radio station, broadcasts from the county town, Llangefni.\n\n==Welsh language==\nAnglesey is a stronghold of the [[Welsh language]] and according to the 2011 census it was the local authority with the second highest proportion of Welsh speakers.

The general line of strike of the formations in the island is from north-east to south-west.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}} A belt of [[granitic|granitic rocks]] lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from [[Llanfaelog]] near the coast to the vicinity of [[Llanerchymedd]]. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of [[Ordovician]] slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out in the north of the island between [[Dulas Bay]] and Carmel Point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses [[Carboniferous]] rocks are found. The [[Carboniferous Limestone]] occupies a broad area south of [[Lligwy Bay]] and [[Pentraeth]], and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by [[Llangefni]] to [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth Sands]]. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow [[sandstone]] (sometimes considered to be of [[Old Red Sandstone]] age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast around [[Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd|Llanfihangel]] and [[Llangoed]]; and in the south-west round Llanidan near the [[Menai Strait]]. [[Puffin Island, Anglesey|Puffin Island]] is made of carboniferous limestone. [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth marsh]] is occupied by Coal Measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the [[Menai Strait]]. A patch of rhyolitic/[[felsite|felsitic]] rocks form [[Parys Mountain]], where copper and iron ochre have been worked.

The [[A5025 road|A5025]] round the northern edge of Anglesey and the [[A4080 road|A4080]] round the southern edge form a ring.\n\nAnglesey's six railway stations are [[Holyhead railway station|Holyhead]], [[Valley railway station|Valley]], [[Rhosneigr railway station|Rhosneigr]], [[Ty Croes railway station|Ty Croes]], [[Bodorgan railway station|Bodorgan]] and [[Llanfairpwll railway station|Llanfairpwll]]. All are on the [[North Wales Coast Line]], with services operated by [[Avanti West Coast]] to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], and by [[Transport for Wales Rail]] to [[Chester railway station|Chester]], [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]]. Historically the island was also served by the [[Anglesey Central Railway]] which ran from [[Gaerwen]] to [[Amlwch]], and the [[Red Wharf Bay branch line]] between the [[Holland Arms railway station]] and [[Red Wharf Bay]].\n\nBy air, [[Anglesey Airport]] has a twice-daily scheduled service to [[Cardiff Airport]], where connections worldwide can be made.\n\nThe [[ferry]] [[port of Holyhead]] handles more than 2 million passengers each year. [[Stena Line]] and [[Irish Ferries]] sail to [[Dublin]] and previously to [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] in [[Ireland]], forming the principal link for surface [[transport]] from central and northern [[England]] and [[Wales]] to [[Ireland]].\n\n==Sport and leisure==\nAnglesey is independently represented in the [[Island Games]] (under its Welsh name ''Ynys M\u00f4n'').

The island expected to benefit from more than \u00a33m of spending if it had hosted the event. However, Anglesey currently lacks two facilities necessary for a successful bid, a six-lane competition swimming pool and an athletics track.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Clark |first=Rhodri |title=Out of the running for island 'Olympics' |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/08/02/out-of-the-running-for-island-olympics-91466-21452392/ |accessdate=30 August 2010 |newspaper=Western Mail}}</ref>\n\nSeveral precursors to the modern football codes were highly popular in Anglesey. They had few rules, and were quite violent. Rhys Cox, at the turn of the 18th century, described a game in [[Llandrygan]] as ending with \"&#91;n&#93;umbers of players...  left here and there on the road, some having limbs broken in the struggle, others severely injured, and some carried on biers to be buried in the churchyard nearest to where they had been mortally injured.\" William Bulkeley, in his April 1734 diary, records that the violence of such games left no hard feelings, with both sides parting \"as good friends as they came, after they had spent half an hour together cherishing their spirits with a cup of ale... having finished Easter Holydays innocently and merrily.\"{{sfnp |ETBRS |2005b}}\n\n===Association football===\nFootball arrived on the island in the 1870s. It was initially met with resistance, given its locally perceived associations with drunkenness and rowdiness, and the lower classes. One critic dismissed it as \"un-Christian practice\". The Anglesey League, comprising teams from [[Amlwch]], [[Beaumaris]], [[Holyhead]], [[Menai Bridge]], [[Llandegfan]], and [[Llangefni]], was, however, formed in the 1895\u20131896 football season.{{sfnp |Pretty |2005}}\n\nThe [[Anglesey football team|Ynys M\u00f4n]] football team represent the island of Anglesey at the biannual [[Island Games]], winning gold in 1999. In 2018, the island was chosen to host the [[2019 Inter Games Football Tournament]], where the men's team won gold and the women's team won silver.\n\nAs of the 2019-20 season, [[Llangefni Town F.C.|Llangefni Town]] play in the [[Cymru North]] league - at the second tier of the [[Welsh football league system]], after winning the [[Welsh Alliance League]] title the previous season.\n\nThere are seven Anglesey clubs playing in the Welsh Alliance, including [[Bodedern Athletic F.C.|Bodedern Athletic]] and [[Holyhead Hotspur F.C.|Holyhead Hotspur]] in Division One. Local clubs also participate in the [[Gwynedd League]] and the [[Anglesey League]].\n\n===Rugby Union===\n[[Llangefni RFC]] is the island's highest competing team in the [[WRU Division One North]].\n\n[[Llangoed]] hosts an annual [[rugby sevens]] contest. Touring sides have included Manhattan RFC.\n\n===Anglesey Hunt===\nThe Anglesey Hunt, formed in 1757, was the second oldest [[fox hunting]] association in Wales (the oldest being the Tivyside Hunt in Cardiganshire).{{sfnp|ETBRS|2005a}}\n\n===Athletics===\nEvery September the Anglesey Festival of Running takes place. It includes a marathon, a half-marathon, 10-km and 5\u2013km races, and children's contests. Its slogan is ''Run the Island''.\n\n===Motorsport===\nThe [[Anglesey Circuit]] (Welsh: Trac M\u00f4n) is a fully licensed MSA and ACU championship racing circuit that opened in 1997.\n\n===Cricket===\nThe Beaumaris Cricket Club was formed in 1858. Clubs at [[Holyhead]], [[Amlwch]] and [[Llangefni]] were formed within the following decade, but it was not until the 1880s that the sport became popular outside the upper classes. [[Bodedern]] Cricket Club was formed in 1947.{{sfnp |Pretty |2005}}\n\n===Sailing===\nThe Royal Anglesey Yacht Club hosts the Menai Strait Regatta yearly.\n\n===Swimming===\nThe Menai Strait hosts two annual open-water swimming contests: the Menai Strait Swim from Foel to Caernarfon (1 mile), and the Pier to Pier Open Water Swim, between [[Beaumaris Pier|Beaumaris]] and [[Garth Pier]],

In AD 60 the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], determined to break the power of the druids, attacked the island using his amphibious [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavian]] contingent as a surprise [[vanguard]] assault<ref>Tacitus Agricola 18.3\u20135.</ref> and then destroying the shrine and the [[nemeton|nemeta]] ([[sacred grove]]s). News of [[Boudica]]'s revolt reached him just after his victory, causing him to withdraw his army before consolidating his conquest. The island was finally brought into the Roman Empire by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], the [[Roman governor]] of Britain, in AD 78. During the Roman occupation, the area was notable for the mining of [[copper]]. The foundations of [[Caer Gybi (fort)|Caer Gybi]], a fort in [[Holyhead]], are Roman, and the present road from Holyhead to [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]] was originally a [[Roman roads|Roman road]].<ref>{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Chisholm |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Chisholm |title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog |year=1910 |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog/page/n337 18]}}</ref> The island was grouped by [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] with [[Geography of Ireland|Ireland]] (\"[[Hibernia]]\") rather than with [[Great Britain|Britain]] (\"[[Albion]]\").<ref>{{citation |author=[[Ptolemy]] |title=[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geog.]] |at=Bk. 2, Ch. 1 & 2 }}</ref>\n\n[[British Iron Age]] and Roman sites have been excavated and coins and ornaments discovered, especially by the 19th-century [[antiquarian]] [[William Owen Stanley]].<ref>Stanley, ''Anglesey'', 1871, and many Celtic contributions, especially on Celtic subjects, to ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]''.</ref> After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in the early 5th century, pirates from [[Ireland]] colonised Anglesey and the nearby [[Ll\u0177n Peninsula]]. In response to this, [[Cunedda|Cunedda ap Edern]], a [[Gododdin]] warlord from [[Scotland]], came to the area and began to drive the Irish out. This was continued by his son [[Einion Yrth ap Cunedda]] and grandson [[Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion]]; the last Irish invaders were finally defeated in battle in 470. As an island, Anglesey was in a good defensive position, and so [[Aberffraw]] became the site of the court, or ''Llys'', of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. Apart from a devastating [[Denmark|Danish]] raid in 853 it remained the capital until the 13th century, when improvements to the [[England|English]] navy made the location indefensible. Anglesey was also briefly the most southerly possession of the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norwegian Empire]].\n\nAfter the Irish, the island was invaded by [[Vikings]] \u2014 some of these raids were noted in famous [[saga]]s (see [[Menai Strait#History|Menai Strait History]]) \u2014 and by [[Saxons]], and [[Normans]], before falling to [[Edward I of England]] in the 13th century.\n\nAnglesey (together with Holy Island) is one of the 13 [[historic counties of Wales]]. In medieval times, before the conquest of Wales in 1283, ''M\u00f4n'' often had periods of temporary independence, as it was frequently bequeathed to the heirs of kings as a sub-kingdom of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. The last times this occurred were a few years after 1171, following the death of [[Owain Gwynedd]], when the island was inherited by [[Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd]], and between 1246 and c. 1255, when it was granted to [[Owain Goch]] as his share of the kingdom. After the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Anglesey was created a county under the terms of the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] of 1284. Prior to this it had been divided into the ''[[cantref]]i'' of [[Cantref Aberffraw|Aberffraw]], [[Rhosyr (cantref)|Rhosyr]] and [[Cemais (Anglesey cantref)|Cemaes]].\n\n===20th century===\nDuring the [[First World War]], the Presbyterian minister and celebrity preacher John Williams toured the island as part of an effort to recruit young men to volunteer for a just war.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/anglesey-during-first-world-war-2036022 |title=Anglesey during the First World War and Second World War |last=Devine |first=Darren |date=2012-02-15 |work=walesonline |access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> German [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] were kept on the island.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy the end of the war, some 1,000 of the island's men had died while on active service.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 1936 the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] opened its first branch on Anglesey.<ref>''A Years' Work of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Annual Report for 1936-1937, adopted by the Council and Corporation, May 28, 1937'', London, p. 12.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Anglesey received Italian [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The island was designated a reception zone, and was home to evacuee children from Liverpool and Manchester.<ref name=\":0\" /> The island's location made it an ideal place to monitor [[U-boat|German U-Boats]] operating in the [[Irish Sea]].

The [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]] abolished the 1974 county and the five districts on 1 April 1996. Anglesey became a separate [[unitary authority]]. In 2011, the [[Welsh Government]] appointed a panel of commissioners to administer the council, thus the elected members were not in control. The commissioners remained in control until an [[Isle of Anglesey County Council election, 2013|election]] was held in May 2013, restoring an elected Council. Before the period of direct administration, there had been a majority of independent councillors. Though members did not generally divide along party lines, these were organised into five non-partisan groups on the council, containing a mix of party and independent candidates. The position remains substantially unchanged since the election, although the Labour Party has formed a governing coalition with the independents.\n\nThe principal offices of the [[Isle of Anglesey County Council]] ({{lang-cy|Cyngor Sir Ynys M\u00f4n}}) are in [[Llangefni]] ({{IPA-cy|\u026can\u02c8\u0261\u025bvni}}), the [[county town]].<ref name=\"Academy\">{{Cite book |last1=Davies |first1=John |author1-link=John Davies (historian) |last2=Jenkins |first2=Nigel |author2-link=Nigel Jenkins |last3=Baines |first3=Menna |last4=Llynch |first4=Peredur |year=2008 |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |location=Cardiff |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6 |page=494}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Britannia Bridge Train crossing 3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Britannia Bridge]] from the east along the [[Menai Strait]]]]\nAnglesey is a relatively low-lying island, with low hills spaced evenly over the north of the island. The highest six are [[Holyhead Mountain]], {{convert|220|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd Bodafon]], {{convert|178|m|ft}}; [[Llaneilian|Mynydd Llaneilian]], {{convert|177|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd y Garn]], {{convert|170|m|ft}}; [[Bwrdd Arthur]], {{convert|164|m|ft}}; and Mynydd Llwydiarth, {{convert|158|m|ft}}. To the south and south-east, the island is separated from the Welsh mainland by the [[Menai Strait]], which at its narrowest point is about {{convert|250|m|yd}} wide. In all other directions the island is surrounded by the [[Irish Sea]]. At 714&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, it is the [[List of European islands by area|51st largest island]] in Europe, (although technically [[Madeira]] is part of Africa), and just five square kilometres smaller than [[Singapore]].\n\nThere are several small towns scattered around the island, making it quite evenly populated. The largest are [[Holyhead]], [[Llangefni]], [[Benllech]], [[Menai Bridge]], and [[Amlwch]]. [[Beaumaris]] (Welsh: ''Biwmares''), in the east of the island, features [[Beaumaris Castle]], built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as part of his [[Bastide|Bastide Town]] campaign in [[North Wales]]. Beaumaris is a [[yachting]] centre, with many boats moored in the bay or off Gallows Point. The village of [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] (Welsh: ''Niwbwrch''), in the south, created when the townsfolk of Llanfaes were relocated to make way for the building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of [[Llys Rhosyr]], another of the courts of the medieval Welsh princes, which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. [[Llangefni]] is located in the centre and is the island's administrative centre. The town of [[Menai Bridge]] (Welsh: ''Porthaethwy'', in the south-east) expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, to accommodate workers and construction. Until then, Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies [[Bryn Celli Ddu]], a [[Stone Age]] burial mound.\n\nNearby is the village with the longest name in Europe, [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]]gogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, and [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]], ancestral home of the [[Marquess of Anglesey|Marquesses of Anglesey]]. The town of [[Amlwch]] is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century by supporting an important [[copper]]-mining industry at [[Parys Mountain]].\n[[File:Penmon Lighthouse off Anglesey.jpg|thumb|[[Trwyn Du Lighthouse]]]]\n[[File:Anglesey Coast - geograph.org.uk - 1367265.jpg|thumb|Anglesey coast]]\n[[File:Menai Bridge - Anglesey August 2009 (3834581170).jpg|thumb|right|Menai Bridge]]\nOther villages and settlements include [[Cemaes]], [[Pentraeth]], [[Gaerwen]], [[Dwyran]], [[Bodedern]], [[Malltraeth]] and [[Rhosneigr]]. The [[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] is a local tourist attraction, providing a descriptive look{{clarify|date=January 2019}} at local marine [[wildlife]] from [[Homarus gammarus|common lobsters]] to [[conger]]s. All the fish and [[crustacean]]s on display are caught around the island and placed in reconstructions of their natural [[habitat]]. The zoo also breeds lobsters commercially for food, and [[oyster]]s, for pearls, both from local stocks. Sea salt (''Halen M\u00f4n'', evaporated from the local sea water), now produced in a modern facility nearby, was formerly produced at the Sea Zoo site.\n\nThere are a few natural lakes, mostly in the west, such as [[Llyn Llywenan]], the largest on the island, Llyn Coron, and Cors Cerrig y Daran, but rivers are few and small. There are two large water supply reservoirs operated by [[Welsh Water]]. These are [[Llyn Alaw]] to the north of the island and [[Llyn Cefni]] in the centre of the island, which is fed by the headwaters of the [[Afon Cefni]].\n\nThe climate is humid (though much less so than neighbouring mountainous [[Gwynedd]]) and generally equable, being influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The land is of variable quality and it was probably much more fertile in the past. Anglesey is the home of the northernmost [[olive]] grove in Europe and presumably in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=First Welsh olive grove planted on Anglesey |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-welsh-olive-grove-planted-2262852 |accessdate=2013-05-09 |date=30 April 2007 |work=WalesOnline}}</ref>\n\n==Coastal path==\nThe rural coastline has been designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

Agriculture provides the secondary source of income for the economy, with local dairies being some of the most productive in the region.\n\nMajor industry is restricted to Holyhead (Caergybi), which until 30 September 2009 supported an [[aluminium smelting|aluminium smelter]], and the [[Amlwch]] area, once a copper mining town. Nearby is the site of the former [[Wylfa Nuclear Power Station]] and a former [[bromine]] extraction plant. With construction starting in 1963, the two Wylfa reactors began producing electricity in 1971. One reactor was decommissioned in 2012 and the other in 2015. Plans were developed for a replacement reactor, planned by [[Horizon Nuclear Power|Horizon]], a subsidiary of [[Hitachi]], to start production in the 2020s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/04/reduced-subsidies-onshore-windfarms-good-news |title=Renewables industry welcomes reduced subsidies for onshore windfarms |author=Damian Carrington |work=the Guardian |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The replacement has been enthusiastically endorsed by Anglesey Council and Welsh Assembly members, but protesters have raised doubts about the economic and safety claims made for the plant,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/8596392.stm Anglesey protest over plans for new nuclear power plant] BBC News, 30 March 2014</ref> and in January 2019 Hitachi announced it was putting development work on hold, which meant the plant's future was put in serious doubt.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hitachi's Wylfa nuclear project pause 'tremendous blow' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46902723 |website=BBC News |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAnglesey also has three wind farms on land,<ref name=energy>[http://www.anglesey-today.com/energy.html Anglesey Today: Energy] accessed 15 April 2014</ref> and more than twenty offshore [[wind turbine]]s near the north coast.

The Royal Air Force station [[RAF Valley]] (Y Fali) is home to the RAF Fast Jet Training School and 22 Sqn Search and Rescue Helicopters, both units providing employment to about 500 civilians. RAF Valley is now the 22 Sqn Search and Rescue headquarters.\n\nThere is a wide range of smaller industries, mostly in industrial and business parks, especially at [[Llangefni]] and [[Gaerwen]]. These include an [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]], [[fine chemical]] manufacturing, and factories for timber production, aluminium smelting, fish farming and food processing.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The island is on one of the main road routes from Britain to [[Ireland]], via [[ferry|ferries]] from [[Holyhead]], off the west of Anglesey on Holy Island, serving [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin]] Port.\n\n==Ecology and conservation==\nMuch of Anglesey is used for relatively intensive cattle and sheep farming. However, there are several important [[wetland]] sites that have protected status. In addition, the several lakes all have significant ecological interest, including their support for a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic bird species. In the west, the [[Malltraeth Marsh]]es are believed to support an occasional visiting [[bittern]], and the nearby estuary of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]] supports a bird population made internationally famous by the paintings of [[Charles Tunnicliffe]], who lived for many years and died at [[Malltraeth]] on the Cefni estuary. The [[RAF]] airstrip at Mona is a nesting site for [[skylark]]s. The sheer cliff faces at [[South Stack]] near [[Holyhead]] provide nesting sites for huge numbers of [[auk]]s, including [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]s, [[razorbill]]s and [[common guillemot|guillemot]]s, together with [[chough]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]s. Anglesey is home to several species of tern, including the [[roseate tern]]. Three sites on Anglesey are important for breeding terns \u2013 see [[Anglesey tern colonies]].\n\nThere are marked occurrences of the [[Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow|''Juncus subnodulosus''\u2013''Cirsium palustre'' fen-meadow]] [[plant association]], a [[habitat]] marked by certain hydrophilic grasses, sedges and forbs.<ref>*C.

The coastal zone of Anglesey was designated as an AONB in 1966 and confirmed as such in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe AONB is predominantly a coastal designation, covering most of Anglesey's {{convert|125|mi|km|0}} coastline but also encompasses Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. Substantial areas of other land protected by the AONB form the backdrop to the coast. The AONB is about 221&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (85 sq mi) and it is the largest AONB in Wales, covering one third of the island.\n\nA number of the habitats in Anglesey gain still greater protection through both UK and European designations of their nature conservation value. These include:\n*6 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs)\n*4 Special Protection Areas (SPAs)\n*1 National Nature Reserve\n*26 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)\n*52 Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs)\nThese habitats support a variety of wildlife, such as [[harbour porpoise]]s and [[marsh fritillary]].\n\nThe AONB also takes in three sections of open, undeveloped coastline designated as Heritage Coast. These non-statutory designations complement the AONB and cover about {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} of the coastline. The sections of Heritage Coast are:\n#North Anglesey {{convert|28.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n#Holyhead Mountain {{convert|12.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n#Aberffraw Bay {{convert|7.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n\nPopular recreations include sailing, angling, cycling, walking, wind surfing and jet skiing.

Younger strata in Anglesey rest upon a foundation of very old [[Precambrian]] rocks that appear at the surface in four areas:\n#a western region including Holyhead and [[Llanfaethlu]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\n#a central area about [[Aberffraw]] and [[Trefdraeth]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\n#an eastern region which includes [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]],{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}} [[Gaerwen]] and [[Pentraeth]]\n#a coastal region at [[Menai Bridge#Glyn Garth|Glyn Garth]] between [[Menai Bridge]] and [[Beaumaris]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\nThese Precambrian rocks are [[schist]]s and [[phyllite]]s, often contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the formations in the island is from north-east to south-west.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}} A belt of [[granitic|granitic rocks]] lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from [[Llanfaelog]] near the coast to the vicinity of [[Llanerchymedd]]. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of [[Ordovician]] slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out in the north of the island between [[Dulas Bay]] and Carmel Point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses [[Carboniferous]] rocks are found. The [[Carboniferous Limestone]] occupies a broad area south of [[Lligwy Bay]] and [[Pentraeth]], and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by [[Llangefni]] to [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth Sands]]. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow [[sandstone]] (sometimes considered to be of [[Old Red Sandstone]] age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast around [[Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd|Llanfihangel]] and [[Llangoed]]; and in the south-west round Llanidan near the [[Menai Strait]]. [[Puffin Island, Anglesey|Puffin Island]] is made of carboniferous limestone. [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth marsh]] is occupied by Coal Measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the [[Menai Strait]]. A patch of rhyolitic/[[felsite|felsitic]] rocks form [[Parys Mountain]], where copper and iron ochre have been worked. [[serpentine group|Serpentine]] (Mona Marble) is found near [[Llanfair-yn-Neubwll]] and upon the opposite shore in [[Holyhead]].{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17\u201318}}\n\nUnder the name ''[[GeoM\u00f4n]]'', in recognition of its extraordinary geological heritage, the island gained membership of the [[European Geoparks Network]] in spring 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geomon.co.uk/#/about/4533286655 |title=GeoM\u00f4n \u2013 Anglesey Geopark |publisher= |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> and the [[Global Network of National Geoparks|Global Geoparks Network]] in September 2010.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:South Stack Lighthouse Anglesey.jpg|thumb|right|South Stack lighthouse]]\n*[[Anglesey Circuit|Anglesey Motor Racing Circuit]]\n*[[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] near [[Dwyran]]\n*Bays and beaches \u2013 [[Benllech]], [[Cemlyn Bay and lagoon|Cemlyn]], [[Red Wharf Bay|Red Wharf]], and [[Rhosneigr]]\n*[[Beaumaris Castle]] and [[Beaumaris Gaol|Gaol]]\n*[[Cribinau]] \u2013 tidal island with 13th-century church\n*[[Elin's Tower]] (Twr Elin) \u2013 RSPB reserve and the lighthouse at South Stack (Ynys Lawd) near [[Holyhead]]\n*[[King Arthur]]'s seat \u2013 near [[Beaumaris]]\n*[[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]], one of the longest place names in the world\n*[[Malltraeth]] \u2013 centre for bird life and home of wildlife artist [[Charles Tunnicliffe]]\n*[[Moelfre, Anglesey|Moelfre]] \u2013 fishing village\n*[[Parys Mountain]] \u2013 copper mine dating to the early Bronze Age\n*[[Penmon (place)|Penmon]] \u2013 priory and dovecote\n*[[The Skerries, Anglesey|Skerries]] [[Lighthouse]] \u2013 at the end of a low piece of submerged land, north-east of [[Holyhead]]\n*Stone Science Museum \u2013 privately run fossil museum near [[Pentraeth]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stonescience.co.uk/|title=Stone Science Museum - Fossils & Dinosaurs - Anglesey North Wales|author=|date=|website=Stone Science Museum Anglesey}}</ref>\n*Swtan longhouse and museum \u2013 owned by the [[National Trust]] and managed by the local community\n*Working [[windmill]] \u2013 [[Llanddeusant, Anglesey|Llanddeusant]]\n*[[Ynys Llanddwyn]] (Llanddwyn Island) \u2013 tidal island\n*[[St Cybi's Church]] Historic church in Holyhead\n\n==Notable people==\n===Born in Anglesey===\n*[[Tony Adams (actor)|Tony Adams]] \u2013 actor (Anglesey, 1940)\n*[[Stu Allan]] \u2013 radio and club DJ\n*[[John C.
