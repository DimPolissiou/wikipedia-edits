Various other effects are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of [[molecular vibration]]s, including his ability to vibrate at speed to pass through objects. The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring.\n\nBarry Allen's classic stories introduced the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] to DC Comics, and this concept played a large part in DC's various [[reboot (fiction)|continuity reboots]] over the years. The Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC's major company-wide reboot stories, and in the crossover ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #8 (Nov. 1985), Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse, removing the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years. His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during the narrative (and a single image of a blur) in [[Grant Morrison]]'s crossover story ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #3 (Nov. 2008), fully actualized in [[Geoff Johns]]' accompanying ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' #1 (June 2009), kicking off a six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. He has since played a pivotal role in the crossover stories ''[[Blackest Night]]'' (2009), [[Flashpoint (comics)|''Flashpoint'']] (2011), [[Convergence (comics)|''Convergence'']] (2015), and ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' (2016).\n\nAllen is the most well-known and commonly featured individual to take the mantle of the Flash, being present in numerous media adaptations, one-shots and comic-book story-arcs taking place in alternate universes.\n\nBarry Allen has been featured in several media, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' and then in the related ''[[Super Friends]]'' program. Since then he has appeared in several [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]]. Actor [[John Wesley Shipp]] portrayed the character in the live-action 1990s television show ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and the [[Arrowverse]]. Allen is currently portrayed by [[Grant Gustin]] in the [[Arrowverse]] shows in a main capacity, especially the 2014 television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', while [[Ezra Miller]] portrays the character in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|''Crisis on Infinite Earths'']] and the [[DC Extended Universe]] films ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']], and will return in the 2022 film ''The Flash''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Showcase4.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Showcase''#4 (Oct. 1956): First appearance of the Silver Age Flash. Art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Joe Kubert]].]]Barry Allen is a police [[scientist]] (his job was later changed to a forensic investigator) with a reputation for being very slow, and frequently late, which frustrates his fianc\u00e9e, [[Iris West]]. When Barry was a child, his mother was murdered, and Barry's father was unjustly blamed. It was actually the [[Reverse-Flash]]. One night, as he is working late on a new case, a lightning bolt strikes and shatters a case full of unspecified chemicals and drenches all over Barry, temporarily knocking him out. As a result, Allen later finds that he can run at super-human speeds and possesses equally enhanced reflexes, senses, and healing. He later dons a red bodysuit, sporting a lightning bolt in the chest (reminiscent of the original [[Fawcett Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]), dubs himself the Flash (after his childhood comic book hero, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]), and becomes [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]'s resident costumed crime fighter and protector.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nCentral City University professor Ira West (Iris's adoptive father) designed Allen's costume and the ring which stores it while Allen is in his civilian identity.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Bates, Cary|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 267|Date = November 1978|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> The ring can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit. In addition, Allen invented the cosmic treadmill, a device that allowed for precise [[time travel]] and was used in many stories. Allen was warmly received by his superhero colleagues, so much to the extent that nearly all speedsters that come after him are often compared to him. [[Batman]] once said \"Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents had not been murdered.\"<ref>''Justice'' #8 (Dec. 2006)</ref>\n\n===Justice League===\nAs presented in ''Justice League of America'' #9, when the Earth is infiltrated by [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] warriors sent to conquer the planet, some of the world's greatest heroes join forces, Allen among them. While the superheroes individually defeat most of the invaders, they fall prey to a single alien and only by working together are they able to defeat the warrior. Afterwards, the heroes decide to establish the [[Justice League]].\n\nDuring the years, he is depicted as feeling slightly attracted to [[Black Canary]] and [[Zatanna]], but he never pursues a relationship because he feels his real love is Iris West, whom he ultimately marries. Allen also becomes a good friend with [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], which would later be the subject of the limited series ''Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold''.\n\nIn ''The Flash'' # 123\u2014\"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\"\u2014Allen is transported to [[Earth-Two]] where he meets Jay Garrick, the original Flash in DC Continuity; it is revealed that Jay Garrick's adventures were captured in comic book form on [[Earth-One]]. This storyline initiated DC's multiverse and was continued in issues of ''Flash'' and in team-ups between the Justice League of America of Earth-One and the [[Justice Society of America]] of Earth-Two. In the classic story from ''Flash'' #179\u2014\"The Flash&nbsp;\u2013 Fact or Fiction?\"\u2014Allen is thrown into the universe eventually called [[Earth Prime]], a representation of \"our\" universe, where he seeks the aid of the ''Flash'' comic book's editor [[Julius Schwartz]] to build a [[cosmic treadmill]] so that he can return home. He also gains a sidekick and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Iris' nephew, [[Wally West]], who gains super-speed in an accident similar to that which gave Allen his powers.\n\n===Tragedy===\nIn time, he married his girlfriend Iris West, who learned of his double identity because Allen talked in his sleep. She kept this secret, and he eventually revealed his identity to her of his own free will with Moreno's persuasion.<ref>''The Flash'' #174</ref> Iris was eventually revealed to have been sent as a child from the 30th century and adopted.\n\nIn the 1980s, Flash's life begins to collapse.  [[Professor Zoom]] (a [[supervillain]] from the 25th century who had long loved her and been jealous of Allen), and when Allen prepares to marry another woman, Zoom tries the same trick again. Allen stops him, killing Zoom in the process by breaking his neck. Unfortunately, when Barry is unable to make an appearance at his own wedding, his fianc\u00e9e eventually descends into madness and  stomps \nout of the room walking in somber.\n\nPlaced on trial for murder in connection with Zoom's death, Allen is found guilty by the jury. When he is told by a juror Nathan Newbury, who is being possessed by a mind from the future, that Reverse-Flash (whom Allen knows to be dead) brainwashed the jury into this verdict, Flash flees his trial. The Flash is then attacked by Reverse-Flash, and realizes that the answers to this mystery, and restoring his good name, lie in the future, so Newbury uses a time device to send them forward. They discover that [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] was disguised as Reverse-Flash to ruin the Flash's good name. Defeating Kadabra, he retreats to the future to be reunited with Iris, having learned that Iris' spirit was in fact drawn to the 30th century, and given a new body (and was in fact the mind inhabiting Newbury). The final issue of ''The Flash'' ends with Flash and Iris kissing passionately and the caption \"And they lived happily ever after... for a while\". There are a few references in the final issue (''The Flash'' #350) to the upcoming events, and Flash's impending death.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nIn the controversial storyline ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' (sets within the post-''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' continuity), it is revealed that Barry voted to allow [[Zatanna]] to edit [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]]'s mind with four of the members of the Justice League six months after Iris's death, essentially lobotomizing him. When Batman discovers what the League was doing, they have his memories edited as well despite the opposition from [[Green Arrow]]. Both Doctor Light and Batman would eventually recover from their respective mindwipe, leading Doctor Light to swear vengeance to all heroes and Batman's distrust towards his allies.\n\n===''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A Flash's death (Crisis on Infinite Earths).png|thumb|right|250px|Barry heroically sacrificing himself to stop the Anti-Monitor; however, it is later retconned that he actually still alive but trapped in the Speed Force following the battle. Art by [[George Perez]] from ''Crisis on Infinite Earth'' #8 (November 1985).]] -->\nFollowing the trial, Allen retires and joins Iris in the 30th century. After only a few weeks of happiness, the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' intervenes, and Allen is captured by the [[Anti-Monitor]] and brought to 1985; according to the Anti-Monitor, the Flash was the only being capable of traveling to other universes at will, so the Anti-Monitor could not allow him to stay free. Allen escapes and foils the Anti-Monitor's plan to destroy the Earth with an anti-matter cannon, creating a speed vortex to draw the power in, but dies in the process as the power becomes too much for his body.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> It has been said that Allen travels back through time and becomes the very same lightning bolt that gives him his powers, but later it is also strongly implied that the soul of Barry resides in the [[Speed Force]], the mystical source and Valhalla open to all dead speedsters, and from which the living ones draw their amazing powers. After Allen's death, Kid Flash [[Wally West]], his nephew and sidekick, takes up the mantle of the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|Title = [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 12|Date = March 1986|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====After death====\n[[Marv Wolfman]], scribe for the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has repeatedly stated (first hinted at in his introduction to the original ''Crisis'' collected edition hardcover), then fully explained on his website that he left a loophole in the script wherein the Barry Allen Flash could be reintroduced, without a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]], into DC Universe continuity.<ref>[http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q&A.html ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128175053/http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q%26A.html |date=January 28, 2006 }}</ref> This loophole would allow a writer to pull Barry out of his desperate run to annihilate the anti-matter cannon. However, Barry would know he must someday finish his death run, and would become more determined to use his speed to help others.\n\nIt should also be noted that the way Barry Allen seemed to have \"died\" in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', was that he ran so fast that he was able to stop the Anti-Monitor's anti-matter cannon from firing by catching the tachyon beam at the heart of the weapon. After this act, according to ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 (1988), Barry Allen turns into a lightning bolt, goes back in time, becoming the lightning bolt that hit his lab, splashing his past-self with chemicals and transforming him into the Flash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/wheres-barry.html |title=Where's Barry?

His spirit seems to still be alive within the Speed Force, along with [[Max Mercury]] and other speedsters.\n\nIn [[Quasar (comics)|''Quasar'']] by [[Marvel Comics]], released between December 1990 and May 1994, an amnesiac Barry Allen, misremembering his name as \"Buried Alien\" and the [[Speed Force]] as the \"Hyperforce\", and surprised to have \"form\" again, enters the [[Marvel Universe]] in the middle of the great race to be the \"Fastest Man Alive\" after the players had passed the first warp junction, where he is discovered by the Runner co-ordinating it and invited to participate in his great race. Beating several other speedsters ([[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro \"Quicksilver\" Maximoff]], [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)| Wendell \"Quasar\" Vaughn]], [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Robert \"The Whizzer\" Frank]], [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|James \"Speed Demon\" Sanders]], [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Ariana \"Black Racer\"]], [[Super Sabre (comics)|Martin \"Super Sabre\" Fletcher]] and [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]]) he is declared to be the \"fastest man alive\", a title he believes feels \"right\", though he never recovers his memory during his time in the universe. He later adopted the alias \"FastForward\", before he is returned to his original universe with Makkari's assistance.\n\n===Legacy===\nIris is pregnant, and she has two children who have super-speed powers, the [[Tornado Twins]], who later meet the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. In the multiversal variant known as Earth-247, each of her children themselves have children with speed-based abilities. One, Jenni Ognats, grows up to become the Legionnaire [[XS (comics)|XS]], while the other, [[Bart Allen]], is born with an accelerated metabolism that rapidly ages him, and is sent back to the 20th century where he is cured by Wally West. He remains there as the superhero Impulse under the tutelage of [[Max Mercury]], and later becomes the second Kid Flash as a member of the [[Teen Titans]]. [[One Year Later|One year]] after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Bart becomes the fourth Flash until he is abruptly killed by his clone [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Marc Guggenheim|Guggenheim, Marc]]|Title = The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive|Volume = 1|Issue = 13|Date = August 2007|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Wally then retook the identity of the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)#Volume 2 (1987-2006, 2007-2008)|All_Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = September 2007|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Bart would later be resurrected as Kid Flash by the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 31st century to combat [[Superboy-Prime]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = April 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nBarry Allen appears in issue 3 as the Flash in the JLA when the two realities start changing, along with Hal Jordan. When the two teams see their real futures, Barry witnesses his death during Crisis on Infinite Earths as the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] shows the heroes how reality should be, but nevertheless resolves to help restore the timeline as it is not his place to play God. He talks with Hal Jordan over the similarity of their situation, stating that dying could not be so bad so long as they have left a legacy for others (Wally West and [[Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner)|Kyle Rayner]], in their cases) to fight for what they believe. He helps the team get into [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s base by using his running on a treadmill to pass the ship through the dimensional barrier. With the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], he is ordered by [[Captain America]] to find ways through Krona's defences, and alerts the group to a probably lethal force field. During the final battle, Barry saves [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from being killed when the [[Absorbing Man]] breaks the ground beneath him, but both of them are blasted and apparently killed by [[Dreamslayer]]. At the end, it is revealed that Barry got the two of them out alive and at Captain America's suggestion they laid low and because of this, Hawkeye is able to destroy Krona's machine with a TNT arrow while Barry distracts him, then Barry takes the 12 items of power. As a result, reality is restored, Barry disappears and Wally returns.\n\n===Post-''Crisis'' appearances===\nWally West, wracked by grief for the loss of his unborn twins at the hands of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], regrets the public knowledge of his identity. Barry appears from somewhere in time\u2014stating that he is from a period shortly before his death\u2014counseling his nephew, and talking the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] into granting his wish, erasing all public knowledge of Wally and Barry's identities as the Flash (Although Wally himself also loses his memory of his identity for a time). Barry then disappears, telling his nephew that he will come to his aid three times, on the three most difficult days of his life of which this is the first. In fact, when Zoom enlists the aid of the original Professor Zoom to make Wally relive the loss of his beloved twins, Barry is already there, trying to stop his \"own\" Reverse-Flash; Zoom apparently retrieved [[Eobard Thawne]] from the day that he attempted to kill Fiona Webb, with Barry following his nemesis. For the second time, he helps Wally to undo the damage dealt by Zoom, also allowing Wally to save his twins, and then he returns to his proper time, dragging his Zoom with him and breaking his enemy's neck in his timeline.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nIn the fourth issue of ''Infinite Crisis'', Barry Allen comes out from the Speed Force, along with [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Max Mercury]], to help his grandson Bart deal with [[Superboy-Prime]], taking the villainous teen with him in the Speed Force. Bart Allen appears wearing Barry Allen's costume in Tokyo near the end of ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 to tell the heroes that Superboy-Prime has escaped the Speed Force. Bart again reappears in ''Infinite Crisis'' #7 in Barry Allen's costume to combat Superboy-Prime once more.\n\nIn ''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #6 (2006) (with a portion taking place shortly before ''Infinite Crisis'' #5) it is told how Barry spent four years in an alternate [[Keystone City]] along with Max Mercury, Johnny Quick, and an alternate Jay Garrick, until he met Bart and Wally West, joining him after the battle against Superboy-Prime. After Superboy escapes, Barry suggests that someone has to absorb the whole Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge back to Post-Crisis Earth. As Bart volunteers, Barry gives him his suit as a last gift, to keep the Force contained, and stays behind. Wally West did not go because of his wife and kids. Bart says he knows Barry would go if he could, but why Barry Allen could not make the journey himself is not stated.\n\n===Return===\n[[Image:Barry Return.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barry Allen returns to the DC Universe, fleeing from the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]]. Art from ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #2 by [[J. G. Jones]].]]\nTwenty three years after his death in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Barry Allen's essence made a return to the present DC Universe proper in ''DC Universe'' #0, preceding his full-time return in the pages of writer [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Final Crisis]]''.\n\n''DC Universe'' #0 features an unnamed narrator who initially associates himself with \"everything\". As the story progresses, he begins to recall his past and association with [[Justice League]] members, particularly [[Hal Jordan]] and [[Superman]]. The lettering in which he speaks to the reader is yellow on backgrounds that are initially black. As the story moves forward, the background slowly begins turning red. In the final pages, the narration boxes feature a yellow lightning bolt. Over time, as he recalls friendships and connections with other people, his mind begins to narrow, remarking \"I...know him. I am no longer everything. I am a shaft of light split through a prism\". Yet he is still the only one able to see \"the shadow falling over everything\", in the form of [[Darkseid]]. On the final page, the moon appears in front of a red sky, as a yellow lightning bolt strikes diagonally in front of it creating the logo of the Flash, as he remarks \"and now I remember\". The title of the story is revealed to be \"Let There Be Lightning\".<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] and [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = DC Universe Zero|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = April 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nA ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' story released on the same day proclaimed that Barry Allen has returned to life, with issue co-writer [[Geoff Johns]] stating, \"When the greatest evil comes back to the DC Universe, the greatest hero needed to return.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2008/04/30/2008-04-30_the_flash_outruns_the_reaper_23_years_af-1.html |title=Entertainment/Arts 2008-04-30 |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2011-04-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204145213/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2008/04/30/2008-04-30_the_flash_outruns_the_reaper_23_years_af-1.html |archivedate=2009-02-04 }}</ref>\n\n====''Final Crisis''====\n{{Main|Final Crisis}}\nBarry makes his [[wikt:corporeal|corporeal]] return in ''Final Crisis'' #2.

Meanwhile, Wally and Barry run a few weeks into the future. When they come to rest, Wally asks Barry if it is really him. Lamenting on Orion's death, which he was unable to stop, Barry wonders why he is now alive after being dead for so long. It is then that Barry and Wally are confronted by [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batwoman]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Giganta]], who have all been transformed into the new [[Female Furies]] following the release of the [[Anti-Life Equation]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = [[Final Crisis]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = July 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that this new version of the Female Furies is equipped with the ability to track down speedsters, perceived by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] and Darkseid as the only obstacle left between them and world domination, Barry's expertise allows him to overcome their foes and run through the ruined Earth.\n\nBarry stops to see his wife Iris and save her from the slavery of the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. Seeing his wife again for the first time in years, Barry is overcome with emotion and gives his brainwashed wife a deep kiss. While kissing her, the Speed Force sparkles out of his body, enveloping Iris and freeing her from the Equation.

When asked what Flashes would appear in the series, Johns and Van Sciver said, \"All of them.\"\n\nThe series begins with the cities of Central and Keystone celebrating the return of, \"Central City's Flash\", [[Wonder Woman]] having used her government contacts to create the story that Barry was in witness protection to account for his resurrection. Avoiding the parades, parties, and other celebrations of his return, Barry instead contemplates why he is alive again. A visit to the [[Flash Museum]] and from his friend [[Hal Jordan]] is not enough to put his mind at ease as he runs off as the Flash. \"I can't be late,\" he says. When asked by Hal late for what, Flash replies, \"For whatever the rest of the world needs me for.\"\n\nIt is then revealed that Flash's mother was murdered when he was a child, and his father was arrested for the crime (this is pointedly contrary to previous Flash stories, in which both his parents appear alive). Flash describes this as \"the only one open case I left behind.\" Before he can contemplate this any further, the speedster villain [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]] escapes the Speed Force through Flash. When Flash manages to put his hand on Savitar's shoulder, the villain screams in agony and crumbles into dust, not before telling Flash, \"...You were the beginning, Allen...and you're the end.\" At that moment, [[Wally West]], West's children Iris and Jai, [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]], [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]] all experience painful convulsions and are engulfed in lightning.<ref name=\"TFR1\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = April 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nBarry's conflict with the speed cult{{clarify|date=September 2011}} culminates in the death of their new leader who was attempting to avenge Savitar's death. It causes pain once again to all the speedsters, though Wally West manages to catch a glimpse of Allen directly afterwards, and sees him as the new [[Black Flash]].<ref name=\"TFR2\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = May 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> When he realizes that his presence could damage or kill other innocents, Barry flees back into the Speed Force, where he encounters old friends [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Max Mercury]]. Max attempts to tell Allen that his becoming the Black Flash is not his fault. When Max and Barry are pulled into another pocket of the Speed Force, the real culprit reveals himself: [[Professor Zoom]].<ref name=\"TFR3\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = June 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nZoom reveals his plan: after Barry briefly aided Kid Flash against Superboy-Prime during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Thawne was able to send a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to draw back what was left of Barry's self-awareness. This led to the hero's reappearance during the ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Afterward, Zoom transformed himself into \"a new kind of speedster and created his negative Speed Force to contaminate Barry and the other heroic speedsters. Before Barry can fight any further, Zoom fades away. Wally enters the Speed Force to retrieve his uncle, and after venturing deeper into the Speed Force, Max reveals to Barry that it was Allen himself who created the Speed Force. Meanwhile, Wally manages to reach Barry and Max, and the three begin their escape. As the heroic speedsters are recharged with energy, Barry, Wally, Jay, Max, and Bart charge towards Zoom.<ref name=\"TFR4\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|Date = August 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nThe seven speedsters (the 5 men plus Jesse Chambers and Iris West-Park) battle against Zoom, and despite being outnumbered, Zoom pulls Barry away. He reveals that everything horrible that happened to Barry, including the murder of Barry's mother, was caused by Zoom. Zoom then decides to destroy everything by killing Barry's wife, Iris, before they met.<ref name=\"TFR5\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 5|Date = November 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nBarry chases after Zoom, and is joined by Wally, who tells Barry to push as hard as he can to break the time barrier. They reach Thawne, becoming the lightning bolt that turns Barry into the Flash as they are able to stop Zoom from killing Iris. As the two Flashes push Zoom back through time to the present, they see that the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device specifically for Thawne. Barry tosses him in and activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force. The Flashes tie Zoom up to stop him from running. With the threat ended, everyone celebrates by welcoming Barry back and the speedsters in general. Later, Barry closes the case on his mother's death and opts to take all the other cold cases they had after his death. Barry spends some time with Iris before racing to Washington to celebrate his return with the Justice League, apologizing for being late.<ref name=\"TFR6\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 6|Date = February 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====''Blackest Night''====\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\n[[Image:Blue Lantern Flash.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barry Allen as a member of the [[Blue Lantern Corps]] during the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event.

Allen appears alongside Jordan in the [[Free Comic Book Day]] issue ''Blackest Night'' #0 that acts as a prologue to the July company crossover.\n\nAt the grave of [[Bruce Wayne]] in [[Gotham City]], Hal and Barry reflect on Batman's death and how the hero community is avoiding linking Wayne and Batman.\n\nThis reflection turns to the pair looking at their own deaths, comparing the sadness that Barry's death engendered in others while Hal's death produced anger. Hal sums it up by telling Barry, \"'''I''' died a '''sinner'''. '''''You''''' died a '''saint'''.\" (though he admits he's not and reflecting of his past sins.) The conversation moves on to the world becoming \"more dangerous\" after Barry's death and observing that the deaths of [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] and [[Martian Manhunter]] cost the [[Justice League]] its \"heart and soul\". As they leave the cemetery, Barry expresses hope that their dead comrades will be returned to them. He specifically cites Batman noting, \"If there's an escape, you can bet Batman's already planning it.\"<ref name=\"BlackestNight0\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 0|Date = May 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nBarry also appears alongside Hal in the July issues of ''Green Lantern'' tying into the event. Recently, in a fight with [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] [[J'onn J'onzz]], he found a mysterious black residue at Bruce Wayne's grave\u2014a black form coagulating much like blood that started corrupting him by partly decaying his skin and muscle during the fight against his former friend, who is intent on killing both Hal and Barry, seeing how they both died, and in the eyes of the Black Lanterns, must return to that state to keep the universe in balance.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = July 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]|Volume = 4|Issue = 44|Date = July 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nAfter fighting off the undead Martian and the subsequent Black Lanterns with Hal and the arriving [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and two of the [[Indigo Tribe]] members, Barry, along with Wally and Bart, races across the globe to warn every superhero community across the planet.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = August 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> His message also inadvertently warns the Rogues.

Barry decides to go to [[Gorilla City]] to seek aid from its ruler [[Solovar]], unaware the gorilla leader had been killed years before. Finding the city attacked, Barry assumed [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd]] had struck only to be horrified to learn Solovar was now a Black Lantern. Their fight was shortened by Barry racing to [[Coast City]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night|Blackest Night: Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = December 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nHe stops at the city's memorial, where he witnesses the arrival of the Black Lanterns' demonic lord, [[Nekron]], and his disciples [[Scar (comics)|Scar]] and [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|Date = October 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> The Justice League, the [[Teen Titans|Titans]], Wally, and Bart arrive to aid Barry to take a stand against Nekron. Nekron reveals that all the resurrected heroes are tied to him, because he allowed them to rise again. As such they belong to him.

During the battle, Barry is forced to fight his own grandson, who his ring detects is still alive but would eventually die if not free from the black ring soon. Barry is shown to be skilled with his ring in creating energy constructs based on his imagination and an ability of flight (possibly because of the understanding with Hal's ring), as he is able to create images of Bart as Impulse and Kid Flash against him in order to make him feel again. Barry's plan almost works as Bart reacts to the images of his past and the constructs begin to attempt to take the black ring from him, but later is interrupted by the Black Lantern Professor Zoom and Solovar. Wally and Walker later join Barry to fight against them.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night|Blackest Night: Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = February 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Barry and Bart temporarily joined the [[White Lantern Corps]] during the final events of Blackest Night.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 8|Date = March 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n===''The Flash'' Volume 3===\n{{Main|The Flash (comic book)#Volume 3 (2010\u20132011)|l1=The Flash (comic book)#Volume 3 (2010\u20132011)}}\nThe new ''Flash'' series begins after the completion of ''[[Blackest Night]]'' and the beginning of ''[[Brightest Day]]''. After the events of ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'', Barry Allen is reintegrating himself into life in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. Under the cover of having been in [[witness protection]], Allen returns to the Central City Police Department's crime lab and returns to the streets as the Flash. While readjusting to life as the Flash, a man appears out of thin air in the costume of Flash rogue the [[Mirror Master]], and promptly dies on the street.\n\nWhen Barry arrives on the scene to investigate, he sees the man is neither original Mirror Master Sam Scudder, or the current Rogue, Evan McCulloch. Hearing of another portal appearing, Barry transforms into the Flash and runs to investigate. When he arrives, a group of people in costumes similar to the Rogues, called ''[[Rogues (comics)#The Renegades|The Renegades]]'' appear and tell Barry that they are from the 25th century, and that he is under arrest for murdering the \"Mirror Monarch\". Barry tells the crew that he has not killed anyone, to which their leader, \"Commander Cold\", tells him, \"Not yet. But you will.\"<ref name=\"vol3no1\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|Volume = 3|Issue = 1|Date = April 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nAfter a brief struggle, where Weather Warlock's time disc was damaged, the Renegades were forced back to the 25th century, which also caused the destruction of an apartment building due to their uncontrolled jump back. Barry saves everyone in the building, even rebuilding the building in minutes, and goes on to search for the true killer of Mirror Monarch. He is attacked again by the Renegades, but only before Captain Boomerang shows up, now wielding explosive energy boomerangs. Boomerang fights both the Flash and the Renegades, and a confused Top (one of the Renegades from the 25th century) questions his teammates on whether or not Barry Allen is the man they are looking for, pointing out that in their timeline, Boomerang never showed up.\n\nThe Renegades finally corner Captain Boomerang when the Rogues arrive with a giant mirror left by the previous Mirror Master that says \"In Case The Flash Returns Break Glass\". An all out brawl ensues as the Rogues battle the Renegades. Meanwhile, Flash is confronted by Top who warns him that the reason he will eventually kill Mirror Monarch is because of Iris's death, which he claims will be caused when the giant mirror breaks, releasing the Mirror Lords. Top tells Barry that one of the Mirror Lords will possess Iris and take her away from him. Barry races to stop the mirror from breaking, with Top at his side. However, when the White Lantern entity reaches out to Captain Boomerang, telling him to \"Throw the Boomerang\", Boomerang responds by throwing dozens of boomerangs in every direction. One of them hits the glass and it begins to break. Top tells Flash to stop the Mirror Lords, while he goes and protects Iris. Flash questions does not make sense, but Top throws him into the mirror and flees.\n\nIn the mirror, Flash is exposed to strange visions of his mother. Outside, the Rogue Mirror Master tells the others that the mirror is actually a slow acting poison and they flee. Barry escapes the mirror confused and asks, \"Where are the Mirror Lords?\" He is then arrested by the Renegades, who realize that this was all a setup by Top to frame the Flash for his own personal gains. Barry is transported to a 25th-century court, while Top confronts Iris.\n\nThe story concludes with Barry escaping the 25th century court and going after Top. Top reveals that the reason for all of his crimes is because Barry reopened a previously closed case. Barry felt that the person convicted was actually innocent. The person who is actually guilty of the crime is one of Top's ancestors. Top reveals that they do not allow anyone in the Renegades who has any ancestors with a criminal record. The Flash is able to beat Top, and convict the right man for murder, letting go the innocent man who was sent to prison. Afterward, the 25th century court and the Renegades go over the facts, realizing that the Flash was right and that their entire record of history is wrong. This alludes to the upcoming Flash event, ''[[Flash: Flashpoint|Flashpoint]]''. Meanwhile, a man on a Speed Force-powered motorcycle (later revealed to be a Speed Force police officer under the name of Hot Pursuit)<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 3) #8 (November 2010)</ref> moves through the desert and says that if Barry does not find the flashpoint, it will destroy the world. As he continues through the desert, Speed Force lightning strikes in the distance.\n\nIn a ''Green Lantern'' storyline, Barry becomes the latest host for the embodiment of fear, [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], after he joins Hal Jordan's quest of locating all of the entities who each represent aspects of the power of the emotional spectrum. Barry was susceptible to the entity's attacks due to his fear for Jordan's safety.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #59 (Nov. 2010)</ref> Barry is eventually freed after the embodiment of compassion, Proselyte, helps him remember his capability for benevolence over his fear.\n\nDC has also announced via the Flashpoint Friday Blog that ''Flash'' #12 will be the last in the series despite a thirteenth issue originally having been announced for sale on May 25, 2011, but which has since been withdrawn.\n\n====''Flashpoint''====\n{{Main|Flashpoint (comics)}}\nAs the story begins, Barry Allen wakes up in his office and discovers that his mother is alive, there is no trace of [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]] leading their respective nations in a war, his wife [[Iris West]] is unmarried, and himself currently powerless. Barry seeks the aid of [[Batman]], driving to Gotham City and entering a run-down Wayne Manor. He explores what turns out to be a small Batcave until he is attacked by Batman. Barry tries to explain who he is by saying he knows Batman is Bruce Wayne, only to find that in this reality, Batman is [[Thomas Wayne]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref> While Barry is being beat up by Batman, he explains about his secret identity as the Flash and his relation to Bruce Wayne. Barry's memories spontaneously change and he realizes that the world of Flashpoint is not an alternate dimension, but his own. Barry uses his ring, which he uses to contain his Flash outfit, but the ring instead ejects [[Professor Zoom]]'s costume. Barry tells Batman that Zoom is taunting him with it. Barry explains that both he and Zoom have the ability to alter time, leading Batman to ask him about how Bruce was to have lived in his place and if he can really change the world. Barry states that he needs his speed first. Later, Barry and Batman create an electric chair-like device to try and recreate the accident that gave him his speed; however, the first attempt meets with failure, leaving Barry severely burned.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #2 (June 2011)</ref>\n\nBarry awakes on an operating table in the Batcave and is covered in bandages and third degree burns. Despite Thomas' advice, Barry sits back down in the electric chair device. When lightning strikes a second time, Barry's super-speed returns, and he then saves the Batman from being impaled on a fence. Barry's injuries are healing rapidly due to his speed-enhanced regeneration. He also makes a new copy of his Flash costume. The Flash researches the incarnations of heroes of the DC timeline, believing that Zoom deliberately changed their lives to prevent the Flash from creating a Justice League, and learns of a rocket that crashed into Metropolis which carried the infant Superman, who instead of being raised in Kansas was taken in by the government. They then contact [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] for his help in sneaking into the government bunker of \"Project: Superman\" that is 'raising' Superman after his rocket destroyed Metropolis upon its arrival, only to be disappointed at Superman's frail appearance. They head towards Project: Superman's underground base via the sewer. The group comes across a giant vault door bearing the Superman logo. After they open the door, the three see a pale, weakened Kal-El. Despite his appearance, Barry says that no matter what, Superman will always be a good person. When the arrival of guards forces them to escape, Superman's powers begin to manifest and he flies off leaving them at the hands of the guards.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #3 (July 2011)</ref>\n\nWhile they fend off the guards, they are rescued by Element Woman. Barry's memories begin to change much more drastically, altering his past. He states that he is running out of time and soon he will not be able to restore the timeline to normal. After Barry is recovering, he asks the heroes to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war from creating more casualties, although the heroes are not willing to unless Batman wants to join them. Cyborg explains to him that they believe Batman was invincible. However, Barry convinces him that no one is invincible; the [[Marvel Family]] and Batman agree to join him. The heroes arrive at New Themyscira to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, and appear to be winning until [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] reveals herself as the Amazon spy and uses her magic to separate the Marvel Family and restore them to their mortal forms. Penthesilea kills Billy Batson just as Professor Zoom reveals himself to Barry.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)</ref> Professor Zoom reveals to him that the \"Flashpoint\" timeline was actually created by Barry himself, after he traveled back in time to stop Zoom from killing his mother, but the timeline diverted into the near-apocalyptic world they find themselves in. He continues to taunt Barry with this knowledge, but is suddenly stabbed in the back by Batman wielding an Amazonian sword. Before Barry returns the timeline to normal, Batman thanks him for all he's done and gives him a letter addressed to his son. After this, Barry bids a farewell to his mother, knowing he must travel back in time to stop his younger self from altering time. Through the fusions of the time stream, Barry seemingly hears [[Pandora (DC Comics)|a voice]] explaining that the three timelines and worlds, need to become one again and would need his help to do this. After the ordeals, he visits the real Bruce Wayne and gives him the letter from his alternate father. Bruce is grateful to Barry of informing him of the events of the \"Flashpoint\" before the timeline was apparently returned to normal.<ref name=\"fp5\">''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nDC Comics relaunched ''The Flash'' with issue #1 in September 2011, with writing and art chores handled by [[Francis Manapul]] and Brian Buccellato as part of DC's company-wide title relaunch, [[The New 52]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32768 |title=DC Comics Solicitations for September, 2011 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 13, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928144827/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32768 |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speedforce.org/2011/06/flash-reboot/ |title=Flash Reboot Creative Team: Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato |publisher=SpeedForceOrg |date=June 2, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817004046/http://speedforce.org/2011/06/flash-reboot/ |archivedate=August 17, 2013 }}</ref> As with all of the books associated with the DC relaunch, Barry Allen appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. He gains his powers after getting frustrated and throwing a small machine at the window of his lab. The machine broke through the window, leaving a hole big enough for a bolt of lightning to charge through the hole and strike him.\n\nIn the second issue of the new ''[[Justice League]]'' title (the first released comic series of the New 52 initiative and \"opening shot\" of the new DC Universe), Flash is called to assist [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and [[Batman]] in wrangling an out-of-control [[Superman]], and later assists with the pursuit of an alien, revealed to be an agent of [[Darkseid]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff| penciller= [[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]| inker= Williams, Scott| story= Justice League Part Two| title= Justice League| volume= 2| issue= 2| date= December 2011}}</ref> In this new continuity, Barry's marriage to Iris West never took place, and he is instead in a relationship with longtime co-worker [[Patty Spivot]]. In this new series, the Flash draws deeper into the Speed Force, enhancing his mental abilities while still trying to get a full grasp on his powers, which he does not yet exert total control over.\n\nAs revealed in issue #0 of the current series, Barry Allen's father was placed in prison for the murder of his mother. The murder occurred shortly after Barry returned victorious from a school spelling bee, and Barry placed the trophy he won on his mother's grave in her memory. While the evidence seems to indicate his father's guilt, Barry makes proving his father's innocence a priority.\n\nBarry is also part of the main cast of the relaunched ''Justice League'' series, making his debut in the series' second issue. Following Convergence, Barry has a new suit in issue #41, which has a darker shade and features more streaks.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\nDuring [[DC Rebirth]], Barry is no longer the only Flash. It is revealed that [[Wally West]] has been lost in the Speed Force for ten years, realizing during this time that Barry is not responsible of changing the timeline after the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crisis, the [[Doctor Manhattan|unknown entity]] used Barry's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth, but each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional \"lightning rod\") could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Because of Wally, Barry is now aware that the timeline is not reset correctly after Flashpoint and thus another alternate timeline. However, he still cannot remember his pre-Flashpoint life, such as people like Jay Garrick, his long-last marriage with Iris and the details of his feuds with the Reverse-Flash / Eobard Thawne (who now remembers their pre-Flashpoint history), and remembers Wally from their new DC Rebirth timeline history. Despite being informed by Wally that another party is responsible, Barry remains in guilt over his mistakes, and seeks to find and stop them in hopes of making amends.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016)</ref> Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than 'Kid Flash'. While Wally considers his options, Barry visits Batman to discuss the new evidence of some outside force attacking them, musing on how personal this assault appears, but despite the potential danger, Batman and Barry agree to keep their investigation to themselves until they know what they are up against.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' one-shot (June 2016)</ref> Later, when Eobard Thawne attacks Iris and [[Wallace West (DC comics)|Wallace]], Iris had glimpses of her pre-Flashpoint life with Barry and learns his secrets as the Flash in the process. Barry then learned of their marriage in the other timeline as well.  Knowing from Thawne that her entire life has been drastically altered and that Barry is indirectly responsible for it as the result of his time-traveling actions, Iris now distrusts Barry.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 5 #24 (August 2017)</ref> To make matters worse for Barry, while he's entering the Negative Speed Force, he becomes the Negative-Flash which is more lethal than the original, and mostly dangerous to control.\n\nAfter gotten rid of the Negative Speed Force, he investigates with the death of Turbine, but thanks to Godspeed's help, he discovers that Captain Cold was the one who killed him because he seeks redemption. He visits Wally after defeating the Top, he discusses about him telling Iris that he's alive and existed. While he's rekindling his relationship with Iris, the city is being attacked by Gorilla Grodd and his organization the Black Hole.\n\nAfter defeating Grodd and getting Wally to meet Iris for the first time, they've been encountered by the Renegades. The Renegades take the Flashes and Iris back to the 25th century to get answers about why Iris killed Eobard Thawne, only to discover that Hunter Zolomon has been manipulating everyone as a plot to bring conflict between Barry and Wally for the fate of the Speed Force. After Wally defeated Hunter, Barry place him under watch at the Sanctuary while he's moving with his girlfriend Iris at her place after Wallace angrily left them. Barry begins searching for the other forces such as Sage Force and Strength Force after the Force Barrier's broken; he ends up discovering about the four forces conflicting for the control of the Forever Force.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBarry Allen has the ability to run at super-human velocities. He was at times during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] described as faster than the [[Action potential|speed of thought]].  ''Flash'' #150, \"straining every muscle\", he ran at ten times the speed of light.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Fox, Gardner|Title = Flash|Volume = 1|Issue = 150|Date = February 1965|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> However, when he pushed himself further (during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'') he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure energy, traveled back in time, and was revealed in ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Fleming, Robert Loren|Title = Secret Origins Annual|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = December 1988|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> This was later [[retcon]]ned in ''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1, where Barry stated that he \"ran into the [[Speed Force]]\", and that, \"When he stopped the [[Anti-Monitor]], when [he] ran into the \"Speed Force\" and joined it, it was like shedding [his] identity.\"<ref name=\"TFR1\" /> Allen possesses abilities that original Flash [[Jay Garrick]] has not always been able to duplicate, and most notably the ability to \"vibrate\" in such a way as to pass through solid matter. Allen regularly engaged in [[time travel]] by using his Cosmic Treadmill device. His speed also allows him, in certain circumstances, to \"vibrate\" between [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimensions]]. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Final Crisis]]'', using the Speed Force, Allen was able to undo the effects of the [[Anti-Life Equation]] upon an individual: an ability he used on his wife Iris to free her from the bondage of [[Darkseid]]'s mind control.<ref name=\"FinalCrisis4\" />\n\nBarry's speed has numerous secondary applications. He can use it to generate cyclones by spinning his arms quickly. Barry can also manipulate the electrical Speed Force energy he generates. He can channel the energy into arcs of lightning, as well as use the electricity to manipulate magnetism on a minor level. He has also used the lightning to create blinding amounts of light. By interlocking his lightning with that of another speedster, Barry can short circuit their connection to the Speed Force. Barry is also immune to telepathic attacks and control as he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Through \"speed-reading\", he can absorb large amounts of information into his [[short-term memory]], which remain in his mind just long enough for him to make use of it. Using this technique, Barry was able to learn enough about building work to rebuild a destroyed apartment building.<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 3) #2 (May 2010)</ref> The Speed Force also supplies Barry with a protective aura that shields him from friction and kinetic impacts, as well as grants him superhuman durability. Other aspects of Barry's powers include an enhanced metabolism, which grants him a regenerative healing factor. In the New 52, Barry learned that his body is using the Speed Force to its full extent but his brain was not. With the help of Dr. Elias he was able to learn how to use the Speed Force to process more information, and make even quicker decisions, to the point where he feels like he can see everything before it happens.<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 4) #2 (December 2011)</ref> Barry also developed the ability to speed up the flow of time around him, which he used to negate the powers of Zoom, who was able to slow down time. In terms of DC's internal lexicon, Barry is classified as a [[metahuman]]: a human being who possesses extranormal abilities either through birth or (as in Barry's case) as the result of some external event.<ref>''Superman'' #7 (2012)</ref><ref>''Voodoo'' #7 (2012)</ref>\n\n==Rogues gallery==\n{{Main|Rogues (comics)}}\nThe Flash has acquired a colorful rogues gallery of villains. Their number includes (but is not limited to) several who formed a loose association and refer to themselves as the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], disdaining the use of the term \"[[supervillain]]\" or \"super-criminal\". These criminals typically have unusually modest goals for their power level (robbery or other petty crimes), and each have adopted a specific theme in his or her equipment and methods.\n\n==Other versions==\n* Barry Allen is a supporting character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''. He has been kept by [[Lex Luthor]] as a power source for most of the East Coast, constantly running on a treadmill to provide cheap electrical power or else Iris will be executed. After being rescued, Barry wears a black version of his original Flash costume which Batman's young assistants deemed as \"old\"\u2014\"Kids, these days, can't tell the difference between just plain old and classic\", he mutters. He then aids [[Batman]] and other heroes in restoring order, though they clash when Barry wants to save people in danger while Batman is prepared to let them die for the sake of his long-term strategy.\n* Barry Allen appears in ''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'' as a scientist working with [[Superman]] and a consortium of early twentieth-century scientists such as [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. His uniform incorporates the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] look with the [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]-style helmet worn by Jay Garrick.\n* In ''League of Justice'', a ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]''-type story, Barry is recast as \"Phaeton\", who wears a mystical brooch resembling Flash's lightning-bolt chest emblem, and has bathed in dragon's blood in order to protect himself from speed friction.\n* In ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'', Barry is one of a number of [[metahuman]]s imprisoned by a [[theocracy|theocratic]] state, discovered and released by Batman during a raid on the government. He then shows Batman some of the attempts to recreate his powers in others, ranging from a man who cannot control his ability to vibrate to a woman whose brain operates at lightspeed while her body is still at normal speed or a man rapidly aging to death. While Barry and Batman are able to defeat the brainwashed [[Zatanna]], Barry is then killed when his captor reveals that his research has included discovering how to deactivate the aura that protects Barry from being destroyed by the friction he generates while running.\n* A version of Barry Allen aka '''Hot Pursuit''' appeared in the lead into [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]].<ref name=\"tf12\">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #6 (January 2011)</ref> Little is known about the exact origins of Hot Pursuit, or how he came to be. The only thing known is the fact that he is a version of Barry Allen from the future, who goes back in time to warn himself about the upcoming events of Flashpoint. Hot Pursuit's history is assumed to be the same as Barry Allen's up until the single point in time, where a great anomaly altered the reality of the future all together. The unknown event that made Barry Allen don the role of Hot Pursuit is the same event he travels back in time to warn himself about, as well as the event that causes Flashpoint. With Flashpoint's widespread time-altering effects, it is possible that Barry Allen lost his connection to the Speed Force, thus needing the cosmic motorcycle Hot Pursuit is seen riding to access the Speed Force and travel back in time. This motorcycle also needs to be charged constantly with mass amounts of electricity in order for it to continue to be able to access the Speed Force, thus it is unable to naturally access the Speed Force like Barry Allen or the rest of the Flash Family.<ref name=autogenerated2>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #12 (May 2011)</ref>\n[[Image:Quasar1.png|thumb|upright|\"'''Buried Alien'''\"]]\n* A story in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book series ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'', written four years after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has the [[Marvel Universe]] speedsters facing off in a competition set up by a being called the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]]. The contest is a race from the Earth to the Moon. During the race, a surge of energy hits the track, leaving a being with blonde hair and dressed in the remains of a red outfit with yellow boots. This being has no memory, but an enormous desire to run. He goes on to win the race, passing Marvel speedsters such as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] in the process. When asked what his name is, the man replies, \"I'm not sure. \"Buried Alien\"... Something like that.\" When asked how it felt to be the fastest man alive, he replied, \"It feels... right.\"<ref>Quasar #17, December 199</ref> The racer goes on to take the name Fast-Forward, disappearing into the universe in an attempt to help [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], who is stuck at hyper speed.<ref>Quasar #58, May 1994</ref>\n* In the Elseworlds tale ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', Barry's life is still the same, but heroes age in real time. This reality shows no sign of the Crisis ever happening, so an elderly Barry is seen to be alive and well in 2008.\n* The Elseworlds story ''Flashpoint'' shows an alternate reality where Barry Allen becomes the Flash in 1956, the year he first appeared in comics. He is more involved in government affairs. By 1963, he has ended the [[Cold War]] and pushed the [[communism|communists]] out of [[Vietnam]]. However, his career is cut short as he takes a bullet aimed at [[John F. Kennedy]]. He is paralyzed from the neck down, but he still has the fastest mind on Earth and forms Allen Industries. By 1988, he and [[Vandal Savage|Vandal Savage's]] Immortality, Inc. have begun an exploration of [[Mars]]. In 1998, Wally West leads an expedition to Mars, during which he finds the flashpoint, an object which killed all life on Mars. Savage reveals he is the one who shot Allen. Barry makes contact with [[Wally West|Wally]], who is going on a super speed rampage. Barry is cured and defeats Savage. He then enters the flashpoint, going into the [[Speed Force]].\n* In ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]] Annual'' #7, an alternate universe is shown where shortly after Wally West became Kid Flash, he became a superstar celebrity. However, Barry was tragically killed while battling [[Captain Cold]]. Ten years later, Wally is now a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] and Captain Cold has written a supposedly \"true\" story about Barry that paints him as arrogant and incompetent. Wally decides to make a movie about his mentor that portrays the genuine Barry Allen. The resulting film is a success.\n* The Barry Allen of [[Earth-51]], where [[secret identity|secret identities]] are no longer needed by superheroes, is seen alive. He is subsequently killed by the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]] of New Earth.\n* In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' a version of Barry Allen is a member of a Justice League where Superman did not become a hero and join the team until much later. In lieu of Superboy's adventures with the Legion of Super-Heroes, the Flash visited the 30th Century instead. Barry Allen of ''The Nail'' is almost identical to the pre-Crisis Earth-1 version, except that his costume resembles Wally's. His most prominent scene in the story is a confrontation with [[Amazo]] where he manages to defeat the android by turning intangible and removing his computerized brain before Amazo can process and mimic that attack.\n* In the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' Barry joins Superman's Regime in a more forceful approach to saving the world from crime. However, Barry remains one of the few (alongside Shazam) to maintain some sense of morality, as he is more prone to questioning some of Superman's more drastic actions in the Year One series. Though Batman tries to convince Barry of the Regime's negative influence, he chooses to stay with them, though still tries to convince Superman his more drastic actions will not go down well. In the game, Barry finally defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam for questioning his ethics. He joins the Insurgency and plays a critical role in stopping Superman's dictatorship. While he and the other Regime members are arrested, he is pardoned thanks to Batman vouching for him and given a job at Luthor/Wayne climate research. His superior, Doctor Randall, convinces Barry to become the Flash again to aid the heroes in stopping [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s invasion.\n* A version of Barry Allen is present through ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]''. This version hails from Earth-Minus-52 of the Dark Multiverse, where Batman became mad due to the deaths of his crimefighting sidekicks. Batman manages to absorb Barry's body, taking the Speed Force for himself and calling himself \"'''Red Death'''\"; however Barry's mind remains present in Bruce's body, pleading Bruce to stop his dark crusade. When Red Death is hit by the positive energy, Bruce dies, leaving Barry alive and in control of his body, with the costume changing its color from red to gold. Barry tries his best to help his counterpart from Earth-0. However, because Barry from Earth-Minus-52 is a \"creature of darkness\", the exposure to the positive energy starts to rip him apart, killing him almost instantly.\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Flash in other media}}\n\n===Film===\n====DC Extended Universe====\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\n[[File:EzraFlash.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ezra Miller]] as Barry Allen/The Flash in 2017 film, ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.]]\n[[Ezra Miller]] portrays Barry Allen/The Flash in the DCEU.

When Bruce contacts Barry and offers him membership of the team, Barry accepts, a conversation with his father forcing Barry to face the idea that he needs friends, but finding it hard to interact with other people because of his speed.

Labs]] scientist Dr. Christina McGee, Barry learned how to control his powers with the help of a special prototype deep-sea diving suit. When Barry's older brother and police colleague Jay Allen was murdered by gang leader and Jay's former police partner Nicholas Pike, Barry wore a masked version of the suit and called himself the Flash. After capturing Pike, Barry sees his potentials of accomplishing some differences with his powers in a crime-ridden Central City, and started helping to bring other criminals to justice and provide hope to people as a masked superhero. Later, the Earth where this Flash lives is designated as Earth-90. Shipp also recurs as Earth-1's Barry Allen's (portrayed by Grant Gustin) father, [[Henry Allen (The Flash)|Dr. Henry Allen]], and Henry's Earth-3 equivalent [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick/The Flash]] in the 2014 television series. Shipp later reprises his role of 1990 television series for both crossovers \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\" and \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", therefore like Garrick, this Flash is also Henry's doppelg\u00e4nger.\n[[File:The Flash (Grant Gustin) 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Grant Gustin]] as Barry Allen / The Flash in The CW network television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.]]\n* [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] first appears in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', played by [[Grant Gustin]].

In the exclusive \"Who do you trust\" trailer, he appears to be taking an order from Batman, and runs upon being told. While running, he stops to see [[Hal Jordan]] about to get killed by [[Black Adam]]. He runs there to save Hal. Before he can, though, Black Adam sets off an explosion that kills Barry, Hal, and other heroes.\n* Barry Allen was a playable character in the multiplayer battle arena game ''[[Infinite Crisis (video game)|Infinite Crisis]]'', voiced by Michael Rosenbaum.\n* Barry Allen was a playable hero in mobile [[multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game that released by [[Tencent Games]], [[Arena of Valor]].\n* Barry Allen appears as a playable character in ''DC Unchained''.\n\n====LEGO series====\n* Barry Allen appears a member of the Justice League in LEGO films ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League]]'', ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League \u2013 Attack of the Legion of Doom]]'', ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League \u2013 Cosmic Clash]]'', and ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash]]'', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].\n* Barry Allen appears a member of the Justice League in video games ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes|LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham|LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'' and ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]] ; he also appears in the ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'' game, with the role reprised by ''[[Michael Rosenbaum]]''.\n\n====''Injustice'' series====\n* Barry Allen is a playable character in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', voiced by [[Neal McDonough]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=5152 |title=The Voices of Injustice: Gods Among Us (2013, Video Game)&nbsp;\u2013 Voice Cast Listing at Voice Chasers |work=Voice Chasers |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311164941/http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=5152 |archivedate=2016-03-11 }}</ref> He is seen at the beginning taking part in a battle against Lex Luthor and his villain allies. In the alternate reality, Flash is one of the heroes serving in [[Superman]]'s Regime, although he has doubts about Superman's true intentions. After Superman kills [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] when the latter questions his plan to destroy Metropolis and Gotham City to show humanity that he is 'needed', the Flash realizes that the heroes have officially gone too far and defects to [[Batman]]'s Insurgency. After the original Superman deposes the Regime, Barry surrenders himself due to his previous alliance with the Regime, but is assured by [[Green Arrow]] that his help in their defeat will be mentioned at the Regime's trial. In Flash's ending, he defeats Superman but is still overcome with guilt for his actions with the Regime and goes into exile. To make amends, he retakes his superhero mantle and begins fighting crime relentlessly in Central City where he is referred to as \"The Ghost\".\n* He returns as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', now with [[Taliesin Jaffe]] reprising his role from ''MK vs DC''. In the story, Flash has been pardoned from prison in recognition of his aid in deposing Superman's regime, and now seeks to make amends for his time as a regime member. In his playable chapter, Flash single-handedly defends Metropolis from Brainiac's initial attack and briefly comes to blows with Hal Jordan, who is trying to atone for his misdeeds as a Regime partisan, much like Flash himself. The two put their differences aside and join Batman's Insurgency. After Brainiac is defeated, he sides with Batman on allowing Brainiac to live so the captured and lost cities could be restored. Flash attempts to stop an enraged Superman but is easily defeated. In his arcade mode ending, Flash throws Brainiac into the end of time and enters the Speed Force, where he is reunited with other speedsters. Together, they set out to stop a crisis that threatens multiple universes.\n\n===Music===\n\n\"Ballad of Barry Allen\"\u2014A song by the band [[Jim's Big Ego]] on their album, ''They're Everywhere''. The song portrays Barry as a tragic character, whose perception of the world is so accelerated that all of reality appears to proceed at a snail's pace, causing him to gradually slip into depression. The band's frontman, [[Jim Infantino]], is the nephew of Flash (Barry Allen) co-creator [[Carmine Infantino]], who provided the cover art for the same album.\n\n==Reception==\n[[IGN]] ranked Barry as the 49th greatest hero of all time stating that even in his 20-year absence, Barry's legacy as the greatest Flash of them all lived on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/49 |title=Barry Allen (The Flash) is number 49 |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508013024/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/49 |archivedate=May 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Barry Allen placed 8th on [[IGN]]'s Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics |title=The Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics |publisher=IGN |date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2015-11-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102013528/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics |archivedate=2015-11-02 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Flash_Intro.ogg|2008-04-16}}\n* [https://www.webcitation.org/6jOaTZseg?url=http://toonopedia.com/flash2.htm Flash (1956)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].  from the original on July 30, 2016.\n* {{cite web| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060323061055/http://www.monitorduty.com/mdarchives/2006/01/kistlers_profil_2.shtml | first=Alan|last= Kistler | title= Profile On: The Flash&nbsp;\u2013 Part 2| publisher= MonitorDuty.com| date = January 11, 2006| archivedate= March 23, 2006| url= http://www.monitorduty.com/mdarchives/2006/01/kistlers_profil_2.shtml}}\n* [http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Barry_Allen Arrowverse entry for The Flash]\n\n{{Flash}}\n{{Justice League}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{Green Lantern}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by John Broome]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carmine Infantino]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Robert Kanigher]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1956]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:DC Comics television characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional forensic scientists]]\n[[Category:Central City Police Department officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional chemists]]\n[[Category:Flash (DC comics) characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Superhero television characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate time]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Superhero appearing in DC Comics publications and related media}}\n{{About||the character from the 2014 The Flash TV series|Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|other uses of Barry Allen|Barry Allen (disambiguation){{!}}Barry Allen}}\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| character_name = Flash\n| image = Flash (Barry Allen circa 2019).png\n| caption = Barry Allen, the second Flash, on the cover of ''The Flash'' vol. 5, #78 (September 2019).

Various other effects are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of [[molecular vibration]]s, including his ability to vibrate at speed to pass through objects. The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring.\n\nBarry Allen's classic stories introduced the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] to DC Comics, and this concept played a large part in DC's various [[reboot (fiction)|continuity reboots]] over the years. The Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC's major company-wide reboot stories, and in the crossover ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #8 (Nov. 1985), Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse, removing the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years. His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during the narrative (and a single image of a blur) in [[Grant Morrison]]'s crossover story ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #3 (Nov. 2008), fully actualized in [[Geoff Johns]]' accompanying ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' #1 (June 2009), kicking off a six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. He has since played a pivotal role in the crossover stories ''[[Blackest Night]]'' (2009), [[Flashpoint (comics)|''Flashpoint'']] (2011), [[Convergence (comics)|''Convergence'']] (2015), and ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' (2016).\n\nAllen is the most well-known and commonly featured individual to take the mantle of the Flash, being present in numerous media adaptations, one-shots and comic-book story-arcs taking place in alternate universes.\n\nBarry Allen has been featured in several media, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' and then in the related ''[[Super Friends]]'' program. Since then he has appeared in several [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]]. Actor [[John Wesley Shipp]] portrayed the character in the live-action 1990s television show ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and the [[Arrowverse]]. Allen is currently portrayed by [[Grant Gustin]] in the [[Arrowverse]] shows in a main capacity, especially the 2014 television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', while [[Ezra Miller]] portrays the character in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|''Crisis on Infinite Earths'']] and the [[DC Extended Universe]] films ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']], and will return in the 2022 film ''The Flash''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Showcase4.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Showcase''#4 (Oct. 1956): First appearance of the Silver Age Flash. Art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Joe Kubert]].]]Barry Allen is a police [[scientist]] (his job was later changed to a forensic investigator) with a reputation for being very slow, and frequently late, which frustrates his fianc\u00e9e, [[Iris West]]. When Barry was a child, his mother was murdered, and Barry's father was unjustly blamed. It was actually the [[Reverse-Flash]]. One night, as he is working late on a new case, a lightning bolt strikes and shatters a case full of unspecified chemicals and drenches all over Barry, temporarily knocking him out. As a result, Allen later finds that he can run at super-human speeds and possesses equally enhanced reflexes, senses, and healing. He later dons a red bodysuit, sporting a lightning bolt in the chest (reminiscent of the original [[Fawcett Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]), dubs himself the Flash (after his childhood comic book hero, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]), and becomes [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]'s resident costumed crime fighter and protector.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nCentral City University professor Ira West (Iris's adoptive father) designed Allen's costume and the ring which stores it while Allen is in his civilian identity.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Bates, Cary|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 267|Date = November 1978|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> The ring can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit. In addition, Allen invented the cosmic treadmill, a device that allowed for precise [[time travel]] and was used in many stories. Allen was warmly received by his superhero colleagues, so much to the extent that nearly all speedsters that come after him are often compared to him. [[Batman]] once said \"Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents had not been murdered.\"<ref>''Justice'' #8 (Dec. 2006)</ref>\n\n===Justice League===\nAs presented in ''Justice League of America'' #9, when the Earth is infiltrated by [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] warriors sent to conquer the planet, some of the world's greatest heroes join forces, Allen among them. While the superheroes individually defeat most of the invaders, they fall prey to a single alien and only by working together are they able to defeat the warrior. Afterwards, the heroes decide to establish the [[Justice League]].\n\nDuring the years, he is depicted as feeling slightly attracted to [[Black Canary]] and [[Zatanna]], but he never pursues a relationship because he feels his real love is Iris West, whom he ultimately marries. Allen also becomes a good friend with [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], which would later be the subject of the limited series ''Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold''.\n\nIn ''The Flash'' # 123\u2014\"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\"\u2014Allen is transported to [[Earth-Two]] where he meets Jay Garrick, the original Flash in DC Continuity; it is revealed that Jay Garrick's adventures were captured in comic book form on [[Earth-One]]. This storyline initiated DC's multiverse and was continued in issues of ''Flash'' and in team-ups between the Justice League of America of Earth-One and the [[Justice Society of America]] of Earth-Two. In the classic story from ''Flash'' #179\u2014\"The Flash&nbsp;\u2013 Fact or Fiction?\"\u2014Allen is thrown into the universe eventually called [[Earth Prime]], a representation of \"our\" universe, where he seeks the aid of the ''Flash'' comic book's editor [[Julius Schwartz]] to build a [[cosmic treadmill]] so that he can return home. He also gains a sidekick and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Iris' nephew, [[Wally West]], who gains super-speed in an accident similar to that which gave Allen his powers.\n\n===Tragedy===\nIn time, he married his girlfriend Iris West, who learned of his double identity because Allen talked in his sleep. She kept this secret, and he eventually revealed his identity to her of his own free will with Moreno's persuasion.<ref>''The Flash'' #174</ref> Iris was eventually revealed to have been sent as a child from the 30th century and adopted.\n\nIn the 1980s, Flash's life begins to collapse.  [[Professor Zoom]] (a [[supervillain]] from the 25th century who had long loved her and been jealous of Allen), and when Allen prepares to marry another woman, Zoom tries the same trick again. Allen stops him, killing Zoom in the process by breaking his neck. Unfortunately, when Barry is unable to make an appearance at his own wedding, his fianc\u00e9e eventually descends into madness and  stomps \nout of the room walking in somber.\n\nPlaced on trial for murder in connection with Zoom's death, Allen is found guilty by the jury. When he is told by a juror Nathan Newbury, who is being possessed by a mind from the future, that Reverse-Flash (whom Allen knows to be dead) brainwashed the jury into this verdict, Flash flees his trial. The Flash is then attacked by Reverse-Flash, and realizes that the answers to this mystery, and restoring his good name, lie in the future, so Newbury uses a time device to send them forward. They discover that [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] was disguised as Reverse-Flash to ruin the Flash's good name. Defeating Kadabra, he retreats to the future to be reunited with Iris, having learned that Iris' spirit was in fact drawn to the 30th century, and given a new body (and was in fact the mind inhabiting Newbury). The final issue of ''The Flash'' ends with Flash and Iris kissing passionately and the caption \"And they lived happily ever after... for a while\". There are a few references in the final issue (''The Flash'' #350) to the upcoming events, and Flash's impending death.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nIn the controversial storyline ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' (sets within the post-''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' continuity), it is revealed that Barry voted to allow [[Zatanna]] to edit [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]]'s mind with four of the members of the Justice League six months after Iris's death, essentially lobotomizing him. When Batman discovers what the League was doing, they have his memories edited as well despite the opposition from [[Green Arrow]]. Both Doctor Light and Batman would eventually recover from their respective mindwipe, leading Doctor Light to swear vengeance to all heroes and Batman's distrust towards his allies.\n\n===''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A Flash's death (Crisis on Infinite Earths).png|thumb|right|250px|Barry heroically sacrificing himself to stop the Anti-Monitor; however, it is later retconned that he actually still alive but trapped in the Speed Force following the battle.

After only a few weeks of happiness, the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' intervenes, and Allen is captured by the [[Anti-Monitor]] and brought to 1985; according to the Anti-Monitor, the Flash was the only being capable of traveling to other universes at will, so the Anti-Monitor could not allow him to stay free. Allen escapes and foils the Anti-Monitor's plan to destroy the Earth with an anti-matter cannon, creating a speed vortex to draw the power in, but dies in the process as the power becomes too much for his body.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> It has been said that Allen travels back through time and becomes the very same lightning bolt that gives him his powers, but later it is also strongly implied that the soul of Barry resides in the [[Speed Force]], the mystical source and Valhalla open to all dead speedsters, and from which the living ones draw their amazing powers. After Allen's death, Kid Flash [[Wally West]], his nephew and sidekick, takes up the mantle of the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|Title = [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 12|Date = March 1986|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====After death====\n[[Marv Wolfman]], scribe for the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has repeatedly stated (first hinted at in his introduction to the original ''Crisis'' collected edition hardcover), then fully explained on his website that he left a loophole in the script wherein the Barry Allen Flash could be reintroduced, without a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]], into DC Universe continuity.<ref>[http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q&A.html ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128175053/http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q%26A.html |date=January 28, 2006 }}</ref> This loophole would allow a writer to pull Barry out of his desperate run to annihilate the anti-matter cannon. However, Barry would know he must someday finish his death run, and would become more determined to use his speed to help others.\n\nIt should also be noted that the way Barry Allen seemed to have \"died\" in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', was that he ran so fast that he was able to stop the Anti-Monitor's anti-matter cannon from firing by catching the tachyon beam at the heart of the weapon. After this act, according to ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 (1988), Barry Allen turns into a lightning bolt, goes back in time, becoming the lightning bolt that hit his lab, splashing his past-self with chemicals and transforming him into the Flash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/wheres-barry.html |title=Where's Barry?

In the multiversal variant known as Earth-247, each of her children themselves have children with speed-based abilities. One, Jenni Ognats, grows up to become the Legionnaire [[XS (comics)|XS]], while the other, [[Bart Allen]], is born with an accelerated metabolism that rapidly ages him, and is sent back to the 20th century where he is cured by Wally West. He remains there as the superhero Impulse under the tutelage of [[Max Mercury]], and later becomes the second Kid Flash as a member of the [[Teen Titans]].

When the two teams see their real futures, Barry witnesses his death during Crisis on Infinite Earths as the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] shows the heroes how reality should be, but nevertheless resolves to help restore the timeline as it is not his place to play God. He talks with Hal Jordan over the similarity of their situation, stating that dying could not be so bad so long as they have left a legacy for others (Wally West and [[Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner)|Kyle Rayner]], in their cases) to fight for what they believe. He helps the team get into [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s base by using his running on a treadmill to pass the ship through the dimensional barrier. With the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], he is ordered by [[Captain America]] to find ways through Krona's defences, and alerts the group to a probably lethal force field. During the final battle, Barry saves [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from being killed when the [[Absorbing Man]] breaks the ground beneath him, but both of them are blasted and apparently killed by [[Dreamslayer]]. At the end, it is revealed that Barry got the two of them out alive and at Captain America's suggestion they laid low and because of this, Hawkeye is able to destroy Krona's machine with a TNT arrow while Barry distracts him, then Barry takes the 12 items of power. As a result, reality is restored, Barry disappears and Wally returns.\n\n===Post-''Crisis'' appearances===\nWally West, wracked by grief for the loss of his unborn twins at the hands of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], regrets the public knowledge of his identity. Barry appears from somewhere in time\u2014stating that he is from a period shortly before his death\u2014counseling his nephew, and talking the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] into granting his wish, erasing all public knowledge of Wally and Barry's identities as the Flash (Although Wally himself also loses his memory of his identity for a time). Barry then disappears, telling his nephew that he will come to his aid three times, on the three most difficult days of his life of which this is the first. In fact, when Zoom enlists the aid of the original Professor Zoom to make Wally relive the loss of his beloved twins, Barry is already there, trying to stop his \"own\" Reverse-Flash; Zoom apparently retrieved [[Eobard Thawne]] from the day that he attempted to kill Fiona Webb, with Barry following his nemesis. For the second time, he helps Wally to undo the damage dealt by Zoom, also allowing Wally to save his twins, and then he returns to his proper time, dragging his Zoom with him and breaking his enemy's neck in his timeline.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nIn the fourth issue of ''Infinite Crisis'', Barry Allen comes out from the Speed Force, along with [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Max Mercury]], to help his grandson Bart deal with [[Superboy-Prime]], taking the villainous teen with him in the Speed Force. Bart Allen appears wearing Barry Allen's costume in Tokyo near the end of ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 to tell the heroes that Superboy-Prime has escaped the Speed Force. Bart again reappears in ''Infinite Crisis'' #7 in Barry Allen's costume to combat Superboy-Prime once more.\n\nIn ''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #6 (2006) (with a portion taking place shortly before ''Infinite Crisis'' #5) it is told how Barry spent four years in an alternate [[Keystone City]] along with Max Mercury, Johnny Quick, and an alternate Jay Garrick, until he met Bart and Wally West, joining him after the battle against Superboy-Prime. After Superboy escapes, Barry suggests that someone has to absorb the whole Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge back to Post-Crisis Earth. As Bart volunteers, Barry gives him his suit as a last gift, to keep the Force contained, and stays behind. Wally West did not go because of his wife and kids. Bart says he knows Barry would go if he could, but why Barry Allen could not make the journey himself is not stated.\n\n===Return===\n[[Image:Barry Return.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barry Allen returns to the DC Universe, fleeing from the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]].

As the story progresses, he begins to recall his past and association with [[Justice League]] members, particularly [[Hal Jordan]] and [[Superman]]. The lettering in which he speaks to the reader is yellow on backgrounds that are initially black. As the story moves forward, the background slowly begins turning red. In the final pages, the narration boxes feature a yellow lightning bolt. Over time, as he recalls friendships and connections with other people, his mind begins to narrow, remarking \"I...know him. I am no longer everything. I am a shaft of light split through a prism\". Yet he is still the only one able to see \"the shadow falling over everything\", in the form of [[Darkseid]]. On the final page, the moon appears in front of a red sky, as a yellow lightning bolt strikes diagonally in front of it creating the logo of the Flash, as he remarks \"and now I remember\". The title of the story is revealed to be \"Let There Be Lightning\".<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] and [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = DC Universe Zero|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = April 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nA ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' story released on the same day proclaimed that Barry Allen has returned to life, with issue co-writer [[Geoff Johns]] stating, \"When the greatest evil comes back to the DC Universe, the greatest hero needed to return.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2008/04/30/2008-04-30_the_flash_outruns_the_reaper_23_years_af-1.html |title=Entertainment/Arts 2008-04-30 |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2011-04-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204145213/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2008/04/30/2008-04-30_the_flash_outruns_the_reaper_23_years_af-1.html |archivedate=2009-02-04 }}</ref>\n\n====''Final Crisis''====\n{{Main|Final Crisis}}\nBarry makes his [[wikt:corporeal|corporeal]] return in ''Final Crisis'' #2.

Meanwhile, Wally and Barry run a few weeks into the future. When they come to rest, Wally asks Barry if it is really him. Lamenting on Orion's death, which he was unable to stop, Barry wonders why he is now alive after being dead for so long. It is then that Barry and Wally are confronted by [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batwoman]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Giganta]], who have all been transformed into the new [[Female Furies]] following the release of the [[Anti-Life Equation]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = [[Final Crisis]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = July 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that this new version of the Female Furies is equipped with the ability to track down speedsters, perceived by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] and Darkseid as the only obstacle left between them and world domination, Barry's expertise allows him to overcome their foes and run through the ruined Earth.\n\nBarry stops to see his wife Iris and save her from the slavery of the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. Seeing his wife again for the first time in years, Barry is overcome with emotion and gives his brainwashed wife a deep kiss. While kissing her, the Speed Force sparkles out of his body, enveloping Iris and freeing her from the Equation.

When asked what Flashes would appear in the series, Johns and Van Sciver said, \"All of them.\"\n\nThe series begins with the cities of Central and Keystone celebrating the return of, \"Central City's Flash\", [[Wonder Woman]] having used her government contacts to create the story that Barry was in witness protection to account for his resurrection. Avoiding the parades, parties, and other celebrations of his return, Barry instead contemplates why he is alive again. A visit to the [[Flash Museum]] and from his friend [[Hal Jordan]] is not enough to put his mind at ease as he runs off as the Flash. \"I can't be late,\" he says. When asked by Hal late for what, Flash replies, \"For whatever the rest of the world needs me for.\"\n\nIt is then revealed that Flash's mother was murdered when he was a child, and his father was arrested for the crime (this is pointedly contrary to previous Flash stories, in which both his parents appear alive). Flash describes this as \"the only one open case I left behind.\" Before he can contemplate this any further, the speedster villain [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]] escapes the Speed Force through Flash. When Flash manages to put his hand on Savitar's shoulder, the villain screams in agony and crumbles into dust, not before telling Flash, \"...You were the beginning, Allen...and you're the end.\" At that moment, [[Wally West]], West's children Iris and Jai, [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]], [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]] all experience painful convulsions and are engulfed in lightning.<ref name=\"TFR1\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = April 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nBarry's conflict with the speed cult{{clarify|date=September 2011}} culminates in the death of their new leader who was attempting to avenge Savitar's death.

Max attempts to tell Allen that his becoming the Black Flash is not his fault. When Max and Barry are pulled into another pocket of the Speed Force, the real culprit reveals himself: [[Professor Zoom]].<ref name=\"TFR3\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = June 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nZoom reveals his plan: after Barry briefly aided Kid Flash against Superboy-Prime during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Thawne was able to send a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to draw back what was left of Barry's self-awareness. This led to the hero's reappearance during the ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Afterward, Zoom transformed himself into \"a new kind of speedster and created his negative Speed Force to contaminate Barry and the other heroic speedsters. Before Barry can fight any further, Zoom fades away. Wally enters the Speed Force to retrieve his uncle, and after venturing deeper into the Speed Force, Max reveals to Barry that it was Allen himself who created the Speed Force. Meanwhile, Wally manages to reach Barry and Max, and the three begin their escape. As the heroic speedsters are recharged with energy, Barry, Wally, Jay, Max, and Bart charge towards Zoom.<ref name=\"TFR4\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|Date = August 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nThe seven speedsters (the 5 men plus Jesse Chambers and Iris West-Park) battle against Zoom, and despite being outnumbered, Zoom pulls Barry away. He reveals that everything horrible that happened to Barry, including the murder of Barry's mother, was caused by Zoom. Zoom then decides to destroy everything by killing Barry's wife, Iris, before they met.<ref name=\"TFR5\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 5|Date = November 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nBarry chases after Zoom, and is joined by Wally, who tells Barry to push as hard as he can to break the time barrier. They reach Thawne, becoming the lightning bolt that turns Barry into the Flash as they are able to stop Zoom from killing Iris. As the two Flashes push Zoom back through time to the present, they see that the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device specifically for Thawne. Barry tosses him in and activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force. The Flashes tie Zoom up to stop him from running. With the threat ended, everyone celebrates by welcoming Barry back and the speedsters in general. Later, Barry closes the case on his mother's death and opts to take all the other cold cases they had after his death. Barry spends some time with Iris before racing to Washington to celebrate his return with the Justice League, apologizing for being late.<ref name=\"TFR6\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 6|Date = February 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====''Blackest Night''====\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\n[[Image:Blue Lantern Flash.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barry Allen as a member of the [[Blue Lantern Corps]] during the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event.

Allen appears alongside Jordan in the [[Free Comic Book Day]] issue ''Blackest Night'' #0 that acts as a prologue to the July company crossover.\n\nAt the grave of [[Bruce Wayne]] in [[Gotham City]], Hal and Barry reflect on Batman's death and how the hero community is avoiding linking Wayne and Batman.\n\nThis reflection turns to the pair looking at their own deaths, comparing the sadness that Barry's death engendered in others while Hal's death produced anger. Hal sums it up by telling Barry, \"'''I''' died a '''sinner'''. '''''You''''' died a '''saint'''.\" (though he admits he's not and reflecting of his past sins.) The conversation moves on to the world becoming \"more dangerous\" after Barry's death and observing that the deaths of [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] and [[Martian Manhunter]] cost the [[Justice League]] its \"heart and soul\". As they leave the cemetery, Barry expresses hope that their dead comrades will be returned to them.

Boomerang fights both the Flash and the Renegades, and a confused Top (one of the Renegades from the 25th century) questions his teammates on whether or not Barry Allen is the man they are looking for, pointing out that in their timeline, Boomerang never showed up.\n\nThe Renegades finally corner Captain Boomerang when the Rogues arrive with a giant mirror left by the previous Mirror Master that says \"In Case The Flash Returns Break Glass\". An all out brawl ensues as the Rogues battle the Renegades. Meanwhile, Flash is confronted by Top who warns him that the reason he will eventually kill Mirror Monarch is because of Iris's death, which he claims will be caused when the giant mirror breaks, releasing the Mirror Lords. Top tells Barry that one of the Mirror Lords will possess Iris and take her away from him. Barry races to stop the mirror from breaking, with Top at his side. However, when the White Lantern entity reaches out to Captain Boomerang, telling him to \"Throw the Boomerang\", Boomerang responds by throwing dozens of boomerangs in every direction. One of them hits the glass and it begins to break. Top tells Flash to stop the Mirror Lords, while he goes and protects Iris. Flash questions does not make sense, but Top throws him into the mirror and flees.\n\nIn the mirror, Flash is exposed to strange visions of his mother. Outside, the Rogue Mirror Master tells the others that the mirror is actually a slow acting poison and they flee. Barry escapes the mirror confused and asks, \"Where are the Mirror Lords?\" He is then arrested by the Renegades, who realize that this was all a setup by Top to frame the Flash for his own personal gains. Barry is transported to a 25th-century court, while Top confronts Iris.\n\nThe story concludes with Barry escaping the 25th century court and going after Top. Top reveals that the reason for all of his crimes is because Barry reopened a previously closed case. Barry felt that the person convicted was actually innocent. The person who is actually guilty of the crime is one of Top's ancestors. Top reveals that they do not allow anyone in the Renegades who has any ancestors with a criminal record. The Flash is able to beat Top, and convict the right man for murder, letting go the innocent man who was sent to prison. Afterward, the 25th century court and the Renegades go over the facts, realizing that the Flash was right and that their entire record of history is wrong. This alludes to the upcoming Flash event, ''[[Flash: Flashpoint|Flashpoint]]''. Meanwhile, a man on a Speed Force-powered motorcycle (later revealed to be a Speed Force police officer under the name of Hot Pursuit)<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 3) #8 (November 2010)</ref> moves through the desert and says that if Barry does not find the flashpoint, it will destroy the world. As he continues through the desert, Speed Force lightning strikes in the distance.\n\nIn a ''Green Lantern'' storyline, Barry becomes the latest host for the embodiment of fear, [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], after he joins Hal Jordan's quest of locating all of the entities who each represent aspects of the power of the emotional spectrum. Barry was susceptible to the entity's attacks due to his fear for Jordan's safety.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #59 (Nov. 2010)</ref> Barry is eventually freed after the embodiment of compassion, Proselyte, helps him remember his capability for benevolence over his fear.\n\nDC has also announced via the Flashpoint Friday Blog that ''Flash'' #12 will be the last in the series despite a thirteenth issue originally having been announced for sale on May 25, 2011, but which has since been withdrawn.\n\n====''Flashpoint''====\n{{Main|Flashpoint (comics)}}\nAs the story begins, Barry Allen wakes up in his office and discovers that his mother is alive, there is no trace of [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]] leading their respective nations in a war, his wife [[Iris West]] is unmarried, and himself currently powerless. Barry seeks the aid of [[Batman]], driving to Gotham City and entering a run-down Wayne Manor. He explores what turns out to be a small Batcave until he is attacked by Batman. Barry tries to explain who he is by saying he knows Batman is Bruce Wayne, only to find that in this reality, Batman is [[Thomas Wayne]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref> While Barry is being beat up by Batman, he explains about his secret identity as the Flash and his relation to Bruce Wayne. Barry's memories spontaneously change and he realizes that the world of Flashpoint is not an alternate dimension, but his own. Barry uses his ring, which he uses to contain his Flash outfit, but the ring instead ejects [[Professor Zoom]]'s costume. Barry tells Batman that Zoom is taunting him with it. Barry explains that both he and Zoom have the ability to alter time, leading Batman to ask him about how Bruce was to have lived in his place and if he can really change the world. Barry states that he needs his speed first. Later, Barry and Batman create an electric chair-like device to try and recreate the accident that gave him his speed; however, the first attempt meets with failure, leaving Barry severely burned.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #2 (June 2011)</ref>\n\nBarry awakes on an operating table in the Batcave and is covered in bandages and third degree burns. Despite Thomas' advice, Barry sits back down in the electric chair device. When lightning strikes a second time, Barry's super-speed returns, and he then saves the Batman from being impaled on a fence. Barry's injuries are healing rapidly due to his speed-enhanced regeneration. He also makes a new copy of his Flash costume. The Flash researches the incarnations of heroes of the DC timeline, believing that Zoom deliberately changed their lives to prevent the Flash from creating a Justice League, and learns of a rocket that crashed into Metropolis which carried the infant Superman, who instead of being raised in Kansas was taken in by the government. They then contact [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] for his help in sneaking into the government bunker of \"Project: Superman\" that is 'raising' Superman after his rocket destroyed Metropolis upon its arrival, only to be disappointed at Superman's frail appearance. They head towards Project: Superman's underground base via the sewer. The group comes across a giant vault door bearing the Superman logo. After they open the door, the three see a pale, weakened Kal-El. Despite his appearance, Barry says that no matter what, Superman will always be a good person. When the arrival of guards forces them to escape, Superman's powers begin to manifest and he flies off leaving them at the hands of the guards.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #3 (July 2011)</ref>\n\nWhile they fend off the guards, they are rescued by Element Woman. Barry's memories begin to change much more drastically, altering his past. He states that he is running out of time and soon he will not be able to restore the timeline to normal. After Barry is recovering, he asks the heroes to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war from creating more casualties, although the heroes are not willing to unless Batman wants to join them. Cyborg explains to him that they believe Batman was invincible. However, Barry convinces him that no one is invincible; the [[Marvel Family]] and Batman agree to join him. The heroes arrive at New Themyscira to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, and appear to be winning until [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] reveals herself as the Amazon spy and uses her magic to separate the Marvel Family and restore them to their mortal forms. Penthesilea kills Billy Batson just as Professor Zoom reveals himself to Barry.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)</ref> Professor Zoom reveals to him that the \"Flashpoint\" timeline was actually created by Barry himself, after he traveled back in time to stop Zoom from killing his mother, but the timeline diverted into the near-apocalyptic world they find themselves in. He continues to taunt Barry with this knowledge, but is suddenly stabbed in the back by Batman wielding an Amazonian sword. Before Barry returns the timeline to normal, Batman thanks him for all he's done and gives him a letter addressed to his son. After this, Barry bids a farewell to his mother, knowing he must travel back in time to stop his younger self from altering time. Through the fusions of the time stream, Barry seemingly hears [[Pandora (DC Comics)|a voice]] explaining that the three timelines and worlds, need to become one again and would need his help to do this. After the ordeals, he visits the real Bruce Wayne and gives him the letter from his alternate father. Bruce is grateful to Barry of informing him of the events of the \"Flashpoint\" before the timeline was apparently returned to normal.<ref name=\"fp5\">''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nDC Comics relaunched ''The Flash'' with issue #1 in September 2011, with writing and art chores handled by [[Francis Manapul]] and Brian Buccellato as part of DC's company-wide title relaunch, [[The New 52]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32768 |title=DC Comics Solicitations for September, 2011 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 13, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928144827/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32768 |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speedforce.org/2011/06/flash-reboot/ |title=Flash Reboot Creative Team: Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato |publisher=SpeedForceOrg |date=June 2, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817004046/http://speedforce.org/2011/06/flash-reboot/ |archivedate=August 17, 2013 }}</ref> As with all of the books associated with the DC relaunch, Barry Allen appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. He gains his powers after getting frustrated and throwing a small machine at the window of his lab. The machine broke through the window, leaving a hole big enough for a bolt of lightning to charge through the hole and strike him.\n\nIn the second issue of the new ''[[Justice League]]'' title (the first released comic series of the New 52 initiative and \"opening shot\" of the new DC Universe), Flash is called to assist [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and [[Batman]] in wrangling an out-of-control [[Superman]], and later assists with the pursuit of an alien, revealed to be an agent of [[Darkseid]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff| penciller= [[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]| inker= Williams, Scott| story= Justice League Part Two| title= Justice League| volume= 2| issue= 2| date= December 2011}}</ref> In this new continuity, Barry's marriage to Iris West never took place, and he is instead in a relationship with longtime co-worker [[Patty Spivot]]. In this new series, the Flash draws deeper into the Speed Force, enhancing his mental abilities while still trying to get a full grasp on his powers, which he does not yet exert total control over.\n\nAs revealed in issue #0 of the current series, Barry Allen's father was placed in prison for the murder of his mother. The murder occurred shortly after Barry returned victorious from a school spelling bee, and Barry placed the trophy he won on his mother's grave in her memory. While the evidence seems to indicate his father's guilt, Barry makes proving his father's innocence a priority.\n\nBarry is also part of the main cast of the relaunched ''Justice League'' series, making his debut in the series' second issue. Following Convergence, Barry has a new suit in issue #41, which has a darker shade and features more streaks.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\nDuring [[DC Rebirth]], Barry is no longer the only Flash. It is revealed that [[Wally West]] has been lost in the Speed Force for ten years, realizing during this time that Barry is not responsible of changing the timeline after the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crisis, the [[Doctor Manhattan|unknown entity]] used Barry's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth, but each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional \"lightning rod\") could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Because of Wally, Barry is now aware that the timeline is not reset correctly after Flashpoint and thus another alternate timeline. However, he still cannot remember his pre-Flashpoint life, such as people like Jay Garrick, his long-last marriage with Iris and the details of his feuds with the Reverse-Flash / Eobard Thawne (who now remembers their pre-Flashpoint history), and remembers Wally from their new DC Rebirth timeline history. Despite being informed by Wally that another party is responsible, Barry remains in guilt over his mistakes, and seeks to find and stop them in hopes of making amends.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016)</ref> Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than 'Kid Flash'. While Wally considers his options, Barry visits Batman to discuss the new evidence of some outside force attacking them, musing on how personal this assault appears, but despite the potential danger, Batman and Barry agree to keep their investigation to themselves until they know what they are up against.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' one-shot (June 2016)</ref> Later, when Eobard Thawne attacks Iris and [[Wallace West (DC comics)|Wallace]], Iris had glimpses of her pre-Flashpoint life with Barry and learns his secrets as the Flash in the process. Barry then learned of their marriage in the other timeline as well.  Knowing from Thawne that her entire life has been drastically altered and that Barry is indirectly responsible for it as the result of his time-traveling actions, Iris now distrusts Barry.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 5 #24 (August 2017)</ref> To make matters worse for Barry, while he's entering the Negative Speed Force, he becomes the Negative-Flash which is more lethal than the original, and mostly dangerous to control.\n\nAfter gotten rid of the Negative Speed Force, he investigates with the death of Turbine, but thanks to Godspeed's help, he discovers that Captain Cold was the one who killed him because he seeks redemption. He visits Wally after defeating the Top, he discusses about him telling Iris that he's alive and existed. While he's rekindling his relationship with Iris, the city is being attacked by Gorilla Grodd and his organization the Black Hole.\n\nAfter defeating Grodd and getting Wally to meet Iris for the first time, they've been encountered by the Renegades. The Renegades take the Flashes and Iris back to the 25th century to get answers about why Iris killed Eobard Thawne, only to discover that Hunter Zolomon has been manipulating everyone as a plot to bring conflict between Barry and Wally for the fate of the Speed Force. After Wally defeated Hunter, Barry place him under watch at the Sanctuary while he's moving with his girlfriend Iris at her place after Wallace angrily left them. Barry begins searching for the other forces such as Sage Force and Strength Force after the Force Barrier's broken; he ends up discovering about the four forces conflicting for the control of the Forever Force.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBarry Allen has the ability to run at super-human velocities. He was at times during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] described as faster than the [[Action potential|speed of thought]].  ''Flash'' #150, \"straining every muscle\", he ran at ten times the speed of light.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Fox, Gardner|Title = Flash|Volume = 1|Issue = 150|Date = February 1965|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> However, when he pushed himself further (during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'') he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure energy, traveled back in time, and was revealed in ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Fleming, Robert Loren|Title = Secret Origins Annual|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = December 1988|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> This was later [[retcon]]ned in ''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1, where Barry stated that he \"ran into the [[Speed Force]]\", and that, \"When he stopped the [[Anti-Monitor]], when [he] ran into the \"Speed Force\" and joined it, it was like shedding [his] identity.\"<ref name=\"TFR1\" /> Allen possesses abilities that original Flash [[Jay Garrick]] has not always been able to duplicate, and most notably the ability to \"vibrate\" in such a way as to pass through solid matter. Allen regularly engaged in [[time travel]] by using his Cosmic Treadmill device. His speed also allows him, in certain circumstances, to \"vibrate\" between [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimensions]]. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Final Crisis]]'', using the Speed Force, Allen was able to undo the effects of the [[Anti-Life Equation]] upon an individual: an ability he used on his wife Iris to free her from the bondage of [[Darkseid]]'s mind control.<ref name=\"FinalCrisis4\" />\n\nBarry's speed has numerous secondary applications. He can use it to generate cyclones by spinning his arms quickly. Barry can also manipulate the electrical Speed Force energy he generates. He can channel the energy into arcs of lightning, as well as use the electricity to manipulate magnetism on a minor level. He has also used the lightning to create blinding amounts of light. By interlocking his lightning with that of another speedster, Barry can short circuit their connection to the Speed Force. Barry is also immune to telepathic attacks and control as he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Through \"speed-reading\", he can absorb large amounts of information into his [[short-term memory]], which remain in his mind just long enough for him to make use of it. Using this technique, Barry was able to learn enough about building work to rebuild a destroyed apartment building.<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 3) #2 (May 2010)</ref> The Speed Force also supplies Barry with a protective aura that shields him from friction and kinetic impacts, as well as grants him superhuman durability. Other aspects of Barry's powers include an enhanced metabolism, which grants him a regenerative healing factor. In the New 52, Barry learned that his body is using the Speed Force to its full extent but his brain was not. With the help of Dr. Elias he was able to learn how to use the Speed Force to process more information, and make even quicker decisions, to the point where he feels like he can see everything before it happens.<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 4) #2 (December 2011)</ref> Barry also developed the ability to speed up the flow of time around him, which he used to negate the powers of Zoom, who was able to slow down time. In terms of DC's internal lexicon, Barry is classified as a [[metahuman]]: a human being who possesses extranormal abilities either through birth or (as in Barry's case) as the result of some external event.<ref>''Superman'' #7 (2012)</ref><ref>''Voodoo'' #7 (2012)</ref>\n\n==Rogues gallery==\n{{Main|Rogues (comics)}}\nThe Flash has acquired a colorful rogues gallery of villains. Their number includes (but is not limited to) several who formed a loose association and refer to themselves as the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], disdaining the use of the term \"[[supervillain]]\" or \"super-criminal\". These criminals typically have unusually modest goals for their power level (robbery or other petty crimes), and each have adopted a specific theme in his or her equipment and methods.\n\n==Other versions==\n* Barry Allen is a supporting character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''. He has been kept by [[Lex Luthor]] as a power source for most of the East Coast, constantly running on a treadmill to provide cheap electrical power or else Iris will be executed. After being rescued, Barry wears a black version of his original Flash costume which Batman's young assistants deemed as \"old\"\u2014\"Kids, these days, can't tell the difference between just plain old and classic\", he mutters. He then aids [[Batman]] and other heroes in restoring order, though they clash when Barry wants to save people in danger while Batman is prepared to let them die for the sake of his long-term strategy.\n* Barry Allen appears in ''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'' as a scientist working with [[Superman]] and a consortium of early twentieth-century scientists such as [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. His uniform incorporates the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] look with the [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]-style helmet worn by Jay Garrick.\n* In ''League of Justice'', a ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]''-type story, Barry is recast as \"Phaeton\", who wears a mystical brooch resembling Flash's lightning-bolt chest emblem, and has bathed in dragon's blood in order to protect himself from speed friction.\n* In ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'', Barry is one of a number of [[metahuman]]s imprisoned by a [[theocracy|theocratic]] state, discovered and released by Batman during a raid on the government. He then shows Batman some of the attempts to recreate his powers in others, ranging from a man who cannot control his ability to vibrate to a woman whose brain operates at lightspeed while her body is still at normal speed or a man rapidly aging to death. While Barry and Batman are able to defeat the brainwashed [[Zatanna]], Barry is then killed when his captor reveals that his research has included discovering how to deactivate the aura that protects Barry from being destroyed by the friction he generates while running.\n* A version of Barry Allen aka '''Hot Pursuit''' appeared in the lead into [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]].<ref name=\"tf12\">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #6 (January 2011)</ref> Little is known about the exact origins of Hot Pursuit, or how he came to be. The only thing known is the fact that he is a version of Barry Allen from the future, who goes back in time to warn himself about the upcoming events of Flashpoint. Hot Pursuit's history is assumed to be the same as Barry Allen's up until the single point in time, where a great anomaly altered the reality of the future all together. The unknown event that made Barry Allen don the role of Hot Pursuit is the same event he travels back in time to warn himself about, as well as the event that causes Flashpoint. With Flashpoint's widespread time-altering effects, it is possible that Barry Allen lost his connection to the Speed Force, thus needing the cosmic motorcycle Hot Pursuit is seen riding to access the Speed Force and travel back in time. This motorcycle also needs to be charged constantly with mass amounts of electricity in order for it to continue to be able to access the Speed Force, thus it is unable to naturally access the Speed Force like Barry Allen or the rest of the Flash Family.<ref name=autogenerated2>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #12 (May 2011)</ref>\n[[Image:Quasar1.png|thumb|upright|\"'''Buried Alien'''\"]]\n* A story in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book series ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'', written four years after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has the [[Marvel Universe]] speedsters facing off in a competition set up by a being called the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]]. The contest is a race from the Earth to the Moon. During the race, a surge of energy hits the track, leaving a being with blonde hair and dressed in the remains of a red outfit with yellow boots. This being has no memory, but an enormous desire to run. He goes on to win the race, passing Marvel speedsters such as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] in the process. When asked what his name is, the man replies, \"I'm not sure. \"Buried Alien\"... Something like that.\" When asked how it felt to be the fastest man alive, he replied, \"It feels... right.\"<ref>Quasar #17, December 199</ref> The racer goes on to take the name Fast-Forward, disappearing into the universe in an attempt to help [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], who is stuck at hyper speed.<ref>Quasar #58, May 1994</ref>\n* In the Elseworlds tale ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', Barry's life is still the same, but heroes age in real time. This reality shows no sign of the Crisis ever happening, so an elderly Barry is seen to be alive and well in 2008.\n* The Elseworlds story ''Flashpoint'' shows an alternate reality where Barry Allen becomes the Flash in 1956, the year he first appeared in comics. He is more involved in government affairs. By 1963, he has ended the [[Cold War]] and pushed the [[communism|communists]] out of [[Vietnam]]. However, his career is cut short as he takes a bullet aimed at [[John F. Kennedy]]. He is paralyzed from the neck down, but he still has the fastest mind on Earth and forms Allen Industries. By 1988, he and [[Vandal Savage|Vandal Savage's]] Immortality, Inc. have begun an exploration of [[Mars]]. In 1998, Wally West leads an expedition to Mars, during which he finds the flashpoint, an object which killed all life on Mars. Savage reveals he is the one who shot Allen. Barry makes contact with [[Wally West|Wally]], who is going on a super speed rampage. Barry is cured and defeats Savage. He then enters the flashpoint, going into the [[Speed Force]].\n* In ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]] Annual'' #7, an alternate universe is shown where shortly after Wally West became Kid Flash, he became a superstar celebrity. However, Barry was tragically killed while battling [[Captain Cold]]. Ten years later, Wally is now a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] and Captain Cold has written a supposedly \"true\" story about Barry that paints him as arrogant and incompetent. Wally decides to make a movie about his mentor that portrays the genuine Barry Allen. The resulting film is a success.\n* The Barry Allen of [[Earth-51]], where [[secret identity|secret identities]] are no longer needed by superheroes, is seen alive. He is subsequently killed by the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]] of New Earth.\n* In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' a version of Barry Allen is a member of a Justice League where Superman did not become a hero and join the team until much later. In lieu of Superboy's adventures with the Legion of Super-Heroes, the Flash visited the 30th Century instead. Barry Allen of ''The Nail'' is almost identical to the pre-Crisis Earth-1 version, except that his costume resembles Wally's. His most prominent scene in the story is a confrontation with [[Amazo]] where he manages to defeat the android by turning intangible and removing his computerized brain before Amazo can process and mimic that attack.\n* In the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' Barry joins Superman's Regime in a more forceful approach to saving the world from crime. However, Barry remains one of the few (alongside Shazam) to maintain some sense of morality, as he is more prone to questioning some of Superman's more drastic actions in the Year One series. Though Batman tries to convince Barry of the Regime's negative influence, he chooses to stay with them, though still tries to convince Superman his more drastic actions will not go down well. In the game, Barry finally defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam for questioning his ethics. He joins the Insurgency and plays a critical role in stopping Superman's dictatorship. While he and the other Regime members are arrested, he is pardoned thanks to Batman vouching for him and given a job at Luthor/Wayne climate research. His superior, Doctor Randall, convinces Barry to become the Flash again to aid the heroes in stopping [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s invasion.\n* A version of Barry Allen is present through ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]''. This version hails from Earth-Minus-52 of the Dark Multiverse, where Batman became mad due to the deaths of his crimefighting sidekicks. Batman manages to absorb Barry's body, taking the Speed Force for himself and calling himself \"'''Red Death'''\"; however Barry's mind remains present in Bruce's body, pleading Bruce to stop his dark crusade. When Red Death is hit by the positive energy, Bruce dies, leaving Barry alive and in control of his body, with the costume changing its color from red to gold. Barry tries his best to help his counterpart from Earth-0. However, because Barry from Earth-Minus-52 is a \"creature of darkness\", the exposure to the positive energy starts to rip him apart, killing him almost instantly.\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Flash in other media}}\n\n===Film===\n====DC Extended Universe====\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\n[[File:EzraFlash.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ezra Miller]] as Barry Allen/The Flash in 2017 film, ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.]]\n[[Ezra Miller]] portrays Barry Allen/The Flash in the DCEU.

It is stated that his father is in prison for killing his mother despite the nine-year-old Barry's insistence that his father was innocent. When Bruce contacts Barry and offers him membership of the team, Barry accepts, a conversation with his father forcing Barry to face the idea that he needs friends, but finding it hard to interact with other people because of his speed.

In the alternate reality, Flash is one of the heroes serving in [[Superman]]'s Regime, although he has doubts about Superman's true intentions. After Superman kills [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] when the latter questions his plan to destroy Metropolis and Gotham City to show humanity that he is 'needed', the Flash realizes that the heroes have officially gone too far and defects to [[Batman]]'s Insurgency. After the original Superman deposes the Regime, Barry surrenders himself due to his previous alliance with the Regime, but is assured by [[Green Arrow]] that his help in their defeat will be mentioned at the Regime's trial. In Flash's ending, he defeats Superman but is still overcome with guilt for his actions with the Regime and goes into exile. To make amends, he retakes his superhero mantle and begins fighting crime relentlessly in Central City where he is referred to as \"The Ghost\".\n* He returns as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', now with [[Taliesin Jaffe]] reprising his role from ''MK vs DC''. In the story, Flash has been pardoned from prison in recognition of his aid in deposing Superman's regime, and now seeks to make amends for his time as a regime member. In his playable chapter, Flash single-handedly defends Metropolis from Brainiac's initial attack and briefly comes to blows with Hal Jordan, who is trying to atone for his misdeeds as a Regime partisan, much like Flash himself. The two put their differences aside and join Batman's Insurgency. After Brainiac is defeated, he sides with Batman on allowing Brainiac to live so the captured and lost cities could be restored. Flash attempts to stop an enraged Superman but is easily defeated.

He was one of the first leaders in the world who had openly supported the cause of [[net-neutrality]] and as a Minister in charge of digital affairs in India declined Facebook the permission to operate Free Basics in India. He is also known to have taken a tough stand against misuse of social media for destabilising democracy and fomenting violence in society. Led by Ravi Shankar Prasad, [[Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology]] sent legal notices to both Facebook and [[Cambridge Analytica]]. Unsatisfied with their responses, he ordered the criminal investigation in this data theft episode by India's apex crime investigation body, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]. When incidents of mob violence were reported in a few parts of India by viral circulation of fake messages on Whatsapp, he took a firm stand against Whatsapp and demanded technological solutions to curb the problem of fake messages leading to violence. While responding to a debate in the [[Indian Parliament]] he openly supported the role of social media in giving a means of expression to ordinary people that they are happily using to question the politicians and media editors, he warned the social media platforms against any misuse of the platform for encouraging violence and terror. Responding to the legal notice served by [[Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology]], Whatsapp took several steps such as mentioning the word forwarded on every message that was forwarded by a user. Whatsapp has also restricted the number of forwarded messages to a maximum of five. Besides these stern regulatory measures that were taken under the leadership of Ravi Shankar Prasad, he is also known for promoting digital development in the rural areas of India by creating a network of 300,000 village level digital entrepreneurs who are operating digital service delivery kiosks known as the [[Common Service Centers]] across India. This has not only ensured the availability of digital services in rural areas but has also created job opportunities for 1.2 million rural youth.<ref>apolitical [https://apolitical.co/lists/digital-government-world100 \"World\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in Digital Government\"],  Retrieved on 9 August 2018.</ref><ref>net-neutrality [https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/net-neutrality-ravi-shankar-prasad-says-right-of-internet-access-is-non-negotiable/story-3HATMUGp5Qg4S0xq2sBagJ.html \"Net neutrality: Ravi Shankar Prasad says right of internet access is \u2018non-negotiable\u2019\"], Retrieved on 23 November 2017.</ref><ref>cambridgeanalytica [https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/cbi-to-probe-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-case-says-ravi-shankar-prasad-118072601139_1.html \"CBI to probe Cambridge Analytica data breach case, says Ravi Shankar Prasad \"],  Retrieved on 26 July 2018.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.archive.india.gov.in/govt/rajyasabhampbiodata.php?mpcode=214 Profile on Rajya Sabha's website]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Offices and distinctions\n|list1= \n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|in-lwr}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Shatrughan Sinha]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of Parliament<br>for [[Patna Sahib (Lok Sabha constituency)|Patna Sahib]] |years=2019 \u2013 Present}}\n{{s-aft|after=Incumbent}}\n{{s-break}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Sushma Swaraj]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Minister of Information and Broadcasting]]|years=29 January 2003 - 13 May 2004<br> <i>As Minister of State (Independent Charge)}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Jaipal Reddy]]}}\n{{s-break}}\n{{s-bef|rows=2|before=[[Kapil Sibal]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Minister of Law and Justice]]|years=26 May 2014 \u2013 9 November 2014}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[D.

While responding to a debate in the [[Indian Parliament]] he openly supported the role of social media in giving a means of expression to ordinary people that they are happily using to question the politicians and media editors, he warned the social media platforms against any misuse of the platform for encouraging violence and terror. Responding to the legal notice served by [[Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology]], Whatsapp took several steps such as mentioning the word forwarded on every message that was forwarded by an user. Whatsapp has also restricted the number of forwarded messages to a maximum of five. Besides these stern regulatory measures that were taken under the leadership of Ravi Shankar Prasad, he is also known for promoting digital development in the rural areas of India by creating a network of 300,000 village level digital entrepreneurs who are operating digital service delivery kiosks known as the [[Common Service Centers]] across India. This has not only ensured the availability of digital services in rural areas but has also created job opportunities for 1.2 million rural youth.<ref>apolitical [https://apolitical.co/lists/digital-government-world100 \"World\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in Digital Government\"],  Retrieved on 9 August 2018.</ref><ref>net-neutrality [https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/net-neutrality-ravi-shankar-prasad-says-right-of-internet-access-is-non-negotiable/story-3HATMUGp5Qg4S0xq2sBagJ.html \"Net neutrality: Ravi Shankar Prasad says right of internet access is \u2018non-negotiable\u2019\"], Retrieved on 23 November 2017.</ref><ref>cambridgeanalytica [https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/cbi-to-probe-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-case-says-ravi-shankar-prasad-118072601139_1.html \"CBI to probe Cambridge Analytica data breach case, says Ravi Shankar Prasad \"],  Retrieved on 26 July 2018.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.archive.india.gov.in/govt/rajyasabhampbiodata.php?mpcode=214 Profile on Rajya Sabha's website]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Offices and distinctions\n|list1= \n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|in-lwr}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Shatrughan Sinha]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of Parliament<br>for [[Patna Sahib (Lok Sabha constituency)|Patna Sahib]] |years=2019 \u2013 Present}}\n{{s-aft|after=Incumbent}}\n{{s-break}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Sushma Swaraj]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Minister of Information and Broadcasting]]|years=29 January 2003 - 13 May 2004<br> <i>As Minister of State (Independent Charge)}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Jaipal Reddy]]}}\n{{s-break}}\n{{s-bef|rows=2|before=[[Kapil Sibal]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Minister of Law and Justice]]|years=26 May 2014 \u2013 9 November 2014}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[D.

{"title_page": "List of films and television shows set in Miami", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe city of [[Miami]], Florida in the United States is a popular location for the filming and setting of movies and television shows, both fictional and non-fictional. The following article provides a '''list of films and television shows which have been partially or wholly set in or shot in Miami'''. The listed shows span a wide variety of genres and range from shows almost entirely shot and set in the city (e.g., ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Miami Vice]]'') to those containing only a small number of scenes shot or set in Miami (e.g., ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965)).\n[[File:Burn Notice Explosion.JPG|thumb|300px|''[[Burn Notice]]'' explosion On Set]]\n\n==Context==\nBecause of its climate and the high sunshine amounts, Florida has long been a favoured location for filmmakers, and the early [[silent film]] industry in the state rivaled [[Hollywood]]'s in production.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Film in Florida is still a major industry in the state, with Florida ranking third in the U.S. for film production (after California and New York, respectively) based on revenue generated (according to 2006 Florida Film Commission Data{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}). In particular, Miami has long been a popular filming location in Florida and continues to grow as the entertainment industry expands throughout the state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nWorldwide, [[Miami]] is one of the largest production and distribution centers for [[commercial advertising]], [[Film industry|film]], [[Music industry|music]], [[new media]], [[Photography|still photography]], and [[Television industry|television]] industries. The industry's{{which|date=February 2016}} combined economic impact in the local economy is about two billion dollars annually, with $100 to $150 million coming from more than 1,000 location filming shoots each year.{{when|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} There are approximately 3,000 companies working in film and [[Entertainment industry|entertainment]] in [[Miami-Dade County]], employing an estimated 15,000 workers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Spanish-language productions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\nMiami's large [[Hispanic]] population and close proximity to Latin America have made Miami a center for Latin television and film production. As a result, many Spanish-language programs are filmed in Miami's numerous television production studios, predominantly in [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]] and [[Doral, Florida|Doral]]. These include game shows, news programs, reality shows, [[telenovelas]], and variety shows.\n\n==Films set in or shot in Miami==\n===English-language films set in or shot in Miami===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:225px;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\" | Release Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:500px;\"| Notes\n|-\n| ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]''\n| 2003\n|Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[2 Lava 2 Lantula!]]''\n| 2016\n|Set in [[Miami]], [[Fort Lauderdale]], and other parts of [[South Florida]]\n|-\n| ''[[8th & Ocean]]''\n| 2006\n|\n|-\n| ''[[A+ (film)|A+]]''\n| 2013\n| Filmed throughout Florida\n|-\n| ''[[Absence of Malice]]''\n| 1981\n| Set and shot in Miami and [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], including inside the since-demolished [[Miami Herald#Headquarters|Miami Herald]] building on Biscayne Bay\n|-\n|''[[Absolute Zero (film)|Absolute Zero]]''\n| 2006\n|\n|-\n|''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''\n| 1994\n|Set in Miami\n|-\n|''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]''\n| 2003\n|\n|-\n|''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]''\n| 2001\n|\n|-\n|''[[All About the Benjamins]]''\n| 2002\n|Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[Any Given Sunday]]''\n| 1999\n|Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]''\n| 2006\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]''\n| 1995\n| Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[Bad Boys II]]''\n| 2003\n| Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[Bad Boys for Life]]''\n| 2020\n| Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[Band of the Hand]]''\n| 1986\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]''\n| 2017\n| Set and shot in South Beach.\n|-\n| ''[[The Bellboy]]''\n| 1960\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Big Trouble (2002 film)|Big Trouble]]''\n| 2002\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Birdcage]]''\n| 1996\n|Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]]''\n| 1977\n| Adaptation of the novel by [[Thomas Harris]]\n|-\n| ''[[Blood and Wine]]''\n| 1996\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]''\n| 2001\n|Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[Body Heat]]''\n| 1981\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]''\n|1992\n|Set in Miami\n|-\n|''[[Brown Sub, Miami]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Caddyshack]]''\n| 1980\n| Boating scene filmed in [[Biscayne Bay]]; balance of filming done in [[Broward County]]\n|-\n| ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''\n| 2006\n| [[James Bond]] film, set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[The Champ (1979 film)|The Champ]]''\n|1979\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Cocaine Cowboys]]''\n|2006\n|Set in Miami\n|-\n| ''[[Confessions of a Shopaholic (film)|Confessions of a Shopaholic]]''\n| 2008\n|\n|-\n|''[[Crash (1978 film)|Crash]]''\n|1978\n| Also known as ''The Crash of Flight 401''\n|-\n| ''[[Crime Busters x 2|Crime Busters]]''\n|1977\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Day of the Dolphin|The Day of the dolphin]]''\n| 1973\n| Early scene with George C.

The following article provides a '''list of films and television shows which have been partially or wholly set in or shot in Miami'''. The listed shows span a wide variety of genres and range from shows almost entirely shot and set in the city (e.g., ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Miami Vice]]'') to those containing only a small number of scenes shot or set in Miami (e.g., ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965)).\n[[File:Burn Notice Explosion.JPG|thumb|300px|''[[Burn Notice]]'' explosion On Set]]\n\n==Context==\nBecause of its climate and the high sunshine amounts, Florida has long been a favoured location for filmmakers, and the early [[silent film]] industry in the state rivaled [[Hollywood]]'s in production.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Film in Florida is still a major industry in the state, with Florida ranking third in the U.S. for film production (after California and New York, respectively) based on revenue generated (according to 2006 Florida Film Commission Data{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}). In particular, Miami has long been a popular filming location in Florida and continues to grow as the entertainment industry expands throughout the state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nWorldwide, [[Miami]] is one of the largest production and distribution centers for [[commercial advertising]], [[Film industry|film]], [[Music industry|music]], [[new media]], [[Photography|still photography]], and [[Television industry|television]] industries.

Founded in 1985 by Elliot Grassiano, it attained early success with games published through [[Loriciel]] in France and other partners (including [[Activision]] and [[Broderbund]]) in international markets. Through expanding its staff and development teams, Micro\u00efds generated funds to expand from just development to [[Video game publishing|publishing]] and [[Wholesaling|distribution]] and opening international offices. The company merged with MC2 in 2003 to create MC2-Micro\u00efds, whereafter it acquired publishers Wanadoo Edition and [[Cryo Interactive]]. Grassiano left MC2-Micro\u00efds in 2005; under new management, MC2-Micro\u00efds was briefly renamed MC2 before returning to the old Micro\u00efds name. It was then acquired by Anuman Interactive in 2010, which itself was renamed Micro\u00efds (then simplified to Microids) in 2019.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background and early years (1985\u20132003) ===\nMicro\u00efds was founded by Elliot Grassiano, a French [[Video game programmer|programmer]]. He was educated at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand]] school from 1972 to 1974 and later studied engineering, electronics, and computers at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'arts et m\u00e9tiers]]. He started working as an engineer for the defence system company [[SAGEM]] in 1979. By the 1980s, Grassiano had become interested in [[telecommunications]], [[consumer electronics]], and video games. He acquired a [[Thomson MO5]] model [[home computer]], which he used to create his first game, ''Space Shuttle Simulator''. The game was published by [[Loriciel]] and released to both critical and commercial success. Subsequently, Grassiano quit his job to establish his own company. he formally founded Micro\u00efds in 1985, setting it up in [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay]], a suburb of [[Paris]]. He was aided in these efforts by Loriciel's founders, Laurent Weill and Marc Bayle, as well as Patrick Le Nestour, another engineer. The name \"Micro\u00efds\" was a [[portmanteau]] of \"microinformatique\" and \"androids\". Within its first year of operation, the company grew to five people, with Grassiano in the managerial role.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\">{{cite magazine |title=From the Archives: Micro\u00efds |first=David |last=Crookes |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=154 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |date=21 April 2016 |pages=50\u201355}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Micro\u00efds set out to create consumer [[robotics]] projects before shifting its focus solely to video games. The first Micro\u00efds-developed game was ''Air Attack'', released by Loriciel for the Thomson MO5 to moderate commercial success. Early [[adventure game]]s developed by Micro\u00efds include ''Oceania'' (developed by Le Nestour and released in 1985 for the Thomson MO5 and [[Thomson TO7|TO7]]) and ''Les Pyramides D'Atlantys'' (developed by Luc Thibaud and released for the [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1986). ''Air Attack'' provided the groundwork for subsequent Micro\u00efds games, such as ''[[500 cc Grand Prix]]'' for the Amstrad CPC, which debuted in 1986. This game was the company's first breakthrough title, partially driven by the CPC's success in France. By way of a deal between Loriciel and [[Activision]], the game was also released in the UK, it was also released in the US, and it was later [[Porting|ported]] to other systems, such as the [[Atari ST]]. The American market appeared especially viable for Micro\u00efds, who believed that game sales would vastly outnumber the domestic ones. For this reason, it partnered with the American publisher [[Broderbund]] in 1987, which released several Micro\u00efds games in the country, partially under altered names. In return, Micro\u00efds managed sales of Broderbund's games, notably ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]'' in France.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" />\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Micro\u00efds underwent expansion, increasing both staff count and development team sizes. Development operations were accelerated to output more games, leading to increased profits. Through the new-earned funds, the company commenced operations in both [[video game publishing]] and [[Wholesaling|distribution]] in 1995, and between then and 1997 opened three international subsidiaries: Micro\u00efds Italia in [[Milan]], Micro\u00efds UK in [[Milton Keynes]], and Micro\u00efds Canada in [[Montreal]]. By 1997, Micro\u00efds had 20 employees and a turnover of 20&nbsp;million [[French franc]]s. Both increased tenfold by 2002, and the Canadian studio alone house 105 of Micro\u00efds' 200 employees by 2003.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" />\n\n=== Mergers (2003\u2013present) ===\nIn 2003, Micro\u00efds merged with MC2, a French software company, with the amalgam assuming the name MC2-Micro\u00efds.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" /> In September that year, it acquired Wanadoo Edition, the games division of [[Wanadoo]], which itself had been created through a September 2000 merger between Index+ and France Telecom Multimedia in exchange, Wanadoo received a 12% stake in MC2-Micro\u00efds.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://adventuregamers.com/news/view/19154 |title=Microids takes over Wanadoo's games division |first=Marek |last=Bronstring |date=2 October 2003 |website=[[Adventure Gamers]] |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022223812/https://adventuregamers.com/news/view/19154 |archive-date=22 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2004, MC2-Micro\u00efds proceeded to close Micro\u00efds UK, while Micro\u00efds Italia spun off as Blue Label Entertainment.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" /> Micro\u00efds Canada was sold off to [[Ubisoft]] in March 2005, with the studio's 50 employees integrated into Ubisoft's own [[Ubisoft Montreal]] studio.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news040305ubisoftmicroids |title=Ubisoft buys Microids Canada |author=GamesIndustry International |date=4 March 2005 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022223811/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news040305ubisoftmicroids |archive-date=22 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Later that year, Grassiano left MC2-Micro\u00efds due to internal disagreements.

Founded in 1985 by Elliot Grassiano, it attained early success with games published through [[Loriciel]] in France and other partners (including [[Activision]] and [[Broderbund]]) in international markets. Through expanding its staff and development teams, Micro\u00efds generated funds to expand from just development to [[Video game publishing|publishing]] and [[Wholesaling|distribution]] and opening international offices. The company merged with MC2 in 2003 to create MC2-Micro\u00efds, whereafter it acquired publishers Wanadoo Edition and [[Cryo Interactive]]. Grassiano left MC2-Micro\u00efds in 2005; under new management, MC2-Micro\u00efds was briefly renamed MC2 before returning to the old Micro\u00efds name. It was then acquired by Anuman Interactive in 2010, which itself was renamed Micro\u00efds (then simplified to Microids) in 2019.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background and early years (1985\u20132003) ===\nMicro\u00efds was founded by Elliot Grassiano, a French [[Video game programmer|programmer]]. He was educated at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand]] school from 1972 to 1974 and later studied engineering, electronics, and computers at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'arts et m\u00e9tiers]]. He started working as an engineer for the defence system company [[SAGEM]] in 1979. By the 1980s, Grassiano had become interested in [[telecommunications]], [[consumer electronics]], and video games. He acquired a [[Thomson MO5]] model [[home computer]], which he used to create his first game, ''Space Shuttle Simulator''. The game was published by [[Loriciel]] and released to both critical and commercial success. Subsequently, Grassiano quit his job to establish his own company. he formally founded Micro\u00efds in 1985, setting it up in [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay]], a suburb of [[Paris]]. He was aided in these efforts by Loriciel's founders, Laurent Weill and Marc Bayle, as well as Patrick Le Nestour, another engineer. The name \"Micro\u00efds\" was a [[portmanteau]] of \"microinformatique\" and \"androids\". Within its first year of operation, the company grew to five people, with Grassiano in the managerial role.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\">{{cite magazine |title=From the Archives: Micro\u00efds |first=David |last=Crookes |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=154 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |date=21 April 2016 |pages=50\u201355}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Micro\u00efds set out to create consumer [[robotics]] projects before shifting its focus solely to video games. The first Micro\u00efds-developed game was ''Air Attack'', released by Loriciel for the Thomson MO5 to moderate commercial success. Early [[adventure game]]s developed by Micro\u00efds include ''Oceania'' (developed by Le Nestour and released in 1985 for the Thomson MO5 and [[Thomson TO7|TO7]]) and ''Les Pyramides D'Atlantys'' (developed by Luc Thibaud and released for the [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1986). ''Air Attack'' provided the groundwork for subsequent Micro\u00efds games, such as ''[[500 cc Grand Prix]]'' for the Amstrad CPC, which debuted in 1986. This game was the company's first breakthrough title, partially driven by the CPC's success in France. By way of a deal between Loriciel and [[Activision]], the game was also released in the UK, it was also released in the US, and it was later [[Porting|ported]] to other systems, such as the [[Atari ST]]. The American market appeared especially viable for Micro\u00efds, who believed that game sales would vastly outnumber the domestic ones. For this reason, it partnered with the American publisher [[Broderbund]] in 1987, which released several Micro\u00efds games in the country, partially under altered names. In return, Micro\u00efds managed sales of Broderbund's games, notably ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]'' in France.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" />\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Micro\u00efds underwent expansion, increasing both staff count and development team sizes. Development operations were accelerated to output more games, leading to increased profits. Through the new-earned funds, the company commenced operations in both [[video game publishing]] and [[Wholesaling|distribution]] in 1995, and between then and 1997 opened three international subsidiaries: Micro\u00efds Italia in [[Milan]], Micro\u00efds UK in [[Milton Keynes]], and Micro\u00efds Canada in [[Montreal]]. By 1997, Micro\u00efds had 20 employees and a turnover of 20&nbsp;million [[French franc]]s. Both increased tenfold by 2002, and the Canadian studio alone house 105 of Micro\u00efds' 200 employees by 2003.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" />\n\n=== Mergers (2003\u2013present) ===\nIn 2003, Micro\u00efds merged with MC2, a French software company, with the amalgam assuming the name MC2-Micro\u00efds.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" /> In September that year, it acquired Wanadoo Edition, the games division of [[Wanadoo]], which itself had been created through a September 2000 merger between Index+ and France Telecom Multimedia in exchange, Wanadoo received a 12% stake in MC2-Micro\u00efds.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://adventuregamers.com/news/view/19154 |title=Microids takes over Wanadoo's games division |first=Marek |last=Bronstring |date=2 October 2003 |website=[[Adventure Gamers]] |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022223812/https://adventuregamers.com/news/view/19154 |archive-date=22 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2004, MC2-Micro\u00efds proceeded to close Micro\u00efds UK, while Micro\u00efds Italia spun off as Blue Label Entertainment.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" /> Micro\u00efds Canada was sold off to [[Ubisoft]] in March 2005, with the studio's 50 employees integrated into Ubisoft's own [[Ubisoft Montreal]] studio.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news040305ubisoftmicroids |title=Ubisoft buys Microids Canada |author=GamesIndustry International |date=4 March 2005 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022223811/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news040305ubisoftmicroids |archive-date=22 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Later that year, Grassiano left MC2-Micro\u00efds due to internal disagreements.
