The elections coincided with the elections of other offices, including the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2018|gubernatorial election]], as well as [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2018|other elections]] to the House of Representatives, [[United States Senate elections, 2018|elections]] to the [[United States Senate]] and various [[United States elections, 2018#State elections|state]] and [[United States elections, 2018#Local elections|local elections]].

Voters will elect the 36 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] from the state of [[Texas]], one from each of the state's 36 [[Texas Congressional Districts|congressional districts]]. The elections coincided with the elections of other offices, including the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2018|gubernatorial election]], as well as [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2018|other elections]] to the House of Representatives, [[United States Senate elections, 2018|elections]] to the [[United States Senate]] and various [[United States elections, 2018#State elections|state]] and [[United States elections, 2018#Local elections|local elections]]. The primaries were held on March 6 and the run-offs were held on May 22.\n\nIn 2018, for the first time in at least 25 years, the [[Texas Democratic Party]] fielded at least one candidate in each of the state's 36 congressional districts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Phillps|first1=Amber|title=The four most important races in Texas's Tuesday primaries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/06/your-cheat-sheet-for-how-to-sound-smart-about-tuesdays-texas-primaries/|accessdate=6 March 2018|publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 6, 2018}}</ref> The state congressional delegation changed from a 25\u201311 Republican majority to a 23\u201313 Republican majority, the most seats that Democrats have won in the state since [[2006 United States House of Representatives elections in Texas|2006]]. Democrats won almost 47% of the vote, likely as part of a [[down-ballot effect]] of Representative [[Beto O'Rourke]]'s [[2018 United States Senate election in Texas|Senate Candidacy]], in which he won 48.3% of the vote.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes|limit=2}}\n\n==Results summary==\n===Statewide===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2|Party

Most common types of DJs include [[Radio personality|radio DJs]], club DJs, who perform at a [[nightclub]] or [[music festival]] and [[turntablism|turntablists]] who use record players, usually [[turntable]]s, to manipulate sounds on [[phonograph record]]s. Originally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[vinyl records]], but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who [[DJ mix|mix]] music from other recording media such as [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]] or [[digital audio file]]s on a [[CDJ]] or a [[laptop]]. The title \"DJ\" is often used by DJs in front of their real names, adopted [[pseudonym]]s, or [[stage name]]s.\n\nDJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]] to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique [[DJ mix|mixes]] of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized [[DJ mixer]]s, small [[Audio console|audio mixers]] with [[crossfader]] and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in [[headphones]] and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a [[DJ controller]] device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\n==Role==\n[[File:Avicii @ Inox Park Paris Chatou 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Avicii]] at work in [[Paris]] in 2011]]\nOriginally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now \"DJ\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[vinyl records]], [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[CD]]s, or [[digital audio file]]s stored on [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] or [[laptop]]. DJs typically perform for a live audience in a [[nightclub]] or dance club or a TV, radio broadcast audience, or an [[online radio]] audience. DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In [[hip hop music]], DJs may create beats, using percussion [[Break (music)|break]]s, [[bassline]]s and other musical content [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from pre-existing records. In hip hop, rappers and MCs use these beats to [[rapping|rap]] over.\n\nDJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]]. This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together, either so two records can be played at the same time, or to enable the DJ to make a smooth transition from one song to another. An important tool for DJs is the specialized [[DJ mixer]], a small [[audio console|audio mixer]] with a [[crossfader]]  and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to \"listen\" to a source of recorded music in [[headphones]] before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play, [[cue (audio)|cue up]] the track to the desired starting location, and align the two tracks' beats in traditional situations where auto sync technology is not being used. This process ensures that the selected song will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects; and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nThe title \"DJ\" is also often used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s as a title to denote their profession (e.g., [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[DJ Qbert]], [[DJ Shadow]] and [[DJ Yoda]]). Some DJs focus on creating a good mix of songs for the club dancers or radio audience. Other DJs use [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]], in which the DJ or [[turntablism|turntablist]] manipulates the [[phonograph|record player turntable]] to create new rhythms and sounds. DJs need to have a mixture of artistic and technical skills for their profession, because they have to understand both the creative aspects of making new musical beats and tracks, and the technical aspects of using [[mixing console]]s, professional audio equipment, [[digital audio workstation]]s and other computerized music gear. In many types of DJing, including club DJing and radio/TV DJing, a DJ also has to have [[charisma]] and develop a good rapport with the audience. Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as [[techno]], [[house music|house]] or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] music. DJs typically have an extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Radio DJs===\n{{Main|Radio personality}}\n\nRadio DJs or [[radio personality|radio personalities]] introduce and play music broadcast on [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital radio|digital]] or [[Internet radio]] stations.\n\n===Club DJs===\n[[File:Pete Rock @ The Brookyln Bowl in 2016.jpg|thumbnail|right|\nDJ [[Pete Rock]] performing at Razel and Friends - Brooklyn Bowl, 2016]]\nClub DJs, commonly referred as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at [[Nightclub|music venues]] or [[bar]]s, [[music festival]]s, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs mix music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques in order to produce non-stopping flow of music. One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is [[beatmatching]]. A DJ who mostly plays and mixes one specific music genre is often given the title of that genre; for example, a DJ who plays hip hop music is called a hip hop DJ, a DJ who plays house music is a house DJ, a DJ who plays techno is called a techno DJ, and so on. The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main features: technical skills, or how well can DJ operate the equipment and produce smooth transitions between two or more recordings and a playlist; and the ability of a DJ to select most suitable recordings, also known as \"reading the crowd\".<ref>[https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2011/12/how-to-read-a-crowd-and-what-happens-if-you-dont/ How To Read A Crowd (And What Happens If You Don\u2019t)], ''Digital DJ Tips'', 3 November 2017</ref>\n\n===Turntablists===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n\nTurntablists, also called battle DJs, use [[Phonograph|turntables]] and [[DJ mixer]] to manipulate recorded sounds in order to produce new music.  In essence, they use DJ equipment as a musical instrument. The most known turntablist technique is [[scratching]]. Turntablists often participate in DJ contests like [[DMC World DJ Championships]] and Red Bull 3Style.<ref>[http://www.redbullthre3style.com/ Red Bull 3Style]</ref>\n\n=== Residents ===\nA resident DJ performs at a venue on a regular basis or permanently.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/resident-djs-are-the-unsung-heroes-of-clubbing-show-them-love|title=Resident DJs Are The Heroes Of Clubbing, And We Need To Show Them Love {{!}} Thump|last=Thorp|first=John|date=7 January 2014|newspaper=Thump|access-date=9 February 2017|publisher=Vice|work=|language=en-UK|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaldjinfo.com/what-is-resident-dj/|title=What Is \"Being A Resident DJ\" ? {{!}}|last=Celikbas|first=Murat|date=1 October 2013|newspaper=Digital DJ INFO|access-date=9 February 2017|work=|language=en-US|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/11/dos-donts-resident-dj/|title=The Do's and Don'ts of Being a Weekly Resident DJ|last=|first=|date=14 November 2013|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> They would perform regularly (typically under an agreement) in a particular discotheque, a particular club, a particular event, or a particular broadcasting station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djmag.com/content/darius-syrossian-best-resident-dj|title=DARIUS SYROSSIAN (BEST RESIDENT DJ)|website=DJMag.com|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/2013/04/resident-dj-mednas-dishes-miami-liv-ing/|title=Resident DJ Mednas Dishes On Miami LIV-ing|date=19 April 2013|newspaper=Vibe|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=66384&dir=2017/february/06|title=The Monitor :: Variety Of Talent At Next Big EDM DJ|last=Ncube|first=Dumisani|newspaper=The Monitor|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> Residents have a decisive influence on the club or a series of events.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.skiddle.com/news/all/mUmU-Liverpool-9th-birthday-review/30778/|title=mUmU Liverpool 9th birthday review|last=Frankland|first=Becca|date=7 February 2017|newspaper=Skiddle.com|access-date=9 February 2017|work=|language=en-gb|via=}}</ref> Per agreement with the management or company, the DJ would have to perform under agreed times and dates.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magneticmag.com/2016/03/how-to-become-resident-dj-at-local-nightclub/|title=How to Become the Resident Dj At Your Local Nightclub|last=Robinson|first=Tyler|date=9 March 2016|website=www.magneticmag.com|language=en-us|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> Typically, DJs perform as residents for two or three times in a week, for example, on Friday and Saturday.

Traditionally, DJs used two [[turntable]]s plugged into a [[DJ mixer]] to mix music on vinyl records. As [[compact disc]]s became popular media for publishing music, specialized high quality CD players known as [[CDJ]]s were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Secure Digital|SD cards]] in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], and [[smartphone]] computers, DJs began using software together with specialized [[sound card]]s and [[DJ controller]] hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.\n\n===Turntables===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n[[Turntable]]s allow DJs to play vinyl records. By adjusting the playback speed of the turntable, either by adjusting the speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the [[tempo]]s of different records so their rhythms can be played together at the same time without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as [[beatmatching]]. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a [[slipmat]] that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. [[Direct-drive turntable]]s are the type preferred by DJs, with the [[Technics SL-1200]] being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play [[hip hop]] music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for [[scratching]], [[beat juggling]], and other [[turntablism]] techniques.\n\n===CDJs===\n{{Main|CDJ}}\nCDJs are high quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and [[pitch control]]s to allow DJs to manipulate the playback of digital files for [[beatmatching]] similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from [[compact disc]]s, they now can play digital music files stored on [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD card]]s. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software to act as a [[DJ controller]].\n\n===DJ mixers===\n{{Main|DJ mixer}}\n[[File:DJ Mixer.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A [[Numark (DJ equipment)|Numark]] DM2002X Pro Master DJ mixer. This three channel mixer can have up to three input sound sources. The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] control knobs and [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] control knobs allow the volume and tone of each sound source to be adjusted. The vertical faders allow for further adjustment of the volume of each sound source. The horizontally-mounted [[crossfader (audio engineering)|crossfader]] enables the DJ to smoothly transition from a [[song]] on one sound source to a song from a different sound source.]]\nDJ mixers are small audio [[mixing console]]s specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer used by a [[record producer]] or [[audio engineer]]; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard [[recording studio]] mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have many of the same features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, [[effects unit]]s, etc.), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the [[crossfader]]. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a [[DJ controller]] instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.\n\n===Headphones===\n{{Main|Headphones}}\nDJs generally use higher quality headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate the sounds of the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen to one side of the headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.\n\nClosed-back headphones are highly recommended for DJs to block outside noise as the environment of DJ usually tend to be very noisy. Standard headphones have 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires \u00bc inch jack. Most of specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between 3.5mm jack and \u00bc inch jack. Detachable coiled cables are perfect for DJ Headphones.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.getaheadphone.com/the-5-best-dj-headphones-of-2016/|title = Best DJ Headphones| accessdate =27 October 2016|year=2016|author=GetAHeadphone}}</ref>\n\n===Software===\n{{See also|List of music software#DJ software}}\n[[File:Mixxx-1.11.0-Deere.png|thumb|left|A [[screenshot]] of [[Mixxx]] DJ software running on [[Mac OS X]]]]\n\nDJs have changed their equipment as new technologies are introduced. The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used [[phonograph|record turntable]]s, vinyl records and [[audio console]]s. In the 1970s, DJs would have to lug heavy direct drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to [[compact cassette]]s. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using [[digital audio]] such as [[CD]]s and [[MP3]] files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a [[laptop]] computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop as a source of music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most [[media player (software)|music player software]] designed for [[consumer electronics|regular consumers]], DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the [[waveform]]s of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.\n\nThe waveforms allow the DJ see what is coming next in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information can be used by the DJ to help manually [[beatmatch]] like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. [[Digital signal processing]] algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the [[tempo]] of recordings independently of their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (and musical [[key (music)|key]], a feature known as \"keylock\". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with [[ReplayGain]] and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply [[effects unit|effects]].\n\nAs [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became widespread, [https://thedjplanet.com/best-dj-software-and-how-each-one-operates-complete-guide/ DJ software] was written to run on these devices in addition to laptops.\nDJ software requires specialized hardware in addition to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular [[sound card]] integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.\n\n===Timecode===\nSpecial vinyl records (or CDs/digital files played with [[CDJ]]s) can be used with DJ software to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing [[turntablism]] techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as \"timecode\", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing in the same way that the turntable manipulates the timecode record.\n\nThis requires a specialized DJ [[sound card]] with at least 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware [[DJ mixer]]. Some DJ mixers have integrated [[USB]] sound cards that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate sound card.\n\n===DJ controllers===\n{{Main|DJ controller}}\nDJ software can be used to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a [[DJ controller]] device that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the [[computer keyboard]] & [[touchpad]] on a laptop, or the [[touchscreen]] on a [[tablet computer]] or [[smartphone]]. Many DJ controllers have an integrated [[sound card]] with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allows the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.<ref>{{Cite book|title=DJing for dummies|last=Steventon, John, 1975-|isbn=9781118937280|edition= 3rd|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=888464041|date = 3 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Other equipment===\n* A [[microphone]], so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience over the sound system.\n* Electronic [[effects unit]]s such as [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[reverb]], [[octave]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], etc.\n* Multi-stylus head shells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.\n* [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], electronic musical keyboards ([[synthesizer]]s), or [[drum machine]]s.\n* [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]] ([[power amplifier]]s and [[speaker enclosure]]s), typically including [[subwoofer]] cabinets for deep bass (or, if a DJ is broadcasting and/or recording a set, broadcasting equipment or recording gear)\n*[[Foldback (sound engineering)|Monitor speaker]]s, for listening to the \"house mix\" that is playing over the main speakers\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore (right), inventor of vinyl record scratching technique.jpg|thumb|In the early 1970s in the South Bronx, a young teen DJ called [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]] invented the \"DJ scratch\" technique. Other DJs, like [[Grandmaster Flash]], took the technique to higher levels to the familiar sound and technique we hear today.]]\nSeveral techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the [[cueing (playback)|cueing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.\n\n{{Side box|above='''DJ Techniques'''\n|text=\n[[Back spinning]]\n*[[Beat juggling]]\n*[[Beatmatching]]\n*[[Chopping (sampling technique)|Chopping]] and [[Chopped and screwed|screwing]]\n*[[Harmonic mixing]]\n*[[Loop (music)|Looping]]\n*[[Needle drop (DJing)|Needle dropping]]\n*[[Phrasing (DJ)|Phrasing]]\n*[[Scratching]]\n*[[Slip-cueing]]}}\nClub DJ turntable techniques include [[beatmatching]], [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[slip-cueing]] to preserve energy on a dance floor.

Examples include [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[beatmatching]], which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic [[synchronization]] of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \"sync\". Most [[DJ mixer]]s now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in [[beats per minute]] (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.\n\nIn the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815205546/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |archivedate=15 August 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===Miming===\nIn DJ culture, [[Miming in instrumental performance|miming]] refers to the practice of DJ's pantomiming the actions of live-mixing a set on stage while a pre-recorded mix plays over the sound system.<ref name=\"Fonarow2006\">Wendy Fonarow.

[[Hip hop]] DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]] and [[beat juggling]] rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.<ref name=\"wired\"/> Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.\n\nIn 1980, Japanese company [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] released the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]], an analog [[Drum machine|rhythm/drum machine]], which has unique artificial sounds, such as its booming [[Bass drum|bass]] and sharp [[Snare drum|snare]], and a [[metronome]]-like [[rhythm]].

In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. Final Scratch debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard Vinyl DJs\", this would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit\", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nIn 2001, [[Pioneer DJ]] began producing the [[CDJ#CDJ-1000|CDJ-1000]] [[CD player]], making the use of digital music recordings with traditional DJ techniques practical for the first time. As the 2000s progressed, [[laptop]] computers became more powerful and affordable. [[#Software|DJ software]], specialized DJ [[sound card]]s, and [[DJ controller]]s were developed for DJs to use laptops as a source of music rather than turntables or CDJs. In the 2010s, like laptops before them, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became more powerful & affordable. DJ software was written to run on these more portable devices instead of laptops, although laptops remain the more common type of computer for DJing.\n\n== Female DJs ==\nIn Western [[popular music]], [[Women in music|women musicians]] have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, however, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs.

Most common types of DJs include [[Radio personality|radio DJs]], club DJs, who perform at a [[nightclub]] or [[music festival]] and [[turntablism|turntablists]] who use record players, usually [[turntable]]s, to manipulate sounds on [[phonograph record]]s. Originally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[vinyl records]], but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who [[DJ mix|mix]] music from other recording media such as [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]] or [[digital audio file]]s on a [[CDJ]] or a [[laptop]]. The title \"DJ\" is often used by DJs in front of their real names, adopted [[pseudonym]]s, or [[stage name]]s.\n\nDJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]] to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique [[DJ mix|mixes]] of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized [[DJ mixer]]s, small [[Audio console|audio mixers]] with [[crossfader]] and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in [[headphones]] and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a [[DJ controller]] device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\n==Role==\n[[File:Avicii @ Inox Park Paris Chatou 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Avicii]] at work in [[Paris]] in 2011]]\nOriginally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now \"DJ\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[vinyl records]], [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[CD]]s, or [[digital audio file]]s stored on [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] or [[laptop]]. DJs typically perform for a live audience in a [[nightclub]] or dance club or a TV, radio broadcast audience, or an [[online radio]] audience. DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In [[hip hop music]], DJs may create beats, using percussion [[Break (music)|break]]s, [[bassline]]s and other musical content [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from pre-existing records. In hip hop, rappers and MCs use these beats to [[rapping|rap]] over.\n\nDJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]]. This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together, either so two records can be played at the same time, or to enable the DJ to make a smooth transition from one song to another. An important tool for DJs is the specialized [[DJ mixer]], a small [[audio console|audio mixer]] with a [[crossfader]]  and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to \"listen\" to a source of recorded music in [[headphones]] before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play, [[cue (audio)|cue up]] the track to the desired starting location, and align the two tracks' beats in traditional situations where auto sync technology is not being used. This process ensures that the selected song will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects; and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nThe title \"DJ\" is also often used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s as a title to denote their profession (e.g., [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[DJ Qbert]], [[DJ Shadow]] and [[DJ Yoda]]). Some DJs focus on creating a good mix of songs for the club dancers or radio audience. Other DJs use [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]], in which the DJ or [[turntablism|turntablist]] manipulates the [[phonograph|record player turntable]] to create new rhythms and sounds. DJs need to have a mixture of artistic and technical skills for their profession, because they have to understand both the creative aspects of making new musical beats and tracks, and the technical aspects of using [[mixing console]]s, professional audio equipment, [[digital audio workstation]]s and other computerized music gear. In many types of DJing, including club DJing and radio/TV DJing, a DJ also has to have [[charisma]] and develop a good rapport with the audience. Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as [[techno]], [[house music|house]] or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] music. DJs typically have an extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Radio DJs===\n{{Main|Radio personality}}\n\nRadio DJs or [[radio personality|radio personalities]] introduce and play music broadcast on [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital radio|digital]] or [[Internet radio]] stations.\n\n===Club DJs===\n[[File:Pete Rock @ The Brookyln Bowl in 2016.jpg|thumbnail|right|\nDJ [[Pete Rock]] performing at Razel and Friends - Brooklyn Bowl, 2016]]\nClub DJs, commonly referred as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at [[Nightclub|music venues]] or [[bar]]s, [[music festival]]s, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs mix music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques in order to produce non-stopping flow of music. One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is [[beatmatching]]. A DJ who mostly plays and mixes one specific music genre is often given the title of that genre; for example, a DJ who plays hip hop music is called a hip hop DJ, a DJ who plays house music is a house DJ, a DJ who plays techno is called a techno DJ, and so on. The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main features: technical skills, or how well can DJ operate the equipment and produce smooth transitions between two or more recordings and a playlist; and the ability of a DJ to select most suitable recordings, also known as \"reading the crowd\".<ref>[https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2011/12/how-to-read-a-crowd-and-what-happens-if-you-dont/ How To Read A Crowd (And What Happens If You Don\u2019t)], ''Digital DJ Tips'', 3 November 2017</ref>\n\n===Turntablists===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n\nTurntablists, also called battle DJs, use [[Phonograph|turntables]] and [[DJ mixer]] to manipulate recorded sounds in order to produce new music.  In essence, they use DJ equipment as a musical instrument. The most known turntablist technique is [[scratching]]. Turntablists often participate in DJ contests like [[DMC World DJ Championships]] and Red Bull 3Style.<ref>[http://www.redbullthre3style.com/ Red Bull 3Style]</ref>\n\n=== Residents ===\nA resident DJ performs at a venue on a regular basis or permanently.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/resident-djs-are-the-unsung-heroes-of-clubbing-show-them-love|title=Resident DJs Are The Heroes Of Clubbing, And We Need To Show Them Love {{!}} Thump|last=Thorp|first=John|date=7 January 2014|newspaper=Thump|access-date=9 February 2017|publisher=Vice|work=|language=en-UK|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaldjinfo.com/what-is-resident-dj/|title=What Is \"Being A Resident DJ\" ? {{!}}|last=Celikbas|first=Murat|date=1 October 2013|newspaper=Digital DJ INFO|access-date=9 February 2017|work=|language=en-US|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/11/dos-donts-resident-dj/|title=The Do's and Don'ts of Being a Weekly Resident DJ|last=|first=|date=14 November 2013|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> They would perform regularly (typically under an agreement) in a particular discotheque, a particular club, a particular event, or a particular broadcasting station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djmag.com/content/darius-syrossian-best-resident-dj|title=DARIUS SYROSSIAN (BEST RESIDENT DJ)|website=DJMag.com|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/2013/04/resident-dj-mednas-dishes-miami-liv-ing/|title=Resident DJ Mednas Dishes On Miami LIV-ing|date=19 April 2013|newspaper=Vibe|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=66384&dir=2017/february/06|title=The Monitor :: Variety Of Talent At Next Big EDM DJ|last=Ncube|first=Dumisani|newspaper=The Monitor|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> Residents have a decisive influence on the club or a series of events.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.skiddle.com/news/all/mUmU-Liverpool-9th-birthday-review/30778/|title=mUmU Liverpool 9th birthday review|last=Frankland|first=Becca|date=7 February 2017|newspaper=Skiddle.com|access-date=9 February 2017|work=|language=en-gb|via=}}</ref> Per agreement with the management or company, the DJ would have to perform under agreed times and dates.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magneticmag.com/2016/03/how-to-become-resident-dj-at-local-nightclub/|title=How to Become the Resident Dj At Your Local Nightclub|last=Robinson|first=Tyler|date=9 March 2016|website=www.magneticmag.com|language=en-us|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> Typically, DJs perform as residents for two or three times in a week, for example, on Friday and Saturday.

Traditionally, DJs used two [[turntable]]s plugged into a [[DJ mixer]] to mix music on vinyl records. As [[compact disc]]s became popular media for publishing music, specialized high quality CD players known as [[CDJ]]s were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Secure Digital|SD cards]] in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], and [[smartphone]] computers, DJs began using software together with specialized [[sound card]]s and [[DJ controller]] hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.\n\n===Turntables===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n[[Turntable]]s allow DJs to play vinyl records. By adjusting the playback speed of the turntable, either by adjusting the speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the [[tempo]]s of different records so their rhythms can be played together at the same time without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as [[beatmatching]]. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a [[slipmat]] that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. [[Direct-drive turntable]]s are the type preferred by DJs, with the [[Technics SL-1200]] being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play [[hip hop]] music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for [[scratching]], [[beat juggling]], and other [[turntablism]] techniques.\n\n===CDJs===\n{{Main|CDJ}}\nCDJs are high quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and [[pitch control]]s to allow DJs to manipulate the playback of digital files for [[beatmatching]] similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from [[compact disc]]s, they now can play digital music files stored on [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD card]]s. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software to act as a [[DJ controller]].\n\n===DJ mixers===\n{{Main|DJ mixer}}\n[[File:DJ Mixer.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A [[Numark (DJ equipment)|Numark]] DM2002X Pro Master DJ mixer. This three channel mixer can have up to three input sound sources. The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] control knobs and [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] control knobs allow the volume and tone of each sound source to be adjusted. The vertical faders allow for further adjustment of the volume of each sound source. The horizontally-mounted [[crossfader (audio engineering)|crossfader]] enables the DJ to smoothly transition from a [[song]] on one sound source to a song from a different sound source.]]\nDJ mixers are small audio [[mixing console]]s specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer used by a [[record producer]] or [[audio engineer]]; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard [[recording studio]] mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have many of the same features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, [[effects unit]]s, etc.), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the [[crossfader]]. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a [[DJ controller]] instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.\n\n===Headphones===\n{{Main|Headphones}}\nDJs generally use higher quality headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate the sounds of the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen to one side of the headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.\n\nClosed-back headphones are highly recommended for DJs to block outside noise as the environment of DJ usually tend to be very noisy. Standard headphones have 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires \u00bc inch jack. Most of specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between 3.5mm jack and \u00bc inch jack. Detachable coiled cables are perfect for DJ Headphones.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.getaheadphone.com/the-5-best-dj-headphones-of-2016/|title = Best DJ Headphones| accessdate =27 October 2016|year=2016|author=GetAHeadphone}}</ref>\n\n===Software===\n{{See also|List of music software#DJ software}}\n[[File:Mixxx-1.11.0-Deere.png|thumb|left|A [[screenshot]] of [[Mixxx]] DJ software running on [[Mac OS X]]]]\n\nDJs have changed their equipment as new technologies are introduced. The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used [[phonograph|record turntable]]s, vinyl records and [[audio console]]s. In the 1970s, DJs would have to lug heavy direct drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to [[compact cassette]]s. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using [[digital audio]] such as [[CD]]s and [[MP3]] files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a [[laptop]] computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop as a source of music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most [[media player (software)|music player software]] designed for [[consumer electronics|regular consumers]], DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the [[waveform]]s of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.\n\nThe waveforms allow the DJ see what is coming next in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information can be used by the DJ to help manually [[beatmatch]] like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. [[Digital signal processing]] algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the [[tempo]] of recordings independently of their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (and musical [[key (music)|key]], a feature known as \"keylock\". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with [[ReplayGain]] and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply [[effects unit|effects]].\n\nAs [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became widespread, [https://thedjplanet.com/best-dj-software-and-how-each-one-operates-complete-guide/ DJ software] was written to run on these devices in addition to laptops.\nDJ software requires specialized hardware in addition to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular [[sound card]] integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.\n\n===Timecode===\nSpecial vinyl records (or CDs/digital files played with [[CDJ]]s) can be used with DJ software to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing [[turntablism]] techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as \"timecode\", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing in the same way that the turntable manipulates the timecode record.\n\nThis requires a specialized DJ [[sound card]] with at least 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware [[DJ mixer]]. Some DJ mixers have integrated [[USB]] sound cards that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate sound card.\n\n===DJ controllers===\n{{Main|DJ controller}}\nDJ software can be used to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a [[DJ controller]] device that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the [[computer keyboard]] & [[touchpad]] on a laptop, or the [[touchscreen]] on a [[tablet computer]] or [[smartphone]]. Many DJ controllers have an integrated [[sound card]] with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allows the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.<ref>{{Cite book|title=DJing for dummies|last=Steventon, John, 1975-|isbn=9781118937280|edition= 3rd|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=888464041|date = 3 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Other equipment===\n* A [[microphone]], so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience over the sound system.\n* Electronic [[effects unit]]s such as [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[reverb]], [[octave]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], etc.\n* Multi-stylus head shells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.\n* [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], electronic musical keyboards ([[synthesizer]]s), or [[drum machine]]s.\n* [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]] ([[power amplifier]]s and [[speaker enclosure]]s), typically including [[subwoofer]] cabinets for deep bass (or, if a DJ is broadcasting and/or recording a set, broadcasting equipment or recording gear)\n*[[Foldback (sound engineering)|Monitor speaker]]s, for listening to the \"house mix\" that is playing over the main speakers\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore (right), inventor of vinyl record scratching technique.jpg|thumb|In the early 1970s in the South Bronx, a young teen DJ called [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]] invented the \"DJ scratch\" technique.

These techniques primarily include the [[cueing (playback)|cueing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.\n\n{{Side box|above='''DJ Techniques'''\n|text=\n[[Back spinning]]\n*[[Beat juggling]]\n*[[Beatmatching]]\n*[[Chopping (sampling technique)|Chopping]] and [[Chopped and screwed|screwing]]\n*[[Harmonic mixing]]\n*[[Loop (music)|Looping]]\n*[[Needle drop (DJing)|Needle dropping]]\n*[[Phrasing (DJ)|Phrasing]]\n*[[Scratching]]\n*[[Slip-cueing]]}}\nClub DJ turntable techniques include [[beatmatching]], [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[slip-cueing]] to preserve energy on a dance floor.

Examples include [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[beatmatching]], which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic [[synchronization]] of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \"sync\". Most [[DJ mixer]]s now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in [[beats per minute]] (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.\n\nIn the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815205546/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |archivedate=15 August 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===Miming===\nIn DJ culture, [[Miming in instrumental performance|miming]] refers to the practice of DJ's pantomiming the actions of live-mixing a set on stage while a pre-recorded mix plays over the sound system.<ref name=\"Fonarow2006\">Wendy Fonarow.

[[Hip hop]] DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]] and [[beat juggling]] rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.<ref name=\"wired\"/> Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.\n\nIn 1980, Japanese company [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] released the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]], an analog [[Drum machine|rhythm/drum machine]], which has unique artificial sounds, such as its booming [[Bass drum|bass]] and sharp [[Snare drum|snare]], and a [[metronome]]-like [[rhythm]].

In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. Final Scratch debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard Vinyl DJs\", this would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit\", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nIn 2001, [[Pioneer DJ]] began producing the [[CDJ#CDJ-1000|CDJ-1000]] [[CD player]], making the use of digital music recordings with traditional DJ techniques practical for the first time. As the 2000s progressed, [[laptop]] computers became more powerful and affordable. [[#Software|DJ software]], specialized DJ [[sound card]]s, and [[DJ controller]]s were developed for DJs to use laptops as a source of music rather than turntables or CDJs. In the 2010s, like laptops before them, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became more powerful & affordable. DJ software was written to run on these more portable devices instead of laptops, although laptops remain the more common type of computer for DJing.\n\n== Female DJs ==\nIn Western [[popular music]], [[Women in music|women musicians]] have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, however, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs.

In 1981 Greece joined the [[EU]]. Simultaneously, the centre-left party [[PASOK]] won the election and changed the Greek political scenery.

In 1981 Greece joined the [[EU]]. Simultaneously, the centre-left party [[PASOK]] won the election and changed the Greek political scenery.

On 1 January 2001, Greece voted to adopt the [[Euro]], and the currency was introduced in the country one year later on 1 January 2002.

He landed a role and from that moment on lived, ate and drank the theater. \nOver the next five years he went to every theater in Atlanta and auditioned for almost everything that came along. This included a TV pilot for ''[[The Catlins]]'' (1982) which led to a two-year contract. He got a part in ''[[The Bear (1984 film)|The Bear]]'' (1984), with [[Gary Busey]] and then a role in a TV movie called ''[[Poison Ivy (1985 film)|Poison Ivy]]'' (1985), with [[Michael J.

He played in many TV shows such as ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (1988), ''[[I'll Fly Away]]'' (1991), ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' (1993), and many more. Theatrical films included ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), ''[[Passenger 57]]'' (1992), ''[[Kalifornia]]'' (1993), ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' (1998), ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998) and as a co-star in ''[[Remember the Titans]]'' (2000) in which he played Coach Tyrell opposite [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Will Patton]]. He had a guest appearance on the television show, ''[[Sheena (TV series)|Sheena]]'' (2000) in the episode \"Stranded in the Jungle\" (2002).

The alternative explanation \u2013 that Tenerife was colonised by already-distinct Gran Canaria robins \u2013 has not been explored and the proposed model relies only on [[probabilistic]] [[inference]]. Likewise, the seemingly exact molecular dating is doubtful as it assumes a [[molecular clock]] that may or may not be correct, and of course the assumption that the ancestor of all robins was similar in colouration to ''superbus'' and not the continental birds is, being inferred from their model of colonisation, entirely conjectural.</ref>\n\nChristian Dietzen, Hans-Hinrich Witt and Michael Wink published in 2003 in Avian Science a study called \"The phylogeographic differentiation of the European robin ''Erithacus rubecula'' on the Canary Islands revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequence data and morphometrics: evidence for a new robin taxon on Gran Canaria?\".<ref name=\"Dietzen\" /> In it they concluded that Gran Canaria's robin diverged genetically from their European relatives as far back as 2.3 million years, while the Tenerife ones took another half a million years to make this leap, 1.8 million years ago. The most likely reason would be a different colonization of the Canaries by this bird, which arrived at the oldest island first (Gran Canaria) and subsequently passed to the neighboring island (Tenerife).<ref name=\"canarias7.es\">[http://www.canarias7.es/articulo.cfm?Id=36465 C\u00e9sar-Javier Palacios, \"Hallazgo en Gran Canaria de una especie de petirrojo \u00fanica en el mundo\", ''Newspaper Canarias 7'' (2006)]; accessed February 24, 2015.</ref>\n\nA thorough comparison between ''marionae'' and ''superbus'' is pending to confirm that the first one is effectively a different subspecies.

Robins from the western [[Canary Islands]]: [[El Hierro]], [[La Palma]] and [[La Gomera]] (''E. r. microrhynchus'') are similar to the European type subspecies (''E. r. rubecula'').<ref name=Lack46 />\n\nFinally, the robins which can be found in [[Fuerteventura]] are the European ones, which is not surprising as the species does not breed either in this island or in the nearby [[Lanzarote]], they are wintering birds or just passing through during their long migrations between [[Africa]] and [[Europe]].<ref name=\"canarias7.es\" />\n\n=== Other robins ===\nThe larger [[American robin]] (''Turdus migratorius'') is named for its similarity to the European robin, but the two birds are not closely related.

It is a vagrant in [[Iceland]]. In the south-east, it reaches the [[Caucasus]] range. Irish and British robins are largely resident but a small minority, usually female, migrate to southern [[Europe]] during winter, a few as far as Spain. [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Russia]]n robins migrate to Britain and western Europe to escape the harsher winters. These migrants can be recognised by the greyer tone of the upper parts of their bodies and duller orange breast.

As well as the usual crevices, or sheltered banks, other objects include pieces of machinery, barbecues, bicycle handlebars, bristles on upturned brooms, discarded kettles, watering cans, flower pots and even hats. The nest is composed of moss, leaves and grass, with fine grass, hair and feathers for lining.

The eggs are a cream, buff or white speckled or blotched with reddish-brown colour, often more heavily so at the larger end.<ref name=Observerbirdseggs>{{Cite book|title=The Observer's Book of Birds' Eggs|author=Evans, G.|pages=85|year=1972|publisher=Warne|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-7232-0060-4}}</ref> When juvenile birds fly from the nests they are mottled brown in colour all over. After two to three months out of the nest, the juvenile bird grows some orange feathers under its chin and over a similar period this patch gradually extends to complete the adult appearance.\n\n=== Vocalisations ===\n[[File:Erithacus rubecula.ogg|left|200px|thumb|Song 1]]\n[[File:120401-132827 Erithacus rubecula.ogg|left|200px|thumb|Song 2]]\n[[File:European Robin (Erithacus rubecula) (W1CDR0001525 BD17).ogg|left|200px|thumb|Ticking calls]]\n[[File:European Robin Singing.jpg|thumb|right|Singing near [[Doolin]], [[Ireland]]]]\n\nThe robin produces a fluting, warbling {{audio|120401-132827 Erithacus rubecula.ogg|song}} during the breeding season. Both the male and female sing during the winter, when they hold separate territories, the song then sounding more plaintive than the summer version.<ref name=RSPB /> The female robin moves a short distance from the summer nesting territory to a nearby area that is more suitable for winter feeding.  The male robin keeps the same territory throughout the year. During the breeding season, male robins usually initiate their morning song an hour before civil sunrise, and usually terminate their daily singing around thirty minutes after sunset.<ref name=\"Behavioral Ecology\">{{Cite journal|author=Da Silva|author2=Samplonius|author3=Schlicht, Valcu|author4= Gaston|year=2014|title=Artificial night lighting rather than traffic noise affects the daily timing of dawn and dusk singing in common European songbirds|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=25|pages=1037\u20131047|doi=10.1093/beheco/aru103|issue=5}}</ref> Nocturnal singing can also occur, especially in urban areas that are artificially lit during the night.<ref name=\"Behavioral Ecology\" /> Under artificial light, nocturnal singing can be used by urban robins to actively shunt daytime anthropogenic noise.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Fuller RA, Warren PH, Gaston KJ |year=2007|title=Daytime noise predicts nocturnal singing in urban robins|journal=Biology Letters|volume=3|pages=368\u201370|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0134|pmid=17456449|issue=4|pmc=2390663}}</ref> A variety of calls is also made at any time of year, including a ticking note indicating anxiety or mild alarm.\n\n=== Magnetoreception ===\nThe avian magnetic compass of the robin has been extensively researched and uses vision-based [[magnetoreception]], in which the robin's ability to sense the magnetic field of the earth for navigation is affected by the light entering the bird's eye.
