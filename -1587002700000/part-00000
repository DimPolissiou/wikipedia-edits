They speak one of the [[Jivaroan languages|language family of the same name]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe Jivaro people are famous for their head-hunting raids and [[Shrunken head|shrinking of heads]]. These raids usually occur once a year in one particular Jivaro neighborhood. The raiding parties usually only attack one homestead per raid, killing the men, spearing the older women to death, and taking younger women as brides.\n\n[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|Percentage of male deaths due to warfare amongst the Jivaro, as compared to other indigenous ethnic groups in New Guinea and South America and to some industrialized nations.]]\n\nJivaro also engage in hunting activities. These activities usually involve a husband and wife hunting with a [[blow gun]] and poisoned dart, dabbed with the poisonous plant [[curare]], which stops the heartbeat of the animal. Jivaro usually hunt for monkeys and birds, but they do not rely on hunting as their primary food source.\n\n==Groups==\n[[File:Achuar con cerbatana (Amazon\u00eda Ecuatoriana).jpg|thumb|right|An Achuar man with a [[blowgun]]]]\nThe principal groups are:\n*[[Shuar people|Shuar]]\n*[[Achuar people|Achuar]][[File:Shuar in Parque de Logro\u00f1o.JPG|thumb|Shuar in [[Logro\u00f1o, Ecuador]]]]\n*[[Huambisa people|Humabisa]]\n*[[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]]\n\nSome have also named the following:\n*[[Antipas (tribe)|Antipas]]<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Matthew Stirling|Stirling, Matthew]]. 1938 ''Historical and Ethnographic Materials of the Jivaro Indians'' Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 117, 2</ref>\n*[[Mayna (tribe)|Mayna]]<ref name=\"Harner\">[[Michael Harner|Harner, Michael]]. 1972 ''Jivaro: People of the Sacred Waterfalls''. {{ISBN|0385071183}}.</ref>\n\nMoreover, the [[Shiwiar]] are a group of [[Achuar]] speakers living along the [[Corrientes River]], next to [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] speakers; many Shiwiar also speak this other, unrelated, language.\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Beliefs/Worldview ===\nThe Jivaroan worldview is built upon the idea that both animate and inanimate objects hold souls that cannot be seen by our common eyes. These souls contain power, or kar\u00e1ram, that the Jivaroan people believe can be contained and harnessed within one\u2019s self. Harner talks about these souls, called ''arutam'':<blockquote>\u201cA person is not born with an ''arutam'' soul. Such a soul must be acquired, and in certain traditional ways. The acquisition of this type of soul is considered to be so important to an adult male\u2019s survival that a boy\u2019s parents do not expect him to live past puberty without one. By repeatedly killing, one can continually accumulate power through the replacement of old ''arutam'' souls with new ones. This \u201ctrade-in\u201d mechanism is an important feature because, when a person has had the same  ''arutam''  soul for four or five years, it tends to leave its sleeping possessor to wander nightly through the forest. Sooner or later, while it is thus drifting through the trees, another Jivaro will \u201csteal\u201d it. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to obtain a new soul before the old one begins nocturnal wanderings. This felt need encourages the individual to participate in a killing expedition every few years.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Jivaro Souls|last = Michael|first = Harner|publisher = American Anthropologist|year = 1962|isbn = |location = |pages = 258\u2013272}}</ref></blockquote>Killing becomes a vital part of the Jivaro culture. Men are only marriageable after becoming hunters within their communities. The more one kills, the more power one has, granting one  immunity of death.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Jivaro Headhunters in a Headless Time|last = Sieverts|first = Henning|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> Violence is a huge part of Jivaroan culture in respect to this type of soul belief. Harner talks about the main systems of belief within the Jivaroan communities: <blockquote>\u201cJivaro souls beliefs constitute one of four major autonomous systems of verbalized thought so far noted in their culture. The other three are the systems of crop fairy (''nungui'') beliefs, and kinship system. Since belief in one system is not explicitly based upon belief in another, an adequate understanding of Jivaro soul beliefs can be achieved without recourse to the beliefs regarding '''nunui, witchcraft, or kinship.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Gods and deities ===\nThe Jivaroan people have a polytheistic religion. The Jivaro god, Tsungi, is the god of shamanism, and the Jivaro goddess, ''Nung\u00fci'', refers to mother earth. ''Nung\u00fci'' is described as being a short and heavy-set woman, dressed in a black dress. According to Jivaro belief; if ''Nung\u00fci'' dances in a woman's garden, it will be productive during the harvest season. Living deep underground, she emerges at night to dance in the gardens. Women sing to ''Nungui'' to ask her to protect the gardens, and they carefully weed the gardens daily to appease her. Jivaro believe in a protective spirit that comes to them through spirit visions. This spirit, known as ''Arutam'' is thought to protect them from injury, disease, and death.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Jivaro - Introduction, Location, Language, Folklore, Religion, Major holidays, Rites of passage|url = http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Costa-Rica-to-Georgia/Jivaro.html|website = www.everyculture.com|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref> The Jivaroan gods and goddesses are deeply tied to nature. There are different creators and gods that explain the origins of man and animal, the occurrence of natural events and relationships that exist in daily life.

Through the Jivaroan worldview, it is believed that sickness and death are caused by attacks on one\u2019s spirit by malevolent shamans.<ref name=\":1\" /> The healing shamans will hold ''[[ayahuasca]]'' ceremonies and perform different rituals to counteract the work done by witchcraft.\n\n=== Rituals ===\n[[File:Objets dAmazonie (r\u00e9serves visitables du mus\u00e9e national dethnologie) (1450150520).jpg|thumb|[[Shrunken head]] from the upper Amazon region]]\n'''Headhunting'''\n\nSee: [[Shrunken head|Shrunken Head]]\n\n'''Jivaro Gardening'''\n\nUnlike many other cultures, the Jivaro cultures place more emphasis on gardening (horticulture) than they do on hunting. This is due to the unpredictable nature of hunting in the Amazonian region, where the Jivaro call home. As a result, a ritualistic approach to gardening sprouted from the Jivaro cultures.\n\nDespite the reliable, elaborate system of horticultural development the Jivaro have developed, they still believe the act to be \u201c\u2026as fraught with uncertainty as hunting\u201d as Michael Brown stated in a paper titled, \u201cAguaruna Jivaro Gardening Magic in Alto Rio Mayo, Peru.\u201d He then went on to say that in order, \u201cTo encourage the growth of their cultivated plants they sing magical gardening songs, perform a set of ritual acts when planting a new garden, and observe certain taboos connected with garden work.\u201d Much like similar beliefs and rituals associated with hunting, the Jivaro believe that spirits reside in the plants and they need to be encouraged to grow by various songs, chants, and dances.\n\nOwing to the belief of spirits residing in the plants, the garden is regarded as a place of great spiritual significance. Like the inside of a temple, the garden is a place where one receives sanctuary.\n\n\"It is one of the few places where a woman can go alone without attracting curiosity and suspicion. It offers privacy from prying eyes and ears and is therefore the site of a certain amount of intra- and extra-marital sexual activity\" (Brown, 171)\n\n==== Ayahuasca ceremonies ====\nAyahuasca ceremonies play a large role in the Jivaro culture. These ceremonies are used for healing practices usually directed toward enchanting spirits. Here, Bradley C. Bennett makes note of these healing practices,<blockquote>\"During Healing Ceremony, only shaman and patient drink Natem and will participate in the singing and chanting while the shaman will perform different actions to the patients body thought to heal the spirit.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = Hallucinogenic Plants of the Shuar and Related Indigenous Groups in Amazonian Ecuador and Peru|last = Bennett|first = Bradley|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\"</blockquote>The shaman goes about relieving the patient of any harmful spirits that may be attacking his or her body. The Jivaro also believe in an act of what may be considered telling the future or telling time. Bennett makes another note of the Jivaro and their [[ayahuasca]] ceremonies, where a Jivaro will hire a shaman to tell of far away friends and family.<blockquote>\"The Jivaro shamans, Under the influence of ayahuasca, often believe that they are seeing distant relatives or sweethearts. These distant persons apparently have to be individuals with whom the shaman is already acquainted, so that he can \"know whom to look for.\" Also it is normally necessary for the shaman to be already acquainted with the distant locale and the route to get there, and preferably he should know the appearance and location of the house of the person being sought.\" <ref name=\"Harner\" /></blockquote>The Jivaro have been practicing these ceremonies for hundreds of years, keeping them held close to their roots. The ceremonies of the ayahuasca brew continue to be practiced this day. Harley Gardiner is a wankstain.\n\n\n===== Beliefs =====\nThe Shuar believe that the first being, Tensak, casts a spiritual dart that to curse or heal a person. Bennett recorded that the Tensak \"exists in a higher plane of existence that can be seen when in the shaman state.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Bennett also observed that, as a shaman works to heal spirits and counter bewitching shamans he will consume [[Banisteriopsis caapi]], tobacco and alcohol to help enhance and fuel his trip from the [[Ayahuasca|Natem]].\n\n==Confounding factors==\n[[File:Bulletin (1901) (20413495092).jpg|thumb|240px|Jivaro family, c. 1901]]\nAnthropologists have recognized these languages<sup>[which?]</sup> as distinct peoples, but have called attention to two confounding factors.  The first has to do with nomenclature: Jivaroan language speakers typically identify themselves either by their language's word for person (''shuar'') or by the name of the river on which they live.  Consequently, historical sources record either one name for all, or a plethora names of many small Jivaroan tribes, each the name of a different river.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Karsten, Rafael. 1935 ''The Headhunters of Western Amazonas. The Life and Culture of the Jibaro Indians of Eastern Ecuador and Peru'', Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, Commentationes Humanarum Littararum VII(l). 2-3</ref>\n\nThe second reason has to do with social organization.  Prior to Ecuadorian or Peruvian colonization and [[Timeline of Christian missions|Christian missionization]] in the 20th century, the principal unit of Jivaroan social organization was the [[polygynous]] [[matrilocal]] household or cluster of matrilocally-organized households.  Notably, although Jivaroans shared the same language and culture, each household or cluster of matrilocally organized households were politically and economically autonomous.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Harner\"/>  Thus, in 1938 [[Matthew Stirling]] commented that:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n{{quote|the Jivaros scattered over this vast territory of approximately {{convert|22000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} are of similar appearance physically; they speak a single language and their customs, beliefs and material culture are closely interrelated.  With this, however, their unity ends.  The scores of small independent groups, living for the most part on the headwaters of the tributary streams, are constantly at war, one group with another.}}\n\nHe also said that:\n{{quote|...they live in widely separated household groups with very little consciousness of any sort of political unity.  Such groupings as exist are continually shifting location, separating, amalgamating, or being exterminated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\nPrior to colonization and the presence of Christian missionaries, Jivaroan speakers were not organized into any stable and clearly bounded polities or ethnic groups.\n\nIn response to European colonization and missionization, Jivaroan speakers have formed nucleated settlements that are organized into political federations: the Federaci\u00f3n Interprovincial de Centros Shuar and the Nacionalidad Achuar de Ecuador in Ecuador, and the Organizaci\u00f3n Central de Comunidades Aguarunas del Alto Mara\u00f1on and the Consejo Aguaruna y Huambisa in Peru.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Resistance against invaders ==\nAt the time of Spanish arrival to South America, the Jivaro were an independent culture and hostile to outsiders. The neighboring Incas tried to subjugate the Jivaroan peoples, but the Inca Empire's expansion attempts failed after a series of bloody confrontations where the Inca army lost against the fierce Jivaroan warriors. The Jivaro put up a similar resistance to Spaniards, who came into their territory searching for placer gold. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the Jivaroan tribes had only limited and intermittent contact with the Spanish.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=175c4xOpLtYC&pg=PA165|title=The Indians of Central and South America: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|last=Olson|first=James Stuart|date=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313263873|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe strong warrior culture of the Jivaroan tribes and its striking power is illustrated in the famous Jivaro-Spanish war of 1559 when perhaps as many as 20,000 Jivaroan warriors under the leadership of Quiruba annihilated the town of Logro\u00f1o, terminating Spanish incursion into Jivaro territory.

In 1984, he starred in the hit comedy film ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' playing the main role of Gilbert Lowe, a sensitive and well-meaning nerd, Lewis' (played by [[Robert Carradine]]) best friend and later president of the Tri-Lambs.

It was Edwards' role as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw alongside [[Tom Cruise]] in the 1986 film ''[[Top Gun]]'' that brought his first widespread public acknowledgment. His character, who died in an aviation accident, was among the most prominent and popular in the film. He appeared as a terminally ill patient in ''[[Hawks (film)|Hawks]]'' (1988) alongside [[Timothy Dalton]], another role which brought him worldwide fame.

It was the first full-length album to be released by the band, although it was the third to be recorded, after ''[[Static Age]]'' and ''[[12 Hits from Hell]]''. The recording sessions for ''Walk Among Us'' took place at multiple studios between June 1981 and January 1982, and the album also includes the track \"[[Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight?]]\", which was recorded live in [[New York City]]. The album features the single \"[[Night of the Living Dead (song)|Night of the Living Dead]]\", which was released on October 31, 1979.\n\n''Walk Among Us'' was first pressed with cover artwork featuring a pink background, with band's logo in pink. The second pressing introduced a purple background on the cover, though the pink logo remained unchanged. When the album was reissued in 1988 by Ruby Records, the purple cover was retained, but the band's logo was changed to a green color. Until 2018, all official [[Phonograph record|vinyl]] or [[CD]] releases of the album in the United States were issued through Ruby, Slash, or [[Warner Records]]/[[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]]. The album was reissued again on November 30, 2018 by [[Earache Records]], with six limited-run variant colored pressings.\n\n==Recording==\nPrior to ''Walk Among Us'', the Misfits had recorded and shelved two full-length albums: ''[[Static Age]]'', which was recorded in 1978 but would remain unreleased in its entirety until 1996, and ''[[12 Hits from Hell]]'', which was recorded in 1980 and has never received an official wide release.<ref name=misfitsdisc>{{cite web|url=http://www.misfits.com/info/discography.html|title=Official Misfits Discography|publisher=Misfits.com|access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref> The recording sessions for ''Walk Among Us'' took place at multiple studios.

It was the first full-length album to be released by the band, although it was the third to be recorded, after ''[[Static Age]]'' and ''[[12 Hits from Hell]]''. The recording sessions for ''Walk Among Us'' took place at multiple studios between June 1981 and January 1982, and the album also includes the track \"[[Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight?]]\", which was recorded live in [[New York City]]. The album features the single \"[[Night of the Living Dead (song)|Night of the Living Dead]]\", which was released on October 31, 1979.\n\n''Walk Among Us'' was first pressed with cover artwork featuring a pink background, with band's logo in pink. The second pressing introduced a purple background on the cover, though the pink logo remained unchanged. When the album was reissued in 1988 by Ruby Records, the purple cover was retained, but the band's logo was changed to a green color. Until 2018, all official [[Phonograph record|vinyl]] or [[CD]] releases of the album in the United States were issued through Ruby, Slash, or [[Warner Records]]/[[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]]. The album was reissued again on November 30, 2018 by [[Earache Records]], with six limited-run variant colored pressings.\n\n==Recording==\nPrior to ''Walk Among Us'', the Misfits had recorded and shelved two full-length albums: ''[[Static Age]]'', which was recorded in 1978 but would remain unreleased in its entirety until 1996, and ''[[12 Hits from Hell]]'', which was recorded in 1980 and has never received an official wide release.<ref name=misfitsdisc>{{cite web|url=http://www.misfits.com/info/discography.html|title=Official Misfits Discography|publisher=Misfits.com|access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref> The recording sessions for ''Walk Among Us'' took place at multiple studios.

By Christmas 1940 there were 60 Polish officers, 12 Belgians, 50 French, and 30 British, a total of no more than 200 with their orderlies.<ref name = \"story\"/><ref>[http://www.ean.co.uk/Data/Bygones/History/Article/WW2/Colditz/html/body_oflag_ivc.htm Oflag IVC (Colditz) on East Anglia Net, Bygones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507125501/http://www.ean.co.uk/Data/Bygones/History/Article/WW2/Colditz/html/body_oflag_ivc.htm |date=2005-05-07 }}</ref>{{clear|left}}\n\n200 French officers arrived in February 1941. A number of the French demanded that French Jewish officers be segregated from them and the camp commander obliged; they were moved to the attics. By the end of July 1941, there were more than 500 officers: over 250 French, 150 Polish, 50 British and Commonwealth, 2 Yugoslavian. In April 1941, a French officer, [[Alain Le Ray]], become the first prisoner ever to escape from the Colditz Castle.\n\nOn 24 July 1941, 68 Dutch officers arrived, mostly members of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, who had refused to sign a declaration that they would take no part in the war against Germany. According to the German Security Officer, Captain [[Reinhold Eggers]], the Dutch officers appeared to be model prisoners at first. Importantly for other internees in the camp, among the 68 Dutch was [[Hans Larive]] with his knowledge of the [[Singen]] route. This route into Switzerland was discovered by Larive in 1940 on his first escape attempt from an Oflag in Soest. Larive was caught at the Swiss border near Singen. The interrogating Gestapo officer was so confident the war would soon be won by Germany that he told Larive the safe way across the border near Singen. Larive did not forget and many prisoners later escaped using this route.<ref>''Larive; the man who came in from Colditz'', Leo de hartog; officieren achter prikkeldraad 1940-1945</ref>\n\nWithin days after their arrival, the Dutch escape officer, Captain [[Machiel van den Heuvel]], planned and executed his first of many escape plans. On 13 August 1941 the first two Dutchmen escaped successfully from the castle followed by many more of which six officers made it to England. Afterwards a number of would-be escapees would borrow Dutch [[Trench coat|greatcoat]]s as their disguise. When the Wehrmacht invaded the Netherlands they were short of material for uniforms, so they confiscated anything available. The coats in Dutch field [[grey]] in particular remained unchanged in colour, since it was similar to the tone already in use by the Germans, thus these greatcoats would be nearly identical with very minor alterations.\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ais.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Some of the French officers held at Colditz]]\n\nIn May 1943, the Wehrmacht High Command decided that Colditz should house only Americans and British, so in June the Dutch were moved out, followed shortly thereafter by the Poles, the Belgians, and the French; with the final French group leaving 12 July 1943. By the end of July there were a few [[Free French Forces|Free French]] officers, and 228 British officers, with a contingent consisting of Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Irish, and one Indian. Included in the few Australian prisoners was serial escapee and saboteur Private Francis McGregor Brown from Western Australia recaptured in July 1943 after escaping Oflag VIIa and V11b, deemed an incorrigible where he remained until liberation. While Generally reserved for Officers and Prominente, Private Browns tenure at Oflag IVC highlighted the presence of soldiers of all ranks and nationalities. \n\nOn 23 August 1944 Colditz received its first Americans: 49-year-old Colonel [[Florimund Duke]] \u2014 the oldest American paratrooper of the war, Captain [[Guy Nunn]], and [[Alfred Suarez]]. They were all counter-intelligence operatives parachuted into Hungary to prevent it joining forces with Germany. Population was approximately 254 at the start of the early winter that year.\n\nOn 19 January 1945 six French Generals \u2014 Lieutenant-General [[Jean Adolphe Louis Robert Flavigny]], Major-General [[Louis L\u00e9on Marie Andr\u00e9 Buisson]], Major-General [[Ars\u00e8ne Marie Paul Vauthier]], Brigadier-General [[Albert Joseph Daine]], and Brigadier-General [[Ren\u00e9 Jacques Mortemart de Boisse]] \u2014 were brought from the camp at [[Oflag IV-B Koenigstein|K\u00f6nigstein]] to Colditz Castle. Major-General [[Gustave Marie Maurice Mesny]] was murdered by the Germans on the way from K\u00f6nigstein to Colditz Castle.\n\nOn 5 February, Polish General [[Tadeusz B\u00f3r-Komorowski]], deputy commander of the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' (Home Army) and responsible for the [[Warsaw Uprising]], arrived with his entourage.\n\nIn March, 1200 French prisoners were brought to Colditz Castle, with 600 more being imprisoned in the town below.\n\nOn 16 April, Oflag IV C was captured by American soldiers from 1st US Army.<ref>Reid ''Colditz: The Full Story'' p294</ref>\n\n==\"Prominente\" and notable inmates==\nAmong the more notable inmates were British fighter ace [[Douglas Bader]]; Pat Reid, the man who brought Colditz to public attention with his post war books; [[Airey Neave]], the first British officer to escape from Colditz and later a British Member of Parliament; New Zealand Army Captain [[Charles Upham]], the only combat soldier ever to receive the Victoria Cross twice; and Sir [[David Stirling]], founder of the wartime Special Air Service.<ref name = \"story\"/>[[File:Inner courtyard of Colditz castle (prominente quarters).JPG|thumb|The inner courtyard of Colditz castle which was used as the prison yard when the castle was the [[POW]] camp Oflag IV-C during [[World War II]].

Note the cutout depiction of [[Attempts to escape Oflag IV-C#The French lady|Lieutenant Bouley]] to the lower left hand side of the photograph.]]\n\nThere were also prisoners called ''Prominente'' (German for 'celebrities'), relatives of Allied VIPs. The first one was [[Giles Romilly]], a civilian journalist who was captured in Narvik, Norway who was also a nephew of [[Winston Churchill]]'s wife [[Clementine Churchill]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] himself specified that Romilly was to be treated with the utmost care and that:\n\n# ''The Kommandant and Security Officer answer for Romilly's security with their heads.''\n# ''His security is to be assured by any and every exceptional measure you care to take.''\n\n[[File:PicOf 4C Prominente.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Members of the Prominente, under a U.S. guard, outside the [[Hungerberg]] Hotel on May 5, 1945, shortly after their release.

Burn had been a journalist like Romilly before the war, working for ''The Times''. Burn had briefly been an admirer of the Nazi Party and in 1936 had met Adolf Hitler, who signed his copy of ''Mein Kampf''. After war broke out Burn shifted politically to Marxism and gave lectures to prisoners at Colditz, but due to his pre-war interest in Nazi philosophy he was widely regarded with distrust and scorn.\n\n[[John Arundell, 16th Baron Arundell of Wardour]] (1907\u20131944) was an aristocrat held at Colditz who, despite his pedigree, was not awarded ''Prominente'' status. Arundell made a habit of exercising in the winter snow; he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and died in Chester Military Hospital.\n\nAnother officer, not listed as among the ''Prominente'' but who became famous after the end of the war, was French military chaplain and Catholic priest [[Yves Congar]], who was captured as a POW and later sent there after repeated attempts to escape. He became a noted theologian and was made [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1994, at age 90.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bernardi|first=Peter J.|title=A Passion for Unity|url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/526/article/passion-unity|work=America Magazine|publisher=America Magazine|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt 1:30&nbsp;a.m. on 13 April 1945, while the final battles of the war approached the area, the ''Prominente'' were moved under guard and the cover of darkness. The Allies and prisoners became especially concerned that the ''Prominente'' might be used as hostages, bargaining chips and [[human shield]]s, or that the SS might try to kill them out of spite; they prepared for resistance and, if possible, to take over the castle. The Germans moved all the ''Prominente'' out of the castle, over the protestations of the other prisoners. When U.S. troops reached the area, the prisoners persuaded the leader of their guards, ''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Gottlob Berger]], to surrender in secret in order to save him from the revenge of the SS. With his aid they reached American lines a couple of weeks later. He would later receive a lessened sentence after his hearing in 1949 because of his actions regarding the ''Prominente''.\n\n==German staff and visitors==\n[[File:Ordonnances.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A group of the French orderlies from Colditz Castle poses for a picture in the inner courtyard.]]\n\nKeeping the castle running in a secure and efficient manner was a difficult task, and the Germans maintained a larger garrison at the castle than at many of their other prison camps. Between the years 1939 and 1945 more than 70 German officers and enlisted men worked in a wide variety of staff positions, as well as overseeing prisoners' labour.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\nThere was also a large contingent of civilians and local townspeople who worked on the castle grounds. Some were in maintenance, some in medical roles, some were there in a supervisory role ([[Nazi Party]] leaders, Swiss Red Cross observers, etc.). Some family members of the German military officers lived at the camp.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\n===Security officers===\n* Captain [[Paul Priem]] was the first Security Officer. Pat Reid said he \"possessed a rare quality among Germans \u2013 a sense of humour\".<ref>P.R. Reid, MBE, MC, ''Colditz: The Colditz Story & The Latter Days of Colditz'', Coronet, 1985, p. 74</ref>\n* Captain [[Reinhold Eggers]] was Security Officer from November 1940 until April 1945, promoted to chief of security in 1944. He was also the only English-speaker among the Germans at Colditz, thus was involved in every interaction with the prisoners or between the Senior Officers and the Kommandant serving as translator.<ref name = \"eggers\">http://www.herofiles.org/resources/books.shtml</ref> Dutchman Lieutenant [[Damiaen J. van Doorninck]] said of him, \"This man was our opponent, but nevertheless he earned our respect by his correct attitude, self-control and total lack of rancour despite all the harassment we gave him.\"\n\n===Kommandants===\n* Oberst Schmidt 1939 \u2013 August 1941\n* Oberst Glaesche 1 August 1942 \u2013 13 February 1943\n* Oberst Prawitt 14 February 1943 \u2013 15 April 1945<ref>Reid, ''Colditz: The Full Story'' p325</ref>\n\n==Life in the camp==\nIn Colditz, the Wehrmacht followed the [[Geneva Convention]].<ref>\"Colditz: The Legend\" Yesterday TV, 12:00 pm, 6 Dec 2010</ref> Would-be escapees were punished with solitary confinement, instead of being summarily executed. In principle, the security officers recognized that it was the duty of the POWs to try to escape and that their own job was to stop them. Prisoners could even form [[gentlemen's agreement]]s with the guards, such as not using borrowed tools for escape attempts.\n\nMost of the guard company was composed of World War I veterans and young soldiers not fit for the front. Because Colditz was a high security camp, the Germans organized three and then later four ''Appells'' (roll calls) per day to count the prisoners. If they discovered someone had escaped, they alerted every police and train station within a {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius, and many local members of the Hitler Youth would help to recapture any escapees.\n\nBecause of the number of Red Cross food parcels, prisoners sometimes ate better than their guards, who had to rely on Wehrmacht rations. Prisoners could use their relative luxuries for trade and, for example, exchange their cigarettes for German ''[[Reichsmark]]s'' that they hoped could later use in their escape attempts. Occasionally this turned out to be a mistake as several of the bills they received were of the earlier ''[[German papiermark|Papiermark]]'' varieties that were no longer considered valid. There were also other currencies in circulation, including the ''[[Registermark]]'', utilized for travelling and investments in Germany; the ''[[Reisemark]]'', for tourists; the ''[[Kreditsperrmark]]'', for sales of property belonging to foreigners; the ''[[Effektensperrmark]]'', arising from the sale of securities in Germany; the ''[[Reichskreditkassenschein]]'' in occupied territories; and the ''[[Behelfszahlungsmittel]]'' (Auxiliary Payment Certificates) for the German Armed Forces. The ''Kreditsperrmark'' and ''Effektensperrmark'' were consolidated into the ''[[Handelsperrmark]]'' in 1939. Because of the massive variety of currency types and uses, in several escape attempts, escapees with one of these various currencies printed before 1939 were told their money was no good \u2014 leaving them moneyless and easier to recapture.\n\nPrisoners had to make their own entertainment. In August 1941 the first camp [[1940 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] were organized by the Polish prisoners. Events were held in football (soccer), volleyball, boxing, and chess, but the closing ceremony was interrupted by a German fire drill. \"The British came in last place in every event cheerfully, to the dismay of the other participants who took the competition deadly seriously,\" according to the British inmate John Wilkens in a 1986 interview. Prisoners also formed a Polish [[choir]], a Dutch Hawaiian [[guitar]] band, and a French [[orchestra]].<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\nThe British put on homemade revues, classical plays and farces including: ''[[Gaslight (play)|Gaslight]]'', ''[[Rope (play)|Rope]]'', ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'', ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. Several prisoners intentionally grew their hair long so as better to portray female roles. Prisoner [[Jock Hamilton-Baillie]] used to shave his legs, rub them in brown shoe polish, and draw a line down the back of his legs in pencil to simulate the appearance of silk stockings. This allowed him special \"bath privileges\" in the German guards washroom, since the prisoners' showers were unable to get the polish off his legs. Staging these plays even gained the prisoners access to \"parole tools\", tools which were used to build the sets and promised not to be used to escape. During the summer months, the theatre's peak periods, there were new productions every two weeks. The biggest success of the theatre however would be the Christmas themed ''Ballet Nonsense'' which premiered on November 16, 1941 and ran until the November 18, 1941 show which [[Paul Priem|Hauptmann Priem]] (the first prison warden of Colditz) attended.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\nAnother pastime which occupied much of the prisoners' time was the production of [[moonshine]] alcohol. Initially started by the Polish contingent using a recipe of yeast, water, German jam and sugar from their Red Cross parcels, and then taken up by other prisoners, it did not take long for stills to be secreted all across Colditz (one of which remained undiscovered until a tourist trip in 1984). Prisoner Michael Farr, whose family ran Hawker's Gin (the sole purveyors of Sloe gin with a Royal Warrant), managed to make a sparkling wine dubbed \"Ch\u00e2teau Colditz\". Some prisoners would get black teeth or even temporary blindness from consuming this beverage \u2014 a condition known as \"jam-happy\" \u2014 as it contained many impurities. Although the German guards despised the drunken prisoners, they generally turned a blind eye to the distilling.\n\nOfficers also studied languages, learning from each other, and told stories. Most popular of these stories were the embellished retelling of BBC broadcasts by Jim Rogers. Since mail was regularly screened by censors, and the German newspapers received by prisoners contained much Nazi propaganda, the only reliable information prisoners could obtain on the progress of the war in Europe was through BBC broadcasts received via one of two radios which were secreted in the castle. These radios were smuggled in by French prisoner [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Guigues]] and named \"Arthur 1\" and \"Arthur 2\". The first radio was quickly discovered because of a mole, but the second would remain secreted until Guigues returned and removed it during a tour of the castle in 1965. The prisoners' \"Radio Laboratory\" would not be permanently exposed until 1992 during repairs to the roof.<ref>[http://www.colditz-4c.com/tour/p14/p14.htm Colditz Castle : Virtual Tour : Page 14: Attic Secrets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nLater the most popular way to pass the time was ''stoolball'', a particularly rough version of [[Rugby football|rugby]], where there were two stools at either end of the prisoners' courtyard and goals were scored by touching the opponent's stool with the ball. This game served as an outlet for pent-up aggression, and also provided noise to cover the sounds of tunnel-digging.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\nIn addition to escape attempts, prisoners also tried to make the life of their guards more miserable by resorting to \"[[goon baiting|goon-baiting]]\", making nuisances of themselves by harassing the guards. For example, they would drop water bombs on the guards. [[Douglas Bader]] encouraged his junior officers to do the same. British Flight Lieutenant [[Pete Tunstall]] especially tried to cause havoc by disturbing the roll call even if nobody was trying to escape, so that the guards would not become suspicious when somebody was. He went through a total of five [[courts-martial]] and suffered a total of 415 days in solitary confinement.\n\n==Escape attempts==\n{{main|Attempts to escape Oflag IV-C}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nOflag IV-C provided the inspiration for both television and film because of the widely popular retellings by Pat Reid and Airey Neave. This started as early as 1955 with the release of ''[[The Colditz Story]]'', followed by ''[[The Birdmen]]'' in 1971, continuing until 2005 with the ''Colditz'' mini-series. The escape stories of Colditz Castle have inspired several board and video games, such as [[Escape from Colditz]] and [[Commandos (series)|Commandos]]. In contrast, the existence of Colditz is virtually unknown in Germany today. Eggers wrote a book based on his experiences of the German side of events.<ref>Colditz: The German Story|author=Reinhold Eggers|year=1961|publisher=Barnsley: Pen and Sword Books|Pen and Sword Military. {{ISBN|1-84415-536-6}}</ref>\n\n===Cinema===\n* ''[[The Colditz Story]]'' (1955) was a [[drama]]tic film re-enactment of life in the camp during World War II, based entirely on the books of [[Pat Reid]], directed by [[Guy Hamilton]] for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award]] in 1956.

This movie is of note in that it is the first movie based on Pat Reid's books to reference the Colditz glider, devised and built by Bill Goldfinch with Jack Best his partner in the construction.\n* ''[[Colditz (TV series)|Colditz]]'' (1972\u20131974) was a television drama series aired on BBC1 television. It ran for a total of 28 episodes across two seasons, progressing in time from the opening of the camp until its liberation in 1945. The first three episodes of the series acted as an introduction to the plot of the show and introduced the viewers to the three central characters by following the events that led up to their arrival at the camp. The series was a joint production between the BBC and Universal TV (an American company), but for reasons unknown, it never aired in the United States. Episodes 24 \"A Very Important Person\" and 25 \"Chameleon\" did however air in the US as a two-hour TV movie entitled ''Escape From Colditz'', in 1974. A review of the film was printed in the newspaper ''[[The News Of The World]]'', which praised it saying: ''\"It has all the realism, dignity and courage of the men it commemorates.\"'' Its more notable actors include [[Jack Hedley]] as Lieutenant Colonel John Preston from 1972\u201374, [[Edward Hardwicke]] as Captain Pat Grant from 1972\u201373, [[Robert Wagner]] as Major Phil Carrington from 1972\u201374, [[David McCallum]] as Flight Lieutenant Simon Carter from 1972\u201374, and [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as Lieutenant Colonel Max Dodd in 1974.\n* ''Escape from Colditz'' (2001) is a British television movie.\n* [[Colditz (miniseries)|''Colditz'' (2005)]] was a mini-series on [[ITV1]], based on Henry Chancellor's book ''Colditz: The Definitive History'', directed by [[Stuart Orme]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2904071.stm | work=BBC News | title=Colditz drama planned for ITV | date=31 March 2003}}</ref> This tale is much more fictional than its predecessors, with fictional characters and situations that are merely based on real people and events.<ref>\n[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/151/151924_damians_marriage_escape.html \"Damian's marriage escape\"]</ref> It features [[Jason Priestley]] (''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'') as Rhett Barker, [[James Fox]] as Lt.

A number of the French demanded that French Jewish officers be segregated from them and the camp commander obliged; they were moved to the attics. By the end of July 1941, there were more than 500 officers: over 250 French, 150 Polish, 50 British and Commonwealth, 2 Yugoslavian. In April 1941, a French officer, [[Alain Le Ray]], become the first prisoner ever to escape from the Colditz Castle.\n\nOn 24 July 1941, 68 Dutch officers arrived, mostly members of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, who had refused to sign a declaration that they would take no part in the war against Germany. According to the German Security Officer, Captain [[Reinhold Eggers]], the Dutch officers appeared to be model prisoners at first. Importantly for other internees in the camp, among the 68 Dutch was [[Hans Larive]] with his knowledge of the [[Singen]] route. This route into Switzerland was discovered by Larive in 1940 on his first escape attempt from an Oflag in Soest. Larive was caught at the Swiss border near Singen. The interrogating Gestapo officer was so confident the war would soon be won by Germany that he told Larive the safe way across the border near Singen. Larive did not forget and many prisoners later escaped using this route.<ref>''Larive; the man who came in from Colditz'', Leo de hartog; officieren achter prikkeldraad 1940-1945</ref>\n\nWithin days after their arrival, the Dutch escape officer, Captain [[Machiel van den Heuvel]], planned and executed his first of many escape plans. On 13 August 1941 the first two Dutchmen escaped successfully from the castle followed by many more of which six officers made it to England. Afterwards a number of would-be escapees would borrow Dutch [[Trench coat|greatcoat]]s as their disguise. When the Wehrmacht invaded the Netherlands they were short of material for uniforms, so they confiscated anything available. The coats in Dutch field [[grey]] in particular remained unchanged in colour, since it was similar to the tone already in use by the Germans, thus these greatcoats would be nearly identical with very minor alterations.\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ais.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Some of the French officers held at Colditz]]\n\nIn May 1943, the Wehrmacht High Command decided that Colditz should house only Americans and British, so in June the Dutch were moved out, followed shortly thereafter by the Poles, the Belgians, and the French; with the final French group leaving 12 July 1943. By the end of July there were a few [[Free French Forces|Free French]] officers, and 228 British officers, with a contingent consisting of Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Irish, and one Indian.\n\nOn 23 August 1944 Colditz received its first Americans: 49-year-old Colonel [[Florimund Duke]] \u2014 the oldest American paratrooper of the war, Captain [[Guy Nunn]], and [[Alfred Suarez]]. They were all counter-intelligence operatives parachuted into Hungary to prevent it joining forces with Germany.

[[Adolf Hitler]] himself specified that Romilly was to be treated with the utmost care and that:\n\n# ''The Kommandant and Security Officer answer for Romilly's security with their heads.''\n# ''His security is to be assured by any and every exceptional measure you care to take.''\n\n[[File:PicOf 4C Prominente.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Members of the Prominente, under a U.S. guard, outside the [[Hungerberg]] Hotel on May 5, 1945, shortly after their release.

Eventually there were [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|Lord Lascelles]] and [[John Elphinstone, 17th Lord Elphinstone|Lord Elphinstone]], nephews of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth; Captain The [[George Haig, 2nd Earl Haig|Lord Haig]], son of [[World War I]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Douglas Haig]]; [[Charles William Frederick Hope, 3rd Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]], son of [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Linlithgow]], the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]]; Lieutenant [[John Winant Jr.]], son of [[John Gilbert Winant]], [[Ambassadors from the United States|US ambassador to Britain]]; [[Tadeusz B\u00f3r-Komorowski]], commander of [[Armia Krajowa]] and the [[Warsaw Uprising]]; and five other Polish generals.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hostages at Colditz|first1=Giles|last1=Romilly|first2=Michael|last2=Alexander|publisher=Sphere Books|year=1973|isbn=0-7221-7463-2|page=138}}</ref> [[British Commandos|British Commando]] [[Michael Alexander (soldier)|Michael Alexander]] claimed to be a nephew of field marshal [[Harold Alexander]] in order to escape execution, but was merely a distant cousin.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\n[[Micky Burn]], another well-known inmate of Colditz, was a British commando captured at [[Saint-Nazaire]]. Burn had been a journalist like Romilly before the war, working for ''The Times''. Burn had briefly been an admirer of the Nazi Party and in 1936 had met Adolf Hitler, who signed his copy of ''Mein Kampf''. After war broke out Burn shifted politically to Marxism and gave lectures to prisoners at Colditz, but due to his pre-war interest in Nazi philosophy he was widely regarded with distrust and scorn.\n\n[[John Arundell, 16th Baron Arundell of Wardour]] (1907\u20131944) was an aristocrat held at Colditz who, despite his pedigree, was not awarded ''Prominente'' status. Arundell made a habit of exercising in the winter snow; he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and died in Chester Military Hospital.\n\nAnother officer, not listed as among the ''Prominente'' but who became famous after the end of the war, was French military chaplain and Catholic priest [[Yves Congar]], who was captured as a POW and later sent there after repeated attempts to escape. He became a noted theologian and was made [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1994, at age 90.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bernardi|first=Peter J.|title=A Passion for Unity|url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/526/article/passion-unity|work=America Magazine|publisher=America Magazine|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt 1:30&nbsp;a.m. on 13 April 1945, while the final battles of the war approached the area, the ''Prominente'' were moved under guard and the cover of darkness. The Allies and prisoners became especially concerned that the ''Prominente'' might be used as hostages, bargaining chips and [[human shield]]s, or that the SS might try to kill them out of spite; they prepared for resistance and, if possible, to take over the castle. The Germans moved all the ''Prominente'' out of the castle, over the protestations of the other prisoners. When U.S. troops reached the area, the prisoners persuaded the leader of their guards, ''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Gottlob Berger]], to surrender in secret in order to save him from the revenge of the SS. With his aid they reached American lines a couple of weeks later. He would later receive a lessened sentence after his hearing in 1949 because of his actions regarding the ''Prominente''.\n\n==German staff and visitors==\n[[File:Ordonnances.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A group of the French orderlies from Colditz Castle poses for a picture in the inner courtyard.]]\n\nKeeping the castle running in a secure and efficient manner was a difficult task, and the Germans maintained a larger garrison at the castle than at many of their other prison camps. Between the years 1939 and 1945 more than 70 German officers and enlisted men worked in a wide variety of staff positions, as well as overseeing prisoners' labour.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\nThere was also a large contingent of civilians and local townspeople who worked on the castle grounds. Some were in maintenance, some in medical roles, some were there in a supervisory role ([[Nazi Party]] leaders, Swiss Red Cross observers, etc.). Some family members of the German military officers lived at the camp.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\n===Security officers===\n* Captain [[Paul Priem]] was the first Security Officer. Pat Reid said he \"possessed a rare quality among Germans \u2013 a sense of humour\".<ref>P.R. Reid, MBE, MC, ''Colditz: The Colditz Story & The Latter Days of Colditz'', Coronet, 1985, p. 74</ref>\n* Captain [[Reinhold Eggers]] was Security Officer from November 1940 until April 1945, promoted to chief of security in 1944. He was also the only English-speaker among the Germans at Colditz, thus was involved in every interaction with the prisoners or between the Senior Officers and the Kommandant serving as translator.<ref name = \"eggers\">http://www.herofiles.org/resources/books.shtml</ref> Dutchman Lieutenant [[Damiaen J. van Doorninck]] said of him, \"This man was our opponent, but nevertheless he earned our respect by his correct attitude, self-control and total lack of rancour despite all the harassment we gave him.\"\n\n===Kommandants===\n* Oberst Schmidt 1939 \u2013 August 1941\n* Oberst Glaesche 1 August 1942 \u2013 13 February 1943\n* Oberst Prawitt 14 February 1943 \u2013 15 April 1945<ref>Reid, ''Colditz: The Full Story'' p325</ref>\n\n==Life in the camp==\nIn Colditz, the Wehrmacht followed the [[Geneva Convention]].<ref>\"Colditz: The Legend\" Yesterday TV, 12:00 pm, 6 Dec 2010</ref> Would-be escapees were punished with solitary confinement, instead of being summarily executed. In principle, the security officers recognized that it was the duty of the POWs to try to escape and that their own job was to stop them. Prisoners could even form [[gentlemen's agreement]]s with the guards, such as not using borrowed tools for escape attempts.\n\nMost of the guard company was composed of World War I veterans and young soldiers not fit for the front. Because Colditz was a high security camp, the Germans organized three and then later four ''Appells'' (roll calls) per day to count the prisoners. If they discovered someone had escaped, they alerted every police and train station within a {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius, and many local members of the Hitler Youth would help to recapture any escapees.\n\nBecause of the number of Red Cross food parcels, prisoners sometimes ate better than their guards, who had to rely on Wehrmacht rations. Prisoners could use their relative luxuries for trade and, for example, exchange their cigarettes for German ''[[Reichsmark]]s'' that they hoped could later use in their escape attempts. Occasionally this turned out to be a mistake as several of the bills they received were of the earlier ''[[German papiermark|Papiermark]]'' varieties that were no longer considered valid. There were also other currencies in circulation, including the ''[[Registermark]]'', utilized for travelling and investments in Germany; the ''[[Reisemark]]'', for tourists; the ''[[Kreditsperrmark]]'', for sales of property belonging to foreigners; the ''[[Effektensperrmark]]'', arising from the sale of securities in Germany; the ''[[Reichskreditkassenschein]]'' in occupied territories; and the ''[[Behelfszahlungsmittel]]'' (Auxiliary Payment Certificates) for the German Armed Forces. The ''Kreditsperrmark'' and ''Effektensperrmark'' were consolidated into the ''[[Handelsperrmark]]'' in 1939. Because of the massive variety of currency types and uses, in several escape attempts, escapees with one of these various currencies printed before 1939 were told their money was no good \u2014 leaving them moneyless and easier to recapture.\n\nPrisoners had to make their own entertainment. In August 1941 the first camp [[1940 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] were organized by the Polish prisoners. Events were held in football (soccer), volleyball, boxing, and chess, but the closing ceremony was interrupted by a German fire drill. \"The British came in last place in every event cheerfully, to the dismay of the other participants who took the competition deadly seriously,\" according to the British inmate John Wilkens in a 1986 interview. Prisoners also formed a Polish [[choir]], a Dutch Hawaiian [[guitar]] band, and a French [[orchestra]].<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\nThe British put on homemade revues, classical plays and farces including: ''[[Gaslight (play)|Gaslight]]'', ''[[Rope (play)|Rope]]'', ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'', ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. Several prisoners intentionally grew their hair long so as better to portray female roles. Prisoner [[Jock Hamilton-Baillie]] used to shave his legs, rub them in brown shoe polish, and draw a line down the back of his legs in pencil to simulate the appearance of silk stockings. This allowed him special \"bath privileges\" in the German guards washroom, since the prisoners' showers were unable to get the polish off his legs. Staging these plays even gained the prisoners access to \"parole tools\", tools which were used to build the sets and promised not to be used to escape. During the summer months, the theatre's peak periods, there were new productions every two weeks. The biggest success of the theatre however would be the Christmas themed ''Ballet Nonsense'' which premiered on November 16, 1941 and ran until the November 18, 1941 show which [[Paul Priem|Hauptmann Priem]] (the first prison warden of Colditz) attended.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\nAnother pastime which occupied much of the prisoners' time was the production of [[moonshine]] alcohol. Initially started by the Polish contingent using a recipe of yeast, water, German jam and sugar from their Red Cross parcels, and then taken up by other prisoners, it did not take long for stills to be secreted all across Colditz (one of which remained undiscovered until a tourist trip in 1984). Prisoner Michael Farr, whose family ran Hawker's Gin (the sole purveyors of Sloe gin with a Royal Warrant), managed to make a sparkling wine dubbed \"Ch\u00e2teau Colditz\". Some prisoners would get black teeth or even temporary blindness from consuming this beverage \u2014 a condition known as \"jam-happy\" \u2014 as it contained many impurities. Although the German guards despised the drunken prisoners, they generally turned a blind eye to the distilling.\n\nOfficers also studied languages, learning from each other, and told stories. Most popular of these stories were the embellished retelling of BBC broadcasts by Jim Rogers. Since mail was regularly screened by censors, and the German newspapers received by prisoners contained much Nazi propaganda, the only reliable information prisoners could obtain on the progress of the war in Europe was through BBC broadcasts received via one of two radios which were secreted in the castle. These radios were smuggled in by French prisoner [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Guigues]] and named \"Arthur 1\" and \"Arthur 2\". The first radio was quickly discovered because of a mole, but the second would remain secreted until Guigues returned and removed it during a tour of the castle in 1965. The prisoners' \"Radio Laboratory\" would not be permanently exposed until 1992 during repairs to the roof.<ref>[http://www.colditz-4c.com/tour/p14/p14.htm Colditz Castle : Virtual Tour : Page 14: Attic Secrets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nLater the most popular way to pass the time was ''stoolball'', a particularly rough version of [[Rugby football|rugby]], where there were two stools at either end of the prisoners' courtyard and goals were scored by touching the opponent's stool with the ball. This game served as an outlet for pent-up aggression, and also provided noise to cover the sounds of tunnel-digging.<ref name = \"story\"/>\n\nIn addition to escape attempts, prisoners also tried to make the life of their guards more miserable by resorting to \"[[goon baiting|goon-baiting]]\", making nuisances of themselves by harassing the guards. For example, they would drop water bombs on the guards. [[Douglas Bader]] encouraged his junior officers to do the same. British Flight Lieutenant [[Pete Tunstall]] especially tried to cause havoc by disturbing the roll call even if nobody was trying to escape, so that the guards would not become suspicious when somebody was. He went through a total of five [[courts-martial]] and suffered a total of 415 days in solitary confinement.\n\n==Escape attempts==\n{{main|Attempts to escape Oflag IV-C}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nOflag IV-C provided the inspiration for both television and film because of the widely popular retellings by Pat Reid and Airey Neave. This started as early as 1955 with the release of ''[[The Colditz Story]]'', followed by ''[[The Birdmen]]'' in 1971, continuing until 2005 with the ''Colditz'' mini-series. The escape stories of Colditz Castle have inspired several board and video games, such as [[Escape from Colditz]] and [[Commandos (series)|Commandos]]. In contrast, the existence of Colditz is virtually unknown in Germany today. Eggers wrote a book based on his experiences of the German side of events.<ref>Colditz: The German Story|author=Reinhold Eggers|year=1961|publisher=Barnsley: Pen and Sword Books|Pen and Sword Military. {{ISBN|1-84415-536-6}}</ref>\n\n===Cinema===\n* ''[[The Colditz Story]]'' (1955) was a [[drama]]tic film re-enactment of life in the camp during World War II, based entirely on the books of [[Pat Reid]], directed by [[Guy Hamilton]] for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award]] in 1956. It has been called an ''\"Outstanding factual World War Two drama about Allied POW's held in Germany's most secure wartime prison.\"''<ref>[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/genres/drama/filmography/031.html The Colditz Story (1955)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Television and TV movies===\n* ''[[Escape of the Birdmen]]'' (1971) was a television movie loosely based on Pat Reid's book. This movie is of note in that it is the first movie based on Pat Reid's books to reference the Colditz glider, devised and built by Bill Goldfinch with Jack Best his partner in the construction.\n* ''[[Colditz (TV series)|Colditz]]'' (1972\u20131974) was a television drama series aired on BBC1 television. It ran for a total of 28 episodes across two seasons, progressing in time from the opening of the camp until its liberation in 1945. The first three episodes of the series acted as an introduction to the plot of the show and introduced the viewers to the three central characters by following the events that led up to their arrival at the camp. The series was a joint production between the BBC and Universal TV (an American company), but for reasons unknown, it never aired in the United States. Episodes 24 \"A Very Important Person\" and 25 \"Chameleon\" did however air in the US as a two-hour TV movie entitled ''Escape From Colditz'', in 1974. A review of the film was printed in the newspaper ''[[The News Of The World]]'', which praised it saying: ''\"It has all the realism, dignity and courage of the men it commemorates.\"'' Its more notable actors include [[Jack Hedley]] as Lieutenant Colonel John Preston from 1972\u201374, [[Edward Hardwicke]] as Captain Pat Grant from 1972\u201373, [[Robert Wagner]] as Major Phil Carrington from 1972\u201374, [[David McCallum]] as Flight Lieutenant Simon Carter from 1972\u201374, and [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as Lieutenant Colonel Max Dodd in 1974.\n* ''Escape from Colditz'' (2001) is a British television movie.\n* [[Colditz (miniseries)|''Colditz'' (2005)]] was a mini-series on [[ITV1]], based on Henry Chancellor's book ''Colditz: The Definitive History'', directed by [[Stuart Orme]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2904071.stm | work=BBC News | title=Colditz drama planned for ITV | date=31 March 2003}}</ref> This tale is much more fictional than its predecessors, with fictional characters and situations that are merely based on real people and events.<ref>\n[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/151/151924_damians_marriage_escape.html \"Damian's marriage escape\"]</ref> It features [[Jason Priestley]] (''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'') as Rhett Barker, [[James Fox]] as Lt.
