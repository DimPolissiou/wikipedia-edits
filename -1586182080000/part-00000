Like bobsleigh, but unlike luge, the race begins with a running start from the opening gate at the top of the course. The skeleton sled is thinner and heavier than the luge sled, and skeleton affords the rider more control, making it safer than luge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shape.com/blogs/shape-your-life/luge-vs-skeleton-racing-whats-difference|title=How Are Luge and Skeleton Racing Different?|date=23 January 2014|website=Shape.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref> Skeleton is the slowest of the three sliding sports, as skeleton's face-down, head-first riding position is less aerodynamic than luge's face-up, feet-first ride.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/winter-olympics-2018-luge-skeleton-bobsled-difference-explained|title=Here's How You Can Tell the Difference Between Luge, Skeleton, and Bobsled|first=Dustin|last=Nelson|date=19 February 2018|website=Thrillist.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, skeleton appeared in the Olympic program in [[St.&nbsp;Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in [[Skeleton at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] and again in [[Skeleton at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948]].<ref name=\"SMTC\"/> It was added permanently to the Olympic program for the [[Skeleton at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]], at which stage a women's race was added.\n\nDuring elite racing the rider experiences accelerations up to 5{{nbsp}}[[g-force|g]] and reaches speeds over {{cvt|130|kph}}.<ref name=\"eb\" />\n\n==History==\nThe skeleton originated in [[St. Moritz, Switzerland|St.&nbsp;Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], as a spinoff of the popular British sport called [[Cresta Run|Cresta sledding]]. Although skeleton \"sliders\" use equipment similar to that of Cresta \"riders\", the two sports are different: while skeleton is run on the same track used by [[bobsled]]s and [[luge]], Cresta is run on Cresta-specific sledding tracks only. Skeleton sleds are steered using torque provided by the head and shoulders. The Cresta toboggan does not have a steering or braking mechanism, though Cresta riders use rakes on their boots in addition to shifting body weight to help [[Steering|steer]] and [[brake]].\n\nThe sport of skeleton can be traced to 1882, when English soldiers constructed a [[toboggan]] track between the towns of [[Davos]] and [[Klosters]] in [[Switzerland]]. While toboggan tracks were not uncommon at the time, the added challenge of curves and bends in the Swiss track distinguished it from those of Canada and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"FIBT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fibt.com/skeleton/history.html |title=History |publisher=Fibt.com |date=1999-10-02 |accessdate=2014-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214001619/http://www.fibt.com/skeleton/history.html |archivedate=14 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The source of the word is debated; some speculating the skeleton-like appearance original sleds, and others an incorrectly [[anglicized]] version of the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word for toboggan, \"Kjaelke\".\n\nApproximately {{convert|30|km|-1|abbr=on}} away in the winter sports town of St.&nbsp;Moritz, British men had long enjoyed racing one another down the busy, winding streets of the town, causing an uproar among citizens because of the danger to pedestrians and visiting tourists. In 1884, Major William Bulpett, with the backing of winter sports pioneer and [[Kulm (district)|Kulm]] hotel owner [[Caspar Badrutt]], constructed [[Cresta Run]], the first sledding track of its kind in St.&nbsp;Moritz.<ref name=\"BBSA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bobskeleton.org.uk/index.php?item=55 |title=British Bob Skeleton Association |accessdate=2007-07-18 }}</ref> The track ran three-quarters of a mile from St.&nbsp;Moritz to [[Celerina/Schlarigna|Celerina]] and contained ten turns still used today.

This opened the door to other national skeleton competitions including the [[Austria]]n championship held the following year. In 1908 and 1910, skeleton competitions were held in the [[Semmering Pass]].<ref name=\"FIBT\"/> As the popularity of the sport grew, skeleton evolved into the sport recognized today. In 1892, the sled was transformed by L.&nbsp;P. Child, an Englishman. The newly designed bare-bones sled resembled a human skeleton, and the sport adopted its modern name of skeleton, though it is still recognized as tobogganing in many countries.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/>\n\nIn 1923, the [[Federation Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing]] (FIBT) was established as the governing body of the sport. Soon afterward, in 1926, the [[International Olympic Committee]] declared bobsleigh and skeleton as Olympic sports and adopted the rules of the St.&nbsp;Moritz run as the officially recognized Olympic rules.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/> It was not until 2002, however, that skeleton  returned to the Olympic Winter Games after a 54-year absence, with the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  In 2015, the FIBT was renamed the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation (IBSF), and the Congress of the IBSF adopted its current governing statutes in 2016.<ref name=\"ibsf-statutes\">{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/IBSF_Statutes_01082016.pdf | format = PDF | title = IBSF Statutes | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | date = 12 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nPopularity in the sport has grown since the 2002 Winter Olympics and now includes participation by some countries that do not have or cannot have a track because of climate, terrain or monetary limitations. Athletes from such countries as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Bermuda]], [[South Africa]], [[Argentina]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], and even the [[Virgin Islands]] have become involved with the sport in recent years.  The IBSF operates a support program for \"emerging nations\", which provides travel, coaching, and equipment funding assistance to countries which have neither a track nor three qualified pilots in three IBSF disciplines; in 2017, 20 national federations qualified for financial support in men's skeleton, and 11 qualified in women's skeleton.<ref name=\"ibsf-emerging\">{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Development/2017_2018/IBSF_Emerging_Nations_Support_Package_2017-18_am.pdf | format = PDF | title = IBSF Emerging Nations Support Package 2017/18 | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | date = 29 September 2017 | author = Pengilly, Adam}}</ref>\n\n== International competitions ==\n[[File:Lizzy Yarnold 2017 Lake Placid WC (1 of 3).jpg|thumb|[[Lizzy Yarnold]] competing in the [[2017\u201318 Skeleton World Cup|World Cup]] at Lake Placid in November 2017]]\nThe IBSF organizes four competitive circuits for international skeleton competition, in three tiers: two Continental Cups, the Intercontinental Cup (ICC), and the top level [[Skeleton World Cup|World Cup]].  Each athlete receives points based on their results and the level of the competition, which are used to determine both their rankings on each circuit they race in and also an overall ranking across all four circuits.\n\nNational federations are assigned athlete quota spots in the higher levels according to the overall rankings of their individual athletes during the previous season, but are free to send any qualified athlete to a competition in which they have available quota.  However, individual athletes' discipline rankings are used to determine the start order for the first heat of each race: the track becomes less smooth after each successive run, so earlier starts are more desirable.<ref name=\"rules-2017\">{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | title = International Skeleton Rules 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Rules/2017_2018/2017_International_Rules_SKELETON.pdf | format = PDF | date = September 2017}}</ref> In the second (fourth at the World Championships and Winter Olympics) heat, the competitors start in reverse order of their ranking after the previous heat.  (At four-heat races, start order in heats two and three is in ascending order of combined time from the prior heats.)\n\nIn addition to the four race series, the IBSF also organizes World Championships, which are held at the end of every sliding season except when the [[Olympic Winter Games]] are held, and a Junior World Championships (open to athletes aged 23 and under) which are held annually without regard to the Olympics.  One race each World Cup season is also designated the European Championship.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>  The IBSF cooperates with the International Olympic Committee to supervise the skeleton races at the Olympic Winter Games, and the IBSF ranking system is used to determine the National Olympic Committees' athlete quota allocations.\n\nOn all of the regular competitive circuits, the race days are preceded by three or four days of pre-race training to allow athletes to learn the intricacies of each track, and each athlete must complete a certain number of successful training runs to be eligible to compete.  Normally, if the same competition also includes bobsleigh races, the skeleton races will be held first, as the heavier bobsleighs do more damage to the track.\n\n=== Continental Cups ===\nThe two Continental Cup series are the Europe Cup (also called \"Europa Cup\" and \"European Cup\") and the North American Cup.  Both series are open to athletes from all participating nations, but with some restrictions: the top 15 athletes in combined ranking are not permitted to race in the Continental Cups, and athletes are not permitted to race unless their team has filled all of its assigned quota sports in the World Cup.  In addition, teams are limited to four athletes on their home continent and two athletes on the other continent.  (For the purposes of this restriction, African teams are considered to be home on the Europe Cup and Asian, Oceanian, and South American teams are home on the North American Cup.)<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>\n\nAs the bottom level of international skeleton competition, race results in the Continental Cups are assigned the lowest point values for ranking, with a first-place finish being with 75 points (compared to 120 points for the Intercontinental Cup and 225 points for the World Cup).  Only the top 30 athletes receive ranking points; 30th place is worth 1 point.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>  However, two races are generally held in each discipline on a single race weekend, allowing consistently competitive athletes to earn a higher ranking than if they went to a single World Cup race and finished poorly.\n\n=== Intercontinental Cup ===\nThe Intercontinental Cup (ICC) was introduced as an intermediate level between the Continental Cups and the World Cup; a first-place finish is worth 120 points in the IBSF ranking (vs. 225 points for a World Cup win).  Teams with three athletes in the top 60 (top 45 for women) of the IBSF overall ranking for the previous year may send three athletes (not necessarily the same ones) to each ICC race; teams with two athletes in the top 75 (top 60 for women) may send two; and all other teams may send one athlete each.  In order to be eligible to race in the ICC, athletes must have received a ranking in at least five IBSF competitions at three different tracks in the previous two years.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>\n\n=== World Cup ===\n{{main|Skeleton World Cup}}\n\nThe World Cup is the top level of international skeleton competition, and has the most stringent team quotas, with no teams receiving an automatic entry.  To qualify, a team must have placed at least one athlete in the top 60 of the overall ranking table (top 45 for women); teams with two athletes in the top 50 (top 35 for women) receive two quota spots, and teams with three athletes in the top 30 (top 25 for women) receive three.  The same athlete experience requirements as apply to the ICC also apply to the World Cup.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>  At the end of the World Cup season, the man and woman with the highest ranking, considering only points earned in World Cup races, are given a trophy known as the \"Crystal Globe\".\n\n=== Continental Championships ===\nOne World Cup race a year may be designated as a continental championship for the continent on which it is held.  This championship is a \"paper\" race, based only on the times in the regularly scheduled World Cup event, with the athletes representing a different continent excluded.  Currently, this is done only in Europe; the 2017/18 European Championship races were the World Cup races held on 15 December 2017 at [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].  The current European champions are [[Martins Dukurs]] of Latvia<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-17 | title = European Championship (Men's Skeleton) | date = 15 December 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/169809 | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation}}</ref> and [[Elena Nikitina]] of Russia.<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-17 | title = European Championship (Women's Skeleton) | date = 15 December 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/169810 | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation}}</ref>\n\n=== Senior World Championships ===\n{{for|a list of past winners|Skeleton World Championships}}\n\nIn non-Olympic years, a national federation volunteers to organize the (Senior) World Championships (for both bobsleigh and skeleton), which are open to all athletes meeting the experience requirements that apply to the World Cup and the ICC (including junior athletes).  The quota system for the Senior World Championships is the same as for the World Cup, except that all national federations are entitled to send one athlete.  The defending Junior World Champion in each discipline also receives an automatic entry.  Unlike all other IBSF-sponsored races, the World Championships use a two-day, four-heat format, with rankings determined by total time for all four heats.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>\n\nThe 2016/17 World Championships were held at [[K\u00f6nigssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track]] in [[Bavaria]], 24\u201326 February 2017.

Junior athletes are those who are under 23 years of age, or who turn 23 at some point during the competitive season.  All countries are entitled to send up to three athletes to the Junior World Championships, subject to the requirement that each entrant must have finished at least three IBSF sanctioned competitions on at least two tracks in the previous two years.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>\n\nThe 2017\u201318 Junior World Championships were held on 25 January 2018 in [[St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun|St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], and the winners were [[Anna Fernst\u00e4dt]] of Germany and [[Nikita Tregubov]] of Russia.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation | accessdate = 2018-02-02 | date = 25 January 2018 | title = Skeleton Athletes Anna Fernst\u00e4dt and Nikita Tregubov Junior World Champions | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/news/9-skeleton/20497-skeleton-athletes-anna-fernstaedt-and-nikita-tregubov-junior-world-champions}}</ref>\n\n=== Olympic Winter Games ===\n{{main|Skeleton at the Winter Olympics}}\n\nThe skeleton event in the Winter Olympics uses the same two-day, four-heat format as the World Championships, but team quotas are significantly smaller.  The International Olympic Committee assigns athlete quotas to national Olympic committees in cooperation with the IBSF and using the IBSF ranking system to determine qualification; 20 women and 30 men competed at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in Pyeongchang, Korea, with one automatic quota going to the host country (Korea) for each gender.  For men, three countries received three quota spots each, six were allocated two spots, and five got one; for women, two countries received three spots, four got two, and two got one.  The ranking of the countries for quota assignment was based on their third-highest, second-highest, or highest ranked athlete in total IBSF ranking over the qualification period.  In addition, three quota spots are reserved for countries whose continent did not receive any representation based on this assignment procedure.\n\nNational Olympic Committees may send athletes other than the ones whose rankings earned the quota spot, but the athletes chosen must be ranked in the top 60 (for men) or top 45 (for women) on the IBSF list and meet similar experience requirements to those that apply to the World Cup.<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | title = Qualification System for the XXIII Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018: Skeleton | date = 17 May 2016 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Quotas/2016_17/2016-05-17_-_PyeongChang_2018_Qualification_System_-_Skeleton_V1.1.pdf}}</ref> However, IBSF rule 4.1 provides that, for the purposes of determining the top 60 (or top 45) qualification, lower-ranking athletes from countries which have already received a full quota are \"cleaned\" from the list before an athlete's ordinal ranking is determined<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>  This had the effect of allowing continental representatives for Africa into the 2018 games, as they would otherwise have been too low on the ranking list to qualify (notably, Nigerian slider [[Simidele Adeagbo]] was ranked 74th before cleaning,<ref>{{cite web | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation | title = Standings (2017/2018) (Women's skeleton) (IBSF ranking) | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/rankings/rankings?season=2017&ctype=6&session= | accessdate = 2018-02-02}}</ref> but was in the top 45 after application of rule 4.1).\n\n==Sport==\nThe accessibility of skeleton to [[Amateur sports|amateurs]] may have been the catalyst for its upswing in popularity. Most notably, [[Nino Bibbia]], a fruit and vegetable merchant from [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland, took Olympic gold at the 1948 event.<ref name=\"BBSA\" /> With the advent of the first artificially refrigerated track in 1969 at [[K\u00f6nigssee]]/[[Berchtesgaden]], [[Germany]], athletes are currently able to practice the sport regardless of weather conditions.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title =Skeleton, in winter sports |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref> The sport is also promoted by skeleton officials as a gateway sport to \u201ctrain young, aspiring athletes\u2026for their future career in bobsleigh.\u201d<ref name=\"FIBT\"/>\n\n===Track===\n{{main|List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks}}\n\n===Sled===\n\u201cThe \u2018toboggans\u2019 used in [[Alpine states|Alpine countries]] at the end of the 19th century were inspired by Canadian/Indian sleds used for transport\u201d.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/> Various additions and redesigning efforts by athletes have led to the skeleton sleds used today. In 1892, L.&nbsp;P. Child introduced the \u201cAmerica\u201d, a new metal sled that revolutionized skeleton as a sport. The stripped-down design provided a compact sled with metal runners, and the design caught on quickly. In 1902, Arden Bott added a sliding seat to help athletes shift their weight forward and backward, a feature that is no longer included on modern sleds.\n\nIn 2010, the FIBT restricted the materials with which skeleton sleds are permitted to be made. Sled frames must be made of steel and may not include steering or braking mechanisms. The base plate, however, may be made of plastics. The handles and bumpers found along the sides of the sled help secure the athlete during a run.<ref name=\"rules\">{{cite book |title= IBSF International Skeleton Rules |year= 2015 |url=http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/2015_International_Rules_SKELETON.pdf |format= pdf |accessdate= 2017-03-19 }}</ref>\n\nFurther specifications are included in the FIBT ruling regarding sled dimensions:<ref name=\"FIBT\"/><ref name=\"rules\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

-sleigh), down a frozen track while lying [[Prone position|face down and head-first]]. The sport and the sled may have been named from the bony appearance of the sled.<ref name=\"eb\">{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547402/skeleton-sledding |title= Skeleton sledding| work= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]| access-date= 2013-07-23}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other sliding sports of [[bobsleigh]] and [[luge]], the race always involves single riders. Like bobsleigh, but unlike luge, the race begins with a running start from the opening gate at the top of the course. The skeleton sled is thinner and heavier than the luge sled, and skeleton affords the rider more control, making it safer than luge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shape.com/blogs/shape-your-life/luge-vs-skeleton-racing-whats-difference|title=How Are Luge and Skeleton Racing Different?|date=23 January 2014|website=Shape.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref> Skeleton is the slowest of the three sliding sports, as skeleton's face-down, head-first riding position is less aerodynamic than luge's face-up, feet-first ride.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/winter-olympics-2018-luge-skeleton-bobsled-difference-explained|title=Here's How You Can Tell the Difference Between Luge, Skeleton, and Bobsled|first=Dustin|last=Nelson|date=19 February 2018|website=Thrillist.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, skeleton appeared in the Olympic program in [[St.&nbsp;Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in [[Skeleton at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] and again in [[Skeleton at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948]].<ref name=\"SMTC\"/> It was added permanently to the Olympic program for the [[Skeleton at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]], at which stage a women's race was added.\n\nDuring elite racing the rider experiences accelerations up to 5{{nbsp}}[[g-force|g]] and reaches speeds over {{cvt|130|kph}}.<ref name=\"eb\" />\n\n==History==\nThe skeleton originated in [[St. Moritz, Switzerland|St.&nbsp;Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], as a spinoff of the popular British sport called [[Cresta Run|Cresta sledding]]. Although skeleton \"sliders\" use equipment similar to that of Cresta \"riders\", the two sports are different: while skeleton is run on the same track used by [[bobsled]]s and [[luge]], Cresta is run on Cresta-specific sledding tracks only. Skeleton sleds are steered using torque provided by the head and shoulders. The Cresta toboggan does not have a steering or braking mechanism, though Cresta riders use rakes on their boots in addition to shifting body weight to help [[Steering|steer]] and [[brake]].\n\nThe sport of skeleton can be traced to 1882, when English soldiers constructed a [[toboggan]] track between the towns of [[Davos]] and [[Klosters]] in [[Switzerland]]. While toboggan tracks were not uncommon at the time, the added challenge of curves and bends in the Swiss track distinguished it from those of Canada and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"FIBT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fibt.com/skeleton/history.html |title=History |publisher=Fibt.com |date=1999-10-02 |accessdate=2014-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214001619/http://www.fibt.com/skeleton/history.html |archivedate=14 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The source of the word is debated; some speculating the skeleton-like appearance original sleds, and others an incorrectly [[anglicized]] version of the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word for toboggan, \"Kjaelke\".\n\nApproximately {{convert|30|km|-1|abbr=on}} away in the winter sports town of St.&nbsp;Moritz, British men had long enjoyed racing one another down the busy, winding streets of the town, causing an uproar among citizens because of the danger to pedestrians and visiting tourists. In 1884, Major William Bulpett, with the backing of winter sports pioneer and [[Kulm (district)|Kulm]] hotel owner [[Caspar Badrutt]], constructed [[Cresta Run]], the first sledding track of its kind in St.&nbsp;Moritz.<ref name=\"BBSA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bobskeleton.org.uk/index.php?item=55 |title=British Bob Skeleton Association |accessdate=2007-07-18 }}</ref> The track ran three-quarters of a mile from St.&nbsp;Moritz to [[Celerina/Schlarigna|Celerina]] and contained ten turns still used today. When the [[Winter Olympic Games]] were held at St.&nbsp;Moritz in [[1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] and [[1948 Winter Olympics|1948]], the Cresta Run was included in the program, marking the only two times skeleton was included as an Olympic event before its permanent addition in 2002 to the Winter Games.<ref name=\"SMTC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cresta-run.com/html/general_info.cfm |title=St. Moritz Tobogganing Club |accessdate=2007-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209005208/http://www.cresta-run.com/html/general_info.cfm |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1887 Grand National competition in St.&nbsp;Moritz, a Mr. Cornish introduced the now-traditional head-first position, a trend that was in full force by the 1890 Grand National.<ref name=\"SMTC\" /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =Skeleton Sledding |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n===International expansion===\nUntil 1905, skeleton was practiced mainly in Switzerland; however, in 1905, [[Styria]] held its first skeleton competition in [[M\u00fcrzzuschlag]], [[Austria]]. This opened the door to other national skeleton competitions including the [[Austria]]n championship held the following year. In 1908 and 1910, skeleton competitions were held in the [[Semmering Pass]].<ref name=\"FIBT\"/> As the popularity of the sport grew, skeleton evolved into the sport recognized today. In 1892, the sled was transformed by L.&nbsp;P. Child, an Englishman. The newly designed bare-bones sled resembled a human skeleton, and the sport adopted its modern name of skeleton, though it is still recognized as tobogganing in many countries.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/>\n\nIn 1923, the [[Federation Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing]] (FIBT) was established as the governing body of the sport. Soon afterward, in 1926, the [[International Olympic Committee]] declared bobsleigh and skeleton as Olympic sports and adopted the rules of the St.&nbsp;Moritz run as the officially recognized Olympic rules.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/> It was not until 2002, however, that skeleton  returned to the Olympic Winter Games after a 54-year absence, with the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  In 2015, the FIBT was renamed the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation (IBSF), and the Congress of the IBSF adopted its current governing statutes in 2016.<ref name=\"ibsf-statutes\">{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/IBSF_Statutes_01082016.pdf | format = PDF | title = IBSF Statutes | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | date = 12 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nPopularity in the sport has grown since the 2002 Winter Olympics and now includes participation by some countries that do not have or cannot have a track because of climate, terrain or monetary limitations. Athletes from such countries as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Bermuda]], [[South Africa]], [[Argentina]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], and even the [[Virgin Islands]] have become involved with the sport in recent years.  The IBSF operates an support program for \"emerging nations\", which provides travel, coaching, and equipment funding assistance to countries which have neither a track nor three qualified pilots in three IBSF disciplines; in 2017, 20 national federations qualified for financial support in men's skeleton, and 11 qualified in women's skeleton.<ref name=\"ibsf-emerging\">{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Development/2017_2018/IBSF_Emerging_Nations_Support_Package_2017-18_am.pdf | format = PDF | title = IBSF Emerging Nations Support Package 2017/18 | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | date = 29 September 2017 | author = Pengilly, Adam}}</ref>\n\n== International competitions ==\n[[File:Lizzy Yarnold 2017 Lake Placid WC (1 of 3).jpg|thumb|[[Lizzy Yarnold]] competing in the [[2017\u201318 Skeleton World Cup|World Cup]] at Lake Placid in November 2017]]\nThe IBSF organizes four competitive circuits for international skeleton competition, in three tiers: two Continental Cups, the Intercontinental Cup (ICC), and the top level [[Skeleton World Cup|World Cup]].  Each athlete receives points based on their results and the level of the competition, which are used to determine both their rankings on each circuit they race in and also an overall ranking across all four circuits.\n\nNational federations are assigned athlete quota spots in the higher levels according to the overall rankings of their individual athletes during the previous season, but are free to send any qualified athlete to a competition in which they have available quota.  However, individual athletes' discipline rankings are used to determine the start order for the first heat of each race: the track becomes less smooth after each successive run, so earlier starts are more desirable.<ref name=\"rules-2017\">{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | title = International Skeleton Rules 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Rules/2017_2018/2017_International_Rules_SKELETON.pdf | format = PDF | date = September 2017}}</ref> In the second (fourth at the World Championships and Winter Olympics) heat, the competitors start in reverse order of their ranking after the previous heat.  (At four-heat races, start order in heats two and three is in ascending order of combined time from the prior heats.)\n\nIn addition to the four race series, the IBSF also organizes World Championships, which are held at the end of every sliding season except when the [[Olympic Winter Games]] are held, and a Junior World Championships (open to athletes aged 23 and under) which are held annually without regard to the Olympics.  One race each World Cup season is also designated the European Championship.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>  The IBSF cooperates with the International Olympic Committee to supervise the skeleton races at the Olympic Winter Games, and the IBSF ranking system is used to determine the National Olympic Committees' athlete quota allocations.\n\nOn all of the regular competitive circuits, the race days are preceded by three or four days of pre-race training to allow athletes to learn the intricacies of each track, and each athlete must complete a certain number of successful training runs to be eligible to compete.  Normally, if the same competition also includes bobsleigh races, the skeleton races will be held first, as the heavier bobsleighs do more damage to the track.\n\n=== Continental Cups ===\nThe two Continental Cup series are the Europe Cup (also called \"Europa Cup\" and \"European Cup\") and the North American Cup.  Both series are open to athletes from all participating nations, but with some restrictions: the top 15 athletes in combined ranking are not permitted to race in the Continental Cups, and athletes are not permitted to race unless their team has filled all of its assigned quota sports in the World Cup.  In addition, teams are limited to four athletes on their home continent and two athletes on the other continent.  (For the purposes of this restriction, African teams are considered to be home on the Europe Cup and Asian, Oceanian, and South American teams are home on the North American Cup.)<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>\n\nAs the bottom level of international skeleton competition, race results in the Continental Cups are assigned the lowest point values for ranking, with a first-place finish being with 75 points (compared to 120 points for the Intercontinental Cup and 225 points for the World Cup).  Only the top 30 athletes receive ranking points; 30th place is worth 1 point.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>  However, two races are generally held in each discipline on a single race weekend, allowing consistently competitive athletes to earn a higher ranking than if they went to a single World Cup race and finished poorly.\n\n=== Intercontinental Cup ===\nThe Intercontinental Cup (ICC) was introduced as an intermediate level between the Continental Cups and the World Cup; a first-place finish is worth 120 points in the IBSF ranking (vs. 225 points for a World Cup win).  Teams with three athletes in the top 60 (top 45 for women) of the IBSF overall ranking for the previous year may send three athletes (not necessarily the same ones) to each ICC race; teams with two athletes in the top 75 (top 60 for women) may send two; and all other teams may send one athlete each.  In order to be eligible to race in the ICC, athletes must have received a ranking in at least five IBSF competitions at three different tracks in the previous two years.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>\n\n=== World Cup ===\n{{main|Skeleton World Cup}}\n\nThe World Cup is the top level of international skeleton competition, and has the most stringent team quotas, with no teams receiving an automatic entry.  To qualify, a team must have placed at least one athlete in the top 60 of the overall ranking table (top 45 for women); teams with two athletes in the top 50 (top 35 for women) receive two quota spots, and teams with three athletes in the top 30 (top 25 for women) receive three.  The same athlete experience requirements as apply to the ICC also apply to the World Cup.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>  At the end of the World Cup season, the man and woman with the highest ranking, considering only points earned in World Cup races, are given a trophy known as the \"Crystal Globe\".\n\n=== Continental Championships ===\nOne World Cup race a year may be designated as a continental championship for the continent on which it is held.  This championship is a \"paper\" race, based only on the times in the regularly scheduled World Cup event, with the athletes representing a different continent excluded.  Currently, this is done only in Europe; the 2017/18 European Championship races were the World Cup races held on 15 December 2017 at [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].  The current European champions are [[Martins Dukurs]] of Latvia<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-17 | title = European Championship (Men's Skeleton) | date = 15 December 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/169809 | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation}}</ref> and [[Elena Nikitina]] of Russia.<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-17 | title = European Championship (Women's Skeleton) | date = 15 December 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/169810 | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation}}</ref>\n\n=== Senior World Championships ===\n{{for|a list of past winners|Skeleton World Championships}}\n\nIn non-Olympic years, a national federation volunteers to organize the (Senior) World Championships (for both bobsleigh and skeleton), which are open to all athletes meeting the experience requirements that apply to the World Cup and the ICC (including junior athletes).  The quota system for the Senior World Championships is the same as for the World Cup, except that all national federations are entitled to send one athlete.  The defending Junior World Champion in each discipline also receives an automatic entry.  Unlike all other IBSF-sponsored races, the World Championships use a two-day, four-heat format, with rankings determined by total time for all four heats.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>\n\nThe 2016/17 World Championships were held at [[K\u00f6nigssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track]] in [[Bavaria]], 24\u201326 February 2017.  [[Martins Dukurs]] of Latvia won the men's competition<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | date = 26 February 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/168617 | title = World Championship}}</ref> and [[Jacqueline L\u00f6lling]] of Germany won the women's competition.<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | date = 25 February 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/168615 | title = World Championship}}</ref>  Because 2018 was an Olympic year, no World Championships were held for the 2017/18 season.\n\n=== Junior World Championships ===\nThe Junior World Championships are held every year, but are scheduled to avoid conflict with the Olympics and the Senior World Championships.  Junior athletes are those who are under 23 years of age, or who turn 23 at some point during the competitive season.  All countries are entitled to send up to three athletes to the Junior World Championships, subject to the requirement that each entrant must have finished at least three IBSF sanctioned competitions on at least two tracks in the previous two years.<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>\n\nThe 2017\u201318 Junior World Championships were held on 25 January 2018 in [[St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun|St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], and the winners were [[Anna Fernst\u00e4dt]] of Germany and [[Nikita Tregubov]] of Russia.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation | accessdate = 2018-02-02 | date = 25 January 2018 | title = Skeleton Athletes Anna Fernst\u00e4dt and Nikita Tregubov Junior World Champions | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/news/9-skeleton/20497-skeleton-athletes-anna-fernstaedt-and-nikita-tregubov-junior-world-champions}}</ref>\n\n=== Olympic Winter Games ===\n{{main|Skeleton at the Winter Olympics}}\n\nThe skeleton event in the Winter Olympics uses the same two-day, four-heat format as the World Championships, but team quotas are significantly smaller.  The International Olympic Committee assigns athlete quotas to national Olympic committees in cooperation with the IBSF and using the IBSF ranking system to determine qualification; 20 women and 30 men competed at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in Pyeongchang, Korea, with one automatic quota going to the host country (Korea) for each gender.  For men, three countries received three quota spots each, six were allocated two spots, and five got one; for women, two countries received three spots, four got two, and two got one.  The ranking of the countries for quota assignment was based on their third-highest, second-highest, or highest ranked athlete in total IBSF ranking over the qualification period.  In addition, three quota spots are reserved for countries whose continent did not receive any representation based on this assignment procedure.\n\nNational Olympic Committees may send athletes other than the ones whose rankings earned the quota spot, but the athletes chosen must be ranked in the top 60 (for men) or top 45 (for women) on the IBSF list and meet similar experience requirements to those that apply to the World Cup.<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation | title = Qualification System for the XXIII Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018: Skeleton | date = 17 May 2016 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Quotas/2016_17/2016-05-17_-_PyeongChang_2018_Qualification_System_-_Skeleton_V1.1.pdf}}</ref> However, IBSF rule 4.1 provides that, for the purposes of determining the top 60 (or top 45) qualification, lower-ranking athletes from countries which have already received a full quota are \"cleaned\" from the list before an athlete's ordinal ranking is determined<ref name=\"rules-2017\"/>  This had the effect of allowing continental representatives for Africa into the 2018 games, as they would otherwise have been too low on the ranking list to qualify (notably, Nigerian slider [[Simidele Adeagbo]] was ranked 74th before cleaning,<ref>{{cite web | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation | title = Standings (2017/2018) (Women's skeleton) (IBSF ranking) | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/rankings/rankings?season=2017&ctype=6&session= | accessdate = 2018-02-02}}</ref> but was in the top 45 after application of rule 4.1).\n\n==Sport==\nThe accessibility of skeleton to [[Amateur sports|amateurs]] may have been the catalyst for its upswing in popularity. Most notably, [[Nino Bibbia]], a fruit and vegetable merchant from [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland, took Olympic gold at the 1948 event.<ref name=\"BBSA\" /> With the advent of the first artificially refrigerated track in 1969 at [[K\u00f6nigssee]]/[[Berchtesgaden]], [[Germany]], athletes are currently able to practice the sport regardless of weather conditions.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title =Skeleton, in winter sports |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref> The sport is also promoted by skeleton officials as a gateway sport to \u201ctrain young, aspiring athletes\u2026for their future career in bobsleigh.\u201d<ref name=\"FIBT\"/>\n\n===Track===\n{{main|List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks}}\n\n===Sled===\n\u201cThe \u2018toboggans\u2019 used in [[Alpine states|Alpine countries]] at the end of the 19th century were inspired by Canadian/Indian sleds used for transport\u201d.<ref name=\"FIBT\"/> Various additions and redesigning efforts by athletes have led to the skeleton sleds used today. In 1892, L.&nbsp;P. Child introduced the \u201cAmerica\u201d, a new metal sled that revolutionized skeleton as a sport. The stripped-down design provided a compact sled with metal runners, and the design caught on quickly. In 1902, Arden Bott added a sliding seat to help athletes shift their weight forward and backward, a feature that is no longer included on modern sleds.\n\nIn 2010, the FIBT restricted the materials with which skeleton sleds are permitted to be made. Sled frames must be made of steel and may not include steering or braking mechanisms. The base plate, however, may be made of plastics. The handles and bumpers found along the sides of the sled help secure the athlete during a run.<ref name=\"rules\">{{cite book |title= IBSF International Skeleton Rules |year= 2015 |url=http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/2015_International_Rules_SKELETON.pdf |format= pdf |accessdate= 2017-03-19 }}</ref>\n\nFurther specifications are included in the FIBT ruling regarding sled dimensions:<ref name=\"FIBT\"/><ref name=\"rules\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

She and her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}, were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing 72,800&nbsp;tonnes at full load and armed with nine {{convert|46|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} [[40 cm/45 Type 94 naval gun|Type 94]] main guns, which were the largest guns ever mounted on a warship.\n\nNamed after the ancient Japanese [[Yamato Province]], ''Yamato'' was designed to counter the numerically superior battleship fleet of the [[United States]], Japan's main rival in the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific]]. She was laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned a week after the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] in late 1941. Throughout 1942, she served as the [[flagship]] of the [[Combined Fleet]], and in June 1942 Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] directed the fleet from her bridge during the [[Battle of Midway]], a disastrous defeat for Japan. ''Musashi'' took over as the Combined Fleet flagship in early 1943, and ''Yamato'' spent the rest of the year, and much of 1944, moving between the major Japanese naval bases of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] in response to American threats. Although present at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June 1944, she played no part in the battle.\n\nThe only time ''Yamato'' fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944, when she was sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. On the verge of success, they encountered a light [[escort carrier]] group of the U.S. Navy's [[Task Force 77 (United States Navy)|Task Force 77]], \"Taffy 3\" in the [[Battle off Samar]].  So furious was Taffy 3's counter-attack, the Japanese force turned back, believing they were engaging an entire US carrier fleet instead, rather than [[Battle off Samar#Taffy 3 comes under attack|all that stood]] between the battleship and vulnerable troop transports.\n\nDuring 1944, the balance of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much depleted and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In a desperate attempt to slow the Allied advance, ''Yamato'' was dispatched on [[Operation Ten-Go|a one-way mission]] to [[Okinawa]] in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed, thus protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of [[Kyushu]] by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{Main|Yamato-class battleship}}\nDuring the 1930s the Japanese government adopted an [[ultranationalist]] militancy with a view to greatly expand the [[Japanese Empire]].<ref>Willmott (2000), p. 32.</ref> Japan withdrew from the [[League of Nations]] in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 44.</ref> After withdrawing from the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new [[Yamato-class battleship|''Yamato'' class]] of heavy battleships.

Further confirmation of Japanese intentions came around 20:00 when the Surface Special Attack Force, navigating the [[Bungo Strait]], was spotted by the American submarines {{USS|Threadfin|SS-410|2}} and {{USS|Hackleback|SS-295|2}}. Both reported ''Yamato''{{'}}s position to the main [[Fast Carrier Task Force|American carrier strike force]],<ref name=\"jackson128\" /><ref name=\"G&D60\" /> but neither could attack because of the speed of the Japanese ships\u2014{{convert|22|knot|mph km/h}}\u2014and their extreme [[zigzag]]ging.<ref name=\"G&D60\" />\n\nThe Allied forces around Okinawa braced for an assault.

The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to {{convert|24|knot|mph km/h}}, and following standard Japanese anti-aircraft defensive measures, the destroyers began circling ''Yamato''. The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12:37. ''Yahagi'' turned and raced away at {{convert|35|knot|mph km/h}} in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers; it drew off only an insignificant number. ''Yamato'' was not hit for four minutes, but at 12:41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127&nbsp;mm mount. At 12:46, another two bombs struck the battleship's port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155&nbsp;mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun. These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man survived.<ref name=\"G&D61\" />{{refn|This account is based on Garzke and Dulin's ''Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II''. Other works generally agree, although the exact timings of events can vary between sources.<ref name=\"G&D54\" />|group=N}} At 12:45 a single torpedo struck ''Yamato'' far forward on her port side, sending shock waves throughout the ship. Because many of the ship's crew who did not go down with the vessel were killed by strafing aircraft as they swam in the oily water, the details are uncertain, but authors Garzke and Dulin record that little damage was caused.<ref name=\"G&D61\" /> Shortly afterward, up to three more torpedoes struck ''Yamato''. Two impacts, on the port side near the [[engine room]] and on one of the [[boiler]] rooms, are confirmed; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in ''Yamato''{{'}}s auxiliary steering room. The attack ended around 12:47, leaving the battleship [[List (watercraft)|listing]] {{formatnum:5\u20136}}\u00b0 to port; counterflooding\u2014deliberately flooding compartments on the other side of the ship\u2014reduced the list to {{formatnum:1}}\u00b0. One boiler room had been disabled, slightly reducing ''Yamato''{{'}}s top speed, and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned ''Yamato''{{'}}s unprotected 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft weapons, sharply curtailing their effectiveness.<ref name=\"G&D61\" />\n\n[[File:Yamato damaged 7 apr 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=A large area of ocean with a warship in the middle distance.

In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew high overhead to begin their runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level. Overwhelmed by the number of targets, the battleship's anti-aircraft guns were ineffective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. ''Yamato''{{'}}s main guns were loaded with [[Beehive (anti-aircraft shell)|''Beehive'']] shells fused to explode one second after firing\u2014a mere {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ship\u2014but these had little effect. Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fire room that had already been hit, one impacted a different fire room, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a damaged outboard engine room, increasing the water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations. The fourth hit, unconfirmed, may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding reported in that location.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 62\u201363.</ref> This attack left ''Yamato'' in a perilous position, listing {{formatnum:15\u201318}}\u00b0 to port. Counterflooding of all remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to {{formatnum:10}}\u00b0, but further correction would have required repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms. Although the battleship was not yet in danger of sinking, the list meant the main battery was unable to fire and her speed was limited to {{convert|18|knots}}.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 63.</ref>\n\nThe third and most damaging attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded on the port side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fire room and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Yamato explosion.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A view of the ocean stretching to the horizon with the silhouette of a distant small warship visible to the left.

The battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering, and because of their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the [[Western Powers#Colonial \"West\"|Western Powers]] and the United States in particular. [[Shigeru Fukudome]], chief of the Operations Section of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], described the ships as \"symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy.\"<ref>Evans and Peattie (1997), pp. 298, 378.</ref> ''Yamato''{{'}}s symbolic might was such that some Japanese citizens held the belief that their country could never fall as long as the ship was able to fight.<ref>{{cite news | title = A bomb survivors leery of battleship hype | newspaper = [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] | date = 6 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\nDecades after the war, ''Yamato'' was memorialised in various forms by the Japanese. Historically, the word \"Yamato\" was used as a poetic name for Japan; thus, her name became a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.<ref>Yoshida and Minear (1985), p. xvii; Evans and Peattie (1997), p. 378.</ref><ref>Skulski (2004), p. 7.</ref> In April 1968, a memorial tower was erected at Cape Inutabu on [[Tokunoshima]], an island in the [[Amami Islands]] of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], to commemorate the lives lost in Operation Ten-Go. In October 1974, [[Leiji Matsumoto]] created a new television series, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', about rebuilding the battleship as a starship and its interstellar quest to save Earth. The series was a huge success, spawning eight feature films and four more TV series, the most recent of which was released in 2017. The series popularised the [[space opera]]. As post-war Japanese tried to redefine the purpose of their lives, ''Yamato'' became a symbol of heroism and of their desire to regain a sense of masculinity after their country's defeat in the war.<ref>Mizuno (2007), pp. 106, 110\u2013111, 121\u2013122.</ref><ref>Levi (1998), p. 72.</ref> Brought to the United States as ''[[Star Blazers]]'', the animated series proved popular and established a foundation for anime in the North American entertainment market.<ref>Wright (2009), p. 99.</ref> The motif in ''Space Battleship Yamato'' was repeated in [[The Silent Service|''Silent Service'']], a popular manga and anime that explores issues of nuclear weapons and the Japan\u2013US relationship.

She and her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}, were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing 72,800&nbsp;tonnes at full load and armed with nine {{convert|46|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} [[40 cm/45 Type 94 naval gun|Type 94]] main guns, which were the largest guns ever mounted on a warship.\n\nNamed after the ancient Japanese [[Yamato Province]], ''Yamato'' was designed to counter the numerically superior battleship fleet of the [[United States]], Japan's main rival in the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific]]. She was laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned a week after the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] in late 1941. Throughout 1942, she served as the [[flagship]] of the [[Combined Fleet]], and in June 1942 Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] directed the fleet from her bridge during the [[Battle of Midway]], a disastrous defeat for Japan. ''Musashi'' took over as the Combined Fleet flagship in early 1943, and ''Yamato'' spent the rest of the year, and much of 1944, moving between the major Japanese naval bases of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] in response to American threats. Although present at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June 1944, she played no part in the battle.\n\nThe only time ''Yamato'' fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944, when she was sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].

Further confirmation of Japanese intentions came around 20:00 when the Surface Special Attack Force, navigating the [[Bungo Strait]], was spotted by the American submarines {{USS|Threadfin|SS-410|2}} and {{USS|Hackleback|SS-295|2}}. Both reported ''Yamato''{{'}}s position to the main [[Fast Carrier Task Force|American carrier strike force]],<ref name=\"jackson128\" /><ref name=\"G&D60\" /> but neither could attack because of the speed of the Japanese ships\u2014{{convert|22|knot|mph km/h}}\u2014and their extreme [[zigzag]]ging.<ref name=\"G&D60\" />\n\nThe Allied forces around Okinawa braced for an assault. Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]] ordered six battleships already engaged in shore bombardment in the sector to prepare for surface action against ''Yamato''. These orders were countermanded in favor of strikes from Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]]'s aircraft carriers, but as a contingency the battleships together with 7 cruisers and 21 destroyers were sent to interdict the Japanese force before it could reach the vulnerable transports and landing craft.<ref name=\"G&D60\" />{{refn|Authors Garzke and Dulin speculate that the likely outcome of a battle between the two forces would have been a victory for the Allies, but at a serious cost, because the ''Yamato'' held a large margin of superiority over the old battleships in firepower (460&nbsp;mm vs. 356&nbsp;mm), armor and speed ({{convert|27|knots}} vs. {{convert|21|knots}}).<ref name=\"G&D60\" />|group=N}}\n\n[[File:Yamato maneuvering.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A distant overhead view of a patch of ocean; towards the left, partially obscured by a patch of cloud, is a large warship.

The first Allied aircraft made contact with the Surface Special Attack Force at 08:23; two [[flying boat]]s arrived soon thereafter, and for the next five hours, ''Yamato'' fired [[Beehive (anti-aircraft shell)|Common Type 3 or ''Beehive'']] (''3 Shiki ts\u00fbj\u00f4dan'') shells at the Allied seaplanes, but could not prevent them from shadowing the force. ''Yamato'' obtained her first radar contact with aircraft at 10:00; an hour later, American [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F Hellcat]] fighters appeared overhead to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear. None did.<ref name=\"G&D61\">Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 60\u201361.</ref>{{refn|The poor quality of the Japanese naval radar during World War II meant that only large groups of planes could be detected. Smaller detachments were usually picked up via line of sight.|group=N}}\n\nAt about 12:30, 280 bomber and torpedo bomber aircraft arrived over the Japanese force. {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asashimo||2}}, which had fallen out of formation with engine trouble, was caught and sunk by a detachment of aircraft from {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|2}}. The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to {{convert|24|knot|mph km/h}}, and following standard Japanese anti-aircraft defensive measures, the destroyers began circling ''Yamato''. The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12:37. ''Yahagi'' turned and raced away at {{convert|35|knot|mph km/h}} in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers; it drew off only an insignificant number. ''Yamato'' was not hit for four minutes, but at 12:41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127&nbsp;mm mount. At 12:46, another two bombs struck the battleship's port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155&nbsp;mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun. These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man survived.<ref name=\"G&D61\" />{{refn|This account is based on Garzke and Dulin's ''Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II''. Other works generally agree, although the exact timings of events can vary between sources.<ref name=\"G&D54\" />|group=N}} At 12:45 a single torpedo struck ''Yamato'' far forward on her port side, sending shock waves throughout the ship. Because many of the ship's crew who did not go down with the vessel were killed by strafing aircraft as they swam in the oily water, the details are uncertain, but authors Garzke and Dulin record that little damage was caused.<ref name=\"G&D61\" /> Shortly afterward, up to three more torpedoes struck ''Yamato''. Two impacts, on the port side near the [[engine room]] and on one of the [[boiler]] rooms, are confirmed; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in ''Yamato''{{'}}s auxiliary steering room. The attack ended around 12:47, leaving the battleship [[List (watercraft)|listing]] {{formatnum:5\u20136}}\u00b0 to port; counterflooding\u2014deliberately flooding compartments on the other side of the ship\u2014reduced the list to {{formatnum:1}}\u00b0. One boiler room had been disabled, slightly reducing ''Yamato''{{'}}s top speed, and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned ''Yamato''{{'}}s unprotected 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft weapons, sharply curtailing their effectiveness.<ref name=\"G&D61\" />\n\n[[File:Yamato damaged 7 apr 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=A large area of ocean with a warship in the middle distance.

The battleship is on fire and visibly listing to port.]]\nThe second attack started just before 13:00. In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew high overhead to begin their runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level. Overwhelmed by the number of targets, the battleship's anti-aircraft guns were ineffective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. ''Yamato''{{'}}s main guns were loaded with [[Beehive (anti-aircraft shell)|''Beehive'']] shells fused to explode one second after firing\u2014a mere {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ship\u2014but these had little effect. Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fire room that had already been hit, one impacted a different fire room, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a damaged outboard engine room, increasing the water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations. The fourth hit, unconfirmed, may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding reported in that location.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 62\u201363.</ref> This attack left ''Yamato'' in a perilous position, listing {{formatnum:15\u201318}}\u00b0 to port. Counterflooding of all remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to {{formatnum:10}}\u00b0, but further correction would have required repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms. Although the battleship was not yet in danger of sinking, the list meant the main battery was unable to fire and her speed was limited to {{convert|18|knots}}.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 63.</ref>\n\nThe third and most damaging attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded on the port side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fire room and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Yamato explosion.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A view of the ocean stretching to the horizon with the silhouette of a distant small warship visible to the left.

The battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering, and because of their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the [[Western Powers#Colonial \"West\"|Western Powers]] and the United States in particular. [[Shigeru Fukudome]], chief of the Operations Section of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], described the ships as \"symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy.\"<ref>Evans and Peattie (1997), pp. 298, 378.</ref> ''Yamato''{{'}}s symbolic might was such that some Japanese citizens held the belief that their country could never fall as long as the ship was able to fight.<ref>{{cite news | title = A bomb survivors leery of battleship hype | newspaper = [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] | date = 6 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\nDecades after the war, ''Yamato'' was memorialised in various forms by the Japanese. Historically, the word \"Yamato\" was used as a poetic name for Japan; thus, her name became a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.<ref>Yoshida and Minear (1985), p. xvii; Evans and Peattie (1997), p. 378.</ref><ref>Skulski (2004), p. 7.</ref> In April 1968, a memorial tower was erected at Cape Inutabu on [[Tokunoshima]], an island in the [[Amami Islands]] of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], to commemorate the lives lost in Operation Ten-Go. In October 1974, [[Leiji Matsumoto]] created a new television series, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', about rebuilding the battleship as a starship and its interstellar quest to save Earth. The series was a huge success, spawning eight feature films and four more TV series, the most recent of which was released in 2017. The series popularised the [[space opera]]. As post-war Japanese tried to redefine the purpose of their lives, ''Yamato'' became a symbol of heroism and of their desire to regain a sense of masculinity after their country's defeat in the war.<ref>Mizuno (2007), pp. 106, 110\u2013111, 121\u2013122.</ref><ref>Levi (1998), p. 72.</ref> Brought to the United States as ''[[Star Blazers]]'', the animated series proved popular and established a foundation for anime in the North American entertainment market.<ref>Wright (2009), p. 99.</ref> The motif in ''Space Battleship Yamato'' was repeated in [[The Silent Service|''Silent Service'']], a popular manga and anime that explores issues of nuclear weapons and the Japan\u2013US relationship.

His father [[Boris Parygin]] was a [[Social psychology|social psychologist]]. Alexey studied at the Graphics Faculty of the [[Herzen University]] from 1982\u20131989. He organized the art group \u201cUnion \u2116 0\u201d in Leningrad in 1986-1989 and created the art squatters\u2019 studio \u201cNevsky 25\u201d in Leningrad in 1987\u20131990. Joined the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Professional Artists\u2019 Union of Russia]] in 1994, the Art Critics Association (ACA) member since 2003.\n[[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Art History with the thesis \u201c[[Screen printing|Silk Screening]] as a phenomenon of the 20th Century art\u201d (2002).\n\n===The nature of creativity===\nIn 1980-1990 Parygin concentrated on easel [[oil painting]] outside and using  models at the studio, experimented with various paint foundations such as canvas, plywood, glass and other media and used texture and relief techniques. \nFrom [[Aleksandr Kamensky]]\u2019s article:\n{{quote|\n\u201cThe works create new poetry, which involuntarily rivals with habitual esthetic stereotypes. For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

From 1997 the artist created a series of extended multimedia projects '''Contemplation of Money''', '''Art is Business''', '''Art in the Forest'''.\nFrom Nikolay Blagodatov's article:\n{{quote|\n\"His works show high culture, erudition and taste, it is hard to favor any particular piece. Moreover, the artist prefers options on a particular plastic theme, as he himself puts it. He uses various in techniques, and revisits it in different periods of creativity. He believes his plastic theme conveys the plastic state. The state arises and manifests in very different ways, yet retaining its basic sign.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.

For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.

It does not produce prominent stimulant effects, but is instead said to be relaxing,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} however it is often mixed with stimulant piperazine derivatives such as [[benzylpiperazine]] (BZP) for a combined effect.\n\nMeOPP has been found ''in vitro'' to [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] and induce the [[releasing agent|release]] of the [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s.
