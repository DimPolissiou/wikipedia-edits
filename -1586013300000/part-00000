It was the first church established in Greeneville and is one of the oldest churches in the State of Tennessee. First Presbyterian Church, originally Mount Bethel Presbyterian Church, was first gathered in 1780 at the Big Spring in downtown Greeneville, with the first services preached by traveling frontier minister [[Samuel Doak]].  In 1783, regular services began, and Rev. [[Hezekiah Balch]] was the first settled [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Minutes of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America From Its Organization A.D. 1789 to A.D. 1820 Inclusive|last=|first=|publisher=Presbyterian Board of Publication|year=1847|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=131}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nA log church was built near the present day Greeneville Town Hall and in 1798 after a split involving a theological rift over [[Hopkinsianism]], the church was renamed Harmony Church.  In 1840, the name was changed to Greeneville Presbyterian Church.  The present brick building was erected in 1848.  During this time, the congregation was the only church between [[Knoxville]] and Washington College, an area of approximately 100 miles.<ref>http://www.historicmapworks.com/Buildings/index.php?state=TN&city=Greeneville&id=29816</ref>  In 1928, a fire destroyed the interior of the sanctuary; however, the brick walls were fortunately left intact.    In 1940, the name was changed to First Presbyterian Church, as it exists today.\n\nIn 1926, a 3-story education wing was built.  Christ Chapel was built and dedicated in 1999 under the direction of former senior minister, the Rev. Dr. Daniel Donaldson.\n\nThe church and its congregation were heavily involved in the abolitionist movement in [[East Tennessee]].  Rev. Hezekiah Balch freed his slaves at the Greene County Courthouse in 1807. Rev. Samuel Doak, the founder of [[Tusculum College]], followed in 1818.  Francis McCorkle, the pastor of Greeneville's Presbyterian Church, was a leading member of the Manumission Society of Tennessee.\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church is the parent church of [[Tusculum College]].  It is listed as a historic place with the [[Tennessee Historical Commission]] (marker 1C-59) and is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as part of the [[Greeneville Historic District (Greeneville, Tennessee)|Greeneville Historic District]].\n\nWhen the church split in 1798, members that adhered to the Old School theology kept the name Mount Bethel.  Later, Mount Bethel merged with Covenant Presbyterian of Tusculum, which in 1990, merged with First Presbyterian ending a 192 year separation.\n\n==Pipe Organs==\n[[Image:Greeneville Presbyterian Sanctuary.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Sanctuary of First Presbyterian Church]]\nIn 1905, the first [[pipe organ]], an [[Estey Organ]], was purchased and subsequently installed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Minutes of Session Presbyterian Church, Greeneville E.

P. M\u00f6ller]] Company of Hagerstown, Maryland.  The instrument was two manuals and pedal, of 20 ranks. This instrument was destroyed by a fire in 1928 that gutted the interior of the sanctuary. The congregation quickly rebuilt, replacing the organ with essentially the same instrument. In 1945, a three rank antiphonal division was installed in the balcony.\n\nIn 1964, a new three manual instrument was built by the Greenwood Organ Company of Charlotte, North Carolina. This was a 21 rank instrument, including the antiphonal division. Much of the pipework from the previous M\u00f6ller instrument was re-voiced and re-used, with 10 ranks being new A set of chimes was also added to the instrument at this time.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Schantz Organ Company]] of Orrville, Ohio was contracted to build a new instrument of 27 ranks and 1,630 pipes. Fifteen ranks of pipes were completely new (essentially the Great and Choir divisions), while some pipes and materials were carried over from the 1964 instrument. The organ is split in chambers on either side of the chancel, with the Great and Choir on the left, and the Swell and Pedal on the right.<ref>http://www.firstpresgreeneville.org/Resources/Schantz%20organ.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the J. F. Nordlie Company, of [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] built their Opus 16 instrument for Christ Chapel.  The instrument has 8 ranks and 381 pipes.<ref>http://www.firstpresgreeneville.org/Resources/Nordlie%20organ.pdf</ref>\n\n==Clergy==\n*'''1780''' - [[Samuel Doak]], Supply Minister\n*'''1783''' - [[Hezekiah Balch]], First Minister\n*'''1810''' - Charles Coffin\n*'''1820''' - Christopher Bradshaw\n*'''1829''' - Francis A.
