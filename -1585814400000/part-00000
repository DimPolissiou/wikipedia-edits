While the dispute has historically centered on the exact make-up of the [[insect]] head, it has been widened to include other living arthropods such as the [[crustacean]]s and [[chelicerate]]s; and fossil forms, such as the many arthropods known from exceptionally preserved [[Cambrian]] faunas. While the topic has classically been based on insect [[embryology]], in recent years a great deal of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|developmental molecular]] data has become available. Dozens of more or less distinct solutions to the problem, dating back to at least 1897,<ref>{{citation | last = Goodrich | first = E. S. | title = On the Relation of the Arthropod Head to the Annelid Prostomium | journal = Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science | issue = s2\u201340 | pages = 247\u2013268 | year = 1897}}</ref> have been published, including several in the 2000s.\n\nThe arthropod head problem is popularly known as the '''endless dispute''', the title of a famous paper on the subject by Jacob G. Rempel in 1975,<ref>{{citation | last = Rempel | first = J. G. | title = The Evolution of the Insect Head: the Endless Dispute\n|journal = Quaestiones Entomologicae | volume = 11 | pages = 7\u201325 | year = 1975}}</ref> referring to its seemingly intractable nature. Although some progress has been made since that time, the precise nature of especially the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]] and the pre-oral region of arthropods remain highly controversial.\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote_box|width=25%|align=right|quote=<div style=\"text-align:left;\">It would be too bad if the question of head segmentation ever should be finally settled; it has been for so long such fertile ground for theorizing that arthropodists would miss it as a field for mental exercise.</div>|source= R.E.

E. | title = Facts and Theories Concerning the Insect Head | journal = Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections | volume = 142 | pages = 1\u201361 | year = 1960\n}}</ref>\n}}\nRecent research{{which?|date=May 2019}} suggests that some key events in the evolution of the arthropod body resulted from changes in certain [[Hox gene]]s' DNA sequences. The [[torso| trunks]] of arthropods comprise repeated [[segmentation (biology)| segments]], which are typically associated with various structures such as a pair of [[appendages]], [[exoskeleton#Organisation| apodemes]] for muscle attachment, [[ganglia]] and (at least embryologically) [[coelom| coelomic cavities]]. While many arthropod segments are modified to a greater or lesser extent (for example, only three of the insect thorax and abdominal segments typically bear appendages), arthropodists widely assume that all of the segments were nearly identical in the ancestral state. However, while one can usually readily see the segmental organisation of the trunks of adult arthropods, that of the head is much less obvious. Arthropod heads are typically fused capsules that bear a variety of complex structures such as the eyes, antennae and mouth parts. The challenge that the arthropod head problem has to address is to what extent the various structures of the arthropod head can be resolved into a set of hypothetical ancestral segments. Given the high compaction and complexity of adult arthropod heads, much attention has been directed towards understanding the developmental processes that give rise to them, in the hope that they will reveal their segmental organisation more clearly.\n\n==Head components==\n[[Image:Evolution insect mouthparts.png|right|upright=1.4|thumb|Insect head parts. Legend: '''a''', antennae; '''c''', compound eye; '''lb''', labium; '''lr''', labrum; '''md''', mandibles; '''mx''', maxillae.]]\n[[Image:robal.png|right|upright=1.4|thumb|Insect anatomy]]\nA typical [[insect]] head possesses a pair of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]; [[Compound eye|eyes]]; [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]], [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]], [[maxilla (arthropod)|maxillae]] and [[Labium (insect)|labium]] (the latter four forming the cluster of \"mouth parts\", no. 32. in the diagram). Lying above the oesophagus is the brain or [[supraesophageal ganglion]], divided into three pairs of ganglia: the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum and tritocerebrum from front to back (collectively no. 5 in the diagram). Nerves from the protocerebrum lead to the large compound eyes; from the deutocerebrum to the antennae; and  from the tritocerebrum to the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]] and [[stomatogastric nervous system]]. Circum-oesophageal connectives lead from the tritocerebrum around the gut to connect the brain to the ventral ganglionated nerve cord: nerves from the first three pairs of ganglia lead to the mandibles, maxillae and labium, respectively. The position of the mouth and the circum-oesophageal connectives allows a distinction to be made between pre- and post-oral structures; although it should be borne in mind that because structures can move around during development, a pre-oral position of a structure in the adult does not necessarily prove that its developmental origin is from there. The [[myriapod]] head is very similar to that of the insects.\n\nThe [[crustacean]] head is broadly similar to that of the insects, but possesses, in addition, a second pair of antennae that are innervated from the tritocerebrum. In place of the labium, crustaceans possess a second pair of maxillae.\n\n[[Chelicerate]] head structures differ considerably from those of mandibulates (i.e. insects, crustaceans and myriapods); they possess eyes and a single pair of grasping appendages innervated from the brain, plus a labrum-like structure. Behind the mouth lies another pair of mouthparts, the [[pedipalps]], and behind them lie the series of walking limbs. In chelicerates, the leg-bearing segments are fused with the anterior segments to form a [[prosoma]], so that in living arthropods a distinct head only exists in mandibulates.\n\n==The acron concept==\nThe arthropod head problem has until recently been predicated on the [[Articulata Hypothesis|Articulata]] theory, i.e. that the arthropods and [[annelids]] are close relatives. Although arthropods are essentially direct developers that do not possess a [[trochophore]]-like [[larva]], the annelids do. During annelid [[metamorphosis]], segments are added close to the posterior of the body, behind the mouth; whereas the brain is derived from the [[trochophore|episphere]] or region in front of the mouth. Recognition of this led to the concept of a primary, non-segmental component of the body in annelids known as the [[Prostomium|acron]] being developed, from which the brain is ultimately derived. Because the arthropod and annelid heads, in the light of the Articulata theory, were assumed to be structurally homologous in some way, the arthropod head was also often considered to incorporate a non-segmental acronal component. Taking the homology between annelid and arthropod heads at face value, Swedish workers such as Hanstr\u00f6m<ref>{{citation | last = Hanstr\u00f6m | first = B. | title = Vergleichende Anatomie Des Nervensystems Der Wirbellosen Tiere Unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung Seiner Funktion | journal = Berlin, Heidelberg and New York: Julius Springer | pages = 1\u2013623 | year = 1928 | bibcode = 1929Natur.124..368. | volume = 124 | doi = 10.1038/124368a0 | issue = 3123}}</ref> and Holmgren<ref>{{citation | last = Holmgren | first = N. | title = Zur Vergleichenden Anatomie Des Gehirns Von Polychaeten, Onychophoren, Xiphosuren, Arachniden, Crustaceen, Myriapoden Und Insekten | journal = Kungliga Svenska Vetenskapsakademiens Handlingar | volume = 56 | pages = 1\u2013315 | year = 1916}}</ref> assumed that a large part of the arthropod head must correspond to the acron, a view followed later by several prominent American insect workers such as Butt<ref>{{citation\n|last = Butt | first = F. H. | title = The Role of the Premandibular or Intercalary Segment in Head Segmentation of Insects and Other Arthropods | journal = Transactions of the American Entomological Society | volume = 83 | pages = 1\u201330 | year = 1957}}</ref> and Snodgrass. They proposed that all pre-oral structures in insects were non-segmental, although such a view is at odds with the preoral position of apparently ''bona fide'' appendages such as the antennae. A less extreme set of theories propose that only the protocerebrum and associated structures should be considered to be acronal.\n\nThe view that the arthropod head must contain an acronal remnant has been shaken by the relatively recent revision of [[protostome]] phylogeny, which has dismantled the Articulata and placed the arthropods together with a group of unsegmented worms often referred to as the [[Cycloneuralia]] in the so-called [[Ecdysozoa]]. All members of the Ecdysozoa are direct developers without a trochophore, and the cycloneuralians have terminal mouths. As a result, the idea of the arthropods having inherited a preoral acron from their ancestors seems less likely.\n\n==Molecular development and the arthropod head problem==\n{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}\n[[File:Arthropod segment Hox gene expression.svg|thumb|Expression of [[Hox gene]]s in the body segments of different groups of arthropod. The Hox genes 7, 8, and 9 correspond in these groups but are shifted (by [[heterochrony]]) by up to three segments. Segments with maxillopeds have Hox gene 7.

Because all arthropods have the same complement of nine Hox loci, the morphological diversification observed is caused by [[heterochrony]], meaning that the genes are expressed at different times.\n\n==Areas of agreement==\nIt is widely agreed that the insect, myriapod and crustacean heads are very similar. The apparent lack of a second antenna in insects and myriapods is explained by the idea that this appendage has been lost, leaving an appendage-less segment known as the intercalary segment. Modern phylogenies do not in general support an insect-myriapod relationship, suggesting that the second antenna has been lost independently in each group, perhaps as a result of a convergent adaptation to life on land. Furthermore, there is general agreement that the mandibles, first maxillae and labium/second maxillae each represent a post-oral segment; and that the first antenna  represents a preoral segment.\n\n==Areas of disagreement==\nAreas of disagreement can be grouped into three categories: the nature of the pre-antennal region in mandibulates; the nature of the labrum; and the relationship between the chelicerate and mandibulate anterior segments.\n\n===Nature of the preoral region===\nThe degree to which the area in front of the mouth is segmented remains one of the major controversies in the arthropod head problem. As already mentioned, earlier workers often considered the entire pre-oral region to be \"acronal\" and thus nonsegmental.  Modern workers universally accept that at least the deuterocerebrum is segmental. However, the nature of the region in front of this is much less certain. Some molecular development studies have given limited support to the idea of an \"ocular\" segment corresponding to the protocerebrum; but these data are not unequivocal.<ref>{{citation| last = Scholtz | first = G.| year = 2001|title = Evolution of Developmental Patterns in Arthropods - the Analysis of Gene Expression And Its Bearing on Morphology and Phylogenetics| journal = Zoology| volume = 103| pages = 99\u2013111}}</ref> The idea of the protocerebrum actually comprising two components has also received support from both molecular and embryological data.<ref>{{citation| last1 = Schmidt-ott | first1 = U.\n|last2 = Technau | first2 = G.

The archicerebrum is in some ways equivalent to the 'acron', and may be equivalent (by means of a shared equivalent structure in the common ancestor of lophotrochozoans and ecdysozoans) with the annelid prototroch; it can be recognized by the expression of the genes ''optix'' and ''six3'' during development, whereas the prosocerebrum is associated with ''orthodenticle'' and its homologs.<ref name=Strausfeld2016>{{Cite book| author=Nicholas Strausfeld| title=Arthropod brains| year=2016|chapter=9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S1467-8039(03)00042-2 |pmid = 18088998|title = Early steps in building the insect brain: Neuroblast formation and segmental patterning in the developing brain of different insect species|journal = Arthropod Structure & Development|volume = 32|pages = 103\u2013123|year = 2003|last1 = Urbach|first1 = Rolf|last2 = Technau|first2 = Gerhard M.}}</ref>\n\n(Note that the terms archicerebrum and prosocerebrum are not always used consistently; see [[Composition of the protocerebrum]].)\n\n===The labrum===\nThe labrum is a flap-like structure that lies immediately in front of the mouth in almost all extant [[euarthropods]], the general exception being provided by the probable chelicerate-relatives the [[pycnogonids]]. It has proved to be by far the most controversial of all arthropod head structures. It is innervated in crustaceans and insects from the tritocerebrum, i.e. the back of the brain. However, in development it often appears at the anterior of the head, and migrates backwards towards its adult position. Furthermore, it often appears as a bilobed structure, with a set of muscles, nerves and gene expression in many ways similar to that of a trunk appendage.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Haas | first1 = M.

If the labrum is an appendage then, it seems possible that its origin is indicated by its developmentally anterior position, i.e., that it is the appendage of a segment anterior to the first antenna. The most obvious choice for this is the segment whose ganglion is the protocerebrum, which in extant euarthropods bears no appendage (apart from the eyes).  Strausfeld finds support for this hypothesis in the presence of a median nerve bundle connecting the labrum to the anterior of the protocerebrum,<ref name=Strausfeld2016/> and the expression of the gene ''six3'' in the labrum has been taken as evidence for its homology with onychophoran antennae (frontal appendages borne from the anterior of the protocerebrum).<ref name=OH2017/>\n\nIf the labrum is really an anterior appendage that has migrated to the posterior, then it may be homologous to the \"antennae\" of onychophorans, which, as discussed below, seem to be innervated from a very anterior part of the brain, i.e. in front of the eyes. It has even been suggested (e.g., by [[Mithan Lal Roonwal|Roonwal]]) that the labrum belongs to an even more obscure segment that lies in front of the ocular one. Nevertheless, many workers continue to be highly skeptical about the appendiculate nature of the labrum, preferring to see it as it appears, i.e., as an outgrowth of the body wall just in front of the mouth.\n\nParticularly in some fossil groups, such as certain trilobites, the labrum is often covered with a sclerotised plate, the hypostome.  Confusion can arise where the two structures are conflated or mistaken for one another.<ref name=OH2017/>\n\n===Mandibulate/chelicerate head homologies===\nGiven the disagreements about the structure of the insect head, on which most effort has been spent, it is no surprise that the potential homologies between it and other arthropods, notably the chelicerates, are also very controversial. From after the Second World War to the 1980s a commonly accepted model of arthropod evolution was that the extant euarthropods were [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]], i.e. the main lineages had evolved independently from soft-bodied, annelid-like ancestors, following the work of Tiegs and especially [[Sidnie Manton]]. In this view, most of the head structures would also be convergent, and thus there was no point looking for specific homologies between major groups. However, the [[monophyletic]] theory of arthropod origins has since decisively gained the upper hand, which raises the problem of head homology once more.\n\nThe classical view was that the chelicerae were homologous to the second antennae of crustaceans (i.e., they are innervated from the tritocerebrum), a view based partly on the fact that the chelicerae were innervated from the same ganglion that innervates the labrum, which is the tritocerebrum in crustaceans and insects. Given that there are apparently no appendages in front of the chelicerae, the implication was that the deuterocerebrum had been lost in chelicerates (the protocerebrum innervates the eyes in both groups in this view). While this view still has its defenders (notably Colette and Jacques Bitsch), the alternative view that the chelicerae are innervated from the deuterocerebrum has gained ground, based on molecular development in [[mites]]<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Telford | first1 = M.

This set of innervation makes sense if the mouth of onychophorans was originally terminal and has been bent downwards. Second, the antennae of the onychophorans appear to be innervated from in front of the eyes; which in euarthropod terms implies a protocerebral (or potentially even more anterior) innervation.

However, another group of arthropods, the so-called \"great appendage\" arthropods, including ''[[Yohoia]]'', ''[[Leanchoilia]]'' and ''[[Alalcomenaeus]]'', do not possess simple antennae, but rather have a robust, branched structure, which was called the \"great appendage\" by [[Harry B. Whittington]] in his restudy of these taxa. Yet another group of arthropods may possess two differentiated head appendages, of which the most important and controversial is the Chengjiang form ''[[Fuxianhuia]]''. ''Fuxianhuia'' was claimed to possess a pair of short antennae anterior, followed by a robust pair of \"sub-chelate\" appendages. However, this assessment has been both disputed by Waloszek and colleagues, who consider that the sub-chelate appendages are in fact gut [[Diverticulum|diverticulae]]; and supported by [[Graham Budd]]. Thus, its nature remains controversial at present. Other taxa have also been claimed to have a somewhat similar anterior appendage arrangement (e.g. ''[[Fortiforceps]]'') but, with the exception of the well-preserved ''[[Branchiocaris]]'' from the Burgess Shale, most of them are highly equivocal.\n\nIn almost all Cambrian arthropods, the post-oral limbs show very little differentiation compared to the trunk limbs; the heads posterior to the mouth shows a considerable degree of variability, however, in the number of segments incorporated into the head.\n\nTrilobites, in particular, possess a ventral sclerotised plate in the head called the [[hypostome (trilobite)|hypostome]]. Whether this is homologous to the labrum or not is debated; although Waloszek and others have argued that as the phosphatocopines (upper stem-group crustaceans) seem to possess both, it cannot be.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Maas | first1 = A.\n | last2 = Waloszek | first2 = D.\n | last3 = M\u00fcller | first3 = K.

They also accept that taxa such as ''[[Fuxianhuia]]'' possess both antennae and \"great appendages\". Because in ''Fuxianhuia'' the antennae lie anterior to the great appendages, they suggest that these antennae are the inherited primitive \"primary\" antennae; and that the great appendages are thus equivalent to the first antennae of crustaceans. Because the secondary antennae are not present in stem group arthropods such as ''[[Fuxianhuia]]'', nor in the extant chelicerates, they propose that arthropods, such as the trilobites, that possess secondary antennae, belong in a monophyletic group that also includes the mandibulates, called the Antennata. The trilobites are thus, in their view, not stem-group chelicerates, a commonly held view, but rather, stem-group mandibulates. The status of the labrum is not resolved by this theory, but they argue that it the evidence for it being appendiculate is not compelling; thus it does not have to correspond to a well-developed appendage of any Cambrian arthropod.\n\nThe 2014 description of ''[[Lyrarapax]]'' poses a challenge for this theorem: assuming that its nervous tissue is correctly identified as such, the great appendages of this radiodont are innervated into the front of the protocerebrum, undermining the suggestion that the great appendages are deuterocerebral.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature13486 |pmid = 25043032|title = Brain structure resolves the segmental affinity of anomalocaridid appendages|journal = Nature|volume = 513|issue = 7519|pages = 538\u2013542|year = 2014|last1 = Cong|first1 = Peiyun|last2 = Ma|first2 = Xiaoya|last3 = Hou|first3 = Xianguang|last4 = Edgecombe|first4 = Gregory D.|last5 = Strausfeld|first5 = Nicholas J.}}</ref><ref name=OH2017/>\n\n====Budd====\n\n[[Graham Budd]]'s theory<ref>{{citation\n | last = Budd | first = G.

However, he traces the origin of the \"great appendages\" in the differentiated frontal appendages of Cambrian lobopods such as ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Kerygmachela]]'', neither of which possess convincing antennae. Thus, in Budd's view, the order of the two anterior appendages of taxa such as ''Fuxianhuia'' are reversed: the antennae are the first antennae (deutocerebral) of the mandibulates; and the great appendages correspond to the primary antennae of the onychophorans and Cambrian lobopods. Following previous work by Dewel and colleagues, Budd accounts for their reversal by arguing that the mouth in basal lobopods was terminal, and that as it rotated backwards and downwards, it brought the anterior appendage backwards with it. Given this transformation, it is likely, under this theory, that the remnant of the great appendage/primary antenna is the labrum of extant arthropods. Because in this view ''Fuxianhuia'' possesses both a hypostome and a great appendage, the hypostome cannot be straightforwardly homologous with the labrum.\n\n====Pycnogonids and the great appendage theory====\n\nMaxmen and others recently published a morphologically-based paper<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Maxmen | first1 = A.\n | last2 = Browne | first2 = W.

The [[torso| trunks]] of arthropods comprise repeated [[segmentation (biology)| segments]], which are typically associated with various structures such as a pair of [[appendages]], [[exoskeleton#Organisation| apodemes]] for muscle attachment, [[ganglia]] and (at least embryologically) [[coelom| coelomic cavities]]. While many arthropod segments are modified to a greater or lesser extent (for example, only three of the insect thorax and abdominal segments typically bear appendages), arthropodists widely assume that all of the segments were nearly identical in the ancestral state. However, while one can usually readily see the segmental organisation of the trunks of adult arthropods, that of the head is much less obvious. Arthropod heads are typically fused capsules that bear a variety of complex structures such as the eyes, antennae and mouth parts. The challenge that the arthropod head problem has to address is to what extent the various structures of the arthropod head can be resolved into a set of hypothetical ancestral segments. Given the high compaction and complexity of adult arthropod heads, much attention has been directed towards understanding the developmental processes that give rise to them, in the hope that they will reveal their segmental organisation more clearly.\n\n==Head components==\n[[Image:Evolution insect mouthparts.png|right|upright=1.4|thumb|Insect head parts. Legend: '''a''', antennae; '''c''', compound eye; '''lb''', labium; '''lr''', labrum; '''md''', mandibles; '''mx''', maxillae.]]\n[[Image:robal.png|right|upright=1.4|thumb|Insect anatomy]]\nA typical [[insect]] head possesses a pair of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]; [[Compound eye|eyes]]; [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]], [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]], [[maxilla (arthropod)|maxillae]] and [[Labium (insect)|labium]] (the latter four forming the cluster of \"mouth parts\", no. 32. in the diagram). Lying above the oesophagus is the brain or [[supraesophageal ganglion]], divided into three pairs of ganglia: the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum and tritocerebrum from front to back (collectively no. 5 in the diagram). Nerves from the protocerebrum lead to the large compound eyes; from the deutocerebrum to the antennae; and  from the tritocerebrum to the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]] and [[stomatogastric nervous system]]. Circum-oesophageal connectives lead from the tritocerebrum around the gut to connect the brain to the ventral ganglionated nerve cord: nerves from the first three pairs of ganglia lead to the mandibles, maxillae and labium, respectively. The position of the mouth and the circum-oesophageal connectives allows a distinction to be made between pre- and post-oral structures; although it should be borne in mind that because structures can move around during development, a pre-oral position of a structure in the adult does not necessarily prove that its developmental origin is from there. The [[myriapod]] head is very similar to that of the insects.\n\nThe [[crustacean]] head is broadly similar to that of the insects, but possesses, in addition, a second pair of antennae that are innervated from the tritocerebrum. In place of the labium, crustaceans possess a second pair of maxillae.\n\n[[Chelicerate]] head structures differ considerably from those of mandibulates (i.e. insects, crustaceans and myriapods); they possess eyes and a single pair of grasping appendages innervated from the brain, plus a labrum-like structure. Behind the mouth lies another pair of mouthparts, the [[pedipalps]], and behind them lie the series of walking limbs. In chelicerates, the leg-bearing segments are fused with the anterior segments to form a [[prosoma]], so that in living arthropods a distinct head only exists in mandibulates.\n\n==The acron concept==\nThe arthropod head problem has until recently been predicated on the [[Articulata Hypothesis|Articulata]] theory, i.e. that the arthropods and [[annelids]] are close relatives. Although arthropods are essentially direct developers that do not possess a [[trochophore]]-like [[larva]], the annelids do. During annelid [[metamorphosis]], segments are added close to the posterior of the body, behind the mouth; whereas the brain is derived from the [[trochophore|episphere]] or region in front of the mouth. Recognition of this led to the concept of a primary, non-segmental component of the body in annelids known as the [[Prostomium|acron]] being developed, from which the brain is ultimately derived. Because the arthropod and annelid heads, in the light of the Articulata theory, were assumed to be structurally homologous in some way, the arthropod head was also often considered to incorporate a non-segmental acronal component. Taking the homology between annelid and arthropod heads at face value, Swedish workers such as Hanstr\u00f6m<ref>{{citation | last = Hanstr\u00f6m | first = B. | title = Vergleichende Anatomie Des Nervensystems Der Wirbellosen Tiere Unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung Seiner Funktion | journal = Berlin, Heidelberg and New York: Julius Springer | pages = 1\u2013623 | year = 1928 | bibcode = 1929Natur.124..368. | volume = 124 | doi = 10.1038/124368a0 | issue = 3123}}</ref> and Holmgren<ref>{{citation | last = Holmgren | first = N. | title = Zur Vergleichenden Anatomie Des Gehirns Von Polychaeten, Onychophoren, Xiphosuren, Arachniden, Crustaceen, Myriapoden Und Insekten | journal = Kungliga Svenska Vetenskapsakademiens Handlingar | volume = 56 | pages = 1\u2013315 | year = 1916}}</ref> assumed that a large part of the arthropod head must correspond to the acron, a view followed later by several prominent American insect workers such as Butt<ref>{{citation\n|last = Butt | first = F. H. | title = The Role of the Premandibular or Intercalary Segment in Head Segmentation of Insects and Other Arthropods | journal = Transactions of the American Entomological Society | volume = 83 | pages = 1\u201330 | year = 1957}}</ref> and Snodgrass. They proposed that all pre-oral structures in insects were non-segmental, although such a view is at odds with the preoral position of apparently ''bona fide'' appendages such as the antennae. A less extreme set of theories propose that only the protocerebrum and associated structures should be considered to be acronal.\n\nThe view that the arthropod head must contain an acronal remnant has been shaken by the relatively recent revision of [[protostome]] phylogeny, which has dismantled the Articulata and placed the arthropods together with a group of unsegmented worms often referred to as the [[Cycloneuralia]] in the so-called [[Ecdysozoa]]. All members of the Ecdysozoa are direct developers without a trochophore, and the cycloneuralians have terminal mouths. As a result, the idea of the arthropods having inherited a preoral acron from their ancestors seems less likely.\n\n==Molecular development and the arthropod head problem==\n{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}\n[[File:Arthropod segment Hox gene expression.svg|thumb|Expression of [[Hox gene]]s in the body segments of different groups of arthropod.

Because all arthropods have the same complement of nine Hox loci, the morphological diversification observed is caused by [[heterochrony]], meaning that the genes are expressed at different times.\n\n==Areas of agreement==\nIt is widely agreed that the insect, myriapod and crustacean heads are very similar. The apparent lack of a second antenna in insects and myriapods is explained by the idea that this appendage has been lost, leaving an appendage-less segment known as the intercalary segment. Modern phylogenies do not in general support an insect-myriapod relationship, suggesting that the second antenna has been lost independently in each group, perhaps as a result of a convergent adaptation to life on land. Furthermore, there is general agreement that the mandibles, first maxillae and labium/second maxillae each represent a post-oral segment; and that the first antenna  represents a preoral segment.\n\n==Areas of disagreement==\nAreas of disagreement can be grouped into three categories: the nature of the pre-antennal region in mandibulates; the nature of the labrum; and the relationship between the chelicerate and mandibulate anterior segments.\n\n===Nature of the preoral region===\nThe degree to which the area in front of the mouth is segmented remains one of the major controversies in the arthropod head problem. As already mentioned, earlier workers often considered the entire pre-oral region to be \"acronal\" and thus nonsegmental.  Modern workers universally accept that at least the deuterocerebrum is segmental. However, the nature of the region in front of this is much less certain. Some molecular development studies have given limited support to the idea of an \"ocular\" segment corresponding to the protocerebrum; but these data are not unequivocal.<ref>{{citation| last = Scholtz | first = G.| year = 2001|title = Evolution of Developmental Patterns in Arthropods - the Analysis of Gene Expression And Its Bearing on Morphology and Phylogenetics| journal = Zoology| volume = 103| pages = 99\u2013111}}</ref> The idea of the protocerebrum actually comprising two components has also received support from both molecular and embryological data.<ref>{{citation| last1 = Schmidt-ott | first1 = U.\n|last2 = Technau | first2 = G.

The archicerebrum is in some ways equivalent to the 'acron', and may be equivalent (by means of a shared equivalent structure in the common ancestor of lophotrochozoans and ecdysozoans) with the annelid prototroch; it can be recognized by the expression of the genes ''optix'' and ''six3'' during development, whereas the prosocerebrum is associated with ''orthodenticle'' and its homologs.<ref name=Strausfeld2016>{{Cite book| author=Nicholas Strausfeld| title=Arthropod brains| year=2016|chapter=9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S1467-8039(03)00042-2 |pmid = 18088998|title = Early steps in building the insect brain: Neuroblast formation and segmental patterning in the developing brain of different insect species|journal = Arthropod Structure & Development|volume = 32|pages = 103\u2013123|year = 2003|last1 = Urbach|first1 = Rolf|last2 = Technau|first2 = Gerhard M.}}</ref>\n\n(Note that the terms archicerebrum and prosocerebrum are not always used consistently; see [[Composition of the protocerebrum]].)\n\n===The labrum===\nThe labrum is a flap-like structure that lies immediately in front of the mouth in almost all extant [[euarthropods]], the general exception being provided by the probable chelicerate-relatives the [[pycnogonids]]. It has proved to be by far the most controversial of all arthropod head structures. It is innervated in crustaceans and insects from the tritocerebrum, i.e. the back of the brain. However, in development it often appears at the anterior of the head, and migrates backwards towards its adult position. Furthermore, it often appears as a bilobed structure, with a set of muscles, nerves and gene expression in many ways similar to that of a trunk appendage.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Haas | first1 = M.

If the labrum is an appendage then, it seems possible that its origin is indicated by its developmentally anterior position, i.e., that it is the appendage of a segment anterior to the first antenna. The most obvious choice for this is the segment whose ganglion is the protocerebrum, which in extant euarthropods bears no appendage (apart from the eyes).  Strausfeld finds support for this hypothesis in the presence of a median nerve bundle connecting the labrum to the anterior of the protocerebrum,<ref name=Strausfeld2016/> and the expression of the gene ''six3'' in the labrum has been taken as evidence for its homology with onychophoran antennae (frontal appendages borne from the anterior of the protocerebrum).<ref name=OH2017/>\n\nIf the labrum is really an anterior appendage that has migrated to the posterior, then it may be homologous to the \"antennae\" of onychophorans, which, as discussed below, seem to be innervated from a very anterior part of the brain, i.e. in front of the eyes. It has even been suggested (e.g., by [[Mithan Lal Roonwal|Roonwal]]) that the labrum belongs to an even more obscure segment that lies in front of the ocular one. Nevertheless, many workers continue to be highly skeptical about the appendiculate nature of the labrum, preferring to see it as it appears, i.e., as an outgrowth of the body wall just in front of the mouth.\n\nParticularly in some fossil groups, such as certain trilobites, the labrum is often covered with a sclerotised plate, the hypostome.  Confusion can arise where the two structures are conflated or mistaken for one another.<ref name=OH2017/>\n\n===Mandibulate/chelicerate head homologies===\nGiven the disagreements about the structure of the insect head, on which most effort has been spent, it is no surprise that the potential homologies between it and other arthropods, notably the chelicerates, are also very controversial. From after the Second World War to the 1980s a commonly accepted model of arthropod evolution was that the extant euarthropods were [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]], i.e. the main lineages had evolved independently from soft-bodied, annelid-like ancestors, following the work of Tiegs and especially [[Sidnie Manton]]. In this view, most of the head structures would also be convergent, and thus there was no point looking for specific homologies between major groups. However, the [[monophyletic]] theory of arthropod origins has since decisively gained the upper hand, which raises the problem of head homology once more.\n\nThe classical view was that the chelicerae were homologous to the second antennae of crustaceans (i.e., they are innervated from the tritocerebrum), a view based partly on the fact that the chelicerae were innervated from the same ganglion that innervates the labrum, which is the tritocerebrum in crustaceans and insects. Given that there are apparently no appendages in front of the chelicerae, the implication was that the deuterocerebrum had been lost in chelicerates (the protocerebrum innervates the eyes in both groups in this view). While this view still has its defenders (notably Colette and Jacques Bitsch), the alternative view that the chelicerae are innervated from the deuterocerebrum has gained ground, based on molecular development in [[mites]]<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Telford | first1 = M.

This set of innervation makes sense if the mouth of onychophorans was originally terminal and has been bent downwards. Second, the antennae of the onychophorans appear to be innervated from in front of the eyes; which in euarthropod terms implies a protocerebral (or potentially even more anterior) innervation.

Yet another group of arthropods may possess two differentiated head appendages, of which the most important and controversial is the Chengjiang form ''[[Fuxianhuia]]''. ''Fuxianhuia'' was claimed to possess a pair of short antennae anterior, followed by a robust pair of \"sub-chelate\" appendages. However, this assessment has been both disputed by Waloszek and colleagues, who consider that the sub-chelate appendages are in fact gut [[Diverticulum|diverticulae]]; and supported by [[Graham Budd]]. Thus, its nature remains controversial at present. Other taxa have also been claimed to have a somewhat similar anterior appendage arrangement (e.g. ''[[Fortiforceps]]'') but, with the exception of the well-preserved ''[[Branchiocaris]]'' from the Burgess Shale, most of them are highly equivocal.\n\nIn almost all Cambrian arthropods, the post-oral limbs show very little differentiation compared to the trunk limbs; the heads posterior to the mouth shows a considerable degree of variability, however, in the number of segments incorporated into the head.\n\nTrilobites, in particular, possess a ventral sclerotised plate in the head called the [[hypostome (trilobite)|hypostome]]. Whether this is homologous to the labrum or not is debated; although Waloszek and others have argued that as the phosphatocopines (upper stem-group crustaceans) seem to possess both, it cannot be.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Maas | first1 = A.\n | last2 = Waloszek | first2 = D.\n | last3 = M\u00fcller | first3 = K.

They also accept that taxa such as ''[[Fuxianhuia]]'' possess both antennae and \"great appendages\". Because in ''Fuxianhuia'' the antennae lie anterior to the great appendages, they suggest that these antennae are the inherited primitive \"primary\" antennae; and that the great appendages are thus equivalent to the first antennae of crustaceans. Because the secondary antennae are not present in stem group arthropods such as ''[[Fuxianhuia]]'', nor in the extant chelicerates, they propose that arthropods, such as the trilobites, that possess secondary antennae, belong in a monophyletic group that also includes the mandibulates, called the Antennata. The trilobites are thus, in their view, not stem-group chelicerates, a commonly held view, but rather, stem-group mandibulates. The status of the labrum is not resolved by this theory, but they argue that it the evidence for it being appendiculate is not compelling; thus it does not have to correspond to a well-developed appendage of any Cambrian arthropod.\n\nThe 2014 description of ''[[Lyrarapax]]'' poses a challenge for this theorem: assuming that its nervous tissue is correctly identified as such, the great appendages of this radiodont are innervated into the front of the protocerebrum, undermining the suggestion that the great appendages are deuterocerebral.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature13486 |pmid = 25043032|title = Brain structure resolves the segmental affinity of anomalocaridid appendages|journal = Nature|volume = 513|issue = 7519|pages = 538\u2013542|year = 2014|last1 = Cong|first1 = Peiyun|last2 = Ma|first2 = Xiaoya|last3 = Hou|first3 = Xianguang|last4 = Edgecombe|first4 = Gregory D.|last5 = Strausfeld|first5 = Nicholas J.}}</ref><ref name=OH2017/>\n\n====Budd====\n\n[[Graham Budd]]'s theory<ref>{{citation\n | last = Budd | first = G.

However, he traces the origin of the \"great appendages\" in the differentiated frontal appendages of Cambrian lobopods such as ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Kerygmachela]]'', neither of which possess convincing antennae. Thus, in Budd's view, the order of the two anterior appendages of taxa such as ''Fuxianhuia'' are reversed: the antennae are the first antennae (deutocerebral) of the mandibulates; and the great appendages correspond to the primary antennae of the onychophorans and Cambrian lobopods. Following previous work by Dewel and colleagues, Budd accounts for their reversal by arguing that the mouth in basal lobopods was terminal, and that as it rotated backwards and downwards, it brought the anterior appendage backwards with it. Given this transformation, it is likely, under this theory, that the remnant of the great appendage/primary antenna is the labrum of extant arthropods. Because in this view ''Fuxianhuia'' possesses both a hypostome and a great appendage, the hypostome cannot be straightforwardly homologous with the labrum.\n\n====Pycnogonids and the great appendage theory====\n\nMaxmen and others recently published a morphologically-based paper<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Maxmen | first1 = A.\n | last2 = Browne | first2 = W.

A much more difficult area, however, has been the nature of the preoral region. The obvious contradiction between a theory that no-preoral structures are segmental, and evidence, such as for the first antennae of crustaceans, that some such structures clearly are, led workers as long ago as [[Ray Lankester|Lankester]]<ref>{{citation\n | last = Lankester | first = E.

This form is called [Arg(7)]-corazonin. Other forms include [His(7)]-corazonin, [Thr(4), His(7)]-corazonin and [Tyr(3), Gln(7), Gln(10)]-corazonin.\n[[File:Corazonin.svg|thumbnail|500px|center|Structure of Corazonin]]\n\n== History ==\n\nCorazonin was first identified as a cardiostimulatory [[neuropeptide]] in the [[American cockroach]] ''(Periplaneta americana)''. Due to its ability to accelerate the heart beat in ''P. americana'' it was named corazonin, from 'coraz\u00f3n', the Spanish word for 'heart'. It was then shown to be present also in the moth ''Manduca sexta'', another cockroach species, ''[[Nauphoeta cinerea]]'' as well as the locust ''Schistocerca gregaria''. In the latter species the Arg residue was replaced by a His residue. Several years later the peptide was independently identified from [[locust]]s, where it was initially named 'dark-color-inducing neurohormone' or 'dark pigmentotropin' due to its ability to induce dark pigmentation in some [[insect]]s.\n\n== Where corazonin is found ==\n\n[Arg(7)]-corazonin was originally identified in [[cockroach]]es such as the [[American cockroach]] ''(Periplaneta americana)'' and has also been identified in the genus of flies ''[[Drosophila]]'', the cricket ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'' and the silkworm ''[[Bombyx mori]]'' and is now known to be the most common form of this peptide. [His(7)]-corazonin is found in certain [[locust]]s, including the [[migratory locust]] ''(Locusta migratoria)'' and the [[desert locust]] ''(Schistocerca gregaria)'', the stick insect ''[[Carausius morosus]]'', and in [[wasp]]s (''[[Vespidae]]''). [Thr(4), His(7)]-corazonin appears only to be found in [[bee]]s, such as the [[honey bee]] ''(Apis mellifera)''. [Tyr(3), Gln(7), Gln(10)]-corazonin is present in wasps. Corazonin appears to be lacking in all beetle species as well as aphids. [Arg(7)]-corazonin has also been identified from the tick Ixodes scapularis, but is absent from the spider mite. It may thus well be generally present in Arhropods.\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe peptide is typically produced by large neuroendocrine cells in the pars lateralis of the protocerebrum that have axons into the corpora cardiaca where it is released into the hemolymph.

This form is called [Arg(7)]-corazonin. Other forms include [His(7)]-corazonin, [Thr(4), His(7)]-corazonin and [Tyr(3), Gln(7), Gln(10)]-corazonin.\n[[File:Corazonin.svg|thumbnail|500px|center|Structure of Corazonin]]\n\n== History ==\n\nCorazonin was first identified as a cardiostimulatory [[neuropeptide]] in the [[American cockroach]] ''(Periplaneta americana)''. Due to its ability to accelerate the heart beat in ''P. americana'' it was named corazonin, from 'coraz\u00f3n', the Spanish word for 'heart'. It was then shown to be present also in the moth ''Manduca sexta'', another cockroach species, ''[[Nauphoeta cinerea]]'' as well as the locust ''Schistocerca gregaria''. In the latter species the Arg residue was replaced by a His residue. Several years later the peptide was independently identified from [[locust]]s, where it was initially named 'dark-color-inducing neurohormone' or 'dark pigmentotropin' due to its ability to induce dark pigmentation in some [[insect]]s.\n\n== Where corazonin is found ==\n\n[Arg(7)]-corazonin was originally identified in [[cockroach]]es such as the [[American cockroach]] ''(Periplaneta americana)'' and has also been identified in the genus of flies ''[[Drosophila]]'', the cricket ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'' and the silkworm ''[[Bombyx mori]]'' and is now known to be the most common form of this peptide. [His(7)]-corazonin is found in certain [[locust]]s, including the [[migratory locust]] ''(Locusta migratoria)'' and the [[desert locust]] ''(Schistocerca gregaria)'', the stick insect ''[[Carausius morosus]]'', and in [[wasp]]s (''[[Vespidae]]''). [Thr(4), His(7)]-corazonin appears only to be found in [[bee]]s, such as the [[honey bee]] ''(Apis mellifera)''. [Tyr(3), Gln(7), Gln(10)]-corazonin is present in wasps. Corazonin appears to be lacking in all beetle species as well as aphids. [Arg(7)]-corazonin has also been identified from the tick Ixodes scapularis, but is absent from the spider mite. It may thus well be generally present in Arhropods.\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe peptide is typically produced by large neuroendocrine cells in the pars lateralis of the protocerebrum that have axons into the corpora cardiaca where it is released into the hemolymph. In this respect the neuropeptide resembles its vertebrate homolog, GnRH (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone) which is released into the pituitary gland to stimulate the release of Luteinizing hormone and Follicle Stimulating Hormone in vertebrates, like humans. Corazonin and GnRH are clear homologs, as are their receptors.\n\nIn the common fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', corazonin is expressed in the salivary glands and [[fat body]] of both males and females,<ref name =\"Kubrak\">{{cite journal |last1=Kubrak |first1=OI |last2=Lushchak |first2=OV |last3=Zandawala |first3=M |last4=N\u00e4ssel |first4=DR |title=Systemic corazonin signalling modulates stress responses and metabolism in Drosophila. |journal=Open Biology |date=November 2016 |volume=6 |issue=11 |doi=10.1098/rsob.160152 |pmid=27810969 |pmc=5133436}}</ref> and is also expressed sexually dimorphically in the abdominal ganglia of males.<ref name=\"Tayler\">{{cite journal |last1=Tayler |first1=TD |last2=Pacheco |first2=DA |last3=Hergarden |first3=AC |last4=Murthy |first4=M |last5=Anderson |first5=DJ |title=A neuropeptide circuit that coordinates sperm transfer and copulation duration in Drosophila |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=11 December 2012 |volume=109 |issue=50 |pages=20697-702 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1218246109 |pmid=23197833 |pmc=3528491}}</ref> It acts in part as a stress peptide through regulation of food intake and metabolism<ref name=\"Kubrak\"/> and in males specifically, it both enables sperm transfer and sets copulation duration.<ref name=\"Tayler\"/>\n\nIn the American cockroach ''[[Periplaneta americana]]'', [Arg(7)]-corazonin acts as a cardiostimulatory neuropeptide and accelerates the heart beat.<ref name=\"Veenstra\"/> It also causes contractions of the hyperneural muscle,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Predel |first1=R |last2=Agricola |first2=H |last3=Linde |first3=D |last4=Wollweber |first4=L |last5=Veenstra |first5=JA |last6=Penzlin |first6=H |title=The insect neuropeptide corazonin: physiological and immunocytochemical studies in Blattariae |journal=Zoology |date=1994 |volume=98 |pages=35\u201350}}</ref> however this has not been seen in other cockroach species.\n\n[His(7)]-corazonin acts as a hormonal factor in locusts and can cause dark pigmentation in albino migratory locusts (''[[Locusta migratoria]]'')<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tawfik |first1=AI |last2=Tanaka |first2=S |last3=De Loof |first3=A |last4=Schoofs |first4=L |last5=Baggerman |first5=G |last6=Waelkens |first6=E |last7=Derua |first7=R |last8=Milner |first8=Y |last9=Yerushalmi |first9=Y |last10=Pener |first10=MP |title=Identification of the gregarization-associated dark-pigmentotropin in locusts through an albino mutant |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=8 June 1999 |volume=96 |issue=12 |pages=7083-7 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.12.7083 |pmid=10359842 |pmc=22063}}</ref> and in green nymphs of the desert locust ''[[Schistocerca gregaria]]''.

RVCE follows the credit-based system of performance evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of grades, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks.
