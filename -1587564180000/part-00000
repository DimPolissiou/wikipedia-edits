Being located inland, the local climate is extremely seasonal with average January lows of around {{convert|-18|C|0}} and average July highs of {{convert|25|C|0}}.<ref name=\"EnvironmentCanada\" />\n\nThe population resides in an urban core and many smaller communities scattered around 330 lakes and among hills of rock blackened by historical [[smelting]] activity. Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining. Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century. The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco, now [[Vale Limited]], which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s, and [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge]], now [[Glencore]]. Sudbury has since expanded from its resource-based economy to emerge as the major retail, economic, health and educational centre for Northeastern Ontario. Sudbury is also home to a large [[Franco-Ontarian]] population that influences its arts and culture.\n\n==History==\n<!-- {{Main|History of Sudbury, Ontario}} -->\nThe Sudbury region was inhabited by the [[Ojibwe]] people of the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin group]] as early as 9,000 years ago following the retreat of the last continental ice sheet.<ref name=\"canadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC867615 |title=Sudbury |last=Saarinen |first=O.W. |date=21 October 2012 |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |access-date=February 3, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211124832/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC867615 |archivedate=December 11, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1850, a large tract of land, including what is now Sudbury, was signed over to the [[The Crown|British Crown]] by local Ojibwe chiefs as a part of the [[Robinson Treaty#Robinson Huron Treaty|Robinson Huron Treaty]].

Two major mining companies were created: [[Vale Limited|Inco]] in 1902 and [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge]] in 1928. They became two of the city's major employers and two of the world's leading producers of nickel.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[File:Bird's Eye View of the Smelting Works of the Canadian Copper Co, Ontario (HS85-10-27230).jpg|thumb|left|Smelting works of the Canadian Copper Company prior to [[World War I]]. Most of the nickel mined from Sudbury was used in the manufacturing of artillery during the war.]]\n\nThrough the decades that followed, Sudbury's economy went through boom and bust cycles as world demand for nickel fluctuated. Demand was high during the [[World War I|First World War]], when Sudbury-mined nickel was used extensively in the manufacturing of artillery in [[Sheffield]], England. It bottomed out when the war ended and then rose again in the mid-1920s as peacetime uses for nickel began to develop. The town was reincorporated as a city in 1930.\n\nThe city recovered from the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]] much more quickly than almost any other city in North America due to increased demand for nickel in the 1930s. Sudbury was the fastest-growing city and one of the wealthiest cities in Canada for most of the decade. Many of the city's social problems in the Great Depression era were not caused by unemployment or poverty, but due to the difficulty in keeping up with all of the new infrastructure demands created by rapid growth \u2014 for example, employed mineworkers sometimes ended up living in [[boarding house]]s or makeshift [[shanty town]]s, because demand for new housing was rising faster than supply.<ref name=railtown /> Between 1936 and 1941, the city was ordered into [[receivership]] by the [[Ontario Municipal Board]].<ref name=railtown /> Another economic slowdown affected the city in 1937, but the city's fortunes rose again with wartime demands during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The [[Frood Mine]] alone accounted for 40 percent of all the nickel used in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[artillery]] production during the war. After the end of the war, Sudbury was in a good position to supply nickel to the United States government when it decided to stockpile non-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] supplies during the [[Cold War]].<ref name=railtown />\n[[File:Banner in Sudbury, Ontario, circa 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Banner welcoming [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock]] miners into Sudbury. Nickel mines became vital to the war effort, with [[Frood Mine]] accounting for 40 percent of all nickel used in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] artillery production.]]\nThe open coke beds used in the early to mid 20th century and logging for fuel resulted in a near-total loss of native vegetation in the area. Consequently, the terrain was made up of exposed rocky outcrops permanently stained charcoal black by the air pollution from the roasting yards. [[Acid rain]] added more staining, in a layer that penetrates up to {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} into the once pink-grey [[granite]].\n\nThe construction of the [[Inco Superstack]] in 1972 dispersed sulphuric acid through the air over a much wider area, reducing the acidity of local precipitation. This enabled the city to begin an environmental recovery program. In the late 1970s, private and public interests combined to establish a \"regreening\" effort. [[Calcium oxide|Lime]] was spread over the charred soil by hand and by aircraft. Seeds of wild [[Poaceae|grasses]] and other vegetation were also spread. As of 2010, 9.2&nbsp;million new trees have been planted in the city.<ref>[http://www.greatersudbury.ca/content/div_landreclamation/documents/2010%20Final%20Annual%20Report.pdf Annual Report 2010], City of Greater Sudbury Land Reclamation Program.</ref><!--needs page number--> [[Vale Limited|Vale]] has begun to rehabilitate the [[Spoil tip|slag heap]]s that surrounds their smelter in the Copper Cliff area with the planting of grass and trees,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatersudbury.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_earthcare&lang=en&currID=6855 |title=Vale Community-based Initiatives |publisher=The City of Greater Sudbury |accessdate=2012-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811013206/http://www.greatersudbury.ca/cms/index.cfm?app=div_earthcare&lang=en&currID=6855 |archive-date=August 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as well as the use of [[biosolids]] to stabilize and regreen [[tailings]] areas.<ref>[https://www.northernontariobusiness.com/regional-news/sudbury/biosolids-rejuvenate-mining-wasteland-983489 \"Biosolids rejuvenate mining wasteland\"].

The strike, which lasted for nine months, badly damaged Sudbury's economy. The city government was spurred to launch a project to diversify the city's economy. Through an aggressive strategy, the city tried to attract new employers and industries through the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=railtown />\n[[File:Sudbury smokestack 1976.jpg|thumb|The [[Inco Superstack]] in 1976, four years after its completion.

In 2006, both of the city's major mining companies, Canadian-based Inco and Falconbridge, were taken over by new owners: Inco was acquired by the Brazilian company CVRD (now renamed [[Vale (company)|Vale]]), while Falconbridge was purchased by the Swiss company [[Xstrata]], which itself was purchased by Anglo\u2013Swiss Glencore, forming [[Glencore|Glencore Xstrata]].

To a lesser extent, the area's ecology was also impacted by lumber camps in the area providing wood for the reconstruction of Chicago after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. While other logging areas in Northeastern Ontario were also involved in that effort, the emergence of mining related processes in the following decade made it significantly harder for new trees to grow to full maturity in the Sudbury area than elsewhere.<ref name=railtown />\n[[File:Blackened rocks in Sudbury, Ontario.JPG|thumb|Erosion has resulted in [[bedrock]] being exposed in many parts of the city, many of which were charred to a pitted, dark black appearance.]]\nThe resulting erosion exposed [[bedrock]] in many parts of the city, which was charred in most places to a pitted, dark black appearance. There was not a complete lack of vegetation in the region as [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] and wild [[blueberry]] patches thrived in the acidic soils. During the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] manned lunar exploration program, [[NASA]] astronauts trained in Sudbury to become familiar with impact [[breccia]] and [[shatter cone]]s, rare rock formations produced by large meteorite impacts.

[[Government of Ontario|provincial government]]'s [[Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and Forestry]] is located in Sudbury.]]\n\n===Municipal politics===\nFrom the city hall at [[Tom Davies Square]], the city is headed by twelve [[Greater Sudbury City Council|council]] members and one [[List of mayors of Sudbury, Ontario|mayor]] both elected every four years. The current mayor is [[Brian Bigger]], who was elected in the [[2014 Greater Sudbury municipal election|2014 municipal election]]. The 2011 operating budget for Greater Sudbury was [[Canadian dollar|C$]]471&nbsp;million, and the city employs 2006 full-time workers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatersudbury.ca/content/div_budget/documents/Budget%202011%20Budget%20Operating%20Summary1.pdf |title=2011 Operating Budget |publisher=Greater Sudbury}}</ref>\n\n===Federal and provincial politics===\nThe city is divided between the federal electoral districts of [[Sudbury (electoral district)|Sudbury]] and [[Nickel Belt]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], and the provincial electoral districts of [[Sudbury (provincial electoral district)|Sudbury]] and [[Nickel Belt (provincial electoral district)|Nickel Belt]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. The federal and provincial districts do not have identical boundaries despite using the same names; most notably, the [[Walden, Ontario|Walden]] district of the city is located in Sudbury federally but in Nickel Belt provincially. The city is represented federally by Members of Parliament [[Paul Lefebvre]] and [[Marc Serr\u00e9]], both of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], and provincially by [[Jamie West]] and [[France G\u00e9linas]] of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]]. The provincial [[Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines]] has its head office in the city.\n\nBoth federal and provincial politics in the city tend to be dominated by the Liberal and New Democratic parties. Historically, the Liberals have been stronger in the Sudbury riding, with the New Democrats dominant in Nickel Belt, although both ridings have elected members of both parties at different times.\n\n==Communities==\n[[File:Sudbury downtown.JPG|thumb|Downtown Sudbury is the [[central business district]] for Greater Sudbury and one of the many neighbourhoods that make up the city.]]\n{{See also| Urban neighbourhoods of Sudbury }}\nThe city of Sudbury and its suburban communities were reorganized into the [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] in 1973, which was subsequently merged in 2001 into the single-tier city of Greater Sudbury.\n\nIn common usage, the city's urban core is still generally referred to as ''Sudbury'', while the outlying former towns are still referred to by their old names and continue in some respects to maintain their own distinct community identities despite their lack of political independence.

The French culture is celebrated with the [[Franco-Ontarian flag]], recognized by the province as an official emblem, which was created in 1975 by a group of teachers at [[Laurentian University]] and after some controversy has flown at [[Tom Davies Square]] since 2006. The large francophone community plays a central role in developing and maintaining many of the cultural institutions of Sudbury including the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Nouvel-Ontario]], [[La Nuit sur l'\u00e9tang]], [[La Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario]], [[Le Centre franco-ontarien de folklore]] and the [[Prise de parole]] publishing company.

Sudbury was once a major lumber centre and a world leader in nickel mining. Mining and related industries dominated the economy for much of the 20th century. The two major mining companies which shaped the history of Sudbury were Inco, now [[Vale Limited]], which employed more than 25% of the population by the 1970s, and [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge]], now [[Glencore]].

Most of the nickel mined from Sudbury was used in the manufacturing of artillery during the war.]]\n\nThrough the decades that followed, Sudbury's economy went through boom and bust cycles as world demand for nickel fluctuated. Demand was high during the [[World War I|First World War]], when Sudbury-mined nickel was used extensively in the manufacturing of artillery in [[Sheffield]], England. It bottomed out when the war ended and then rose again in the mid-1920s as peacetime uses for nickel began to develop. The town was reincorporated as a city in 1930.\n\nThe city recovered from the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]] much more quickly than almost any other city in North America due to increased demand for nickel in the 1930s. Sudbury was the fastest-growing city and one of the wealthiest cities in Canada for most of the decade. Many of the city's social problems in the Great Depression era were not caused by unemployment or poverty, but due to the difficulty in keeping up with all of the new infrastructure demands created by rapid growth \u2014 for example, employed mineworkers sometimes ended up living in [[boarding house]]s or makeshift [[shanty town]]s, because demand for new housing was rising faster than supply.<ref name=railtown /> Between 1936 and 1941, the city was ordered into [[receivership]] by the [[Ontario Municipal Board]].<ref name=railtown /> Another economic slowdown affected the city in 1937, but the city's fortunes rose again with wartime demands during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The [[Frood Mine]] alone accounted for 40 percent of all the nickel used in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[artillery]] production during the war. After the end of the war, Sudbury was in a good position to supply nickel to the United States government when it decided to stockpile non-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] supplies during the [[Cold War]].<ref name=railtown />\n[[File:Banner in Sudbury, Ontario, circa 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Banner welcoming [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock]] miners into Sudbury.

Consequently, the terrain was made up of exposed rocky outcrops permanently stained charcoal black by the air pollution from the roasting yards. [[Acid rain]] added more staining, in a layer that penetrates up to {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} into the once pink-grey [[granite]].\n\nThe construction of the [[Inco Superstack]] in 1972 dispersed sulphuric acid through the air over a much wider area, reducing the acidity of local precipitation. This enabled the city to begin an environmental recovery program. In the late 1970s, private and public interests combined to establish a \"regreening\" effort. [[Calcium oxide|Lime]] was spread over the charred soil by hand and by aircraft. Seeds of wild [[Poaceae|grasses]] and other vegetation were also spread.

The strike, which lasted for nine months, badly damaged Sudbury's economy. The city government was spurred to launch a project to diversify the city's economy.

[[Government of Ontario|provincial government]]'s [[Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and Forestry]] is located in Sudbury.]]\n\n===Municipal politics===\nFrom the city hall at [[Tom Davies Square]], the city is headed by twelve [[Greater Sudbury City Council|council]] members and one [[List of mayors of Sudbury, Ontario|mayor]] both elected every four years. The current mayor is [[Brian Bigger]], who was elected in the [[2014 Greater Sudbury municipal election|2014 municipal election]]. The 2011 operating budget for Greater Sudbury was [[Canadian dollar|C$]]471&nbsp;million, and the city employs 2006 full-time workers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatersudbury.ca/content/div_budget/documents/Budget%202011%20Budget%20Operating%20Summary1.pdf |title=2011 Operating Budget |publisher=Greater Sudbury}}</ref>\n\n===Federal and provincial politics===\nThe city is divided between the federal electoral districts of [[Sudbury (electoral district)|Sudbury]] and [[Nickel Belt]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], and the provincial electoral districts of [[Sudbury (provincial electoral district)|Sudbury]] and [[Nickel Belt (provincial electoral district)|Nickel Belt]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. The federal and provincial districts do not have identical boundaries despite using the same names; most notably, the [[Walden, Ontario|Walden]] district of the city is located in Sudbury federally but in Nickel Belt provincially. The city is represented federally by Members of Parliament [[Paul Lefebvre]] and [[Marc Serr\u00e9]], both of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], and provincially by [[Jamie West]] and [[France G\u00e9linas]] of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]]. The provincial [[Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines]] has its head office in the city.\n\nBoth federal and provincial politics in the city tend to be dominated by the Liberal and New Democratic parties. Historically, the Liberals have been stronger in the Sudbury riding, with the New Democrats dominant in Nickel Belt, although both ridings have elected members of both parties at different times.\n\n==Communities==\n[[File:Sudbury downtown.JPG|thumb|Downtown Sudbury is the [[central business district]] for Greater Sudbury and one of the many neighbourhoods that make up the city.]]\n{{See also| Urban neighbourhoods of Sudbury }}\nThe city of Sudbury and its suburban communities were reorganized into the [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] in 1973, which was subsequently merged in 2001 into the single-tier city of Greater Sudbury.\n\nIn common usage, the city's urban core is still generally referred to as ''Sudbury'', while the outlying former towns are still referred to by their old names and continue in some respects to maintain their own distinct community identities despite their lack of political independence.

The French culture is celebrated with the [[Franco-Ontarian flag]], recognized by the province as an official emblem, which was created in 1975 by a group of teachers at [[Laurentian University]] and after some controversy has flown at [[Tom Davies Square]] since 2006. The large francophone community plays a central role in developing and maintaining many of the cultural institutions of Sudbury including the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Nouvel-Ontario]], [[La Nuit sur l'\u00e9tang]], [[La Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario]], [[Le Centre franco-ontarien de folklore]] and the [[Prise de parole]] publishing company.

It lies among the northern ranges of the [[Karancs Hills]] in its valley. Karancsalja is bordered by [[Karancsber\u00e9ny]] in the north, [[Karancslapujt\u0151]] in the west, [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] in the east and [[Etes]] in the south. It lies near the border between Hungary and Slovakia. \n\nKarancsalja must have been inhabited since the time of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]], since its area - the northern side of the valley - is slightly raised from its surroundings, thus providing a suitable place for settlement.\n\nLike the settlements of the Karancs region, Karancsalja was a typical village on a highway at the beginning of its history, and it was established along the road connecting the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Plain]] and the [[North Hungarian Mountains|Highlands]]. Until the middle of the 19th century, this was an important route for the county and even for the country. The traffic here had considerable economic power.\n\nDespite its favorable geographical conditions, Karancsalja did not become a large settlement, although in the second half of the 19th century, with the emergence and rapid development of mining, the village began to grow. More than 1500 people live in Karancsalja today.\n\n== Location ==\nThe village is located in the northeastern part of [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d]] county, in the valley of the Dobroda stream, in the valley of the Karancs Hills, five kilometers northwest of Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n.\n\nThe easiest way to reach Karancsalja is by road 2206 between [[Litke, Hungary|Litke]] and Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n, it is the first settlement from the county capital.\n\nIt is also accessible from the main road 22, from where one has to turn east-northeast in [[S\u00e1g\u00fajfalu]], to the 7 km-long side road 22109 through Etes.\n\nFootpaths and forest tracks are available from the village to the [[Karancs Hills]].\u00a0\n\n== History==\nKarancsalja is a settlement of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian age]] in the valley of the Dobroda stream.\n\nIt was named after the 727 meters high [[Karancs]] peak, which is situated a few kilometers northeast of the village, on the border of Slovakia and Hungary, is also called \"[[Pal\u00f3c]] Olympus\".\n\nThe village already existed in the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian period]].

It lies among the northern ranges of the [[Karancs Hills]] in its valley. Karancsalja is bordered by [[Karancsber\u00e9ny]] in the north, [[Karancslapujt\u0151]] in the west, [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] in the east and [[Etes]] in the south. It lies near the border between Hungary and Slovakia. \n\nKarancsalja must have been inhabited since the time of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]], since its area - the northern side of the valley - is slightly raised from its surroundings, thus providing a suitable place for settlement.\n\nLike the settlements of the Karancs region, Karancsalja was a typical village on a highway at the beginning of its history, and it was established along the road connecting the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Plain]] and the [[North Hungarian Mountains|Highlands]]. Until the middle of the 19th century, this was an important route for the county and even for the country. The traffic here had considerable economic power.\n\nDespite its favorable geographical conditions, Karancsalja did not become a large settlement, although in the second half of the 19th century, with the emergence and rapid development of mining, the village began to grow. More than 1500 people live in Karancsalja today.\n\n== Location ==\nThe village is located in the northeastern part of [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d]] county, in the valley of the Dobroda stream, in the valley of the Karancs Hills, five kilometers northwest of Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n.\n\nThe easiest way to reach Karancsalja is by road 2206 between [[Litke, Hungary|Litke]] and Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n, it is the first settlement from the county capital.\n\nIt is also accessible from the main road 22, from where one has to turn east-northeast in [[S\u00e1g\u00fajfalu]], to the 7 km-long side road 22109 through Etes.\n\nFootpaths and forest tracks are available from the village to the [[Karancs Hills]].\u00a0\n\n== History<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karancsalja.hu/telepulesunk/ismerteto|title=Official website of the village Karancsalja|last=|first=|date=|website=www.karancsalja.hu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>==\nKarancsalja is a settlement of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian age]] in the valley of the Dobroda stream.\n\nIt was named after the 727 meters high [[Karancs]] peak, which is situated a few kilometers northeast of the village, on the border of Slovakia and Hungary, is also called \"[[Pal\u00f3c]] Olympus\".\n\nThe village already existed in the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian period]].

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with [[Pennsylvania#Religion|few Catholics]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} There was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n{{see| William Hogan (priest)}}\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 December 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} The St. Mary's trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]]\u2014William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on 27 May 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} Philadelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city  {{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} (later he completely left the Church and became a vehement anti-Catholic propagandist). In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}} The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} In 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}}\n\n[[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} He received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on 22 April 1842, at about the age of 94.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Conwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with [[Pennsylvania#Religion|few Catholics]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} There was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n{{see| William Hogan (priest)}}\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 December 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} The St. Mary's trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]]\u2014William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on 27 May 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} Philadelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city  {{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} (later he completely left the Church and became a vehement anti-Catholic propagandist). In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}} The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} In 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}}\n\n[[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} He received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on 22 April 1842, at about the age of 94.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Conwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard.

He studied at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as a [[Kellett Fellowship|Kellett Fellow]]; he received a BA from [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] in 1965, where he was a member of the college's 1966 [[University Challenge]] winning team, though he did not appear in the final, having already returned to the US.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/jul02/jul02_profile_foner.html | title=Columbia College Today}}</ref>  Foner returned to Columbia for his PhD, where he worked under [[Richard Hofstadter]]; he finished in 1969.\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1973 to 1982, Foner served as a professor in the history department at [[City College of New York|City College]] and Graduate Center at [[City University of New York]]. In 1976 and 1977, he was a visiting professor of American History at Princeton University. In 1980, he was [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].\n\nAppointed the [[DeWitt Clinton]] Professor of History at Columbia University in 1988, a chair previously held by his mentor Richard Hofstadter, Foner specializes in mid-19th-century US history.  He was elected president of the [[Organization of American Historians]] (1993\u20131994), and of the [[American Historical Association]] (2000).\nHe is one of only two persons to serve as president of the Organization of American Historians, American Historical Association, and Society of American Historians.\n\n===Writing on the Reconstruction Era===\nFoner is a leading authority on the Reconstruction Era.  In a seminal essay in ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' in October 1982, later reprinted in ''Reviews in American History'', Foner wrote,\n\n<blockquote>In the past twenty years, no period of American history has been the subject of a more thoroughgoing reevaluation than Reconstruction\u2014the violent, dramatic, and still controversial era following the Civil War.  Race relations, politics, social life, and economic change during Reconstruction have all been reinterpreted in the light of changed attitudes toward the place of blacks within American society.  If historians have not yet forged a fully satisfying portrait of Reconstruction as a whole, the traditional interpretation that dominated historical writing for much of this century has irrevocably been laid to rest.<ref>Foner, Eric, \"The New View Of Reconstruction,\" ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', October/November 1983, Volume 34, Issue 6.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThat year, he gave the [[Walter L. Fleming]] Lectures in southern history, which were later published as ''Nothing but Freedom: Emancipation and Its Legacy.''\n\nIn 1988, Foner published his definitive book ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877.''  It won the [[Bancroft Prize]], the [[Francis Parkman Prize]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Book Award, the [[Avery O. Craven]] Prize, and the [[Lionel Trilling]] Prize.\n\n\"Foner has established himself as the leading authority on the Reconstruction period,\" wrote historian Michael Perman in reviewing ''Reconstruction''.  \"This book is not simply a distillation of the secondary literature; it is a masterly account \u2013 broad in scope as well as rich in detail and insight.<ref name=\"reconstruction73\" /> \"This is history written on a grand scale, a masterful treatment of one of the most complex periods of American history,\" [[David Herbert Donald]] wrote in ''[[The New Republic]]''. C. Vann Woodward, in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', wrote, \"Eric Foner has put together this terrible story with greater cogency and power, I believe, than has been brought to the subject heretofore.\"<ref>[https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/winter12/features5 Columbia College Today: \"Freedom Writer\"].</ref>  Foner has continued to lecture widely on Reconstruction and published several shorter versions of his major book, including ''A Short History of Reconstruction, 1863\u20131877'' (1990) and ''America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War'' (1995).\n\nIn a 2009 essay, Foner pondered whether Reconstruction might have turned out differently.\n\n<blockquote>\"It is wrong to think that, during the Civil War, [[Presidency of Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] embraced a single 'plan' of Reconstruction,\" he wrote. \"Lincoln had always been willing to work closely with all factions of his party, including the Radicals on numerous occasions. I think it is quite plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing to a Reconstruction policy encompassing basic civil rights for blacks (as was enacted in 1866) plus limited black suffrage, along the lines he proposed just before his death.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120616125206/http://www.americanheritage.com/content/if-lincoln-hadn%E2%80%99t-died \"If Lincoln Hadn't Died...\"], ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', 2009</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2015|reason=Only the first sentence of the quote appears at the link}}</blockquote>\n\nFoner's recent short summary of his views was published in ''The New York Times'' in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Foner|first1=Eric|title=Why Reconstruction Matters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/opinion/sunday/why-reconstruction-matters.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Confederate statues===\nIn a  ''New York Times'' op-ed, he criticised President [[Donald Trump]]'s tweet calling for the preservation of Confederate monuments and heritage, stating that they represented and glorified [[white supremacy]] rather than collective heritage.<ref>Foner, Eric.

In a February 1991 article, Foner noted that the Baltic states claimed the right to secede because they had been unwillingly annexed. In addition, he believed that the Soviet Union did not protect minorities while it tried to nationalize the republics. Foner identified a threat to existing minority groups within the Baltic states, who were in turn threatened by the new nationalist movements.<ref name=\"baltic\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=19lNAQAAIAAJ \"Secession of Baltic States?\"], Eric Foner, ''The Nation'', 11 February 1991, Volume 252</ref>\n\n===Exhibitions and testimony===\nWith Olivia Mahoney, chief curator at the Chicago History Museum,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistory.org/documents/home/aboutus/pressroom/biographies/CHM-OliviaMahoney.pdf|title=Olivia Mahoney|work=About Us|publisher=Chicago History|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925060628/http://chicagohistory.org/documents/home/aboutus/pressroom/biographies/CHM-OliviaMahoney.pdf |archivedate=2010-09-25}}</ref> Foner curated two prize-winning exhibitions on American history: ''A House Divided: America in the Age of Lincoln'', which opened at the [[Chicago History Museum]] in 1990, and ''America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War,'' a traveling exhibit that opened at the [[Virginia Historical Society]] in 1995.

Foner]], who was active in the trade union movement and the campaign for civil rights for [[African Americans]]. Eric Foner describes his father as his \"first great teacher,\" and recalls how,\n\n<blockquote>deprived of his livelihood while I was growing up, he supported our family as a freelance lecturer. ... Listening to his lectures, I came to appreciate how present concerns can be illuminated by the study of the past\u2014how the repression of the [[McCarthy era]] recalled the days of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], the civil rights movement needed to be viewed in light of the great struggles of Black and White abolitionists, and in the brutal suppression of the [[Philippine insurrection]] at the turn of the century could be found the antecedents of [[Vietnam War|American intervention in Vietnam]]. I also imbibed a way of thinking about the past in which visionaries and underdogs\u2014[[Tom Paine]], [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Eugene V. Debs]], and [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]]\u2014were as central to the historical drama as presidents and captains of industry, and how a commitment to [[social justice]] could infuse one's attitudes towards the past.<ref>Jon Wiener, [https://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2000/0004/0004mem2.cfm \"In Memoriam: Jack D.

Shenton on the Civil War and Reconstruction during his junior year. \"It probably determined that most of my career has been focused on that period,\" he recalled years later.<ref>Eric Watkin, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol22/vol22_iss3/Professor_Shenton.html \"Professor James P.

He studied at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as a [[Kellett Fellowship|Kellett Fellow]]; he received a BA from [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] in 1965, where he was a member of the college's 1966 [[University Challenge]] winning team, though he did not appear in the final, having already returned to the US.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/jul02/jul02_profile_foner.html | title=Columbia College Today}}</ref>  Foner returned to Columbia for his PhD, where he worked under [[Richard Hofstadter]]; he finished in 1969.\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1973 to 1982, Foner served as a professor in the history department at [[City College of New York|City College]] and Graduate Center at [[City University of New York]]. In 1976 and 1977, he was a visiting professor of American History at Princeton University. In 1980, he was [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].\n\nAppointed the [[DeWitt Clinton]] Professor of History at Columbia University in 1988, a chair previously held by his mentor Richard Hofstadter, Foner specializes in mid-19th-century US history.  He was elected president of the [[Organization of American Historians]] (1993\u20131994), and of the [[American Historical Association]] (2000).\nHe is one of only two persons to serve as president of the Organization of American Historians, American Historical Association, and Society of American Historians.\n\n===Writing on the Reconstruction Era===\nFoner is a leading authority on the Reconstruction Era.  In a seminal essay in ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' in October 1982, later reprinted in ''Reviews in American History'', Foner wrote,\n\n<blockquote>In the past twenty years, no period of American history has been the subject of a more thoroughgoing reevaluation than Reconstruction\u2014the violent, dramatic, and still controversial era following the Civil War.  Race relations, politics, social life, and economic change during Reconstruction have all been reinterpreted in the light of changed attitudes toward the place of blacks within American society.  If historians have not yet forged a fully satisfying portrait of Reconstruction as a whole, the traditional interpretation that dominated historical writing for much of this century has irrevocably been laid to rest.<ref>Foner, Eric, \"The New View Of Reconstruction,\" ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', October/November 1983, Volume 34, Issue 6.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThat year, he gave the [[Walter L. Fleming]] Lectures in southern history, which were later published as ''Nothing but Freedom: Emancipation and Its Legacy.''\n\nIn 1988, Foner published his definitive book ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877.''  It won the [[Bancroft Prize]], the [[Francis Parkman Prize]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Book Award, the [[Avery O. Craven]] Prize, and the [[Lionel Trilling]] Prize.\n\n\"Foner has established himself as the leading authority on the Reconstruction period,\" wrote historian Michael Perman in reviewing ''Reconstruction''.  \"This book is not simply a distillation of the secondary literature; it is a masterly account \u2013 broad in scope as well as rich in detail and insight.<ref name=\"reconstruction73\" /> \"This is history written on a grand scale, a masterful treatment of one of the most complex periods of American history,\" [[David Herbert Donald]] wrote in ''[[The New Republic]]''. C. Vann Woodward, in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', wrote, \"Eric Foner has put together this terrible story with greater cogency and power, I believe, than has been brought to the subject heretofore.\"<ref>[https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/winter12/features5 Columbia College Today: \"Freedom Writer\"].</ref>  Foner has continued to lecture widely on Reconstruction and published several shorter versions of his major book, including ''A Short History of Reconstruction, 1863\u20131877'' (1990) and ''America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War'' (1995).\n\nIn a 2009 essay, Foner pondered whether Reconstruction might have turned out differently.\n\n<blockquote>\"It is wrong to think that, during the Civil War, [[Presidency of Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] embraced a single 'plan' of Reconstruction,\" he wrote. \"Lincoln had always been willing to work closely with all factions of his party, including the Radicals on numerous occasions. I think it is quite plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing to a Reconstruction policy encompassing basic civil rights for blacks (as was enacted in 1866) plus limited black suffrage, along the lines he proposed just before his death.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120616125206/http://www.americanheritage.com/content/if-lincoln-hadn%E2%80%99t-died \"If Lincoln Hadn't Died...\"], ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', 2009</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2015|reason=Only the first sentence of the quote appears at the link}}</blockquote>\n\nFoner's recent short summary of his views was published in ''The New York Times'' in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Foner|first1=Eric|title=Why Reconstruction Matters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/opinion/sunday/why-reconstruction-matters.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Confederate statues===\nIn a  ''New York Times'' op-ed, he criticised President [[Donald Trump]]'s tweet calling for the preservation of Confederate monuments and heritage, stating that they represented and glorified [[white supremacy]] rather than collective heritage.<ref>Foner, Eric.

In a February 1991 article, Foner noted that the Baltic states claimed the right to secede because they had been unwillingly annexed. In addition, he believed that the Soviet Union did not protect minorities while it tried to nationalize the republics. Foner identified a threat to existing minority groups within the Baltic states, who were in turn threatened by the new nationalist movements.<ref name=\"baltic\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=19lNAQAAIAAJ \"Secession of Baltic States?\"], Eric Foner, ''The Nation'', 11 February 1991, Volume 252</ref>\n\n===Exhibitions and testimony===\nWith Olivia Mahoney, chief curator at the Chicago History Museum,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistory.org/documents/home/aboutus/pressroom/biographies/CHM-OliviaMahoney.pdf|title=Olivia Mahoney|work=About Us|publisher=Chicago History|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925060628/http://chicagohistory.org/documents/home/aboutus/pressroom/biographies/CHM-OliviaMahoney.pdf |archivedate=2010-09-25}}</ref> Foner curated two prize-winning exhibitions on American history: ''A House Divided: America in the Age of Lincoln'', which opened at the [[Chicago History Museum]] in 1990, and ''America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War,'' a traveling exhibit that opened at the [[Virginia Historical Society]] in 1995.

It provides a primary reinforcement capability for the regular service, and consists of paid volunteers who give up some of their weekends, evenings and holidays to train at one of a number of [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s around the [[United Kingdom]]. Its current mission is to provide trained personnel in support of the regular RAF. Queen Elizabeth II is Air Commodore-in-Chief of the RAuxAF.\n\n==Formation==\nThe Royal Auxiliary Air Force owes its origin to Lord [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Trenchard]]'s vision of an elite corps of civilians who would serve their country in flying squadrons in their spare time. Instituted by [[Order in Council]] on 9 October 1924, the first Auxiliary Air Force squadrons were formed the following year. The pilots of AAF squadrons were generally formed from the wealthier classes, as applicants were expected to already have, or be prepared to obtain, their [[Private pilot licence|pilot's licence]] at their own expense, at a cost of \u00a396, about \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|96|1925|r=-3}}}} today.<ref name=\"Flight1925\">{{cite journal |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1925/1925%20-%200663.html |title=Auxiliary Air Force |issue=876 |volume=XVII |pages=663\u2013664 |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |date=8 October 1925 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> The [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve|Royal Air Force Reserve]] (RAFR) differs in that its members were trained in the RAF and left, but are obliged to return to service if required.<ref>{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Bishop |title=Fighter Boys |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003 |isbn=9780002571692}}</ref> Pilots of the AAF were expected to join for a period of no less than five years, and were required to fly a few hours every quarter and attend annual training for 15 days. Each squadron was provided with a town base for training, and facilities at an aerodrome.<ref name=\"Flight1925\"/> All serving members were required to wear the letter A on their uniforms.\n\n==Second World War==\n[[Image:An engine fitter watches the CO of No. 504 Squadron, Squadron Leader R. Lewis, in his Spitfire Mk VC at Middle Wallop, December 1942. CH8010.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron [[Supermarine Spitfire]] during WWII.]]\nBy March 1939, 21 flying squadrons had been formed, the 20 surviving units being 'embodied' (included) with the [[Royal Air Force]] at the outbreak of war.  Notably, all enlisted men continued to serve under their auxiliary conditions of service until they expired when they were required to transfer to the RAFVR. The squadrons were equipped with a variety of operational aircraft which included [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. The squadrons scored a number of notable successes before and during the [[Second World War]]: the first flight over [[Mount Everest]], undertaken by auxiliary pilots from 602 Squadron, the first [[Nazi Germany|German]] aircraft destroyed over British territorial waters \u2013 and over the mainland, the first [[U-boat]] to be destroyed with the aid of airborne [[radar]], the first kill of a [[V-1 flying bomb]]; the first to be equipped with jet-powered aircraft, and the highest score of any British [[night fighter]] squadron. In the [[Battle of Britain]], the AAF provided 14 of the 62 Squadrons in [[RAF Fighter Command]]'s Order of Battle and accounted for approximately 30% of the accredited enemy kills. Indeed, in 11 Group Fighter Command, that saw the heaviest fighting over South East England in 1940, of the 15 top scoring squadrons, eight were auxiliary.  The losses sustained during the Battle of Britain, as with all other squadrons, were replaced by drafting in regular and RAFVR pilots.  In fact, the volunteer reserves of the RAF outnumbered the regular RAF pilots in the Battle of Britain.\n\nThe Tactical Air Force squadrons were chosen to carry out several successful ultra low-level raids on key 'pin-point' targets in occupied Europe. The Balloon Squadrons also played their part, downing and deterring many hostile aircraft, and were accredited with the destruction of 279 V-1 flying bombs.\n\nThe Auxiliary Air Force was also responsible for the anti-aircraft balloon defences of the UK. At the outbreak of war in 1939 there were about 42 Squadrons operating [[barrage balloons]], with the number of squadrons peaking at about 102 in 1944.\n\n==Cold War==\nThese achievements were honoured by the prefix \"Royal\", conferred by [[King George VI]] in 1947. Twenty of the pre-war squadrons were reformed postwar as fighter units. Events after the Second World War heralded a time of great danger for the UK. The onset of the [[Cold War]] with the [[Communist Bloc]] leading to the [[Berlin Air Lift]] and ultimately the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950. During these crises the RAuxAF fighter squadrons, the five newly formed Air Observation Post (AOP) squadrons and other RAuxAF units, played their part in the UK's air defence and participated in many [[NATO]] air exercises. In 1951, at the height of the Korean War, all 20 RAuxAF fighter squadrons (representing one third of Fighter Command strength) were called up for three months full-time service; they were required for home defence in place of regular squadrons earmarked for deployment to Korea. In the event RAF fighter squadrons were not needed in Korea, but the RAuxAF squadrons were retained for intensive refresher training at their home bases.\n\nThe 10 March 1957 saw the disbandment of all 20 RAuxAF fighter squadrons, the five post-war AOP squadrons and the Light Anti-Aircraft ground-based squadrons of the [[RAF Regiment|Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment]].  In the following two years or so, the Auxiliary Fighter Control Units associated with them were also disbanded.  On 16 March 1960, the [[Air Commodore-in-Chief]] and His Royal Highness [[Prince Philip]], [[Duke of Edinburgh]], invited the Squadron Commanders and Flight Commanders of all the disbanded Royal Auxiliary Air Force units to a Reception at [[Buckingham Palace]]. All were given the following letter from the Air Commodore-in-Chief:\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  =\n[[Buckingham Palace|BUCKINGHAM PALACE]]\n\nI have welcomed this opportunity of taking leave of the Commanding Officers and senior Auxiliary officers of the squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force which are being disbanded and of sending through them this message of appreciation and thanks to all their officers, airmen and airwomen.\n\nThe history of the Auxiliary Air Force has been a glorious one.  The first Auxiliary squadrons were included in the Air Defence of Great Britain in 1925.  By the outbreak of war in 1939 the Auxiliary fighter, coastal and balloon squadrons formed an integral and vital part of our forces.  It was aircraft of these squadrons which shot down the first enemy bomber over this country; and Auxiliary squadrons were heavily engaged in the air over Dunkirk and throughout the Battle of Britain.  Later they were to win battle honours over the Atlantic, in Malta, North Africa, Sicily and Italy, the Arakan and Burma, and in Normandy, France and Germany.\n\nAfter the war, the fighter squadrons were reconstituted as the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the traditional spirit of voluntary service found new outlets with the formation of Regiment, Air OP, Fighter Control and Radar reporting Units, some of which are to remain in being and provide further opportunities for voluntary service.\n\nThe association of the Force with my family has always been close.  I was proud to become Honorary Air Commodore of Nos 603, 2603 and 3603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadrons in 1951 and to succeed my father as Honorary Air Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force in 1952.  Members of my family have always treasured their association with Auxiliary squadrons as Honorary Air Commodores.\n\nI wish as Air Commodore-in-Chief to thank officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force for all that they have given to the service of the country by their enthusiasm, their spirit and their devotion to duty in peace and war.  It is a sad day when it is necessary to tell so many that it is no longer possible to use their services on the duties they have assumed so willingly.  I wish them to know that they can look back with pride and satisfaction to service well done.\n\n16 March 1957\n\nElizabeth R\n|quoted = 1\n}}\n\nThe renaissance of the RAuxAF began in 1959 with the formation of three Maritime Headquarters Units and one Maritime Support Unit.  The MSU in Belfast was short-lived, but No 1 (County of Hertford) MHU in Northwood, No 2 (City of Edinburgh) MHU in Edinburgh and No 3 (County of Devon) MHU in Mountbatten continued in existence until No 3 was amalgamated into No 1 in 1999.  Later that year No 1 was renumbered 600 (City of London) Squadron and No 2 was renumbered 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron.  These three units formed the entirety of the RAuxAF for twenty years until expansion starting in 1979, with the formation of three Regiment Field Squadrons, continuing with a Movements Squadron in 1982, and, following lessons learned during the [[Falklands War|Falklands conflict]], an Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron in 1983. A later addition, in 1987, was an auxiliary element (The Grampian Troop) formed within a regular RAF Regiment [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier]] Air Defence Squadron. Another step forward was taken in 1986, with the raising of four Defence Force Flights with the role of ground defence of key points on air bases. In 1984, the RAuxAF's [[Diamond Jubilee]] was marked by the award to the Service of its own badge, which forms the basic motif of the Sovereign's Colour for the Royal Auxiliary Force presented by Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] in 1989. The words of the badge motto are ''COMITAMUR AD ASTRA'' \u2013 Latin \"We go with them to the stars\".\n\n==Gulf War and beyond==\nDuring the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the Aeromedical and Movements Squadrons were mobilised and performed with great distinction in theatre and at other locations in the UK and overseas.\n\n[[File:2623 Troops shooting.jpg|left|2623sqn RAuxAF Regiment Shooting [[General purpose machine gun|GPMG]] on range|thumb]]\n\nOn 5 April 1997, all of the four war-appointable flights of the then [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] were fully amalgamated into the [[RAuxAF]], each with squadron status. In recognition of their origins, and in the absence of direct county or city territorial affiliations, they were each given the honour of retaining the letters \"VR\" within their squadron titles. The remaining non-active support elements of the RAFVR were and remain unaffected by this amalgamation, namely the [[RAFVR(T)]], the [[University Air Squadron|RAFVR(UAS)]], and at its point of formation, the [[Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme|RAFVR(DTUS)]] (being the branches for Training, University Air Squadron, and the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme, respectively).\n\n[[File:Standard_presentation_2622sqn.jpg|thumb|upright|The 2622sqn RAuxAF Regiment standard is presented to an officer on 30 September 2006]]\n\nDuring 2003 the RAuxAF was involved in the first large-scale mobilisation for over 50 years. More than 900 personnel, over 70% of its trained strength, were called into full-time service and were deployed to support RAF operations in [[Cyprus]], [[Kuwait]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], as well as those in the UK.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe Royal Auxiliary Air Force establishment (liability) is set at 2,920 \u2013 though recruitment difficulties mean the RAuxAF is currently at a strength well below that; the RAuxAF's compromised 1,510 personnel as of April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/314795/uk_reserve_force_cadets_2014.pdf |title=UK Reserve Forces and Cadets |date=29 May 2014 |work=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 July 2007, [[Senior Aircraftman]] Chris Dunsmore, aged 29, of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF|504 (County of Nottingham) Sqn RAuxAF]] was one of three men killed by a rocket attack on the RAF base at [[Basrah Airport]], Iraq.

and south coast underground and introduce into service more advanced radars.  However, manning difficulties in the immediate post-war regular RAF led to a number of Fighter Control and Radar Reporting units of the RAuxAF being formed, from 1948 onwards. In the early and uncertain days of the [[Cold War]], the Fighter Control and Radar Reporting units were largely responsible for manning the entire UK Control and Reporting system.  All were disbanded by 1961.

In the event, 12 were formed in the Light Anti-Aircraft role, equipped with 40mm anti-aircraft guns and attached to the RAuxAF flying squadrons.  By 1955, due to the introduction into service of more sophisticated weapons, the squadrons were converted to Regiment Field Squadrons.  All 12 squadrons were disbanded, along with the flying squadrons, in 1957.  However, three new field squadrons were re-formed in 1979, followed by two more in 1982 and a sixth in 1983.  Since then, two have been disbanded and two have been re-roled. In addition, No 1339 Wing was formed in 1085 and consisted of 2729 and 2890 (both City of Lincoln Squadrons) equipped with Skyguard Raddar and Oerlikon guns both captured from the Argentians during the 1982 Falklands War Both squadrons were disbanded in 1994 to become the Rapier Cadreisation Unit and then No 27 and 48 Squadrons RAF Regiment.\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*2501 (County of Gloucester)\n*2502 (Ulster)\n*2503 (County of Lincoln)*\n*2504 (County of Nottingham)\n*2600 (City of London)\n*2602 (City of Glasgow)\n*2603 (City of Edinburgh\n*2605 (County of Warwick)\n*2608 (North Riding of Yorkshire)\n{{Col-break}}\n*2609 (West Riding of Yorkshire)\n*2611 (West Lancashire)\n*2612 (County of Aberdeen)\n*2620 (County of Norfolk)*\n*2622 (Highland)*\n*2623 (East Anglian)*\n*2625 (County of Cornwall)\n*2729 (City of Lincoln)\n*2890 (City of Lincoln)\n{{col-end}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> denotes current active squadrons\n\nRegiment Squadrons took the number of their parent flying squadron, prefixed with 2.

At the time, the Cold War was still in progress and the Soviet Union was regarded as a considerable threat to UK bases. So a plan was created to develop a system of ground defence for the vital bases without extending regular forces and for a modest outlay. As the Royal Auxiliary Air Force had already been revived in 1979 to provide aeromedical evacuation services, air movements and Regiment Field squadrons, it was planned to set up the Defence Force flights and task one of them to protect RAF Lyneham, home of the UK's air transport squadrons.\n\nVolunteers between 18 and 50 were sought within a radius of 50 miles of Lyneham and the first training flight came into being in late 1986, under the command of Flt Lt Bryan Tovey, a retired RAF Squadron Leader. Within five years, over 100 volunteers attended Lyneham on Wednesday evenings and weekends, trained in all the essential field combat skills such as weapons handling and live-firing practice, fieldcraft, perimeter defence, fighting in built up areas, reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering, fire-fighting and rescue techniques plus nuclear, biological and chemical monitoring. Battlefield skills were regularly tested at military training areas and such was the reputation built-up by the Lyneham Defence Force that their personnel were once used to assist regular special forces in training scenarios. The Defence Force field sections and Combined Incident Teams were based with the [[RAF Regiment]] contingent at Lyneham and played a full part in the station's Tactical Evaluation tests, conducted by NATO examiners.  In the final TacEval before the Defence Force was stood down, Lyneham received outstanding marks and its Station Commander particularly thanked the Auxiliaries for their contribution. Such performance did not go unnoticed in the wider air force and in 1993, the Lyneham DF was awarded the Robins Trophy as the outstanding RAuxAF unit of the year.  The trophy was presented by the RAuxAF Inspector General at a ceremony at Lyneham in 1994.\n\n=== The Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) ===\n\nThe foundations of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force were laid by the [[Women's Royal Air Force (World War I)|Women's Royal Air Force]] (WRAF) which was formed early in 1918, but, although plans were formulated for the continual employment of women with the RAF in peacetime, they had to be abandoned on account of the drastic post-war economy and by April 1920, the disbandment of the WRAF was complete.\n\nWhen the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) came into being in September 1938, it contained separate RAF companies, but following the [[Munich Crisis|Munich crisis]] of 1938, it became apparent that these companies should be brought more closely under RAF control.  Accordingly, the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF) was constituted by Royal Warrant on 28 June 1939.\n\nInitially, recruiting was limited to officers and NCOs only, recruiting for the original RAF companies being undertaken by the AAF.  However, with the coming of the Second World War, airwomen were to join the ranks and, by mid 1943, there were 182,000 women serving in the WAAF, in all the RAF trade groups.  In common with the AAF, the women's force became less 'auxiliary' as the war went on; but on the outbreak of war, the WAAF consisted of 234 officers and 1500 airwomen, all of whom could be considered pre-war volunteers in the true auxiliary mould.\n\nInitially, entry was confined to the few service trades then open to women, namely MT Driver, Equipment Assistant, Cook, Clerk and Mess and Kitchen Staff.  A small number of fabric workers were also employed.  By August 1939, additional trades were authorised: Teleprinter Operators, Telephone Operators and Plotters. Without the services of the WAAF, the RAF would have required an additional 150,000 airmen who could not have been obtained as easily as the women and who could only be provided at the expense of other Services or production.  The success of the women's Service is all the more remarkable in view of the prejudice against employing women that undoubtedly existed at the beginning of the war.\n\n===Barrage Balloon Organisation of the Auxiliary Air Force===\n{{main|Barrage Balloon Organisations of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]]\n* [[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n* [[RAF Balloon Command]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Halley, James J.

It provides a primary reinforcement capability for the regular service, and consists of paid volunteers who give up some of their weekends, evenings and holidays to train at one of a number of [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s around the [[United Kingdom]]. Its current mission is to provide trained personnel in support of the regular RAF. Queen Elizabeth II is Air Commodore-in-Chief of the RAuxAF.\n\n==Formation==\nThe Royal Auxiliary Air Force owes its origin to Lord [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Trenchard]]'s vision of an elite corps of civilians who would serve their country in flying squadrons in their spare time. Instituted by [[Order in Council]] on 9 October 1924, the first Auxiliary Air Force squadrons were formed the following year. The pilots of AAF squadrons were generally formed from the wealthier classes, as applicants were expected to already have, or be prepared to obtain, their [[Private pilot licence|pilot's licence]] at their own expense, at a cost of \u00a396, about \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|96|1925|r=-3}}}} today.<ref name=\"Flight1925\">{{cite journal |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1925/1925%20-%200663.html |title=Auxiliary Air Force |issue=876 |volume=XVII |pages=663\u2013664 |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |date=8 October 1925 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> The [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve|Royal Air Force Reserve]] (RAFR) differs in that its members were trained in the RAF and left, but are obliged to return to service if required.<ref>{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Bishop |title=Fighter Boys |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003 |isbn=9780002571692}}</ref> Pilots of the AAF were expected to join for a period of no less than five years, and were required to fly a few hours every quarter and attend annual training for 15 days. Each squadron was provided with a town base for training, and facilities at an aerodrome.<ref name=\"Flight1925\"/> All serving members were required to wear the letter A on their uniforms.\n\n==Second World War==\n[[Image:An engine fitter watches the CO of No. 504 Squadron, Squadron Leader R. Lewis, in his Spitfire Mk VC at Middle Wallop, December 1942. CH8010.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A No. 504 (County of Nottingham) Squadron [[Supermarine Spitfire]] during WWII.]]\nBy March 1939, 21 flying squadrons had been formed, the 20 surviving units being 'embodied' (included) with the [[Royal Air Force]] at the outbreak of war.  Notably, all enlisted men continued to serve under their auxiliary conditions of service until they expired when they were required to transfer to the RAFVR. The squadrons were equipped with a variety of operational aircraft which included [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. The squadrons scored a number of notable successes before and during the [[Second World War]]: the first flight over [[Mount Everest]], undertaken by auxiliary pilots from 602 Squadron, the first [[Nazi Germany|German]] aircraft destroyed over British territorial waters \u2013 and over the mainland, the first [[U-boat]] to be destroyed with the aid of airborne [[radar]], the first kill of a [[V-1 flying bomb]]; the first to be equipped with jet-powered aircraft, and the highest score of any British [[night fighter]] squadron. In the [[Battle of Britain]], the AAF provided 14 of the 62 Squadrons in [[RAF Fighter Command]]'s Order of Battle and accounted for approximately 30% of the accredited enemy kills. Indeed, in 11 Group Fighter Command, that saw the heaviest fighting over South East England in 1940, of the 15 top scoring squadrons, eight were auxiliary.  The losses sustained during the Battle of Britain, as with all other squadrons, were replaced by drafting in regular and RAFVR pilots.  In fact, the volunteer reserves of the RAF outnumbered the regular RAF pilots in the Battle of Britain.\n\nThe Tactical Air Force squadrons were chosen to carry out several successful ultra low-level raids on key 'pin-point' targets in occupied Europe. The Balloon Squadrons also played their part, downing and deterring many hostile aircraft, and were accredited with the destruction of 279 V-1 flying bombs.\n\nThe Auxiliary Air Force was also responsible for the anti-aircraft balloon defences of the UK. At the outbreak of war in 1939 there were about 42 Squadrons operating [[barrage balloons]], with the number of squadrons peaking at about 102 in 1944.\n\n==Cold War==\nThese achievements were honoured by the prefix \"Royal\", conferred by [[King George VI]] in 1947. Twenty of the pre-war squadrons were reformed postwar as fighter units. Events after the Second World War heralded a time of great danger for the UK. The onset of the [[Cold War]] with the [[Communist Bloc]] leading to the [[Berlin Air Lift]] and ultimately the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950. During these crises the RAuxAF fighter squadrons, the five newly formed Air Observation Post (AOP) squadrons and other RAuxAF units, played their part in the UK's air defence and participated in many [[NATO]] air exercises. In 1951, at the height of the Korean War, all 20 RAuxAF fighter squadrons (representing one third of Fighter Command strength) were called up for three months full-time service; they were required for home defence in place of regular squadrons earmarked for deployment to Korea. In the event RAF fighter squadrons were not needed in Korea, but the RAuxAF squadrons were retained for intensive refresher training at their home bases.\n\nThe 10 March 1957 saw the disbandment of all 20 RAuxAF fighter squadrons, the five post-war AOP squadrons and the Light Anti-Aircraft ground-based squadrons of the [[RAF Regiment|Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment]].  In the following two years or so, the Auxiliary Fighter Control Units associated with them were also disbanded.  On 16 March 1960, the [[Air Commodore-in-Chief]] and His Royal Highness [[Prince Philip]], [[Duke of Edinburgh]], invited the Squadron Commanders and Flight Commanders of all the disbanded Royal Auxiliary Air Force units to a Reception at [[Buckingham Palace]]. All were given the following letter from the Air Commodore-in-Chief:\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  =\n[[Buckingham Palace|BUCKINGHAM PALACE]]\n\nI have welcomed this opportunity of taking leave of the Commanding Officers and senior Auxiliary officers of the squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force which are being disbanded and of sending through them this message of appreciation and thanks to all their officers, airmen and airwomen.\n\nThe history of the Auxiliary Air Force has been a glorious one.  The first Auxiliary squadrons were included in the Air Defence of Great Britain in 1925.  By the outbreak of war in 1939 the Auxiliary fighter, coastal and balloon squadrons formed an integral and vital part of our forces.  It was aircraft of these squadrons which shot down the first enemy bomber over this country; and Auxiliary squadrons were heavily engaged in the air over Dunkirk and throughout the Battle of Britain.  Later they were to win battle honours over the Atlantic, in Malta, North Africa, Sicily and Italy, the Arakan and Burma, and in Normandy, France and Germany.\n\nAfter the war, the fighter squadrons were reconstituted as the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the traditional spirit of voluntary service found new outlets with the formation of Regiment, Air OP, Fighter Control and Radar reporting Units, some of which are to remain in being and provide further opportunities for voluntary service.\n\nThe association of the Force with my family has always been close.  I was proud to become Honorary Air Commodore of Nos 603, 2603 and 3603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadrons in 1951 and to succeed my father as Honorary Air Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force in 1952.  Members of my family have always treasured their association with Auxiliary squadrons as Honorary Air Commodores.\n\nI wish as Air Commodore-in-Chief to thank officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force for all that they have given to the service of the country by their enthusiasm, their spirit and their devotion to duty in peace and war.  It is a sad day when it is necessary to tell so many that it is no longer possible to use their services on the duties they have assumed so willingly.  I wish them to know that they can look back with pride and satisfaction to service well done.\n\n16 March 1957\n\nElizabeth R\n|quoted = 1\n}}\n\nThe renaissance of the RAuxAF began in 1959 with the formation of three Maritime Headquarters Units and one Maritime Support Unit.  The MSU in Belfast was short-lived, but No 1 (County of Hertford) MHU in Northwood, No 2 (City of Edinburgh) MHU in Edinburgh and No 3 (County of Devon) MHU in Mountbatten continued in existence until No 3 was amalgamated into No 1 in 1999.  Later that year No 1 was renumbered 600 (City of London) Squadron and No 2 was renumbered 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron.  These three units formed the entirety of the RAuxAF for twenty years until expansion starting in 1979, with the formation of three Regiment Field Squadrons, continuing with a Movements Squadron in 1982, and, following lessons learned during the [[Falklands War|Falklands conflict]], an Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron in 1983. A later addition, in 1987, was an auxiliary element (The Grampian Troop) formed within a regular RAF Regiment [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier]] Air Defence Squadron. Another step forward was taken in 1986, with the raising of four Defence Force Flights with the role of ground defence of key points on air bases. In 1984, the RAuxAF's [[Diamond Jubilee]] was marked by the award to the Service of its own badge, which forms the basic motif of the Sovereign's Colour for the Royal Auxiliary Force presented by Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] in 1989. The words of the badge motto are ''COMITAMUR AD ASTRA'' \u2013 Latin \"We go with them to the stars\".\n\n==Gulf War and beyond==\nDuring the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the Aeromedical and Movements Squadrons were mobilised and performed with great distinction in theatre and at other locations in the UK and overseas.\n\n[[File:2623 Troops shooting.jpg|left|2623sqn RAuxAF Regiment Shooting [[General purpose machine gun|GPMG]] on range|thumb]]\n\nOn 5 April 1997, all of the four war-appointable flights of the then [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] were fully amalgamated into the [[RAuxAF]], each with squadron status. In recognition of their origins, and in the absence of direct county or city territorial affiliations, they were each given the honour of retaining the letters \"VR\" within their squadron titles. The remaining non-active support elements of the RAFVR were and remain unaffected by this amalgamation, namely the [[RAFVR(T)]], the [[University Air Squadron|RAFVR(UAS)]], and at its point of formation, the [[Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme|RAFVR(DTUS)]] (being the branches for Training, University Air Squadron, and the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme, respectively).\n\n[[File:Standard_presentation_2622sqn.jpg|thumb|upright|The 2622sqn RAuxAF Regiment standard is presented to an officer on 30 September 2006]]\n\nDuring 2003 the RAuxAF was involved in the first large-scale mobilisation for over 50 years.

and south coast underground and introduce into service more advanced radars.  However, manning difficulties in the immediate post-war regular RAF led to a number of Fighter Control and Radar Reporting units of the RAuxAF being formed, from 1948 onwards. In the early and uncertain days of the [[Cold War]], the Fighter Control and Radar Reporting units were largely responsible for manning the entire UK Control and Reporting system.  All were disbanded by 1961.

In the event, 12 were formed in the Light Anti-Aircraft role, equipped with 40mm anti-aircraft guns and attached to the RAuxAF flying squadrons.  By 1955, due to the introduction into service of more sophisticated weapons, the squadrons were converted to Regiment Field Squadrons.  All 12 squadrons were disbanded, along with the flying squadrons, in 1957.  However, three new field squadrons were re-formed in 1979, followed by two more in 1982 and a sixth in 1983.  Since then, two have been disbanded and two have been re-roled. In addition, No 1339 Wing was formed in 1085 and consisted of 2729 and 2890 (both City of Lincoln Squadrons,) equipped with Skyguard Raddar and Oerlikon guns both captured from the Argentians during the 1982 Falklands War Both squadrons were disbanded in 1994 to become the Rapier Cadreisation Unit and then No 27 and 48 Squadrons RAF Regiment.\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*2501 (County of Gloucester)\n*2502 (Ulster)\n*2503 (County of Lincoln)*\n*2504 (County of Nottingham)\n*2600 (City of London)\n*2602 (City of Glasgow)\n*2603 (City of Edinburgh\n*2605 (County of Warwick)\n*2608 (North Riding of Yorkshire)\n{{Col-break}}\n*2609 (West Riding of Yorkshire)\n*2611 (West Lancashire)\n*2612 (County of Aberdeen)\n*2620 (County of Norfolk)*\n*2622 (Highland)*\n*2623 (East Anglian)*\n*2625 (County of Cornwall)\n*2729 (City of Lincoln)\n*2890 (City of Lincoln)\n{{col-end}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> denotes current active squadrons\n\nRegiment Squadrons took the number of their parent flying squadron, prefixed with 2.

At the time, the Cold War was still in progress and the Soviet Union was regarded as a considerable threat to UK bases. So a plan was created to develop a system of ground defence for the vital bases without extending regular forces and for a modest outlay. As the Royal Auxiliary Air Force had already been revived in 1979 to provide aeromedical evacuation services, air movements and Regiment Field squadrons, it was planned to set up the Defence Force flights and task one of them to protect RAF Lyneham, home of the UK's air transport squadrons.\n\nVolunteers between 18 and 50 were sought within a radius of 50 miles of Lyneham and the first training flight came into being in late 1986, under the command of Flt Lt Bryan Tovey, a retired RAF Squadron Leader. Within five years, over 100 volunteers attended Lyneham on Wednesday evenings and weekends, trained in all the essential field combat skills such as weapons handling and live-firing practice, fieldcraft, perimeter defence, fighting in built up areas, reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering, fire-fighting and rescue techniques plus nuclear, biological and chemical monitoring. Battlefield skills were regularly tested at military training areas and such was the reputation built-up by the Lyneham Defence Force that their personnel were once used to assist regular special forces in training scenarios. The Defence Force field sections and Combined Incident Teams were based with the [[RAF Regiment]] contingent at Lyneham and played a full part in the station's Tactical Evaluation tests, conducted by NATO examiners.  In the final TacEval before the Defence Force was stood down, Lyneham received outstanding marks and its Station Commander particularly thanked the Auxiliaries for their contribution. Such performance did not go unnoticed in the wider air force and in 1993, the Lyneham DF was awarded the Robins Trophy as the outstanding RAuxAF unit of the year.  The trophy was presented by the RAuxAF Inspector General at a ceremony at Lyneham in 1994.\n\n=== The Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) ===\n\nThe foundations of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force were laid by the [[Women's Royal Air Force (World War I)|Women's Royal Air Force]] (WRAF) which was formed early in 1918, but, although plans were formulated for the continual employment of women with the RAF in peacetime, they had to be abandoned on account of the drastic post-war economy and by April 1920, the disbandment of the WRAF was complete.\n\nWhen the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) came into being in September 1938, it contained separate RAF companies, but following the [[Munich Crisis|Munich crisis]] of 1938, it became apparent that these companies should be brought more closely under RAF control.  Accordingly, the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF) was constituted by Royal Warrant on 28 June 1939.\n\nInitially, recruiting was limited to officers and NCOs only, recruiting for the original RAF companies being undertaken by the AAF.  However, with the coming of the Second World War, airwomen were to join the ranks and, by mid 1943, there were 182,000 women serving in the WAAF, in all the RAF trade groups.  In common with the AAF, the women's force became less 'auxiliary' as the war went on; but on the outbreak of war, the WAAF consisted of 234 officers and 1500 airwomen, all of whom could be considered pre-war volunteers in the true auxiliary mould.\n\nInitially, entry was confined to the few service trades then open to women, namely MT Driver, Equipment Assistant, Cook, Clerk and Mess and Kitchen Staff.  A small number of fabric workers were also employed.  By August 1939, additional trades were authorised: Teleprinter Operators, Telephone Operators and Plotters. Without the services of the WAAF, the RAF would have required an additional 150,000 airmen who could not have been obtained as easily as the women and who could only be provided at the expense of other Services or production.  The success of the women's Service is all the more remarkable in view of the prejudice against employing women that undoubtedly existed at the beginning of the war.\n\n===Barrage Balloon Organisation of the Auxiliary Air Force===\n{{main|Barrage Balloon Organisations of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]]\n* [[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n* [[RAF Balloon Command]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Halley, James J.

There, they move into a supposedly haunted mansion which belonged to Sumit's ancestors. Deboshree then goes into the restricted room and finds out that there was a dancer named Chandramukhi who had been killed by a ''zamindar'' (a Persian word meaning \"landlord\"), who lived in that mansion. After mysterious occurrences in the mansion, which appear paranormal, Sumit calls his psychologist friend Dr. Agni ([[Prosenjit Chatterjee]]) from USA, as he believes that there is not a ghost. He believes that Malini ([[Rachana Banerjee]]) who could not marry him is mentally ill and behind all those incidents. But Dr. Agni makes more comic misunderstandings. Also, Dr. Agni starts to like Malini.\n\nIn the climax, it is revealed that Deboshree suffers multiple personality disorder and because of her sympathy for Chandramukhi, she starts believing that she is Chandramukhi. She thinks that her husband is the cruel zamindar responsible for Chandramukhi's death, and she must take her revenge by killing him. Dr. Agni devises a plan and makes Deboshree 'kill' a doll instead of Sumit. Thinking she has killed Sumit and exacted her revenge, the personality of Chandramukhi 'leaves' Deboshree.

Our grandparents came over in the 1800s to work in the railroads, work the lumber camps, goldmines, worked in the canneries, farmland that most people thought could never raise a crop, worked as merchants in cities that were just emerging. They fought in world wars, died for our freedoms and our liberties. Asian Americans have given our blood, sweat and tears to the communities and to this country. There's a prosperity that we on the west coast enjoy. So much of the prosperity and progress of the western states is because of the blood, sweat and tears of Asian Americans. From doing the dirty work to fighting in our world wars and contributing to our society now as doctors, researchers, people in high tech, as innovators, in all different professions. We have every right, indeed a responsibility, to help set the policies that will move our communities and our nation forward.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kagy |first1=Tom |title=Gary Locke: Governor

They fought in world wars, died for our freedoms and our liberties. Asian Americans have given our blood, sweat and tears to the communities and to this country. There's a prosperity that we on the west coast enjoy. So much of the prosperity and progress of the western states is because of the blood, sweat and tears of Asian Americans. From doing the dirty work to fighting in our world wars and contributing to our society now as doctors, researchers, people in high tech, as innovators, in all different professions.

Both Haye and Chisora sat down in the Sky studios and talked about their relationship, explaining how they came to a deal.

Gashi, who suffered the third defeat of his 20-fight professional career which included 17 early knockouts in 17 victories, switched southpaw from the opening bell, landed an effective counter punch in the second but Chisora connected with a good body shot in the third and took control of the fight. Chisora continued to be the aggressor throughout but his opponent survived to the end of the contest.\n\nOn 13 June 2019, a fight between Chisora and former world title challenger [[Artur Szpilka]] was announced to take place at the [[O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 20 July 2019, with the bout taking place on the undercard of [[Dillian Whyte vs. Oscar Rivas]] live on [[Sky Box Office|Sky Sports Box Office]].

On 1 October Parker pulled out of the fight due to illness.\n\n==== Chisora vs. Price ====\nOn 8 October 2019, [[David Price (boxer)|David Price]] was announced as Dereck Chisora's replacement opponent at the O2 Arena. Chisora pressured Price from the start of the contest and floored his opponent in the fourth round as the fight was called to a halt following the Price corner throwing in the towel.\n\n==== Chisora vs. Usyk ====\nOn 11 March 2020, a fight between Chisora and undefeated former undisputed cruiserweight world champion [[Oleksandr Usyk]] was announced to take place at the [[O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 23 May 2020, live on [[Sky Box Office|Sky Sports Box Office]]\n\n==Personal life==\nIn November 2010, Chisora was found guilty of assaulting his then-girlfriend after finding text messages from another man on her phone. He narrowly escaped being sent to prison, and was given a 12-week sentence suspended for two years. He was ordered to pay \u00a31,500 in compensation and \u00a3500 costs and complete 150 hours community work. The court was told that the fighter also had previous convictions for public order offences, assaulting a police officer and possession of an offensive weapon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11727784|title=Boxer Dereck Chisora guilty of assaulting girlfriend |publisher=BBC|date=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, Chisora was stopped in his [[Bentley]] near [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in London.
