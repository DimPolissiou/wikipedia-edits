The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]], the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. After an argument, they manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack Woody and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and try to help, but RC's batteries run out before he reaches the truck. Realizing that Sid's rocket is still strapped to Buzz's back, Woody ignites it, hurtling them towards the truck. Woody throws RC into the truck before he and Buzz soar into the air; Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket just before it explodes, and he glides with Woody to safety inside a box in the Davis's van, right next to Andy, who concludes they were in the car all along.\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] at their new home, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals; one of the toys is [[Mrs. Potato Head]], to Mr. Potato Head's delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]], a [[pull-string]] [[cowboy]] doll who is Andy's favourite toy.\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]], a space ranger [[action figure]] and Woody's rival, who later becomes his best friend.\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body.\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog]], a [[dachshund]] [[slinky]] toy.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Rex, a nervous green [[Tyrannosaurus]] figurine.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Hamm, a smart-talking [[piggy bank]].\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], a [[Bisque doll|porcelain]] shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest.\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], Woody and Buzz's owner.\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Sid Phillips|Sid Phillips]], Andy's next door neighbor, who tortures toys for his own amusement.\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Mrs. Davis]], Andy's mother.\n* [[R.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty. These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}\n\nAn agreement to produce a feature film based on ''Tin Toy'' with a working title of ''Toy Story'' was finalized and production began soon thereafter.<ref name=\"PixMagicMan\">{{cite news|last=Schlender|first=Brent|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|title=Pixar's magic man|date=May 17, 2006|publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]]|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715081233/http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe original treatment for ''Toy Story'', drafted by Lasseter, [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Pete Docter]], had little in common with the eventually finished film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=121}} It paired Tinny, the one-man band from ''Tin Toy'', with a ventriloquist's dummy and sent them on a sprawling odyssey.

Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I.

However, character designer [[Bud Luckey]] suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy.

Pixar impressed Disney with their technical innovation, but convincing Disney of the plot was more difficult. At each of Pixar's presentations, Katzenberg tore much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg wanted primarily to add \"more edginess\" to the two main characters.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and they asked for adult references to be added to the film.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=129}} Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993\u2014an event they later dubbed the \"Black Friday Incident\".<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\">{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|title=Toy' Wonder|date=December 8, 1995|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205204251/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|archive-date=December 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The results were disastrous.

Schumacher replied bluntly: \"Because it's not their movie any more; it's completely not the movie that John set out to make.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nLasseter was embarrassed by what was on the screen, later recalling, \"It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean characters that I've ever seen.\" He asked Disney for two weeks to rework the script, and Katzenberg was supportive.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy.

Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in ''Toy Story'' came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=136}} Under Galyn Susman and [[Sharon Calahan]], the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"CNN110animators\" /> There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} A camera team, aided by [[David DiFrancesco]], recorded the frames onto [[film stock]]. To fit a 1.85:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], ''Toy Story'' was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} During post-production, the film was sent to [[Skywalker Sound]], where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.<ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Toy Story (soundtrack)}}\n\nDisney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}} The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy.

The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]], the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. After an argument, they manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack Woody and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and try to help, but RC's batteries run out before he reaches the truck.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film.

Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I.

However, character designer [[Bud Luckey]] suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy.

The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy. Jobs demanded more funds to complete the film and insisted that Disney was liable for the cost overruns.

Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was first either created out of [[Modelling clay|clay]] or modeled from a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer-animated design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\">{{cite news|last=Snider|first=Burr|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|title=The Toy Story Story|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|pages=1\u20136|date=December 1995|accessdate=March 13, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131017031124/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|archive-date=October 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Once the animators had a model, its articulation and motion controls were coded; this allowed each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /> Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\">{{cite journal|last=Henne |first=Mark |last2=Hickel |first2=Hal |last3=Johnson |first3=Ewan |last4=Konishi |first4=Sonoks |title=The Making of Toy Story |journal=CompCon '96.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in ''Toy Story'' came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=136}} Under Galyn Susman and [[Sharon Calahan]], the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"CNN110animators\" /> There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} A camera team, aided by [[David DiFrancesco]], recorded the frames onto [[film stock]]. To fit a 1.85:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], ''Toy Story'' was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} During post-production, the film was sent to [[Skywalker Sound]], where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.<ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Toy Story (soundtrack)}}\n\nDisney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}} The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:El Capitan Theatre, Hollywood, California (2997200450).jpg|thumb|The [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, where ''Toy Story''{{'}}s Los Angeles, California's premiere took place on November 19, 1995.|alt=Exterior shot of the El Capitan Theatre.]]\n\nThere were two premieres of ''Toy Story'' in November 1995.

The members of the Cabinet are the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] and the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and other heads of the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive departments]], all of whom \u2014 if eligible \u2014 are in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]].\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] does not explicitly establish a Cabinet.  The Cabinet's role, inferred from the language of the [[Opinion Clause]] (Article&nbsp;II, Section&nbsp;2, Clause&nbsp;1) of the Constitution, is to serve as an advisory body to the [[president of the United States]]. Additionally, the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the Cabinet, to declare the president \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\".\n\nMembers of the Cabinet (except for the vice president) are appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate; once confirmed, they serve [[at the pleasure of the President|at the pleasure of the president]], who can dismiss them at any time without the approval of the Senate, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in ''[[Myers v. United States]]'' (1926). All federal public officials, including Cabinet members, are also subject to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and trial in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" (Article II, Section 4).\n\nThe president can also unilaterally designate senior advisers from the [[Executive Office of the President]] and heads of [[Independent agencies of the United States government|other federal agencies]] as members of the Cabinet, although this is a symbolic status marker and does not, apart from attending Cabinet meetings, confer any additional powers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:State-dining-room-polk-cabinet.jpg|[[James K.

Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edmund Randolph]]. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John Adams]] was not included in Washington's Cabinet because the position was initially regarded as a legislative officer (president of the Senate).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/john-adams/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517153631/http://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/john-adams/ |archive-date=May 17, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was not until the 20th century that vice presidents were regularly included as members of the Cabinet and came to be regarded primarily as a member of the executive branch.\n\nPresidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] and then-professor [[Woodrow Wilson]] advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. But President [[Abraham Lincoln]] rebuffed Seward, and Woodrow Wilson would have none of it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads. President [[Ronald Reagan]] formed seven sub-cabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent Presidents have followed that practice.<ref name=A2EssayGaziano/>\n\n==Federal law==\nIn {{usc|3|302}} with regard to delegation of authority by the president, it is provided that \"nothing herein shall be deemed to require express authorization in any case in which such an official would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the President.\" This pertains directly to the heads of the executive departments as each of their offices is created and specified by statutory law (hence the presumption) and thus gives them the authority to act for the president within their areas of responsibility without any specific delegation.\n\nUnder the 1967 {{usc|5|3110|pipe=Federal Anti-Nepotism statute}}, federal officials are prohibited from appointing their immediate family members to certain governmental positions, including those in the Cabinet.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.stetson.edu/law/lawreview/media/congressional-interference-with-the-presidents-power-to-appoint-24-3.pdf|title=Congressional Interference With The President's Power To Appoint|first1=Richard P.|last1=Wulwick|first2=Frank J.|last2=Macchiarola|journal=Stetson Law Review|volume=XXIV|year=1995|pages=625\u2013652|access-date=November 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116101457/http://www.stetson.edu/law/lawreview/media/congressional-interference-with-the-presidents-power-to-appoint-24-3.pdf|archive-date=November 16, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998]], an administration may appoint acting heads of department from employees of the relevant department.

The members of the Cabinet are the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] and the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and other heads of the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive departments]], all of whom \u2014 if eligible \u2014 are in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]].\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] does not explicitly establish a Cabinet.  The Cabinet's role, inferred from the language of the [[Opinion Clause]] (Article&nbsp;II, Section&nbsp;2, Clause&nbsp;1) of the Constitution, is to serve as an advisory body to the [[president of the United States]]. Additionally, the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the Cabinet, to declare the president \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\".\n\nMembers of the Cabinet (except for the vice president) are appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate; once confirmed, they serve [[at the pleasure of the President|at the pleasure of the president]], who can dismiss them at any time without the approval of the Senate, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in ''[[Myers v. United States]]'' (1926). All federal public officials, including Cabinet members, are also subject to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and trial in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" (Article II, Section 4).\n\nThe president can also unilaterally designate senior advisers from the [[Executive Office of the President]] and heads of [[Independent agencies of the United States government|other federal agencies]] as members of the Cabinet, although this is a symbolic status marker and does not, apart from attending Cabinet meetings, confer any additional powers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:State-dining-room-polk-cabinet.jpg|[[James K.

Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Edmund Randolph]].

Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] and then-professor [[Woodrow Wilson]] advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. But President [[Abraham Lincoln]] rebuffed Seward, and Woodrow Wilson would have none of it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads.

It was formed in 1908 from a nucleus provided by a [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer]] battalion first raised in 1859. It carried out its defence duties along the East Coast throughout [[World War I]] and after the war it was incorporated into a unit of the new [[Royal Corps of Signals]].\n\n==Volunteer Force==\nThe enthusiasm for the [[Volunteer movement]] following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular [[British Army]] in time of need.<ref>Beckett.</ref><ref>Spiers, pp. 163\u20138.</ref> A public meeting to form an RVC in [[Kingston upon Hull]] (Hull) in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] was held in February 1859, but the proposal was defeated by an active minority on political grounds. However, another meeting held on 21 May resolved to raise the '''East Yorkshire Rifle Volunteers''', and 10 independent company-sized RVCs were quickly formed, their officers receiving their commissions the following year. In 1860 these were formed into two battalions: the [[Hull Rifles|1st (Consolidated) Battalion]], comprising all the RVCs in Hull, and the '''2nd (Administrative) Battalion East York Rifle Volunteers''' incorporating those outside the town:<ref name = List>''Army List'', various dates.</ref><ref>Beckett, Appendix VII.</ref><ref name = Norfolk>Norfolk, pp. 35\u201340, 56.</ref><ref name = Westlake>Westlake, pp. 253\u20134.</ref>\n* 3rd ([[Howdenshire]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 28 March 1860 \u2013 replacing an earlier 3rd (Hull) RVC absorbed into 1st Bn\n* 5th ([[Bridlington]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 19 January 1860\n* 6th ([[Beverley]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 28 February 1860\n* 8th ([[Driffield]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 11 May 1860\n* 9th ([[Market Weighton]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC \u2013 formed as a sub-division 12 May 1860, increased into a full company in 1865 when it replaced a short-lived 9th (Hull) RVC\n* 10th ([[Hedon]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 8 November 1860 \u2013 disbanded 1876\n* 11th ([[Pocklington]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC \u2013 formed 8 August 1868 under the command of [[Josslyn Pennington, 5th Baron Muncaster|Lord Muncaster]], formerly of the [[Rifle Brigade]]\n\nThe first commanding officer (CO) of the 2nd (Admin) Battalion was [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] (later [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]]) P. Saltmarshe, formerly of the [[8th Hussars]], with his headquarters (HQ) at Beverley. After the consolidated battalion became the 1st Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC the administrative battalion took the number 1 (though there were no others in the East Riding). It consolidated as the 2nd Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC in 1880 when the constituent RVCs became A to F Companies. The two corps became the [[Hull Rifles|1st]] and 2nd Volunteer Battalions (VBs) of the [[East Yorkshire Regiment]] in 1883.<ref name = Norfolk/><ref name = Westlake/>\n\nFrom the 1870s to the 1890s the two VBs organised their own annual training camps, usually at Bridlington.<ref name = Norfolk/> Higher formations for the Volunteers were lacking, but from 1875 various mobilisation schemes for the Regulars and Militia began to be circulated, and by 1880 a number of Local Brigades had begun to appear in the ''Army List''. B Company of the 2nd VB was included in Local Brigade No 25 at Bridlington, along with two batteries of volunteer artillery.<ref name = List/> Following the [[Stanhope Memorandum]] of December 1888 a comprehensive mobilisation scheme was introduced for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.<ref>Beckett, pp. 135, 185\u20136.</ref><ref>Dunlop, pp. 60\u20131.</ref> The two East Yorkshire VBs did not at first form part of the East Yorkshire Brigade, whose designated place of assembly was [[Doncaster]], but were attached to it by the end of the 1890s when its headquarters was at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]]. By 1902 they were brigaded with the VBs of the [[Green Howards]] as the Yorkshire Brigade at [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]], and later formed the Humber Brigade based at Beverley, together with battalions from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]] across the [[Humber]].<ref name = List/>\n\nThe late Victorian era saw a craze for cycling and the Volunteer Force took a leading role in developing the new [[Safety bicycle]] for military use.

However, another meeting held on 21 May resolved to raise the '''East Yorkshire Rifle Volunteers''', and 10 independent company-sized RVCs were quickly formed, their officers receiving their commissions the following year. In 1860 these were formed into two battalions: the [[Hull Rifles|1st (Consolidated) Battalion]], comprising all the RVCs in Hull, and the '''2nd (Administrative) Battalion East York Rifle Volunteers''' incorporating those outside the town:<ref name = List>''Army List'', various dates.</ref><ref>Beckett, Appendix VII.</ref><ref name = Norfolk>Norfolk, pp. 35\u201340, 56.</ref><ref name = Westlake>Westlake, pp. 253\u20134.</ref>\n* 3rd ([[Howdenshire]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 28 March 1860 \u2013 replacing an earlier 3rd (Hull) RVC absorbed into 1st Bn\n* 5th ([[Bridlington]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 19 January 1860\n* 6th ([[Beverley]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 28 February 1860\n* 8th ([[Driffield]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 11 May 1860\n* 9th ([[Market Weighton]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC \u2013 formed as a sub-division 12 May 1860, increased into a full company in 1865 when it replaced a short-lived 9th (Hull) RVC\n* 10th ([[Hedon]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC, 8 November 1860 \u2013 disbanded 1876\n* 11th ([[Pocklington]]) Yorkshire (East Riding) RVC \u2013 formed 8 August 1868 under the command of [[Josslyn Pennington, 5th Baron Muncaster|Lord Muncaster]], formerly of the [[Rifle Brigade]]\n\nThe first commanding officer (CO) of the 2nd (Admin) Battalion was [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] (later [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]]) P.

However, the [[Vice Lord Lieutenant]] objected, asserting that the [[Battle of Inkerman]] had shown that the grey worn by Russian troops was less visible at shorter distances than [[Rifle green]]. Reluctantly the units agreed to a uniform of 'Volunteer' grey with black braid and red [[Facing colour|facings]] and trouser stripe. The headgear was a grey [[Shako]] with black leather peak and top. The belts and pouch were black leather. In 1880 a scarlet tunic was adopted with white facings, blue trousers with red stripe, and white belts. The headgear was the [[Home Service helmet]] for officers, a [[Glengarry]] cap for other ranks. In 1885 the VBs were granted the right to wear the cap badge of the East Yorkshire Regiment. In 1903 the Cyclist Company adopted a [[Khaki]] service dress with a [[Slouch hat]]. The rest of the battalion adopted khaki in 1906.<ref name = Norfolk/>\n\n==Honorary Colonels==\nThe following served as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)#Ceremonial usage|Honorary Colonel]] of the unit and its predecessor:<ref name = List/><ref name = Regts/>\n*[[William Denison, 1st Earl of Londesborough|William Henry Forester Denison, 1st Earl of Londesborough]] (1834\u20131900) appointed to 2nd VB 9 September 1893 \n* [[Earl of Londesborough|William Francis Henry Denison, 2nd Earl of Londesborough]] (1864\u20131917) appointed to 2nd VB 4 August 1900; to 5th Bn 1 October 1909\n* Capt [[Charles Wilson, 2nd Baron Nunburnholme]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], appointed 21 November 1917\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n* Anon, ''The London Cyclist Battalion'', London: 25th London Cyclist Old Comrade's Association/Forster Groom, 1932.\n* Ian F.W.

Blakenship's case was pending on appeal as he sponsored Brent Benjamin's campaign for a seat on the West Virginia Supreme Court. When the case was taken up on appeal, Benjamin was one of the judges in a position to decide the case. The plaintiff requested that Benjamin recuse himself owing to a conflict of interest stemming from Blakenship's contributions to his campaign, but he refused. Benjamin ultimately cast a decisive vote to vacate the lower court's judgment in a 3\u20132 decision. In [[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]], the Supreme Court ruled that Benjamin's refusal to recuse himself in light of such an obvious conflict of interest constituted a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional right to due process and remanded the case to the West Virginia Supreme Court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-22|title=Caperton v.

When the case was taken up on appeal, Benjamin was one of the judges in a position to decide the case. The plaintiff requested that Benjamin recuse himself owing to a conflict of interest stemming from Blakenship's contributions to his campaign, but he refused. Benjamin ultimately cast a decisive vote to vacate the lower court's judgment in a 3\u20132 decision. In [[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]], the Supreme Court ruled that Benjamin's refusal to recuse himself in light of such an obvious conflict of interest constituted a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional right to due process and remanded the case to the West Virginia Supreme Court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-22|title=Caperton v.

It is the administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]] and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]]. It is situated about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Arctic Circle]] and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the [[confluence]] of the river [[Kemijoki]] and its tributary, the [[Ounasjoki]]. \n\nThe city and the surrounding {{lang|fi|[[Rovaniemen maalaiskunta]]}} (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of [[Europe]] by land area, because the defined limits of the [[city proper]] extend far beyond the actual [[Urban areas in Finland|urban area]].<ref>[https://www.lapland.fi/visit/plan-your-stay/rovaniemi-santa-northern-lights-trip/ Rovaniemi - Capital of Finnish Lapland & Hometown of Santa Claus]</ref> \n\nRovaniemi has an approximate population of {{formatnum: {{#expr: {{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Rovaniemi}} round -3 }}}}. Rovaniemi is a unilingual [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the [[Swedish language]].\n\n==Name==\nThe ''rova'' part in the name ''Rovaniemi'' has often been considered to be of [[Saamic]] origin, as ''{{lang|se|roavve}}'' in [[sami language|Saami]] denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In [[Southern Saami]] [[dialects]], however, ''{{lang|sma|rova}}'' means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The ''niemi'' part of the name means \"[[Cape (geography)|cape]]\".\nNames in the Samic languages include {{lang-smn|Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2}}, {{lang-se|Roavenj\u00e1rga}} and ''{{lang|se|Roavvenj\u00e1rga}}'' and {{lang-sms|Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg}}.\n\n==History==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for [[agriculture]] and the practise of [[slash-and-burn]] cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from [[Karelia]] in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the [[Arctic Ocean]] coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The [[Sami people|Sami]] are considered to be [[S\u00e1pmi|Lapland]]'s most indigenous existing population.\n\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe exploitation of Lapland's [[natural resources]] in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the [[mining]] of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Battle of Rovaniemi}}\n[[File:Rebuilding Rovaniemi in 1949.webm|thumb|left|Rebuilding Rovaniemi in 1949]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Finland signed the [[Moscow Armistice]] and found itself involved in the [[Lapland War]] with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised [[scorched earth]] tactics, and though initially German General [[Lothar Rendulic]] ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present.<ref name=\"sk\">Suomen Kuvalehti 39/2004</ref> While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed.<ref name=\"kallioniemi\">Kallioniemi 1989, s. 196\u2013209</ref> There is a German cemetery 19&nbsp;km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\n\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the [[Stone Age]], few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish [[architect]] [[Alvar Aalto]], who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.<ref>{{cite web |title=There's So Much To See In The Capital Of Finnish Lapland |website=Nordic Visitor |language=en |url=https://lapland.nordicvisitor.com/travel-guide/attractions/rovaniemi/}}</ref>\n\n==Modern day==\n[[File:Rovaniemi 06101999 rescanned.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rovaniemi in 1999]]\n[[File:Christmas celebration in Rovaniemi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Christmas]] celebration in Rovaniemi, November 2004]]\nSince Rovaniemi is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Lapland (Finland)|region of Lapland]], many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the [[University of Lapland]] but also the [[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]] (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, [[forestry]], rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the ''Lapin Kansa'', ''Uusi Rovaniemi'' and ''Lappilainen''.\n\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the [[Arktikum Science Museum]] which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]]. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n===Tourism===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, [[tourism]] is an important [[industry]] in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/sites/visitrovaniemi.fi/files/roi_press_eng_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528074751/http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/sites/visitrovaniemi.fi/files/roi_press_eng_2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-28 }}</ref>\n\nRovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of [[Santa Claus]].<ref name=\"northpole\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-north-pole.com/history|title=History of Santa Claus|website=The-north-pole.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"village\">[http://www.santaclausvillage.info/eng/main.htm Santa Claus' Village on the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi in Lapland in Finland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511171444/http://www.santaclausvillage.info/eng/main.htm |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref><ref name=\"office\">{{cite web|url=http://www.santaclauslive.com/main.php?link=joulupukin_kammari&kieli=eng|title=Joulupukin Kammari \u2013 Santa Claus Office \u2013 Joulupkki, Lapland, Finland, Rovaniemi|website=Santaclauslive.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref> It is home to the [[Santa Claus Village]] at the Arctic Circle and [[Santa Park|SantaPark Arctic World]], which is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the centre. \n\nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\n\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the [[Aurora Borealis]] or ''Northern Lights''. In Finnish [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]], the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Train at Rovaniemi railway station.jpg|thumb|260px|Rovaniemi railway station]]\n[[VR Group]], the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from [[Rovaniemi railway station|Rovaniemi Station]] to [[Oulu]], [[Tampere]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Turku]]. [[Diesel locomotive|Diesel]]-powered passenger trains operated north-east of Rovaniemi to [[Kemij\u00e4rvi]] until March 2014, when electrification to [[Kemij\u00e4rvi]] was completed.

The city lies just south of the {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/today/l/66.50,25.73?par=google</ref>\n{{Weather box\n|location = Rovaniemi Lentoasema, elevation: 196m (1981-2010) Extremes (1959-present)\n|collapsed =\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 6.9\n|Feb record high C = 7.4\n|Mar record high C = 9.5\n|Apr record high C = 19.0\n|May record high C = 28.2\n|Jun record high C = 30.7\n|Jul record high C = 32.2\n|Aug record high C = 29.1\n|Sep record high C = 22.6\n|Oct record high C = 15.6\n|Nov record high C = 8.7\n|Dec record high C = 5.0\n|year record high C = 32.2\n|Jan high C = -8.2\n|Feb high C = -7.8\n|Mar high C = -2.6\n|Apr high C = 3.6\n|May high C = 10.8\n|Jun high C = 16.8\n|Jul high C = 19.7\n|Aug high C = 16.5\n|Sep high C = 10.4\n|Oct high C = 3.1\n|Nov high C = -3.0\n|Dec high C = -6.4\n|year high C = 4.4\n|Jan mean C = -11.3\n|Feb mean C = -10.8\n|Mar mean C = -6.1\n|Apr mean C = -0.2\n|May mean C = 6.3\n|Jun mean C = 12.2\n|Jul mean C = 15.2\n|Aug mean C = 12.5\n|Sep mean C = 7.1\n|Oct mean C = 0.8\n|Nov mean C = -5.5\n|Dec mean C = -9.4\n|year mean C = 0.9\n|Jan low C = -14.5\n|Feb low C = -13.8\n|Mar low C = -9.4\n|Apr low C = -3.9\n|May low C = 2.3\n|Jun low C = 8.3\n|Jul low C = 11.4\n|Aug low C = 9.1\n|Sep low C = 4.2\n|Oct low C = -1.3\n|Nov low C = -7.9\n|Dec low C = -12.5\n|year low C = -2.3\n|Jan record low C = -38.1\n|Feb record low C = -35.0\n|Mar record low C = -27.5\n|Apr record low C = -18.7\n|May record low C = -11.0\n|Jun record low C = -2.6\n|Jul record low C = 2.4\n|Aug record low C = -0.6\n|Sep record low C = -7.7\n|Oct record low C = -21.5\n|Nov record low C = -27.9\n|Dec record low C = -32.9\n|year record low C = -38.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 42.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 33.6\n|Mar precipitation mm = 35.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 30.9\n|May precipitation mm = 35.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 59.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 69.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 71.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 54.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 54.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 48.6\n|Dec precipitation mm = 41.7\n|year precipitation mm = 576.9\n|Jan precipitation days = 10\n|Feb precipitation days = 10\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 7\n|May precipitation days = 8\n|Jun precipitation days = 9\n|Jul precipitation days = 10\n|Aug precipitation days = 10\n|Sep precipitation days = 9\n|Oct precipitation days = 11\n|Nov precipitation days = 12\n|Dec precipitation days = 10\n|year precipitation days = 115\n|Jan sun = 15\n|Feb sun = 57\n|Mar sun = 132\n|Apr sun = 203\n|May sun = 237\n|Jun sun = 271\n|Jul sun = 260\n|Aug sun = 182\n|Sep sun = 112\n|Oct sun = 60\n|Nov sun = 18\n|Dec sun = 3\n|year sun = 1550\n|source 1 = Finnish Meteorological Institute<ref name=\"Met Averages\">{{cite web|url=http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/normal-period-1981-2010|title= Normal period 1981\u20132010|accessdate=4 November 2012|publisher=FMI}}</ref>\n|source 2 = FMI <ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://suja.kapsi.fi/asema-taulukko.php?asema=101920| title = Rovaniemi extreme values | accessdate =18 May 2016 | publisher = [[FMI open data]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=IROVANIE6#history/s20170213/e20170213/mdaily|title=Rantavitikka, Lapland UAS Weather -

It is the administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]] and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]]. It is situated about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Arctic Circle]] and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the [[confluence]] of the river [[Kemijoki]] and its tributary, the [[Ounasjoki]]. \n\nThe city and the surrounding {{lang|fi|[[Rovaniemen maalaiskunta]]}} (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of [[Europe]] by land area, because the defined limits of the [[city proper]] extend far beyond the actual [[Urban areas in Finland|urban area]].<ref>[https://www.lapland.fi/visit/plan-your-stay/rovaniemi-santa-northern-lights-trip/ Rovaniemi - Capital of Finnish Lapland & Hometown of Santa Claus]</ref> \n\nRovaniemi has an approximate population of {{formatnum: {{#expr: {{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Rovaniemi}} round -3 }}}}. Rovaniemi is a unilingual [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the [[Swedish language]].\n\n==Name==\nThe ''rova'' part in the name ''Rovaniemi'' has often been considered to be of [[Saamic]] origin, as ''{{lang|se|roavve}}'' in [[sami language|Saami]] denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In [[Southern Saami]] [[dialects]], however, ''{{lang|sma|rova}}'' means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The ''niemi'' part of the name means \"[[Cape (geography)|cape]]\".\nNames in the Samic languages include {{lang-smn|Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2}}, {{lang-se|Roavenj\u00e1rga}} and ''{{lang|se|Roavvenj\u00e1rga}}'' and {{lang-sms|Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg}}.\n\n==History==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for [[agriculture]] and the practise of [[slash-and-burn]] cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from [[Karelia]] in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the [[Arctic Ocean]] coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The [[Sami people|Sami]] are considered to be [[S\u00e1pmi|Lapland]]'s most indigenous existing population.\n\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe exploitation of Lapland's [[natural resources]] in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the [[mining]] of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Battle of Rovaniemi}}\n[[File:Rebuilding Rovaniemi in 1949.webm|thumb|left|Rebuilding Rovaniemi in 1949]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Finland signed the [[Moscow Armistice]] and found itself involved in the [[Lapland War]] with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised [[scorched earth]] tactics, and though initially German General [[Lothar Rendulic]] ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present.<ref name=\"sk\">Suomen Kuvalehti 39/2004</ref> While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed.<ref name=\"kallioniemi\">Kallioniemi 1989, s. 196\u2013209</ref> There is a German cemetery 19&nbsp;km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\n\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the [[Stone Age]], few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish [[architect]] [[Alvar Aalto]], who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.<ref>{{cite web |title=There's So Much To See In The Capital Of Finnish Lapland |website=Nordic Visitor |language=en |url=https://lapland.nordicvisitor.com/travel-guide/attractions/rovaniemi/}}</ref>\n\n==Modern day==\n[[File:Rovaniemi 06101999 rescanned.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rovaniemi in 1999]]\n[[File:Christmas celebration in Rovaniemi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Christmas]] celebration in Rovaniemi, November 2004]]\nSince Rovaniemi is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Lapland (Finland)|region of Lapland]], many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the [[University of Lapland]] but also the [[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]] (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, [[forestry]], rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the ''Lapin Kansa'', ''Uusi Rovaniemi'' and ''Lappilainen''.\n\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the [[Arktikum Science Museum]] which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]]. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n===Tourism===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, [[tourism]] is an important [[industry]] in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/sites/visitrovaniemi.fi/files/roi_press_eng_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528074751/http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/sites/visitrovaniemi.fi/files/roi_press_eng_2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-28 }}</ref>\n\nRovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of [[Santa Claus]].<ref name=\"northpole\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-north-pole.com/history|title=History of Santa Claus|website=The-north-pole.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"village\">[http://www.santaclausvillage.info/eng/main.htm Santa Claus' Village on the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi in Lapland in Finland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511171444/http://www.santaclausvillage.info/eng/main.htm |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref><ref name=\"office\">{{cite web|url=http://www.santaclauslive.com/main.php?link=joulupukin_kammari&kieli=eng|title=Joulupukin Kammari \u2013 Santa Claus Office \u2013 Joulupkki, Lapland, Finland, Rovaniemi|website=Santaclauslive.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref> It is home to the [[Santa Claus Village]] at the Arctic Circle and [[Santa Park|SantaPark Arctic World]], which is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the centre. \n\nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\n\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the [[Aurora Borealis]] or ''Northern Lights''. In Finnish [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]], the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Train at Rovaniemi railway station.jpg|thumb|260px|Rovaniemi railway station]]\n[[VR Group]], the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from [[Rovaniemi railway station|Rovaniemi Station]] to [[Oulu]], [[Tampere]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Turku]].

The city lies just south of the {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/today/l/66.50,25.73?par=google</ref>\n{{Weather box\n|location = Rovaniemi Lentoasema, elevation: 196m (1981-2010) Extremes (1959-present)\n|collapsed =\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 6.9\n|Feb record high C = 7.4\n|Mar record high C = 9.5\n|Apr record high C = 19.0\n|May record high C = 28.2\n|Jun record high C = 30.7\n|Jul record high C = 32.2\n|Aug record high C = 29.1\n|Sep record high C = 22.6\n|Oct record high C = 15.6\n|Nov record high C = 8.7\n|Dec record high C = 5.0\n|year record high C = 32.2\n|Jan high C = -8.2\n|Feb high C = -7.8\n|Mar high C = -2.6\n|Apr high C = 3.6\n|May high C = 10.8\n|Jun high C = 16.8\n|Jul high C = 19.7\n|Aug high C = 16.5\n|Sep high C = 10.4\n|Oct high C = 3.1\n|Nov high C = -3.0\n|Dec high C = -6.4\n|year high C = 4.4\n|Jan mean C = -11.3\n|Feb mean C = -10.8\n|Mar mean C = -6.1\n|Apr mean C = -0.2\n|May mean C = 6.3\n|Jun mean C = 12.2\n|Jul mean C = 15.2\n|Aug mean C = 12.5\n|Sep mean C = 7.1\n|Oct mean C = 0.8\n|Nov mean C = -5.5\n|Dec mean C = -9.4\n|year mean C = 0.9\n|Jan low C = -14.5\n|Feb low C = -13.8\n|Mar low C = -9.4\n|Apr low C = -3.9\n|May low C = 2.3\n|Jun low C = 8.3\n|Jul low C = 11.4\n|Aug low C = 9.1\n|Sep low C = 4.2\n|Oct low C = -1.3\n|Nov low C = -7.9\n|Dec low C = -12.5\n|year low C = -2.3\n|Jan record low C = -38.1\n|Feb record low C = -35.0\n|Mar record low C = -27.5\n|Apr record low C = -18.7\n|May record low C = -11.0\n|Jun record low C = -2.6\n|Jul record low C = 2.4\n|Aug record low C = -0.6\n|Sep record low C = -7.7\n|Oct record low C = -21.5\n|Nov record low C = -27.9\n|Dec record low C = -32.9\n|year record low C = -38.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 42.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 33.6\n|Mar precipitation mm = 35.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 30.9\n|May precipitation mm = 35.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 59.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 69.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 71.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 54.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 54.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 48.6\n|Dec precipitation mm = 41.7\n|year precipitation mm = 576.9\n|Jan precipitation days = 10\n|Feb precipitation days = 10\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 7\n|May precipitation days = 8\n|Jun precipitation days = 9\n|Jul precipitation days = 10\n|Aug precipitation days = 10\n|Sep precipitation days = 9\n|Oct precipitation days = 11\n|Nov precipitation days = 12\n|Dec precipitation days = 10\n|year precipitation days = 115\n|Jan sun = 15\n|Feb sun = 57\n|Mar sun = 132\n|Apr sun = 203\n|May sun = 237\n|Jun sun = 271\n|Jul sun = 260\n|Aug sun = 182\n|Sep sun = 112\n|Oct sun = 60\n|Nov sun = 18\n|Dec sun = 3\n|year sun = 1550\n|source 1 = Finnish Meteorological Institute<ref name=\"Met Averages\">{{cite web|url=http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/normal-period-1981-2010|title= Normal period 1981\u20132010|accessdate=4 November 2012|publisher=FMI}}</ref>\n|source 2 = FMI <ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://suja.kapsi.fi/asema-taulukko.php?asema=101920| title = Rovaniemi extreme values | accessdate =18 May 2016 | publisher = [[FMI open data]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=IROVANIE6#history/s20170213/e20170213/mdaily|title=Rantavitikka, Lapland UAS Weather -
